## Question

What is the psychiatrist's role before and following a lung transplant?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the psychiatrist's role before and following a lung transplant. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching context and why psychiatric integration matters for outcomes. Then, I should verify the pre-transplant candidacy evaluation, timing of referral, and standardized tools. Next, I will review immediate post-transplant priorities and early adherence support. After that, I need to examine long-term surveillance for depression and distress, quality-of-life trajectories, and lifestyle impacts. I will then consider special populations such as pediatric recipients and cystic fibrosis, followed by cross-cutting multidisciplinary integration, evidence-based interventions, and ethical considerations. Finally, I will synthesize core responsibilities across phases to provide a concise, clinically actionable summary.

> Let me first confirm the context and magnitude of psychiatric involvement. Psychiatry remains underutilized in many transplant programs despite strong evidence that integrated mental health services improve adherence, enhance quality of life, and reduce post-transplant complications, whereas limiting psychiatry to one-time candidacy evaluations or reactive consults leaves a critical gap across the continuum of care [^116rJByP].

> I need to check timing and scope of the pre-transplant evaluation. Early referral is emphasized in ISHLT 2021 because it enables patient and caregiver education, early identification of barriers, and optimization of candidacy, which is precisely where psychiatric input can shape modifiable psychosocial risks before listing [^114vpkiH]. Hold on, I should verify psychiatric burden at evaluation: a national cohort found high lifetime psychiatric disorder prevalence and substantial psychological distress among candidates, linking distress with worse lung function, which underscores the need for structured psychiatric screening and early intervention in the candidacy phase [^116NGYcY].

> Let me consider support systems and adherence, as these are often decisive. The absence of dependable social support is commonly treated as a contraindication in practice, and caregiver characteristics may predict outcomes; patients identifying adult children or siblings as primary caregivers had worse survival and higher graft failure risk compared with spousal caregivers, which should prompt proactive caregiver assessment, capacity building, and contingency planning rather than a cursory checkbox approach [^116887ZD]. I need to ensure we address nonadherence risk and unstable psychiatric illness pre-listing; transplant guidance endorses delaying evaluation when there is ongoing nonadherent behavior or unstable psychiatric disorders until adequately managed, aligning psychiatric stabilization with medical readiness to reduce post-transplant risk [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the role of standardized tools. The Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplant (SIPAT) operationalizes psychosocial suitability and correlates with being declined for transplant, but I should double-check its predictive value post-listing; in a large single-center cohort, higher SIPAT scores were associated with decline at evaluation but did not predict waitlist mortality or post-transplant survival once listed, so SIPAT is valuable for triage and targeting interventions, but I should not overinterpret it as a survival predictor after listing [^116mb7EQ]. Next, I should review symptom scales: validated instruments such as BDI-II, GHQ, HADS, and structured interviews like the MINI support detection of mood and anxiety disorders and distress that influence prognosis and readiness, and they provide baselines for subsequent trajectory monitoring and treatment response [^116NGYcY] [^116rJByP].

> I should confirm that targeted pre-transplant interventions can modify risk. Multiple psychosocial risk factors are potentially modifiable, and stabilizing psychiatric conditions pre-listing aligns with best-practice guidance to lower peri- and post-transplant risk, while short, structured psychotherapies like Quality-of-Life Therapy in waitlisted patients improved QOL, mood disturbance, and social intimacy versus supportive therapy, providing a template for preemptive care pathways led by psychiatry in collaboration with social work and psychology [^1179JfvR] [^112brcJ1] [^113Xw9hA].

> Next, I should review the immediate post-transplant period. I will now examine acute psychological risks and pain. Delirium and adjustment reactions require early detection and management in coordination with the transplant and critical care teams, while pre-transplant depression and anxiety are associated with greater pain during hospitalization and persistent pain and opioid use by two months, indicating that psychiatric comorbidity screening and early analgesia-psychiatry collaboration can mitigate pain chronification and reduce opioid exposure risk [^111Z5hdB] [^117PKAr5]. Early adherence support is crucial given the complexity of immunosuppression; integrated mental health follow-up enhances adherence beyond education alone, so psychiatry should embed medication routines, motivational strategies, and cognitive supports from the outset [^116rJByP] [^112brcJ1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about depression's prognostic significance without serial data. I should review longitudinal evidence. Depressive symptoms typically improve early after lung transplantation, but when they worsen over time, they are associated with higher mortality and subsequent declines in FEV1, suggesting worsening depression can precede or signal evolving chronic lung allograft dysfunction and warrants prompt evaluation for medical drivers as well as psychiatric treatment intensification [^116rJByP]. I initially thought anxiety would similarly predict mortality, but wait, the six-month study showed that elevated depression and general distress, not anxiety, were independently associated with long-term mortality after controlling for medical and sociodemographic factors, which refines our focus for serial screening and risk stratification [^116sQCwH].

> Let me think about quality-of-life trajectories and measurement. Physical QOL improves meaningfully in the first year post-transplant, yet mental health scores often remain unchanged and below population norms, which means psychiatrists should not assume psychological recovery parallels physiologic gains and must actively address residual mood, anxiety, and adjustment problems that persist despite improved respiratory function [^113F95hf]. I should double-check measurement tools; LT-QOL offers transplant-specific coverage of symptoms, treatment burden, cognitive limitations, sexual problems, and worry about future health, complementing generic measures and helping psychiatry capture domains often missed by general instruments, thereby guiding targeted interventions over time [^113Wo2k2] [^116pz9yx]. But wait, post-transplant complications such as primary graft dysfunction attenuate improvements in HRQL, so sustained psychiatric surveillance is especially important in medically complicated recoveries to maintain function and mood gains [^114cXLDv].

> I will now examine adherence and lifestyle impacts that psychiatry can mitigate. Immunosuppression regimens and infection prophylaxis impose social restrictions that can persist beyond 6 to 12 months, leading to socioeconomic burdens and dependency dynamics that psychiatry can help navigate through behavioral planning, caregiver coaching, and linkage to social resources, particularly in adolescents and young adults transitioning roles and identities [^116VKzEC] [^117UFwEn]. Let me reconsider the psychosocial consequences of long-term dependency; high proportions of recipients living with parents into adulthood highlight the need for autonomy-building and executive function supports to protect adherence while fostering independence [^117UFwEn].

> Next, I should review special populations. Pediatric recipients benefit from early psychological supervision, regular assessments, and tailored educational support to identify modifiable risks, with specific attention to the high nonadherence risk during adolescence and the social limitations imposed by infection precautions that can be buffered by virtual platforms and structured peer support [^116VKzEC] [^114M79bk]. For individuals with cystic fibrosis, models vary between integrating the CF team alongside the transplant team or consolidating care within a single program; either way, clear role delineation is essential, and psychiatry should bridge teams to ensure continuity for non-pulmonary CF issues and transplant-specific psychosocial needs [^111LJVdi]. Patients with pre-transplant depression merit targeted monitoring and early interventions post-transplant given their associations with worse pain and potentially poorer functional recovery trajectories, which psychiatry can address with proactive treatment plans and coordinated analgesia strategies [^117PKAr5].

> I need to ensure I address cross-cutting functions throughout the continuum. Psychiatrists should be embedded in multidisciplinary teams from evaluation through long-term follow-up, providing continuity, team education, and system-level quality improvement, not just episodic consults, to realize benefits in adherence and complication reduction [^116rJByP]. I should confirm the evidence base for psychosocial interventions; the ISHLT Nursing and Social Sciences workgroup urged a shift from descriptive studies to prospective trials, and recent telehealth trials show that structured Coping Skills Training combined with exercise yields modest overall benefits but larger gains among depressed subgroups, supporting targeted deployment based on baseline risk stratification [^115qSNpE] [^1166UW9e]. But wait, ethical and existential stressors also require attention; phenomena such as denial toward the foreign organ and the donor, along with complex reproductive counseling in women of childbearing age, call for psychiatric expertise in meaning-making, values clarification, and multidisciplinary planning [^1147NZpQ] [^1145KhuE].

> Finally, I will synthesize core responsibilities across phases to ensure nothing is missed. Pre-transplant, psychiatry conducts comprehensive psychosocial evaluations, screens for mood, anxiety, and distress, assesses caregiver capacity and adherence potential, stabilizes psychiatric illness, and deploys brief evidence-based psychotherapies to optimize candidacy, guided by tools like SIPAT and validated symptom scales, while recognizing SIPAT's limits post-listing [^114vpkiH] [^116NGYcY] [^112brcJ1] [^116mb7EQ] [^113Xw9hA]. Perioperative and early post-transplant, psychiatry monitors for delirium and acute adjustment, partners on analgesia plans for patients with pre-transplant psychiatric comorbidity, and establishes adherence routines integrated into the care pathway from day one [^111Z5hdB] [^117PKAr5] [^116rJByP]. Long-term, psychiatry leads serial tracking of depression and distress as sentinel markers that can herald allograft dysfunction and mortality, intervening early when trajectories worsen and addressing persistent psychological burdens despite physical gains [^113diYGr] [^116sQCwH] [^113F95hf]. Continuously, psychiatrists integrate within the multidisciplinary team, support caregivers, implement targeted psychosocial interventions where evidence suggests benefit, and attend to ethical and reproductive issues that shape patient well-being and safety over the lifespan [^116rJByP] [^1166UW9e] [^115qSNpE] [^1147NZpQ] [^1145KhuE].

Psychiatrists are integral to lung transplantation, providing **pre-transplant assessment** [^114vpkiH] to identify and manage psychiatric comorbidities, substance use, and adherence risks, and to optimize candidacy and readiness [^116NGYcY] [^116mb7EQ]. Post-transplant, they deliver **post-transplant support** through ongoing monitoring, early detection, and treatment of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and cognitive effects of immunosuppression [^116rJByP], while supporting adherence and coping with complications [^113diYGr] [^116sQCwH]. Their continuous involvement improves adherence, reduces complications, and enhances quality of life and survival, making them essential members of the multidisciplinary transplant team [^116rJByP] [^116rJByP].

---

## Pre-transplant psychiatric assessment and intervention

### Comprehensive psychiatric evaluation

- **Psychiatric disorders**: Assess for depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance use, which are common and impact outcomes [^116NGYcY] [^116wkAV2] [^116rJByP].

- **Cognitive function**: Evaluate cognition, as impairment can affect adherence and decision-making [^116rJByP] [^113Wo2k2].

- **Social support**: Assess support systems, as inadequate support is a contraindication to transplantation [^116887ZD] [^114vpkiH].

- **Adherence history**: Review adherence to medical regimens, as nonadherence predicts poor outcomes [^116mb7EQ] [^116rJByP].

---

### Risk stratification and management

Risk identification targets **modifiable and nonmodifiable psychiatric risks** to guide candidacy and timing [^116mb7EQ] [^1179JfvR]. Intervention involves treating **psychiatric disorders and substance use** to optimize candidacy and reduce **post-transplant complications** [^112brcJ1] [^116rJByP].

---

### Patient education and counseling

Education provides information on **psychiatric risks, adherence, and coping strategies** [^116rJByP]. Counseling addresses **anxiety, depression, and stress** related to the waiting period and surgery [^113Xw9hA].

---

## Post-transplant psychiatric care and support

### Monitoring and early detection

Regular screening entails monitoring for **depression, anxiety, PTSD, and cognitive impairment** — conditions that are common post-transplant [^113diYGr] [^116sQCwH]. Early intervention emphasizes **prompt detection and treatment of psychiatric symptoms** to improve adherence and outcomes [^116rJByP].

---

### Management of psychiatric complications

- **Depression and anxiety**: Treat these conditions, as they are linked to increased mortality and graft dysfunction.

- **PTSD**: Address trauma from surgery, ICU stays, and complications [^116rJByP].

- **Cognitive impairment**: Manage neurocognitive effects of immunosuppression and chronic illness [^113Wo2k2] [^111Z5hdB].

---

### Support for adherence and coping

Adherence support reinforces **consistent use of immunosuppression and other medical regimens** [^116rJByP]. Coping strategies help patients manage **chronic illness, complications, and lifestyle changes** [^1166UW9e].

---

## Impact on patient outcomes

Psychiatric involvement **significantly improves outcomes** by enhancing adherence to immunosuppression and other medical regimens, reducing psychiatric complications, and improving quality of life [^116rJByP]. Treated depression and anxiety are associated with **lower mortality and graft dysfunction**.

---

## Integration within the multidisciplinary team

Psychiatrists are **essential team members** who collaborate with pulmonologists, surgeons, nurses, social workers, and psychologists to provide coordinated care and consistent messaging [^116rJByP]. They also provide **education and training** on psychiatric issues and adherence to support team-based management.

---

## Challenges and barriers

Psychiatrists face several challenges, including **stigma around mental health**, which hinders engagement, and **limited psychiatric resources and staffing** [^116rJByP]. They must manage **complex psychiatric and medical comorbidities** while addressing nonadherence and substance use.

---

## Recommendations for best practices

- **Standardized assessment**: Use standardized psychiatric assessments pre- and post-transplant [^116mb7EQ].

- **Early intervention**: Treat psychiatric disorders and substance use early [^116rJByP] [^112brcJ1].

- **Ongoing monitoring**: Regularly screen for psychiatric symptoms post-transplant [^113diYGr].

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Integrate psychiatry into the transplant team [^116rJByP].

- **Patient education**: Provide education on adherence and coping [^113Xw9hA] [^1166UW9e].

---

Psychiatrists play a **critical role** in lung transplantation by conducting comprehensive pre-transplant assessments, managing psychiatric complications, and supporting adherence and coping post-transplant. Their involvement improves adherence, reduces complications, and enhances quality of life and survival, making them essential members of the multidisciplinary transplant team [^116rJByP].

### Psychosocial predictors of mortality following lung transplantation [^116sQCwH]. American Journal of Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Lung transplantation has become an increasingly common treatment for patients with end-stage lung disease. Few studies have examined psychosocial risk factors for mortality in transplant recipients, despite evidence suggesting that elevated levels of negative affect are associated with greater mortality following major cardiac surgery. We therefore examined the relationship between negative affect early after lung transplantation and long-term survival in a sample of 132 lung transplant recipients (28 cystic fibrosis, 64 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 26 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, 14 other) followed for up to 13.5 years (median 7.4 years) following transplantation.

Patients underwent both medical and psychosocial assessments 6 months following transplantation, which included the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Spielberger Anxiety Inventory, and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Over the course of follow-up, 80 (61%) participants died. Controlling for demographic factors, native lung disease, disease severity, family income, education level, social support, and frequency of post-transplant rejection, elevated symptoms of depression (BDI-II: HR = 1.31, p = 0.011) and distress (GHQ: HR = 1.28, p = 0.003) were associated with increased mortality. Higher levels of depression and general distress, but not anxiety, measured 6 months following lung transplantation are associated with increased mortality, independent of background characteristics and medical predictors.

### Advancing models of care in transplant psychiatry: A review and considerations for enhancing the multidisciplinary approach [^116rJByP]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). High credibility.

The purpose of this review is to explore psychosocial considerations in transplant candidacy evaluation, the waitlist, and the post-transplant period, which are tremendously important to overall transplant care. The integration of mental health services in multidisciplinary transplant teams improves adherence to medical regimens, enhances quality of life, and reduces the risk of post-transplant complications.

Recent findings suggest that, despite the importance of psychiatry in transplant care, psychiatrists are often under-utilized by transplant centers. Their engagement typically remains limited to transplant candidacy evaluations or reactive consults in a traditional consultation-liaison (CL) model.

- **Relevance of psychiatry**: This review aims to highlight the importance of psychiatry throughout the transplant process.
- **Role of a CL psychiatrist**: It outlines the role of a CL psychiatrist in advancing patient care and supporting multidisciplinary teams in transplant settings.
- **Understanding CL service models**: The review develops an understanding of CL service models in both inpatient and ambulatory settings.
- **Innovating transplant psychiatry practices**: It also considers the utility of innovating transplant psychiatry practices.

### Depressive symptoms in lung transplant recipients: trajectory and association with mortality and allograft dysfunction [^113diYGr]. Thorax (2022). High credibility.

Most studies observing an association between depressive symptoms following lung transplantation and mortality are limited to depressive symptom measurement at a single time point, unrelated to allograft function. We aimed to test the association of depressive symptoms over multiple assessments with allograft dysfunction and with mortality.

- **Methods**: We assessed depressive symptoms before and serially up to 3 years after lung transplantation in lung transplant recipients. We quantified depressive symptoms with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS; range 0–15; minimally important difference (MID): 2). We quantified changes in GDS using linear mixed effects models and tested the association with mortality using Cox proportional hazards models with GDS as a time-dependent predictor. To determine if worsening in GDS preceded declines in lung function, we tested the association of GDS as a time-dependent predictor with the lagged outcome of FEV1 at the following study visit.

- **Results**: Among 266 participants, depressive symptoms improved early after transplantation. Worsening in post-transplant GDS by the MID was associated with mortality (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.50), and in lagged outcome analyses, with decreased percent predicted FEV1 (Δ, -1.62%, 95% CI -2.49 to -0.76). Visual analyses of temporal changes in GDS demonstrated that worsening depressive symptoms could precede chronic lung allograft dysfunction.

- **Conclusions**: Depressive symptoms generally improve after lung transplantation. When they worsen, however, there is an association with declines in lung function.

### Psychiatric disorders and psychological distress in patients undergoing evaluation for lung transplantation: A national cohort study [^116NGYcY]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the type and prevalence of psychiatric disorders and psychological distress in patients being evaluated for lung transplantation.

- **Methods**: One hundred eighteen patients were assessed, of which 74% had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Assessments were conducted using the MINI Neuropsychiatric Interview, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). Spirometry and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) evaluated lung function, with the data subjected to multivariate regression analyses.

- **Results**: The lifetime prevalence for mental disorders was 41.5%, and for psychological distress, it was 61.0%. Anxiety disorders were identified in 39.8% of patients, mood disorders in 11.8%, and subsyndromal disorders in 8.7%. Additionally, 15% of patients reported feelings of panic during the previous week, 9% reported hopelessness, and 3% felt that life was not worth living. Statistically significant correlations were found for HADS-depression with lung function (P = 0.0012) and 6MWT (P = 0.030) for the entire group (P = 0.012), and with lung function (P = 0.030) for COPD patients (P = 0.045). Higher chronic GHQ-scores correlated with poorer lung function in COPD patients (P = 0.009). In multivariate regression analysis, a history of mental disorder was the strongest predictor of distress.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings underline the importance of assessing past, current, and sub-syndromal psychiatric disorders, in addition to levels of distress in transplant candidates. Prospective studies are required to investigate the impact on long-term outcomes after transplantation.

### Consensus document for the selection of lung transplant candidates: An update from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [^114vpkiH]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for lung transplantation, more specifically with respect to general principles, the ISHLT 2021 guidelines recommend referring patients early. This facilitates transplant education for the patient and caregivers, an initial assessment of barriers to transplant, and determination of timing for a full evaluation with specific recommendations for optimization of candidacy.

### Health-related quality of life after pediatric lung transplantation [^116VKzEC]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

This approach ensures early psychological supervision and intervention, as well as educational support, including contact with schools during the months of pre- and post-transplant in-hospital admissions. This integrated care may contribute to the favorable socioeconomic outcomes observed in our cohort.

Based on our findings, clinical experience, and literature, we propose that optimal health-related quality of life (HRQOL) following transplantation is best supported through a multidisciplinary, individualized care model initiated as early as the pre-transplant phase. This should include regular psychological assessments by experienced professionals to identify modifiable risk factors and enable timely interventions. Early recognition and management of medical complications and immunosuppressant side effects should be approached not only from a clinical standpoint but also with a focus on enhancing post-transplant quality of life. Additionally, specific attention should be given to addressing potential social limitations, incorporating tailored educational and social support. The integration of modern technologies, such as virtual platforms and secure online communities, may help to overcome hygiene-related barriers, facilitating peer interaction to foster emotional support, knowledge exchange, and social reintegration.

Further research to understand the interplay of extended socioeconomic aspects with post-transplant quality of life is of interest. This might not only assess economic settings but also include factors such as familial and friendship support, identity development, and personal goals.

### Psychosocial situation and physical health in 50 patients > 1 year after lung transplantation [^114sQKzX]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Lung transplants have been performed worldwide since the early 1980s. While numerous studies have been published on somatic aspects after lung transplantation, considerably less information is available on psychosocial aspects and the correlation between physical and psychosocial health after transplantation.

- **Methods**: Between 1992 and 2002, 125 patients underwent lung transplantation at University Hospital Zurich. To be included in the study, patients needed to have received a lung transplant more than 12 months prior and have good knowledge of the German or Italian languages. Using standardized questionnaires, psychosocial variables such as levels of anxiety and depression, self-esteem, and social support were determined. Additionally, self-assessments of physical and psychological health were obtained. Medical data included information on FEV1, complications such as pulmonary infections, acute or chronic allograft rejection, and doctors' assessments of the patient's physical and psychological health.

- **Results**: The overall degree of anxiety and depression in lung transplant recipients was comparable to standard samples of an average population. However, male lung transplant recipients were significantly more depressed than female recipients. Self-esteem was higher than in clinical comparison samples. Previous pulmonary complications had long-lasting effects on anxiety levels, whereas non-pulmonary complications did not have such an effect.

- **Conclusions**: Overall, the psychological well-being of patients…

### Consensus document for the selection of lung transplant candidates: An update from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [^114HHPaB]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for lung transplantation, particularly concerning indications in interstitial lung disease (ILD), the ISHLT 2021 guidelines recommend referring patients with inflammatory ILD for lung transplantation in the event of disease progression. This progression can be identified through imaging or pulmonary function deterioration despite treatment.

### Position paper: Models of post-transplant care for individuals with cystic fibrosis [^111LJVdi]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2023). High credibility.

There is no consensus on the best model of care for individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) to manage the non-pulmonary complications that persist after lung transplant. The CF Foundation virtually convened a group of international experts in CF and lung-transplant care. The committee reviewed literature and shared the post-lung transplant model of care practiced by their programs. The committee then developed a survey that was distributed internationally to both clinical and CF/family audiences to determine the strengths, weaknesses, and preferences for various models of transplant care.

- **Two models of care**: Discussion generated two models to accomplish optimal CF care after transplant.
	- **First model**: Incorporates the CF team into care and proposes delineation of responsibilities for the CF and transplant teams. This model relies on outstanding communication between the teams, while leveraging the expertise of the CF team for management of the non-pulmonary manifestations of CF. The transplant team manages all aspects of the transplant, including pulmonary concerns and the management of immunosuppression.
	- **Second model**: Consolidates care in one center and may be more practical for transplant programs that have expertise in managing CF. This model benefits from having access to CF multidisciplinary care team members, often located in the same institution.

The best model for each program is influenced by several factors. Model selection needs to be decided between the transplant and the CF center and may vary from center to center. In either model, CF lung transplant recipients require a clear delineation of the roles.

### Report of the psychosocial outcomes workgroup of the nursing and social sciences council of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: present status of research on psychosocial outcomes in cardiothoracic transplantation: review and recommendations for the field [^115qSNpE]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

The success of cardiothoracic transplantation in prolonging life — and its economic costs — must be considered relative to its psychosocial benefits and costs. Moreover, psychosocial outcomes themselves influence long-term post-transplant morbidity and mortality rates. Although psychosocial outcomes, which encompass patients' physical, psychological, and social functioning as well as their management of their medical regimen and global quality of life, are the focus of many recent studies, these investigations have yet to yield many evidence-based interventions routinely applied to improve patient outcomes.

Our goals were to summarize existing work on psychosocial outcomes, delineate areas requiring attention, offer recommendations for steps to advance the field, and thereby provide an impetus for the conduct of clinical trials of interventions to improve these outcomes. We concluded that research must generally shift away from descriptive studies and toward prospective and clinical trial designs to:

- **Examine a full range of risk factors and clinical sequelae** of patients' psychosocial status.
- **Evaluate the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions**.

In addition, these issues must be considered across all cardiothoracic recipients, including not only heart recipients but also the less-studied populations of lung and heart-lung recipients, and must include longer-term (5+ years) outcomes than is typical in most work. The importance of adequately sized samples to ensure statistical power and the need to construct study samples representative of the larger cardiothoracic transplant population is also crucial.

### Consensus document for the selection of lung transplant candidates: An update from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [^113J7by4]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for lung transplantation, particularly concerning indications in COPD, the ISHLT 2021 guidelines recommend considering listing patients with COPD for lung transplantation if they present with any of the following criteria:

- **FEV1 < 20% predicted**: Indicates severely reduced lung function.
- **Moderate-to-severe pulmonary hypertension**: Reflects increased blood pressure in the lungs' arteries.
- **History of severe exacerbations**: Frequent or intense worsening of symptoms.
- **Chronic hypercapnia**: Persistently elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood.

### Consensus document for the selection of lung transplant candidates: An update from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [^111u8HQv]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). Low credibility.

Tens of thousands of patients with advanced lung diseases may be eligible as potential candidates for lung transplant worldwide each year. The timing of referral, evaluation, determination of candidacy, and listing of candidates continue to pose challenges and ethical dilemmas. To address these challenges, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation appointed an international group of members to review the literature, consider recent advances in managing advanced lung diseases, and update previous consensus documents on the selection of lung transplant candidates.

The purpose of this updated consensus document is to assist providers globally who care for patients with pulmonary disease in identifying potential candidates for lung transplant. It aims to optimize the timing of referrals of these patients to lung transplant centers and provide a framework for evaluating and selecting candidates at these centers.

- **General considerations**: This document addresses general considerations and provides disease-specific recommendations for referral and listing.
- **Ethical framework**: It includes an ethical framework and a recognition of the variability in acceptance of risk between transplant centers.
- **Risk factors**: The document establishes a system to account for how a combination of risk factors may be considered in candidate selection for lung transplantation.

### Patient-reported health outcomes in long-term lung transplantation survivors: A prospective cohort study [^113SEthM]. American Journal of Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Lung transplantation, with a reported median survival of 5.8 years, is currently recognized as a worthwhile treatment modality for patients with end-stage lung diseases. More than 55,000 transplants have been performed worldwide over the last three decades. This quantitative increase was accompanied by improvements in the physical and mental aspects of health in these patients. The survival rate has increased due to advances in surgical techniques and postoperative care, such as guidance on lifestyle and the administration of potent antimicrobial agents. Besides the increase in life years, it is important for both patients and healthcare providers to assess the effects of transplantation on health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

After lung transplantation, patients encounter challenges such as risk of graft rejection, chronic lung allograft dysfunction like bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), infections, malignancies due to immunosuppression, and side effects of medications. In both the short and long term, these issues can also affect HRQoL. Several studies have been performed with health-outcome measurement instruments that capture specific elements of HRQoL. In the short term, most patients are found to experience meaningful improvements after lung transplantation. However, the generalizability of these studies is constrained by methodological problems such as cross-sectional design, short-term follow-up, and small sample sizes. A few longitudinal studies have evaluated HRQoL after lung transplantation.

### Patterns and predictors of pain following lung transplantation [^117PKAr5]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Our objective was to examine variability in pain levels following lung transplantation and examine individual biopsychosocial factors influencing changes in pain.

We performed a retrospective study of a cohort of 150 patients transplanted and discharged from Duke University Hospital between January 2015 and September 2016. During hospitalization and at clinic visits up to two months after discharge, subjective pain ratings were obtained using a 0–10 Numeric Rating Scale. Psychiatric diagnoses of anxiety and depression and Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression (CES-D) scores collected after hospital discharge were examined as predictors of post-surgery pain. Medical and surgical variables were examined as covariates.

During hospitalization, pain ratings decreased over time (p < 0.001). Predictors of higher pain levels included pre-transplant history of depression (p = 0.001) and anxiety (p = 0.04), bilateral lung transplant (p = 0.03), and lower six-minute walk distance (p = 0.02). Two months after discharge, 18% of patients reported continued pain and 34% remained on opioid pain medications. Two months after discharge, more frequent post-operative complications predicted higher pain levels in a univariate analysis (p = 0.02), although this relationship was attenuated after adjustment for depression. In a multivariate analysis, elevated CES-D scores (p = 0.002) and greater opioid use (p = 0.031) predicted higher pain levels two months post-discharge.

We conclude that patients with psychiatric comorbidities may be at risk for greater pain.

The LT-QOL has some limitations, and there is more work to be done on it. Although the authors describe how the LT-QOL is more comprehensive than existing questionnaires, its 10 scales cover only five broad constructs: physical health, emotional/mental health, treatment burden, sexual health, and general QOL. Measurement experts may argue that the LT-QOL does not measure health-related QOL.

As alluded to above, inquiring about the frequency or intensity of symptoms — physical or emotional/mental — addresses health status, but that line of inquiry is subtly different from specifically asking how much those symptoms, or the condition in all its aspects, affect the full spectrum of life domains that contribute to QOL. I would call the LT-QOL a hybrid health-status/QOL questionnaire developed specifically for the post–lung transplant population.

Its last two items — which I really like ("I am able to enjoy life" and "I am content with the quality of my life right now") — tap general QOL, but even they do not reveal whether or how the transplant, and all it involves and impacts, has affected the respondent's QOL or ability to enjoy life. It is important to emphasize what makes this questionnaire distinct, as I suspect many investigators who will use the LT-QOL will not have expertise in measurement and will not review its content in detail. Typically, they would, I suspect, see its name and assume it captures a comprehensive view of QOL after lung transplantation. They should know what they're getting by using it.

### Consensus document for the selection of lung transplant candidates: An update from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [^112YiEQa]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for lung transplantation, more specifically with respect to indications in cystic fibrosis, ISHLT 2021 guidelines recommend listing patients with cystic fibrosis for lung transplantation if they meet any referral criteria in combination with any of the following:

- **Decline in lung function**: FEV1 30% relative decline in forced expiratory volume over 12 months.

- **Frequent hospitalization**: Particularly if more than 28 days hospitalized in the preceding year.

- **Exacerbation requiring mechanical ventilation**.

- **Chronic respiratory failure**: With hypoxemia or hypercapnia, particularly with increasing oxygen requirements or requiring long-term noninvasive ventilation therapy.

- **Pulmonary hypertension**: Pulmonary arterial systolic pressure > 50 mmHg on echocardiogram or evidence of RV dysfunction.

- **Worsening nutritional status**: Particularly with BMI < 18 kg/m² despite nutritional interventions.

- **Massive hemoptysis**: Despite bronchial artery embolization.

- **WHO functional class IV**.

### Do older surgeons have safer hands? A retrospective cohort study [^115YcZ43]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Referrals for lung transplantation have been increasing, with the most common indications being chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, and cystic fibrosis. The immediate effect has been longer waiting lists due to the persistent shortage of donor lungs suitable for transplantation. This situation has been partially mitigated by the introduction of the lung allocation score in 2005 by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) in the United States and the National Urgent Lung Allocation Scheme in the United Kingdom (UK) to ensure that patients most in need receive their transplant as quickly as possible.

Appropriate allocation of donor lungs to the highest priority patients is still limited due to factors such as ischaemic time. Despite this, it has been shown that in larger centers, the impact of longer ischaemic time is less significant, with no disadvantage when compared to shorter ischaemic times in the same center. This indicates that better patient outcomes are associated with management strategies in more experienced units.

Numerous studies support the assertion that larger centers have improved survival rates, particularly in complex procedures such as cardiac and pediatric cardiac surgery. Several contributing factors have been implicated, particularly the standard of peri-operative care and the quality of post-operative care providers. There is limited literature reflecting the possible effect of an individual surgeon's age and experience on survival rates.

A recent study compared surgeons.

### A randomized evaluation of quality-of-life therapy with patients awaiting lung transplantation [^113Xw9hA]. American Journal of Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Research shows that patients wait-listed for lung transplantation have very poor quality of life (QOL). This study evaluated the effectiveness of Quality-of-Life Therapy (QOLT) in improving QOL, mood disturbance, and social intimacy in adults awaiting lung transplantation. Thirty-five adults were randomized to QOLT (n = 17) or supportive therapy (ST; n = 18) and received individual, telephone-based treatment sessions. Assessments for QOL, mood, and social intimacy were conducted at baseline and at 1 and 3 months after treatment.

Repeated measures analyses of variance showed significant Condition x Time interaction effects for all three primary outcome measures. Subsequent post hoc analyses showed that the two groups did not differ significantly at baseline, but did differ significantly at the 1- and 3-month follow-up assessments. When compared to ST patients, QOLT patients had significantly higher QOL scores at the 1- and 3-month assessments, lower mood disturbance scores at the 3-month assessment, and higher social intimacy scores at the 1-month assessment. Results indicate that a patient's QOL, mood state, and relationship with the primary caregiver can be positively impacted by a brief psychological intervention prior to lung transplantation.

### Utility of the Stanford integrated psychosocial assessment for transplant in predicting outcomes before and after lung transplantation [^116mb7EQ]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2024). High credibility.

Optimizing donor use and achieving maximal survival following lung transplantation (LTx) require a pretransplant assessment that identifies clinical, physiological, and psychosocial patient factors associated with both poor and optimal post-LTx survival. We examined the utility of a psychosocial tool, the Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplant (SIPAT), to identify patient suitability for LTx, as well as its association with clinical outcomes before and after LTx.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective single-center study analyzing LTx assessment clinical variables (age, gender, diagnosis, functional capacity, nutrition, renal function), with a particular focus on the utility of the SIPAT score, to predict patient suitability for LTx. The same variables were analyzed against LTx waitlist mortality, as well as post-LTx survival.

- **Results**: Over an 8-year period dating from December 2012, 914 patients (male 54.4%, mean age 55.2 years) underwent LTx assessment. Patients declined for LTx (n = 152, 16.6%) were older and had reduced functional capacity, nutritional markers, and renal function but had a higher SIPAT score. Once listed for LTx, a higher SIPAT score was not associated with waitlist mortality or reduced post-LTx survival.

- **Conclusions**: The SIPAT tool measures psychosocial suitability for transplantation that can be incorporated into a standardized assessment of LTx suitability. While patients with a higher SIPAT score were more likely to be declined for LTx, the SIPAT score did not predict outcome in transplanted patients.

### Imaging indications and findings in evaluation of lung transplant graft dysfunction and rejection [^111PCfAq]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Lung transplantation is a treatment option in end-stage lung disease. Complications can develop along a continuum in the immediate or longer post-transplant period, including surgical and technical complications, primary graft dysfunction, rejection, infections, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, and recurrence of the primary disease. These complications have overlapping clinical and imaging features and often co-exist. Time of onset after transplantation is helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis. In the early post-transplantation period, imaging findings are non-specific and need to be interpreted in the context of the clinical picture and other investigations. In contrast, imaging plays a key role in diagnosing and monitoring patients with chronic lung allograft dysfunction. The goal of this article is to review primary graft dysfunction, acute rejection, and chronic rejection with emphasis on the role of imaging, pathology findings, and differential diagnosis.

### Lung transplant recipients' views on the integration of their new organs [^1147NZpQ]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2010). Low credibility.

Although donorship issues and the integration of the new organs are the most distinguishing aspects of lung transplantation (LTx) compared to other kinds of 'high-tech' medicine, there is a paucity of papers on that matter. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate these aspects in young adult LTx recipients with at least 1-year survival.

- **Methods**: Semi-structured interviews were conducted, with a content analysis of specific parts of the interviews and frequency distributions of resulting categories.

- **Sample**: Forty-five adults aged 18–42 years (mean: 32 ± 5.5 years) were included, with post-transplant survival ranging from 1 to 11 years.

- **Results**: The majority of recipients (60%) fulfilled criteria of denial towards the foreign organ and/or the donor. However, they were rather sensitive towards the ethical and psychological impact of the upcoming option of living donorship in LTx. Furthermore, the majority of recipients (79%) understood there might be good reason not to opt for an LTx.

- **Conclusions**: LTx recipients appeared at first sight 'pragmatic' towards the gift of life, but they remained sensitive to its ethical and psychological challenges.

### Timing of lung transplant evaluation: Considerations, barriers and alternatives [^1118kPfa]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The decision to proceed with lung transplant evaluation is multifaceted and complex. Among the primary **considerations**: The timing of evaluation is critical to ensure optimal outcomes. Patients must be assessed at a point when they are sick enough to need a transplant but healthy enough to undergo the surgery.

- **Barriers**: Several obstacles can hinder timely evaluation, including limited access to specialized centers, patient reluctance, and variations in local medical practice. Financial constraints and geographical location can further exacerbate these issues.

- **Alternatives**: Some alternatives to traditional lung transplant include innovative surgical techniques and advancements in artificial organ development. These options, although promising, are still in their experimental stages and not widely available.

The evaluation process should be patient-centric, considering individual health conditions and personal circumstances to tailor the best approach for each case. Understanding these dynamics is vital for healthcare providers to guide patients effectively through the transplant process.

### Patient-reported health outcomes in long-term lung transplantation survivors: A prospective cohort study [^111Bvftx]. American Journal of Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

This study applied two domain-specific HRQoL instruments to evaluate anxiety and depression. Anxiety was measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a 20-item self-report measure in which responses are given on a 4-point Likert scale from 4 (always) to 1 (never). The overall score ranges from 20 to 80, with 80 representing the worst possible state of anxiety. Depression was measured with the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), a 20-item self-report instrument with a 4-point Likert scale used to evaluate the psychological, affective, and somatic symptoms associated with depression. The overall score to be obtained with this instrument ranges from 25 to 100, where high scores indicate severe symptoms. We followed the standard instructions of the Zung and STAI. Accordingly, when calculating overall scores, if the number of missing items was equal to or less than two, we imputed their value by taking the mean of the other items. Overall scores with more than two missing items were excluded from the analysis.

In addition, the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) was used as a generic HRQoL instrument. The NHP is a self-report tool that contains 38 items and measures six domains of HRQoL: emotional reactions, social isolation, sleep, pain, energy, and physical mobility. The response categories for each item are "yes" and "no". Separate scores are calculated for each domain and lie between 0 and 100, whereby higher scores represent lower levels of HRQoL. Following the instructions for this instrument, if for an individual patient a response was missing, we imputed it by calculating the mean of other responses in the same domain, provided that missing responses did not exceed the allowable limit.

### Health-related quality of life after pediatric lung transplantation [^117UFwEn]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

Even when expecting a reduction of psychological disorders through transplantation, routine surveillance and early detection are crucial. These measures not only improve the overall quality of life but also address their well-documented association with patient adherence, which is of utmost importance in post-transplant care and poses a common problem, especially during puberty.

Lung transplantation is also associated with lifestyle restrictions due to necessary infection prophylaxis measures. Although most pronounced in the first 6–12 months, these limitations can lead to long-term social and economic burdens for patients and their families.

Socioeconomic aspects of our study cohort were evaluated by assessing schooling, education, employment, and housing situation. The rate of employment or education was 69% across the entire study cohort, with 63% of patients over 18 years being in regular or part-time occupations.

These results are challenging to interpret due to confounding factors such as social avoidance measures in phases of high immunosuppressive therapy and adolescent patients transitioning from education to work life. Nonetheless, they were generally better than previously published data on adult transplant recipients (13%–38% reintegrating into the workforce) and demonstrated a good rate of social integration.

A high percentage of recipients (86%) lived with their parents, including 50% of patients above 18 years of age. This might suggest a certain level of dependency despite the achievements in social integration.

### Telehealth interventions to improve outcomes in lung transplant recipients: Primary results of the INSPIRE-III randomized clinical trial [^1166UW9e]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

There is growing evidence that many patients undergoing lung transplantation report significant distress and low physical activity (PA), which might not improve despite lung transplantation and may be associated with worse clinical outcomes. Few studies have attempted to improve psychological outcomes, functional capacity, and PA after transplant.

- **Methods**: The Investigational Study of Psychological Interventions in Recipients of Lung Transplant-III is a single-site, randomized clinical trial in which 180 post-lung transplant patients, recruited between November 2019 and October 2023, completed a psychometric test battery to assess distress and functional capacity. This was measured by the 6-Minute Walk Test, and PA was assessed by 7 consecutive days of continuous activity monitoring. Participants were randomly assigned to a 12-week Coping Skills Training and Exercise intervention (CSTEX) or a Standard of Care plus Education (SoC-ED) program delivered via telephone. Participants were retested after completing the telehealth interventions.

- **Results**: After 12 weeks, both intervention groups achieved small but similar improvements in distress and functional capacity. Although there were no between-group differences overall, patients who were considered clinically depressed at baseline and received CSTEX achieved greater improvements in depression compared to depressed patients who received SoC-ED.

- **Conclusions**: Patients in both CSTEX and SoC-ED showed only modest benefit from their respective interventions. However, a subgroup of patients in CSTEX who were depressed achieved notable improvements.

### Health-related quality-of-life determinants in lung transplantation [^115vQ1hy]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

In light of recent reviews, we examined the effect of individual and clinical factors associated with lung transplantation (LTx) on health-related quality of life (HRQL).

- **Methods**: HRQL was measured cross-sectionally on 34 candidates and 71 lung transplant recipients using the Short Form 36-item questionnaire (SF-36) of the Medical Outcomes Study. Multivariate analysis was used to model each of the 8 SF-36 health domains as a function of individual determinants associated with LTx. The original model included: transplant status, age, gender, time since LTx, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (% predicted), type of LTx received, lung disease, whether within 1 month of the interview the participant was hospitalized, days in hospital (LOS), and whether infection or rejection occurred. Final models were chosen using a statistical cutoff of alpha ≤ 0.10 to remain in the model.

- **Results**: After adjusting for important predictors, lung transplantation was positively associated with all domains (p < 0.005). Although time since transplantation negatively influenced the physical and social-related domains (p < 0.05), the effect was small. Clinically meaningful effects on physical HRQL domains were observed with disease (p < 0.01), type of transplant received (p < 0.05), and hospital stay (p < 0.05). Gender played a role in mental health (p < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: Clinical events leading to hospitalization limit some HRQL domains. Different factors influence the physical, social, and mental health domains, and thus future studies should focus on domain-specific variables.

### A systematic review of health-related quality of life and psychological outcomes after lung transplantation [^11793Gkf]. Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Lung transplantation (LTx) aims to reduce physical disability, alleviate mental distress, extend survival, and improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In this systematic review, we aimed to: (1) augment evidence regarding measures to assess HRQoL and psychological outcomes after LTx; and (2) summarize HRQoL and psychological outcomes after LTx.

- **Methods**: Validated and standardized instruments with well-known psychometric properties used for assessing HRQoL and psychological outcomes after LTx were identified by means of comprehensive literature searches of PsychINFO and Medline/PubMed, up through March 2014. The following search terms were used in various combinations: lung transplantation; physical functioning; symptom experience; mental health; anxiety; depression; distress; social functioning; life satisfaction; and health-related quality of life.

- **Results**: The search strategy identified 371 titles and abstracts. Of these, 279 were retrieved for further assessment and 63 articles were selected for final review. Thirty-nine studies were found for HRQoL, 15 for physical functioning, 5 for mental health, and 4 for social functioning. A total of 50 psychometric instruments were encountered.

- **Conclusions**: Considerable heterogeneity exists in methodology, operational concepts, and applied outcome measures in the existing literature on HRQoL and psychological outcomes after LTx. Nevertheless, the studies generally point to significant improvements in both mental health and HRQoL post-transplant. Further research is warranted utilizing consistent outcome measures, including LTx.

### Considering candidates: modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors for lung transplantation [^1179JfvR]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to evaluate a candidate's risk profile for lung transplantation by understanding which patient factors can be addressed to minimize transplant risk. Some risk factors can be modified, while others cannot. This review explores the understanding of modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors for lung transplantation.

Recent findings suggest that several risk factors for lung transplant can be resolved entirely, thereby minimizing a candidate's transplant risk. Some features cannot be eliminated but can be optimized to minimize risk. Others cannot be altered and inherently bring risk to transplant, while a subset of nonmodifiable risk factors is considered absolute barriers to transplant.

Robust research and novel therapies have led to an increased ability to modify certain risk factors and thus decrease lung transplant risk. Further studies are needed to better understand how to estimate risk profiles when assessing candidacy and timing for lung transplant.

### Special considerations and techniques of interventions in lung transplant recipients [^117EAok8]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Lung transplants remain an important treatment option for patients with end-stage lung diseases, providing improvements in survival rates and quality of life. Specialized considerations should be applied with interventions for lung transplant recipients as they present specific anatomic variations and a high risk of certain complications. In this article, we highlight the role of interventional radiology for lung transplant recipients along with a discussion of interventional techniques. Specific emphasis is placed on describing and explaining the techniques related to the points of anastomosis, diagnosis and treatment of malignancies, and management of complications in lung transplant recipients.

### Comprehensive care of the lung transplant patient [^111Z5hdB]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Lung transplantation has evolved into a life-saving treatment improving the quality of life for patients with end-stage respiratory failure unresponsive to other medical or surgical interventions. With improving survival rates, the number of lung transplant recipients with preexisting and post-transplant comorbidities that require attention continues to increase. A partnership between transplant and non-transplant care providers is necessary to deliver comprehensive and optimal care for transplant candidates and recipients.

The goals of this partnership include timely referral and assistance with transplant evaluation, optimization of comorbidities and preparation for transplantation, management of common post-transplant medical comorbidities, immunization, screening for malignancy, and counseling for a healthy lifestyle to maximize the likelihood of a good outcome. We aim to provide an outline of the main aspects of the care of candidates for and recipients of lung transplants for nontransplant physicians and other care providers.

### A new tool to capture patients' perceptions of the effects of lung transplantation [^113Wo2k2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

In this issue of the journal, Singer and colleagues describe the development and initial testing of a questionnaire that aims to assess quality of life (QOL) after lung transplantation. Rather than developing their own items de novo, these lung transplant and questionnaire-development experts used clusters of items from existing questionnaires to capture aspects of life after lung transplant. They initially identified 126 items comprising clusters from eight questionnaires. Next, they conducted 43 cognitive interviews with lung transplant recipients who were asked whether the words and grammar used for individual items were clear, and whether there was redundancy in the items or clusters. For clusters that tapped the same construct (e.g. respiratory symptoms), interviewees were asked to select which item cluster more clearly reflected their definition of health-related QOL. Forty-two items were dropped after the interviews, leaving 84 items for field testing. Results from an exploratory factor analysis led the investigators to drop another 24 items. This left their questionnaire, which they call the Lung Transplant Health-Related Quality of Life (LT-QOL) survey, with 60 items comprising 10 scales: pulmonary symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, neuromuscular symptoms, treatment burden, worry about future health, cognitive limitations, sexual problems, anxiety/depression, health distress, and general QOL.

Analyses showed that the LT-QOL has acceptable-to-excellent psychometric properties, ranging from internal consistency to floor and ceiling effects. In support of its validity, its sc

### Impact of lung transplantation on recipient quality of life: a serial, prospective, multicenter analysis through the first posttransplant year [^113F95hf]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Quality of life (QOL) is an important but understudied outcome after lung transplantation. Previous cross-sectional, single-center studies suggest improved QOL, but few prior longitudinal multicenter data exist regarding the effect of transplantation on the patient's QOL.

- **Methods**: We hypothesized that lung transplantation confers a 1-year QOL benefit in both physical and psychological well-being. We further hypothesized that the magnitude of benefit would vary by sex, native disease, age, or type of transplant operation. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a secondary analysis using QOL data prospectively and serially measured with the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, version 2 (SF-36), in a multicenter cytomegalovirus prevention clinical trial. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess the impact of transplantation on the recipient's QOL.

- **Results**: Over the first year after lung transplantation, the SF-36 Physical Component Score significantly increased an average of 10.9 points from baseline levels (P < .0001). A positive benefit was observed for all native diseases; however, the magnitude varied slightly by native disease (P = 0.04), but not by sex (P = 0.35), age (P = 0.06), or transplant type (P = 0.30). In contrast, the SF-36 Mental Component Score did not change from baseline (P = 0.36) and remained well below population norms.

- **Conclusions**: Our results demonstrate that lung transplantation confers clinically important QOL benefits in physical domains but not in psychological well-being. A better understanding of the barriers to psychological improvement is needed.

### Primary graft dysfunction attenuates improvements in health-related quality of life after lung transplantation, but not disability or depression [^114cXLDv]. American Journal of Transplantation (2021). Low credibility.

Disability, depressive symptoms, and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQL) are common among patients with life-threatening respiratory compromise. We sought to determine if primary graft dysfunction (PGD), a syndrome of acute lung injury, attenuates improvements in patient-reported outcomes after transplantation. In a single-center prospective cohort, we assessed disability, depressive symptoms, and HRQL before and at 3- to 6-month intervals after lung transplantation. We estimated the magnitude of change in disability, depressive symptoms, and HRQL using hierarchical segmented linear mixed-effects models.

Among 251 lung transplant recipients, 50 developed PGD Grade 3. Regardless of PGD severity, participants experienced improvements in disability and depressive symptoms, as well as in generic-physical, generic-mental, respiratory-specific, and health-utility HRQL, exceeding 1- to 4-fold the minimally clinically important difference across all instruments. Participants with PGD Grade 3 had a lower magnitude of improvement in generic-physical HRQL and health-utility than other participants. Among those with PGD Grade 3, prolonged mechanical ventilation was associated with greater attenuation of improvements.

PGD remains a threat to the two primary aims of lung transplantation: extending survival and improving HRQL. Attenuation of improvement persists long after hospital discharge. Future studies should assess if interventions can mitigate the impact of PGD on patient-reported outcomes.

### Health-related quality of life long-term study in lung transplant patients: A single-center experience [^112Uj7pA]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Low credibility.

Health-related quality of life (HRQL) assessment plays a crucial role in the follow-up care of lung transplanted (LTx) patients. Previous reports have indicated that the HRQL achieved by these patients is often poorer compared to that of healthy individuals. However, the factors contributing to this lower HRQL remain unclear. This prospective study aimed to assess the effectiveness of using both a generic and a disease-specific HRQL instrument in evaluating the outcomes of patients who have undergone LTx.

- **Methods**: A total of 111 LTx patients were enrolled in the study, with 88 survivors completing the 5-year follow-up and 23 nonsurvivors identified within the first 3 years. Among the participants, 84 underwent double LTx, while 27 received a single LTx. Patients were interviewed before LTx, at 6 months post-transplantation, and annually thereafter. Two validated instruments were utilized: the Euro Quality of Life Five Dimensions, a generic measure, and the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), a disease-specific questionnaire.

- **Results**: The study showed significant improvements in Euro Quality of Life Five Dimensions scores from 6 months after LTx. Specifically, the percentage of patients without mobility problems increased from 23% before LTx to 71% at 5 years (P = 0.004). However, there was no significant improvement in other dimensions of health.

### Psychiatric considerations in the patient receiving organ transplantation: A clinical case conference [^117SE85E]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Psychiatric consultations to evaluate a patient's suitability to receive organ transplantation require the integration of multiple types and sources of information. During such a consultation, it is essential to evaluate a patient's social support network, history of treatment compliance, ongoing Axis I and Axis II disorders, and understanding of the procedure and follow-up required. This article presents the case of a woman with borderline personality disorder who developed hepatic failure following a drug overdose and discusses her evaluation for liver transplantation. The discussion frames the pertinent issues in the transplant evaluation and describes the perioperative (transplant) management of the borderline patient.

### Pregnancy after thoracic organ transplantation [^1145KhuE]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

A growing number of heart, heart-lung, or lung transplant recipients are women of reproductive age. Fertility and pregnancy are important issues in this group of patients and often pose complex medical, psychosocial, and ethical problems. Many successful pregnancy outcomes have been reported following heart or lung transplantation. Nevertheless, these patients are at risk of certain maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications, including hypertension, preeclampsia, infection, preterm birth, and low birth weight. The physiological changes that occur in pregnancy are generally well tolerated by patients who have undergone thoracic organ transplants.

The risk of allograft rejection during and after pregnancy is significant, and it is important to maintain an adequate level of immunosuppression. Pregnancies among lung transplant recipients are at higher risk for certain complications. The rate of graft rejection, independent of pregnancy status, is higher in this population. The long-term graft and patient outcomes, citing a 50% five-year mortality, will be critical while counseling these patients regarding the impact of pregnancy on survival and the ability to participate in raising the child.

A multi-disciplinary team, involving specialists in maternal fetal medicine, cardiology or pulmonary medicine, transplant medicine, anesthesiology, high-risk nursing, neonatology, psychology, genetics, and social services, is crucial to the care of these patients. This team approach should be initiated at the time of pretransplant and preconception counseling.

### The patient who has undergone lung transplantation: Implications for respiratory care [^112ymAYU]. Respiratory Care (2006).

Lung transplantation is now performed in patients with end-stage pulmonary parenchymal or vascular lung disease. The process of evaluating a patient for transplantation, managing the patient during the peri-operative period, and caring for the patient following transplantation is complex. Lung-transplant recipients are prone to unique complications of lung transplantation as well as general complications of an immunosuppressed host. This article reviews the indications for, expected outcomes of, and management of complications that can develop following lung transplantation. Respiratory therapists play an instrumental role in assisting in the management of this group of patients in the pre-transplant and post-transplant periods, and in their long-term management.

### Psychiatric disorder and quality of life in patients awaiting lung transplantation [^116wkAV2]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

To examine the relationship between psychiatric comorbidity and quality of life in patients awaiting lung transplantation, the study was conducted at the Duke University Medical Center/Lung Transplantation Program. The participants included one hundred patients with end-stage pulmonary disease listed for lung transplantation.

The findings revealed that twenty-five percent of the sample (n = 25) met diagnostic criteria for at least one mood or anxiety disorder. After controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, percentage of predicted FEV, and lung disease diagnosis, it was determined that patients with a psychiatric diagnosis reported poorer general quality of life (p < 0.0001), poorer disease-specific quality of life (p < 0.0001), greater shortness of breath (p = 0.01), more symptoms of psychological distress (p < 0.0001), lower levels of social support (p < 0.0001), and fewer positive health habits (p < 0.04) than their counterparts without a psychiatric diagnosis.

The study concluded that psychiatric comorbidity affects a significant portion of patients awaiting lung transplantation and is associated with decreased health-related quality of life.

### Timing of lung transplant evaluation: Considerations, barriers and alternatives [^113Xxqz2]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

General considerations regarding the risks and benefits of a lung transplant (LTx) should be taken into account when referring candidates. Factors such as age, body weight, functional status, and comorbidities — including cardiovascular disease, renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, gastrointestinal dysfunction, psychological risk factors, and infectious diseases — must be thoroughly investigated. In patients with COPD, some general considerations may be more concerning. As potential lung transplant candidates age, their comorbidities are likely to increase, necessitating a broader perspective on these considerations. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease in COPD may be as high as 70%, making management and treatment during transplant evaluation and listing essential. There is a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease post-LTx in general. Due to the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease in COPD, caused by systemic inflammation and smoking, the risk of developing or progressing cardiovascular disease post-LTx might be higher.

Furthermore, osteoporosis is common in COPD, even with treatment. Side effects from steroids, coupled with an insufficient diet and sedentary lifestyle, may negatively impact bone density in COPD patients. Unfortunately, there is no specific data on cardiovascular disease or osteoporosis in COPD post-LTx that allows for any firm conclusions to be drawn as a 'barrier' to evaluation or listing. Although LTx improves the quality of life for COPD patients, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis may affect the quality of life post-LTx.

Regarding surgical interventions for pulmonary hypertension, specifically in the context of lung transplantation, the ISHLT 2021 guidelines recommend referring patients with PAH for lung transplantation in the following scenarios:

- **ESC/ERS intermediate or high risk**: Those with a REVEAL risk score ≥ 8 despite appropriate PAH therapy.

- **Significant RV dysfunction**: This persists despite appropriate PAH therapy.

- **Need for IV or SC prostacyclin therapy**.

- **Progressive disease**: This occurs despite appropriate therapy or recent hospitalization for worsening PAH.

- **High-risk variants**: Patients with known or suspected conditions such as pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis, scleroderma, or large and progressive pulmonary artery aneurysms.

- **Signs of secondary liver or kidney dysfunction**: Resulting from pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis.

- **Potentially life-threatening complications**: Such as rehemoptysis.

Regarding surgical interventions for lung transplantation, and more specifically in relation to indications in lung cancer, the ISHLT 2021 guidelines recommend limiting lung transplantation to very select cases of lung-limited adenocarcinoma in situ, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, or lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma in whom:

- **Surgical resection is not feasible** either due to multifocal disease or significant underlying pulmonary disease.
- **Multifocal disease has resulted** in significant lung restriction and respiratory compromise.
- **Medical oncology therapies have failed** or are contraindicated.
- **Lung transplant is expected to be curative**.

### Health-related quality of life after pediatric lung transplantation [^1135Mkcf]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Background**: Survival rates after pediatric lung transplantation are lower compared to other solid organ transplantations. The need for substantial immunosuppression leads to a high rate of morbidities and complications post-transplant. Enhancing health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is particularly important after lung transplantation. However, there is only limited data available on this topic. HRQOL is a comprehensive concept used to evaluate the impact of health status on quality of life, encompassing various dimensions such as physical, functional, social, and psychological aspects to provide a holistic perspective on an individual's well-being.

In adult lung transplantation, significant improvements in emotional well-being and social functioning have been noted compared to pre-transplant status. However, post-transplant psychological challenges, such as posttraumatic stress, anxiety disorders, a sense of responsibility towards donors and caregivers, and fear of graft rejection, have been reported.

In pediatric lung transplantation, a single prospective study with 10 recipients and their caregivers showed significant improvements in self-reported HRQOL, lasting up to 25 months post-transplant. Three other pediatric studies highlighted psychological challenges mainly related to adaptation and fear of organ rejection.

The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) pediatric report of 2019 provides the largest data on physical activity, with nearly 80% of recipients having no.

### A new tool to capture patients' perceptions of the effects of lung transplantation [^116pz9yx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

For patients with many incurable, life-shortening lung conditions, lung transplantation offers "curative" therapy and the only therapeutic option with a reliable chance to improve their quality of life (QOL). But what is really meant by the term "QOL", and how do we measure this abstract construct?

For individuals, QOL refers to their perceptions of how well their needs and wants are met across dimensions of life that matter most to them. Thus, accurate assessments of QOL require knowledge of patients' perceptions, their needs and wants, and the dimensions of life they care about. Carefully crafted questionnaires, developed with systematically collected input from patients with the condition of interest, can capture all these things.

Until now, investigators and other stakeholders interested in examining the effect of lung transplantation on a person's QOL have had to rely on existing questionnaires. However, none of those questionnaires adequately address all of the domains that are important to patients after lung transplantation, including emotional well-being, pulmonary and extrapulmonary symptoms, effects of immunosuppression, and neurocognitive status. In fact, some experts say that many existing questionnaires — even ones that call themselves "QOL" or "health-related QOL" questionnaires — are really measures of health status. They measure certain domains (and do it well), but by confining themselves to assessing physical and/or emotional health, they fail to capture other domains that contribute to a person's QOL.

### Trajectories of change in quality of life in 12-month survivors of lung or heart transplant [^1143k72V]. American Journal of Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Survival and functional outcomes for lung transplant recipients continue to lag behind those for heart recipients. Whether these poorer physical outcomes translate into poorer quality of life (QOL) for lung recipients relative to heart recipients is unknown. Lung versus heart transplant recipients' perceptions of QOL were longitudinally compared at three time points across the first year posttransplant. Additionally, potentially important predictors of patient QOL were examined.

Adult transplant recipients (N = 199) participated in semi-structured interviews that included measures of QOL, optimism, mastery, social support, religiosity, and coping. Temporal patterns of QOL change were compared between lung and heart recipients who survived until 1 year posttransplant using mixed-model, hierarchical analysis of variance (ANOVA). Demographic and psychosocial predictors were examined with multiple regression analysis to identify the unique effects of each variable on QOL 1 year posttransplant.

While heart recipients' QOL across several domains was higher shortly after transplant, lung patients' QOL improved and was equivalent to that of heart recipients by 1 year posttransplant. Greater optimism and support from friends predicted better QOL in physical, psychological, and social domains. Conversely, avoidant coping strategies predicted poorer physical functioning. Thus, while clinical interventions designed to improve QOL posttransplant should be tailored to transplant recipients' initial psychosocial assets and liabilities, they need not be distinguished by transplant type.

### Quality of life after lung transplantation: A cross-sectional study [^116hPyC9]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

The increase in life expectancy has raised the importance of quality of life after lung transplantation, although this issue has not yet been systematically investigated. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to provide an overview of quality of life in lung transplant patients.

- **Methods**: Between April and July 2001, a set of four questionnaires was given to all adult, German-speaking lung transplant recipients (n = 108; response rate 87% [n = 94]): the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), a lung-specific health status instrument; the Short Form-36 (SF-36), a general quality of life measure; the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D); and a self-reported questionnaire concerning sexual functioning, physical symptoms, adverse effects of immunosuppression, and satisfaction with outcome.

- **Results**: With regard to the SGRQ, all lung transplant recipients had significantly better scores, which reflected an enhanced quality of life compared with the reference value for patients with obstructive pulmonary disease (SGRQ: p < 0.001 in all sub-scales). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Mental Component Summary Scale of the SF-36 did not differ significantly compared with published normative data in the healthy population. However, the side effects of immunosuppression proved to be a major factor influencing the quality of life of lung transplant recipients (11% influenced strongly and 24% moderately). Seventy-six percent of lung transplant patients were highly satisfied with the transplant outcome, and 92% would opt for the procedure again.

Regarding surgical interventions for lung transplantation, more specifically with respect to indications in COPD, ISHLT 2021 guidelines recommend referring patients with COPD:

- **BODE score 5–6 with additional factors**: Suggestive of increased risk of mortality such as frequent acute exacerbations, an increase in BODE score > 1 over the past 24 months, pulmonary artery-to-aorta diameter > 1 on CT, or FEV1 20–25% predicted.

- **Clinical deterioration**: Despite maximal treatment including medication, pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen therapy, and, as appropriate, nocturnal noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.

- **Poor quality of life**: Unacceptable to the patient.

### Pre-transplant depression as a predictor of adherence and morbidities after orthotopic heart transplantation [^114AcFE7]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Depression continues to remain a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic medical conditions. Cardiac transplantation is the gold standard treatment for end-stage heart failure. Patients with a condition so advanced as to require transplantation may experience pre/post-operative anxiety and depression. The prevalence of major depressive disorder in patients on a heart transplant waiting list is almost 24%. Further increases in the intensity of the symptoms during the waitlisted period have also been reported.

Many risk factors for post-cardiac transplant morbidity and mortality are well defined and include heart failure etiology, recipient age, donor age, body mass index, history of previous transplantation, impaired renal function, number of rejection episodes, and cardiac allograft vasculopathy.

Although psychosocial risk factors are used to determine eligibility for placement on a heart transplant waiting list, few studies have examined the validity of such factors in predicting post-transplant outcomes. Several studies reported no association between psychosocial factors and mortality, while others have found that several psychiatric risk factors and social/demographic characteristics correlated with post-transplant morbidity. As a result, the role of psychosocial factors on heart transplant outcomes requires further evaluation. In this study, we investigated the prognostic utility of "pre-transplant depression" on survival and morbidity after heart transplantation.

### A new tool to capture patients' perceptions of the effects of lung transplantation [^114ZXBZ7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

There may be some hidden redundancy in the LT-QOL: 10% (n = 6) of the items (from three different scales) include the term "worry", "worried", or "worrying" (e.g. "I worry that my lung transplant will not work, about getting infections, that my health will get worse, about not being able to stop or control worrying", "worrying too much about different things", and "is health a worry in your life?"). However, redundancy only lengthens the questionnaire; it does not detract from its psychometric soundness.

This work suggests that the LT-QOL is a valuable new tool capable of capturing patients' perceptions of the effects of lung transplantation. It provides a foundation for conducting additional analyses to support the validity of this tool. Remember, establishing the validity of a questionnaire is an ongoing process, not a threshold phenomenon. It involves using well-formulated hypotheses to test that questionnaire in many studies, under multiple conditions, to understand what its scores can reveal about respondents.

The LT-QOL is primed and ready for use in observational and interventional studies. The investigators have placed the LT-QOL in the public domain, allowing others to use it freely. They suggest administering a generic QOL questionnaire alongside it. The next phase of analyses should assess how the LT-QOL tracks the post–lung transplant course, establish its responsiveness to changes in health status as time advances after transplantation, and determine its sensitivity for detecting differences in the health-status/QOL trajectory between groups.

### Parent-reported health status after pediatric thoracic organ transplant [^116hSzu7]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

Thoracic organ transplantation is a life-changing event for a child and family from both a physical and psychosocial perspective. Accurate pre-transplantation counseling and effective post-transplantation follow-up depend on a good understanding of post-transplantation health status, especially as perceived by families.

- **Methods**: The Child Health Questionnaire-Parent Form 50 (CHQ-P50), an instrument that assesses parent-reported health status of pediatric patients, was administered to 47 pediatric thoracic organ transplant recipients (41 heart, 6 lung) aged 5 to 18 years.

- **Results**: Transplant recipients scored lower on the Physical Health Summary (PhS) score than the general population, as evidenced by a lower median score (50.6 vs 55.1, p < 0.0001) and a difference in the distribution of quartiles (p = 0.001), skewed toward the lower quartiles of the general population. The distribution of PhS scores in transplant recipients was comparable to scores of three groups of pediatric patients with other chronic health conditions (juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, epilepsy, and asthma). The distribution of the Psychosocial Health Summary (PsS) scores was similar to that of the general population, but the median score was lower (51.5 vs 53.2, p = 0.02). Transplant patients clearly scored lower than the general population on four of 12 sub-scales, including those assessing general health, physical functioning, family activities, and parental emotional impact. No difference was found in sub-scales reflecting self-esteem, mental health, behavior, pain, peer interactions, family communication, and family cohesion.

- **Progressive hypoxemia**: Especially in patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis.

- **Progressive, but not end-stage, liver or kidney dysfunction**: Due to PAH.

- **Life-threatening hemoptysis**.

### Impact of primary caregivers on long-term outcomes after lung transplantation [^116887ZD]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines consider the absence of a dependable social support system as an absolute contraindication to lung transplantation, yet varying degrees of social support exist among those selected for transplantation. We sought to characterize the relationship between a patient's self-reported primary caregiver and long-term outcomes after lung transplantation.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all lung transplant recipients aged 18 years and older who had undergone an initial transplant from 2000 to 2010. Cox regression was used to explore the relationship between the type of caregiver and the long-term risk of death and chronic graft failure, while adjusting for potential confounders.

- **Results**: There were 452 patients undergoing lung transplantation over the study period who met the inclusion criteria. Five types of primary caregivers were identified, with spouses being the most common at 60% (270 of 452). Compared with those with spousal caregivers, overall survival was significantly worse for patients who identified an adult child (hazard ratio [HR] 2.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15 to 3.60) or sibling (HR 3.79, 95% CI 2.48 to 5.78) as their primary caregiver. Additionally, the risk for long-term graft failure was significantly increased (HR 3.34, 95% CI 1.58 to 7.06) among patients with sibling caregivers.

- **Conclusions**: The type of primary caregiver selected before transplantation was associated with long-term outcomes. These results may reflect the long-term support requirements and/or competing responsibilities associated with different types of caregivers.
