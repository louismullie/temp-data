## Question

Treatment recommendations for metastatic solid pseudopapillary neoplasm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment recommendations for metastatic solid pseudopapillary neoplasm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and baseline prognosis. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and guideline positions. Next, I will examine surgical management for resectable disease, followed by systemic therapy for unresectable or metastatic disease. After that, I need to consider locoregional and supportive strategies, and finally, I should integrate molecular profiling and surveillance recommendations, while noting pediatric nuances and summarizing a practical algorithm with caveats about evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the disease framework and prognosis. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm is a rare, low-grade malignant pancreatic tumor with a female predominance and typically indolent behavior; however, 10–15% can metastasize, most often to liver and peritoneum, and long-term outcomes after complete resection are excellent, with 10-year survival exceeding 95% in many series, which underscores why aggressive local control is prioritized when feasible [^f55c662a] [^9eb3f0d7] [^20118a03].

> Wait, let me verify the evidentiary foundation before drawing conclusions. There are no randomized trials for metastatic SPN, and most data consist of case reports, small retrospective series, and expert consensus; European guidelines explicitly state there is no evidence to support routine adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy for SPN, and ACG guidance emphasizes surgical resection as the mainstay with very low-quality evidence for surveillance intervals, so any systemic recommendations must be framed as conditional and individualized [^7a0c7683] [^79278249] [^bc9d1438].

> I will now examine surgical management for resectable disease. Hold on, I should confirm that both synchronous and metachronous metastases are addressed. Multiple guidelines converge on an aggressive surgical approach when complete resection is achievable, including cytoreduction of liver or peritoneal disease, because complete removal is associated with prolonged survival; case series and consensus statements support resection of primary and metastases when feasible, and pediatric data similarly show excellent outcomes with surgical salvage of recurrences [^bc9d1438] [^1e5488c9] [^d109628c].

> Next, I should review systemic therapy for unresectable or metastatic disease. Initially, I thought to apply pancreatic adenocarcinoma regimens broadly, but wait, let me reconsider given SPN's distinct biology and chemosensitivity. European guidance allows that palliative chemotherapy may be considered analogous to pancreatic cancer, yet contemporary series suggest limited chemosensitivity; nonetheless, case-level evidence supports activity of modified FOLFIRINOX in aggressive SPN, with reports of disease control and even downsizing enabling surgery, and everolimus has produced durable responses in case reports, particularly when PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway alterations are present [^7a0c7683] [^a0d51947] [^91a104ab].

> Let me consider endocrine therapy, because I recall conflicting signals. A 2024 cohort analysis proposed tamoxifen plus megestrol based on Wnt and progesterone receptor pathway enrichment, with one durable partial response and prolonged stable disease in others; however, I should double-check that this remains hypothesis-generating rather than standard, given the small numbers and lack of controls, so I will present it as a potential option in select cases after shared decision-making rather than a guideline-endorsed standard [^d582ee56].

> I need to ensure I cover locoregional and supportive strategies. Hepatic arterial embolization has produced sustained control of liver metastases in case reports, and radiotherapy can be used for palliation of symptomatic sites; given the indolent biology, symptom-directed interventions and judicious use of local control are reasonable, and patients should be offered clinical trial participation whenever available to advance the evidence base [^7413418d] [^59b381bf].

> Now, I should review molecular profiling and targeted options. SPNs almost universally harbor CTNNB1 mutations, but additional alterations such as APC, BAP1, KDM6A, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway changes have been linked to more aggressive behavior; ASCO supports somatic genomic testing in metastatic disease when results may guide therapy, and case reports document responses to mTOR inhibition in appropriately selected patients, so I should recommend comprehensive profiling when feasible and consider targeted agents aligned to identified alterations [^20118a03] [^e99a59ab] [^a0d51947] [^91a104ab].

> Let me think about surveillance and long-term follow-up. Recurrence can be late, with median times around 3–4 years and reports up to 15 years, so I should confirm that guidelines recommend annual imaging for at least 5 years after resection; pediatric meta-analyses reinforce that positive margins and larger size increase recurrence risk, supporting prolonged surveillance in higher-risk patients [^79278249] [^b6e002fc] [^f4a7b6b4].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or adolescent. Pediatric SPN has excellent outcomes with surgery alone, and chemotherapy is rarely used; recurrence is uncommon and typically salvaged surgically, so I should avoid over-treating children with systemic therapy unless there is truly unresectable, progressive disease, and even then, decisions should be made in specialized centers with pediatric expertise [^b6e002fc] [^1e5488c9] [^9eb3f0d7].

> I should double-check that my practical algorithm aligns with the evidence. For resectable primary and metastases, prioritize complete surgical resection; for unresectable or medically inoperable disease, consider mFOLFIRINOX in aggressive presentations given case-level evidence of activity, and consider everolimus or other targeted agents when actionable alterations are found; in hormonally active contexts or when conventional therapy is contraindicated, endocrine therapy with tamoxifen plus megestrol may be considered experimentally; throughout, incorporate clinical trials, local control for symptoms, and structured surveillance for 5+ years, adjusting intensity to risk features and patient preferences [^bc9d1438] [^cae707ca] [^a0d51947] [^d582ee56] [^79278249].

> In summary, I need to emphasize that surgery remains the cornerstone for metastatic SPN when complete resection is possible, systemic therapy evidence is limited to case reports and small series, and molecular profiling can identify actionable targets in select patients; therefore, management should be individualized within multidisciplinary care, with transparent discussion of uncertainty and a strong encouragement to participate in clinical trials to build better evidence for this rare disease [^bc9d1438] [^e99a59ab] [^59b381bf].

---

For metastatic solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN), **surgical resection is first-line** when feasible, as it offers the best chance for long-term control and potential cure [^bc9d1438] [^dea72fb3]. If surgery is not feasible, **mFOLFIRINOX is the most active systemic regimen** based on case-level evidence, with responses including tumor shrinkage and disease stabilization [^cae707ca]. Everolimus is a **reasonable second-line option**, particularly with PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway alterations, with case reports showing durable disease control [^a0d51947] [^91a104ab]. Endocrine therapy (tamoxifen plus megestrol) may be considered in select cases, but evidence is limited [^d582ee56]. Given the rarity of metastatic SPN, management should be individualized and ideally conducted at experienced centers, with consideration of clinical trials and molecular profiling to guide therapy [^e99a59ab] [^a637dbb2].

---

## Surgical management

- **Surgical resection**: Complete resection of primary and metastatic lesions is the cornerstone of therapy and offers the best chance for long-term survival [^bc9d1438] [^dea72fb3].

- **Cytoreductive surgery**: Aggressive cytoreduction, including liver and peritoneal metastasectomy, is recommended when feasible [^bc9d1438] [^d582ee56].

- **Organ-preserving techniques**: Minimally invasive and organ-preserving surgeries (e.g. spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy) are safe and effective in selected patients [^84aadaac] [^9ec5147b].

---

## Systemic therapy

### Chemotherapy

- **mFOLFIRINOX**: Modified FOLFIRINOX (5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin) has demonstrated significant tumor shrinkage and disease stabilization in aggressive metastatic SPN cases [^cae707ca] [^b4f50fb4].

- **Gemcitabine-based regimens**: Single-agent gemcitabine or gemcitabine-based combinations have been reported effective in unresectable or metastatic cases, though evidence is limited [^9eb3f0d7] [^fba115e9].

---

### Targeted therapy

Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has shown **durable responses** in metastatic SPN, particularly in tumors with PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway alterations [^a0d51947] [^91a104ab]. Anlotinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, has also demonstrated **stable disease** in small case series, though further validation is needed [^4f9bc60c].

---

### Endocrine therapy

Tamoxifen plus megestrol acetate has been explored based on **progesterone receptor expression** in SPN, with reports of prolonged disease control in select patients [^d582ee56].

---

## Locoregional and supportive therapies

- **Hepatic arterial embolization**: Effective for liver-dominant metastases, providing sustained disease control in case reports [^7413418d].

- **Radiation therapy**: Useful for palliation of symptomatic metastases, particularly bone or brain lesions.

- **Clinical trials**: Enrollment in clinical trials is encouraged given the rarity of metastatic SPN and the limited evidence base [^59b381bf].

---

## Molecular profiling and biomarkers

CTNNB1 mutations are universal in SPN, but **do not currently guide therapy** [^20118a03]. Alterations in PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Wnt, and epigenetic regulators (e.g. BAP1, KDM6A) have been identified and may inform targeted therapy selection [^20118a03] [^e38b935b]. Molecular profiling is **recommended** to identify actionable mutations and guide personalized therapy [^e99a59ab].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Annual imaging for at least 5 years is recommended after resection, given the risk of **late recurrence** [^79278249] [^f4a7b6b4]. Long-term surveillance is essential, as recurrences can occur decades after initial treatment [^f4a7b6b4].

## Summary of treatment recommendations

| **Treatment modality** | **Indication** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Surgical resection | First-line for resectable disease | High |
| mFOLFIRINOX | Unresectable or metastatic disease | Moderate |
| Everolimus | Second-line or with PI3K/AKT/mTOR alterations | Moderate |
| Tamoxifen + megestrol | Selective cases | Low |
| Hepatic arterial embolization | Liver-dominant metastases | Low |
| Radiation therapy | Palliative care | Low |
| Clinical trials | All stages | High |

---

Surgical resection remains the **cornerstone** of metastatic SPN management, with mFOLFIRINOX and everolimus as key systemic options when surgery is not feasible. Management should be individualized, with consideration of molecular profiling and clinical trial enrollment.

### Rare aggressive solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the ovary with metastatic disease following surgical resection [^d02f90c8]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Extra-pancreatic solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs) are rare tumours with an overall favourable prognosis and low malignant potential. SPNs with metastatic spread, distant lymph node metastasis and extrapancreatic origin are exceedingly rare. Significant controversy regarding the treatment and the management of metastatic disease exists and, currently, there are no standardised guidelines or treatment recommendations for the use of adjuvant therapy. In this case report, the authors present a patient with widely metastatic SPN of likely ovarian origin with the invasion of the inguinal lymph nodes and multiple abdominal metastatic deposits. Using the currently available literature, the authors discuss treatment options for metastatic SPN of the ovary and highlight the need for continued research in this important field.

Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms — behavior and management are characterized by aggressive potential with vascular involvement in 4.6%, lymph node in 1.6%, and distant metastases in 7.7% of patients; for these patients, "Surgical resection is recommended… and we recommend referral to a high-volume pancreatic center".

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^79278249]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm — post-resection follow-up: Patients with surgically resected solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm with negative margins have an excellent prognosis; however, recurrence is reported in 4.4% of patients with the median time to recurrence of 50 months. Surveillance is, therefore, recommended, and imaging on a yearly basis for at least 5 years, followed by eventual cessation of surveillance, is reasonable; in addition, patients should be followed for a minimum of 5 years following resection of a solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

7.2 How should a small, undefined cyst be followed up?

Cysts which are of unclear aetiology, have no risk factors for malignancy, and measure < 15 mm, should be re-examined after 1 year. If stable for 3 years, follow-up may be extended to every 2 years. Cysts measuring ≥ 15 mm should be followed up every 6 months during the first year and annually thereafter (GRADE 2C, strong agreement).

As an undefined cyst may be mucinous by nature, surveillance is recommended. Most studies report that the risk of malignant transformation of PCN increases with size. This probably also applies to cysts of unclear aetiology.

A prospective population-based study found that unidentified cysts are very common (49% when including diameters of ≥ 2 mm), increase in number and size with age of the population (57% of subjects), but have no effect on pancreatic disease-associated mortality over 5 years.

Recommendations that include 6-month surveillance intervals may therefore constitute overtreatment in cases where IPMN and MCN have been ruled out.

7.3 Duration of follow-up of undefined cysts

Patients with undefined cysts should undergo lifelong follow-up, unless the patient is unwilling, or unfit to undergo pancreatic surgery (GRADE 2C, strong agreement).

The long-term evolution of PCN is still largely unknown, which also applies to undefined pancreatic cysts. Therefore, no rational term for termination of surveillance can be given. However, recent data suggest that the risk of progression increases over time.

7.4 Should all solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPN) be resected?

Radical resection should be performed for all SPN (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

Even in the absence of a large series, the surgical resection of SPN is internationally recommended and associated with positive long-term outcome.

7.5 Can locally advanced SPN be resected? Should synchronous or metachronous metastases be resected?

In cases of locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent SPNs, an aggressive surgical approach, with complete resection is indicated (GRADE 2C, strong agreement).

SPNs are rare, and there is a lack of high-quality studies to guide care. Most studies are small, retrospective case series, making comparison between studies difficult.

### Whole-genome analysis of an aggressive metastatic pancreatic solid pseudopapillary neoplasm [^cae707ca]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the rarity of aggressive SPNs, there are no prospective studies to guide the most appropriate treatment. Surgical resection is preferred whenever feasible but in cases with disseminated or unresectable disease where systemic therapy is considered, there is no consensus on the standard regimen. In an early review, Soloni et al. reported cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and gemcitabine as the most common chemotherapy agents used in unresectable SPN, though only some patients derived clinical benefit and the impact of chemotherapy was unclear given the expected indolent nature of SPNs. In the current report, our patient was treated with mFOLFIRINOX chemotherapy akin to those with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, with a reduction in the size of liver lesions and stabilization of the pancreatic primary after only eight cycles. A previous case report also described a favorable response to neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX, which facilitated a curative resection in an initially unresectable SPN after nine cycles. However, the patient recurred shortly after with progressive liver metastases and was then treated with everolimus based on genomic testing of the primary tumor revealing a pathogenic PTEN mutation alongside a canonical CTNNB1 mutation, resulting in marked response and sustained partial remission. Overall, the reasonable tolerability and rapid treatment response in our patient further support the effectiveness of FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy in aggressive SPNs, though longer follow-up is needed to determine the durability of responses and long-term outcomes.

In summary, we present a case study of metastatic SPN where, in addition to pathologic and radiographic evaluation, whole-genome analysis of both primary and metastatic tumor lesions was used to identify potential genetic determinants of tumorigenesis and progression. Our patient had a pathologically and clinically aggressive SPN that was genomically characterized by a non-canonical homozygous loss-of-function mutation in APC and demonstrated early response to upfront mFOLFIRINOX chemotherapy. Longer follow-up is required to determine the long-term treatment benefit, while additional studies with larger sample sizes are needed to further characterize the clinicopathologic and molecular features that may predict differentially aggressive subtypes of SPN.

### Treatment modalities for advanced solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas… [^d582ee56]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract e16327 Background: Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas is a rare low-grade malignant tumor. However, a minority of SPT patients present aggressive behavior and develop recurrent or metastatic diseases. The treatment strategies of advanced SPTs remain unclear. Our study aimed to explore the treatment modalities of aggressive SPTs and the role of endocrine therapy. Methods: The data on clinicopathologic characteristics and treatment of advanced SPT patients from Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center and Shen Zhen People's Hospital were collected. The treatment modalities were explored by co-analyzing our local cohort and published literatures. Single sample gene set enrichment analysis was used to explore the functional enrichment pathway. Fresh surgical specimens from 10 SPT patients were collected for endocrine drugs sensitive test in vitro by performing tumor histoculture end-point staining computer image analysis.

Results: A total of 77 advanced SPT patients including 14 cases in our local cohort and 63 cases from published literatures were enrolled. 60 patients received local treatment including cytoreductive surgery, interventional therapy or radiation therapy. 55 patients who had undergone cytoreductive surgery have better outcome compared with others. 31 patients received systemic chemotherapy and 6 patients received targeted therapy. There were 2 patients achieved partial response after chemotherapy. In our local cohort, 5 patients received endocrine therapy with tamoxifen plus megestrol. One patient achieved partial response with duration of response of 89 months. 4 patients showed stable disease. ssGSEA for GSE43795 showed that Wnt signaling pathway and its inhibitory pathway-progesterone receptor signaling pathway were simultaneously enriched in SPTs. Conclusions: Advanced SPTs did not appear chemosensitive. Cytoreductive surgery may improve survival.

Simultaneously enriching Wnt and progesterone receptor signaling pathway may partially explain the low aggressive ability of SPT and their unbalance may lead to the aggressive behavior of SPT. Endocrine therapy with tamoxifen plus megestrol, by enhancing the progesterone signaling pathway, seems to be a promising regimen for advanced SPTs, which is worth to be noted and further studied.

### Whole-genome analysis of an aggressive metastatic pancreatic solid pseudopapillary neoplasm [^306a9ca9]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) is a rare type of pancreatic tumor that predominantly occurs in females of reproductive age, typically characterized by an indolent clinical course, minimally symptomatic presentation, and a highly favorable prognosis when complete resection is feasible. However, up to 10–15% of cases are considered aggressive and can invade locoregional structures or metastasize to distant organs, most commonly the liver. Due to disease rarity and consequent paucity of reported data, clinicopathological and molecular characteristics, as well as optimal management of SPNs, particularly in aggressive cases, are not well defined.

At British Columbia (BC) Cancer, the Personalized OncoGenomics (POG) program is a research initiative that uses whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing to study tumor biology. For eligible patients with advanced cancers, comprehensive genomic data is analyzed to identify potential drivers or clinically actionable mutations that may inform diagnostics or treatments. Here, we describe a patient with pancreatic SPN presenting with highly symptomatic metastatic disease that was treated using upfront modified (m) FOLFIRINOX (infusional 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) chemotherapy. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on both the pancreatic primary and liver metastasis, revealing a non-canonical loss-of-function mutation in APC as the driver of tumorigenesis.

### Outcomes in paediatric solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b6e002fc]. Annals of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate outcomes and risk factors for recurrence and pancreatic insufficiency in paediatric Solid Pseudopapillary Neoplasm (SPN) of the pancreas.

Background

SPN is a low-grade malignant pancreatic tumour and uncommon in children. Recommended treatment is complete surgical resection. Long-term problems include recurrence and pancreatic insufficiency. The low incidence in children complicates consolidation of high-quality data. Paediatric-specific guideline recommendations on follow-up are missing.

Methods

Systematic review of Ovid/Medline/Embase/Web-of-Science databases from inception-2024, investigating outcomes after paediatric SPN resection. Meta-analysis, univariate and multivariate analysis were performed.

Results

778 articles were identified and 37 articles (701 patients) analysed. Median age was 14 years [IQR12;15], 584 (83.2%) patients were female. Median follow-up was 52.5 months [IQR 34;71]. Recurrence developed in 40 (5.7%) patients; at a median of41 months post-operatively [IQR 36;48]. Multivariate analysis identified positive resection margin (OR 48.1, P < 0.001) and large tumour size (OR 1.44, P < 0.001) associated with recurrence. Univariate analysis also identified neurovascular invasion and positive lymph node status as riskfactors. Endocrine dysfunction developed in 10/157 patients (median 14 mo [IQR 14;98] after surgery). Exocrine dysfunction developed in 9/157 patients: (median 15 mo [IQR 6;15]). Four (0.57%) patients died during reported follow-up, two with identified disease recurrence.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis of paediatric patients with SPN demonstrates a significantly increased risk of tumour recurrence in patients with larger tumours and positive resection margins, at a median of 3.4 years after surgery. This highlights the need for systematic long-term follow-up of children with SPN. International collaborative studies are warranted to improve paediatric-specific data.

### Management of a malignant case of solid pseudopapillary tumor of pancreas: a case report and literature review [^529f266a]. Pancreas (2012). Low credibility.

Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas is a rare neoplasm with low malignant potential, which affects predominantly young females. Only approximately 10% to 15% cases of solid pseudopapillary tumors (SPTs) are malignant. We present the case of a 57-year-old woman who developed malignant SPT of the pancreas. Meanwhile, a literature review was carried out. Some clinicopathological features and strategies of management of malignant SPT are presented. In general, surgical removal of the tumor even in case of metastases or recurrence offers an excellent prognosis. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy should be taken into consideration in patients with unresectable tumor.

### Systematic therapy for metastatic solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas: a single-center experience… [^4f9bc60c]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract e16341 Background: Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas is a rare tumor with low-grade malignancy. However, a small proportion of cases still exhibit more aggressive behavior and emerge as distant metastases. Limited data exist on systemic therapy for these entities. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on patients diagnosed with SPN of the pancreas who underwent medical treatment in our hospital between January 2020 and December 2023. The clinicopathological characteristics and therapeutic regimens of the patients were collected. The primary outcomes were disease control rate and progression free survival. SPSS software V27. 0 was used for data analysis. Results: Five patients were identified and 60. 0% of patients were female. The median age was 34 years. All patients first underwent surgical resection. Four individuals had metachronous distant metastasis and one had synchronous distant metastasis.

The most common metastatic site was peritoneum and liver, followed by the distant lymph node. Progesterone receptor positive expression was found in four cases. Four patients received targeted therapy as first-line treatment. All patients receiving targeted therapy had stable disease, with a DCR of 100%. The median PFS in the targeted therapy group was 8. 1 months. Only one patient underwent first-line chemotherapy and experienced disease progression at the initial efficacy evaluation. Data for second-line treatment was available for three patients. One patient got progressive disease after etoposide administration. Two individuals received everolimus 10mg daily, one of whom showed PD and the other achieved a partial response. All treatment-related adverse events were manageable.

Conclusions: Metastatic SPN of the pancreas may be not chemosensitive. Targeted therapy, such as anlotinib and everolimus, appears to be a potential therapeutic option.

### Whole-genome analysis of an aggressive metastatic pancreatic solid pseudopapillary neoplasm [^b4f50fb4]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs) are uncommon tumors that rarely exhibit aggressive behavior. Given disease rarity, comprehensive studies to understand tumor biology, clinical course, and optimal management are limited. We describe an unusual case of a 55-year-old man with metastatic pancreatic SPN, where whole-genome and transcriptome analyses of the primary tumor and a metastatic liver lesion revealed a shared homozygous non-canonical mutation in APC. The patient received upfront modified FOLFIRINOX (infusional 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) chemotherapy due to rapidly progressive symptoms, demonstrating an early and sustained treatment response. Therefore, we identified potential genetic determinants of tumorigenesis and progression in a pathologically and clinically aggressive SPN, which may have important prognostic and treatment implications.

### A systematic review of solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms: are these rare lesions? [^e0a29eff]. Pancreas (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to determine if there had been any change in the number of solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) cases detected and their evaluation or management over time.

Methods

A systematic review of SPN was performed of all articles published in English in PubMed and Scopus.

Results

A total of 2744 patients with SPN were identified in 484 studies published between 1961 and 2012; 87.8% of the cases were reported between 2000 and 2012. A total of 2408 (87.8%) were females, and the mean age was 28.5 (SD, 13.7) years. The most common symptom was abdominal pain in 63.6% of the cases and incidentally detected in 38.1% of the cases. There were 2285 patients who underwent pancreatic resection. The mean tumor size was 8.6 (SD, 4.3) cm. Follow-up was reported for 1952 (90.5%) patients, with a mean follow-up of 36.1 (SD, 32.8) months. Disease-free survival was documented in 1866 (95.6%) patients with recurrence in 86 (4.4%) patients; the median time to recurrence was 50.5 months.

Conclusions

The number of SPNs reported in the literature has seen a 7-fold increase in the number of cases reported since 2000 compared with before. Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms continue to be primarily found in young women and present with nonspecific symptoms. Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment with an excellent long-term prognosis.

### Management algorithms for pancreatic cystic neoplasms [^0ebe95fc]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Context —

The detection of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) has increased owing to the advancement and widespread use of imaging modalities, resulting in differences between past and current management methods for PCNs, including intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). Therefore, clinicians should accurately diagnose and determine appropriate treatment strategies. However, previously published treatment guidelines for IPMNs present different indications for treatment.

Objective —

To review the current status of PCNs, including epidemiologic change, malignancy risk, and factors for treatment, and to provide the optimal management algorithms for PCNs, including IPMNs, from the clinician's point of view.

Data Sources —

Literature review of published studies and the authors' own work.

Conclusions —

The treatment of PCNs relies on the type of cyst that is present or suspected. Serous cystic neoplasms are usually benign, and observation is sufficient. However, surgical treatment is required for mucinous cystic neoplasms, and malignancy risk differs according to lesion size. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms also require surgery. The detection of small IPMNs has been increasing, and most branch duct-type IPMNs are dormant. However, cysts 3 cm or larger or growing branch duct-type IPMNs must be carefully monitored because of the increasing risk of malignancy. Therefore, surveillance strategies should be different according to the size of the lesions. A tailored approach is needed for selecting surgery or surveillance, considering the malignancy potential of the lesion and patient-associated factors such as operative risks and life expectancy. Nomograms are valuable tools for selecting treatment methods as a customized approach for IPMNs.

### Response to mammalian target of rapamycin-based therapy and incidental finding of Lynch syndrome in a patient with solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas with AKT1_E17K mutation | JCO precision oncology… [^91a104ab]. ASCO (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas are exocrine neoplasms that predominantly affect young females and are considered to have low malignant potential. Surgical resection offers patients an excellent chance of long-term survival, even in cases of local invasion, recurrence, and metastatic disease. 1-3Recent studies have demonstrated that invasion of these neoplasms into muscular vessels, advanced tumor stage by European Neuroendocrine Tumors Society classification, and distant metastasis correlated with poor prognosis. 4In such instances — and especially when complete surgical resection is unattainable — use of salvage chemotherapy is needed. 5, 6In this setting, some chemotherapy agents have offered favorable responses, 7-10yet because of the scarce number of reported cases requiring this treatment modality, no regimen has been demonstrated as definitely superior.

Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first case reporting the use of genomic testing to guide the treatment of metastatic SPN of the pancreas. The clinical genomic assessment that included somatic and germline evaluations resulted in the identification of actionable genes in the patient and the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome. On the basis of these results, she was administered an mTOR-based therapy and received genetic counseling for Lynch syndrome. The patient continues to demonstrate a sustained clinical benefit 3 years after the initiation of this therapy and after experiencing disease progression on conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Although a few case reports have demonstrated that chemotherapy agents offer variable degrees of activity toward this rare neoplasm. Targeting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is known for its participation in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis, 25was effective in our patient with SPN.

Analogous to the response achieved in cases of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, 26treatment with everolimus, an oral signal transduction inhibitor that blocks mTOR, resulted in stable disease. The patient continues to tolerate the treatment well, with most adverse events being managed successfully with medical treatment. SPNs should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic masses in patients with Lynch syndrome/HNPCC syndrome. Seeking targetable mutations should continue to play a leading role in the management of this rare neoplasm, especially in those patients who lack defined treatment alternatives.

### Contemporary analysis of solid pseudopapillary neoplasms in children versus adults [^c72a5ab3]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) comprises 2% of pancreatic tumors. We aimed to examine the clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of SPN in children and adults using US-based national cancer registry data.

Methods

In this retrospective National Cancer Database analysis, children (< 18 y) and adults (≥ 18 y) with SPN were included (2004–2020).

Results

A total of 1325 patients (231 children, 1094 adults) with SPN were identified. There were no differences between groups regarding tumor size, metastasis, or stage. Most patients in both groups underwent surgical treatment (96.5% versus 92.1%, P = 0.056), whereas a smaller proportion of children received chemotherapy compared to adults (0.9% versus 4.2%, P = 0.01). The 10-year overall survival rate was 99.1% in children versus 88.0% in adults. In multivariable Cox regression, when adjusted for tumor location and receipt of chemotherapy and radiation, adulthood (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.32, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.26–22.49, P = 0.02), Charlson-Deyo score ≥ 2 (HR: 3.04, 95% CI: 1.21–7.63, P = 0.02) compared to 0, stage II (HR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.27–4.82, P = 0.008), stage III (HR: 6.82, 95% CI: 1.50–31.02, P = 0.01), and stage IV (HR: 5.94, 95% CI: 2.49–14.16, P < 0.001) compared to stage I were associated with an increased risk of mortality, whereas Hispanic compared to White patients (HR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.21–0.95, P = 0.04) and surgically treated patients had a decreased risk of mortality (HR: 0.10, 95% CI: 0.05–0.21, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Despite similar stage presentation, children with SPN exhibit prolonged survival compared to adults. Most patients underwent surgical treatment, whereas children were less likely to undergo chemotherapy than adults.

### Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of pancreas with distant metastasis during pregnancy: a diagnostic and treatment challenge [^5da41760]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs) are rare pancreatic cystic neoplasms occurring predominantly in young women and diagnosis is often a challenge. This report describes the case of a 23-year-old primigravida who presented with abnormally elevated liver blood tests at 24 weeks of gestation. Imaging studies were suggestive of SPN with metastatic liver disease. A multidisciplinary team approach decided on a preterm caesarean delivery of a healthy female child at 36 weeks of gestation. Subsequently, a CT-guided biopsy was performed, with confirmation of SPN in the anatomopathological study. Subpartial pancreatectomy, partial gastrectomy, cholecystectomy, total splenectomy and partial hepatectomy were successfully performed. A 3-month control CT scan and positron emission tomography-CT studies revealed disease recurrence with pulmonary and liver metastatic disease. The patient was started on a palliative chemotherapy protocol with good tolerance. To our knowledge this is the first case of a SPN described in pregnancy with distant metastasis and disseminated recurrence after surgical treatment.

### Malignant potential of solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas [^dea72fb3]. The British Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas are rare malignant lesions of the pancreas that typically occur in young women. Large series from any one centre are notably absent in the literature. The aim of this study was to determine long-term outcomes of operative therapy.

Methods

The records of all 14 patients diagnosed with pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas over 17 years were reviewed.

Results

Thirteen of the 14 patients were female and the mean age at diagnosis was 30 years. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm was suspected in only half of these patients before operation. On computed tomography, ultrasonography and/or magnetic resonance imaging, three lesions were solid, three were largely cystic, and five had solid and cystic components. All 14 patients underwent surgical exploration and curative resections were possible in 13, including distal pancreatectomy in nine, pancreaticoduodenectomy in three and resection of a local intraperitoneal recurrence in one patient. After follow-up ranging from 3 months to 20 years, 12 patients were alive, including one who had undergone re-exploration and resection of local and subcutaneous recurrences 9 years previously.

Conclusion

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any solid or partly cystic pancreatic mass in women aged less than 35 years. An attempt at en bloc resection without formal lymphadenectomy should be undertaken, including resection of synchronous or metachronous distant metastases.

### Surgical treatment of solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas and risk factors for malignancy [^15764d2c]. The British Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to identify clinical predictors of malignancy and surgical strategies for pancreatic solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) by analysis of surgical outcomes at a single institution.

Methods

All patients who underwent surgery for SPN between 1995 and 2010 were identified. Histopathology slides of all patients were reviewed by a specialized pathologist and the neoplasms were classified according to the criteria of the World Health Organization 2010.

Results

Of the 106 patients identified, 85 (80.2 per cent) were female, and the median age was 36 (range 10–65) years. Median tumour size was 4.5 (range 1.0–15.0) cm. Some 17 patients (16.0 per cent) were classified as having a high-grade malignant SPN. Tumour size of at least 5cm was associated with high-grade malignant potential (P = 0.022). Although lymph nodes were removed from 40 patients (37.7 per cent), there were no nodal metastases. A total of five patients underwent en bloc resection of adjacent structures, including two with portal vein involvement. After a median follow-up of 56.9months, two patients with high-grade malignant SPN had evidence of tumour recurrence in the lymph nodes and liver.

Conclusion

SPN with a diameter of 5cm or more is associated with a high-grade malignant phenotype. Complete surgical removal is associated with low recurrence rates.

### Age in combination with gender is a valuable parameter in differential diagnosis of solid pseudopapillary tumors and pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm [^c429bdc9]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm (pNEN) is rare and it is around 10 per million in 2015, which accounts for only 5.2% of all pancreatic neoplasms. In the last two decades, in order to describe these tumors, various nomenclatures were used, for example insulinoma, somatostatinoma, and gastrinoma, and until 2010 the World Health Organization (WHO) defined these tumors as neuroendocrine neoplasm. Based on the histopathlogy and Ki-67 index, the pNENs were divided into well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). In addition, according to the clinical manifestations, the pNENs are classified into functioning or nonfunctioning neoplasms. Functioning pNENs are characterized with specific symptoms, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, wihich are caused by hormones. Nonfunctioning pNENs may also secrate hormones, however, it cannot lead to symptoms.

Solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) is a type of neoplasm whose incidence is lower than pNEN and it accounts for only 0.1% of all pancreatic tumors. Same to pNEN, the nomenclature vasried in the last decades and until 1996 the WHO defined these tumors as SPTs and pathologically classified them as rare cystic pancreatic neoplasm. In contrast to pNEN, which originates from pancreatic duct pluripotent stem cells, SPT may be derived from pancreatic embryonic stem cells. The 5-year survival rate of pNEN and SPT is 45.2% and 87.2%, respectively. This suggests that the prognosis of SPT is better than pNEN. In addition, the management of these two types of pancreatic tumors is different. For example, due to the excellent prognosis and low malignant biological behavior of SPT, patients with advanced or metastatic tumors could achieve long-term survival and, therefore, aggressive surgical resection is a favorable intervention for these patients. However, for pNEN, aggressive surgical resection is recommended for selected individuals with well-differentiated tumors.

### National guidelines for cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in peritoneal malignancies: a worldwide systematic review and recommendations of strength analysis [^59805bfc]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Peritoneal malignancies (PMs) refer to involvement of the peritoneal surface by malignant tumor cells, either originating from the peritoneum itself (primary tumors) or spreading from other organs (peritoneal metastases). This condition is generally associated with a poor prognosis, significant impairment in quality of life, and obstructive symptoms. Whereas primary peritoneal tumors, such as serous carcinoma and mesothelioma, are rare, peritoneal metastases are common in epithelial ovarian cancer (60–70% of cases), gastric cancer (15–40%), pancreatic cancer (15%), and colorectal or appendiceal cancer (4–25%). Less frequently, metastases arise from biliary and genitourinary cancers or from extra-abdominal solid tumors such as breast and lung cancer.

Before the 1990s, PMs were considered an incurable, end-stage disease with limited or no treatment options. However, with the introduction of multimodal therapy, including peritoneal surgery (i.e. cytoreductive surgery) and intraperitoneal chemotherapy, this paradigm has shifted in recent decades toward a potentially curative approach.

Numerous reports from the 2000s, together with high-level studies in recent years, have demonstrated a significant improvement in survival among selected patients with PM of various origins. – Based on these findings, several scientific societies and government agencies have incorporated cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and locoregional treatments, particularly hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), into consensus statements and national guidelines. The strength of these recommendations varies depending on the type of tumor.

This study aimed to identify and analyze national guidelines worldwide regarding the recommendations for CRS and/or HIPEC in the treatment of pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP), malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, and peritoneal malignancies with an epithelial ovarian, gastric, or colorectal origin.

### Potential role for observation in small solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) [^b405c34f]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPN) are rare tumors of the pancreas, typically affecting young women. Resection is the mainstay of treatment but is associated with significant morbidity and potential mortality. We explore the idea that small, localized SPN could be safely observed.

Methods

This retrospective review of the Pancreas National Cancer Database from 2004 to 2018 identified SPN via histology code 8452.

Results

A total of 994 SPNs were identified. Mean age was 36.8 ± 0.5 years, 84.9% (n = 844) were female, and most had a Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Coefficient (CDCC) of 0–1 (96.6%, n = 960). Patients were most often staged clinically as cT 2 (69.5%, n = 457) followed by cT 3 (17.6%, n = 116), cT 1 (11.2%, n = 74), and cT 4 (1.7%, n = 11). Clinical lymph node and distant metastasis rates were 3.0 and 4.0%, respectively. Surgical resection was performed in 96.6% of patients (n = 960), most commonly partial pancreatectomy (44.3%) followed by pancreatoduodenectomy (31.3%) and total pancreatectomy (8.1%). In patients clinically staged as node (N 0) and distant metastasis (M 0) negative, occult pathologic lymph node involvement was found in 0% (n = 28) of patients with stage cT 1 and 0.5% (n = 185) of patients with cT 2 disease. The risk of occult nodal metastasis significantly increased to 8.9% (n = 61) for patients with cT 3 disease. The risk further increased to 50% (n = 2) in patients with cT 4 disease.

Conclusions

Herein, the specificity of excluding nodal involvement clinically is 99.5% in tumors ≤ 4 cm and 100% in tumors ≤ 2 cm. Therefore, there may be a role for close observation in patients with cT 1 N 0 lesions to mitigate morbidity from major pancreatic resection.

### Investigation of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for the diagnosis of solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas: a study associated with a national survey of solid pseudopapillary neoplasms [^62f71528]. Pancreas (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

There remain many unknown factors in the molecular mechanisms and clinical conditions of SPN. Under World Health Organization classification, SPN has low malignant potential, but metastases occur occasionally. – In a previous National Survey on SPN, we investigated the clinical pathology characteristics of 288 cases. The clinical characteristics included 5 cases (1.7%) with distant metastases, and postoperative recurrence was observed in 6 cases (2.1%); however, the 5-year survival rate was good at 98.8%, and complete resection is reported to be important for treatment. The reported pathological characteristics include a higher likelihood of degeneration such as cysts or calcification with increasing tumor diameter, whereas small tumors of 2 cm or smaller are often observed as solid tumors without these types of degeneration. Even among the 53 cases in our study, a number had tumors of 2 cm or smaller without cysts or calcification; thus, the differential diagnosis between PDC or PNEN is difficult with imaging examinations alone.

Due to extensive involvement and highly symptomatic presentation, the patient began mFOLFIRINOX chemotherapy in 2-week cycles. Serial CT chest abdomen pelvis revealed stable disease in the pancreatic primary and regional lymph nodes, with improvement in the liver lesions after 8 cycles of chemotherapy (Fig. 1B). Five target lesions were measured at baseline and cycle 8 timepoints, with a sum of the longest diameter change from 24.6 to 20.7 cm (−15.9%; stable disease). At the time of manuscript writing, the patient had remained on treatment for 34 weeks (17 cycles). Treatment-related toxicities experienced during the course of chemotherapy include grade 2 (moderate) fatigue, nausea, and dysgeusia as defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events, which led to oxaliplatin omission from cycle 9 to improve tolerance. Oxaliplatin was reintroduced in cycle 16, and side effects have been well controlled with supportive medications since.

### Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm of pancreas with long delayed liver metastasis [^f4a7b6b4]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) of the pancreas is a rare neoplasm that most commonly affects adolescent girls and young women. Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas is considered to have malignant potential; 10% to 15% of cases are associated with metastasis, and these usually present at the time of initial diagnoses. Cases with metastases after resection are rare, and all reported cases have occurred less than 5 years after resection. We report a case of SPN in a 36-year-old woman who presented with liver metastasis 15.8 years after complete resection of the primary tumor in the pancreas. To the best of our knowledge, this is the longest time interval reported between resection of primary tumor and subsequent detection of metastatic disease. Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas can present with metastases many years after resection of the primary tumor. Long-term follow-up is warranted, given the possibility of late metastasis.

SPTs of the pancreas are rare tumors that predominantly affect young women in the third decade of life and, unlike pancreatic adenocarcinoma, have a low malignant potential with surgery usually curative. The most common presentation is pain or a palpable abdominal mass, though other nonspecific symptoms can occur; SPTs are often large, with a median size of 6 cm to 7 cm, and frequently discovered incidentally. In the largest series reported, only 52 of 718 cases (7%) had a preoperative diagnosis confirmed by biopsy.

Materials and methods

Study population

The population has been described in the first phase of the CONTACT2 trial published by Napoleon et al. The inclusion criteria were as follows: diagnosis of large (≥ 20 mm) single PCL identified with CT and/or MRI with at least one cavity larger than 13 mm (to allow for CEA and cytohistopathological analyses) without evidence of communication with the main pancreatic duct, without chronic calcifying pancreatitis; no evidence of criteria for malignancy (cyst containing solid masses or mural nodules, presence of metastatic nodes, presence of distant metastases, ascites and vascular infiltration); and scheduled for a diagnostic EUS-FNA procedure. The CONTACT study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Institut Paoli Calmettes (Marseille, France), by the French Health Authority (Agence Française de Sécurité Sanitaire des Produits de Santé) and was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with the following identifier: NCT01563133. The study was performed in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All the co-authors had access to the study data and reviewed and approved the final manuscript.

Consensus on therapeutic management

Five pancreatic disease experts (three endosonographers with EUS-FNA expertise and two pancreato-biliary surgeons) from four tertiary hospitals were involved. They were independent from the CONTACT2 prospective study. A consensus to standardize the therapeutic management of patients with PCLs according to the diagnosis and its confidence level was first defined by the panel of experts as follows:
Eight diagnostic options were retained: SCA, MCN, BD-IPMN, PC, NEN, indeterminate mucinous lesion, indeterminate lesion, and other cyst types (including cystic solid pseudopapillary neoplasm, congenital pancreatic cyst, and cystic lymphoma).
Three therapeutic management options were retained: "neither surgery nor surveillance", "surveillance", or "surgery". If the diagnosis was certain, "neither surgery nor surveillance" was recommended for SCAs and PCs; surgery was recommended for MCNs and NENs; either surgery or surveillance was recommended for BD-IPMNs depending on worrisome features observed in EUS; and either surgery or surveillance was recommended for indeterminate mucinous lesions and for indeterminate lesions. The therapeutic management of other rare types of cysts relied on cyst aetiology. Confidence level modified therapeutic management. For example, surveillance instead of "neither surveillance nor surgery" was recommended for SCAs associated with fair confidence level.

### Prognostic value of progesterone receptor in solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas: evaluation of a pooled case series [^e58a45e1]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This study highlights the potential prognostic value of PR in patients with SPNP, which may help in risk stratification according to the surgical pathologic report. Although SPNP usually has a good clinical outcome, long term follow-up is necessary because of possible recurrence or metastasis. These patients should be scheduled every 1–2 months follow up visits during the first year after surgery and every 3–6 month for years after. And the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy for high risk SPNP need further confirm. There are several limitations in this study. As a retrospective study, the role of PR in SPNP requires to be investigated in a prospective validation study. The small sample size and short length of follow up precluded the difference between all other effective marker. Multicenter prospective studies with large sample size and long follow up are necessary in the future. What's more, we did not notice the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy in this study. Nevertheless, pooled analysis is essential for prediction of prognosis of rare disease. The methodology of our study could be reliable.

### European evidence-based guidelines on pancreatic cystic neoplasms [^7a0c7683]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

8.1 Is adjuvant treatment recommended for resected IPMN or MCN with associated invasive carcinoma? if yes, what is the optimal regimen?

Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy is recommended for IPMN with an associated invasive carcinoma with or without positive lymph node status, as they have more aggressive biological behaviour(GRADE 1C, strong agreement).

As for patients with pancreatic cancer, adjuvant treatment can also be recommended for patients without lymph node involvement, but there is no scientific evidence to support this.

Adjuvant treatment of MCN-associated invasive carcinoma is similar to sporadic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, although no evidence is available to support or refute this approach (GRADE 2C, strong agreement).

No specific recommendation can be given for which chemotherapy agent should be used, as there is substantial heterogeneity among studies. The most commonly used drugs are 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine, similar to adjuvant treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (GRADE 2C, strong agreement).

8.2 Is neoadjuvant treatment recommended for locally advanced carcinoma associated with an IPMN or MCN?

No recommendation can be made for neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced IPMN- or MCN-associated invasive carcinoma, as there are insufficient data (GRADE 2C, strong agreement).

Two case reports have been published, supporting the use of preoperative chemotherapy for IPMN and MCN. An approach similar to that used for patients with pancreatic cancer can be considered, given the similarities between the two diseases.

8.3 Is adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment indicated for SPN? If yes, what is the optimum regimen?

Neoadjuvant therapy for SPN is not routinely recommended, as there are no studies proving its efficacy (GRADE 2C, strong agreement).

The only data for neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy for SPN are from case reports, the majority of which report different chemotherapy regimens, and many of which were used in a palliative setting after postsurgical recurrence.

8.4 Is palliative chemotherapy recommended for non-resectable or recurrent malignant cystic tumours of the pancreas?

Systemic palliative chemotherapy for non-resectable or recurrent malignant cystic tumours may be considered as for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, although there is no evidence available to support or refute this approach(GRADE 2C, strong agreement).

Given the similarity to pancreatic cancer, palliative chemotherapy may be considered for patients with non-resectable, recurrent, or metastatic disease occurring in the setting of a malignant IPMN or MCN, analogous to pancreatic cancer.

Guidelines for pancreatic cyst management have been published by several groups. The strategy for frankly malignant cysts is clearly one of resection, whereas the management of cysts in the absence of frank malignancy remains challenging. While a cautious approach (resection) makes sense when considering the mortality rate of pancreatic cancer, surgery has its own significant mortality and morbidity to consider, especially as most resected pancreatic cysts are found to be benign.–Currently, in the absence of definitive malignancy by cytology, indications for surgery are largely based upon particular morphologic features according to International Consensus Group 2012 (Fukuoka) guidelines. Absolute indications include suspicion of mucinous cystic neoplasm, main duct-associated intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, solid pseudopapillary tumor, or presence of "high-risk stigmata" (obstructive jaundice in a patient with a cystic lesion of the pancreatic head, enhancing solid component, main pancreatic duct ≥ 10 mm). For other cyst types that may have malignant potential but no worrisome morphologic features or high-risk stigmata (eg, branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms), the general recommendation is frequent surveillance at variable intervals based on cyst size. These surveillance interval recommendations have generally been determined based upon physician gestalt, but lack supporting evidence regarding their ability to detect high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and early invasive malignancy.

### Characterizing surveillance recommendations from National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines [^8cb94e14]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Between June and July 2025, we systematically reviewed the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for solid-organ cancers in adults. Two reviewers (A.S.B. and A.K. or M.B.) independently extracted surveillance recommendations following definitive treatment and recorded their NCCN category of evidence. Recommendations were classified by stratification type (eg, risk, stage) and modality (eg, imaging, laboratory testing), and assessed for frequency, duration, and individualization to patient-specific factors. Recommendations addressing only metastatic, recurrent, or progressive disease were excluded. This study followed the Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence version 2.0 reporting guideline for quality improvement studies and was exempt from institutional review board review based on the University of California, San Francisco self-certification protocol.

### Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm: a pancreatic enigma [^14be1cb4]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas is a relatively uncommon tumor. It typically affects young women, has nonspecific clinical and radiologic manifestations, and can be readily diagnosed by ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration and histopathologic evaluation. Histologic features characteristically show loosely cohesive, relatively uniform polygonal cells surrounding delicate capillary-sized blood vessels. Other features include cytoplasmic vacuolization, finely stippled chromatin, nuclear grooving, eosinophilic hyaline globules, and degenerative changes. Almost all solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms harbor mutations in the beta-catenin gene. They stain with beta-catenin, CD10, and focally with neuroendocrine markers. Although previously considered benign, this tumor is currently considered a low-grade malignant epithelial neoplasm with low metastatic rate and high overall survival. Most patients are cured by complete surgical excision. Despite the characterization of the morphologic and molecular features of this enigmatic neoplasm, more work is needed to uncover its cell of origin and true histogenesis.

### Management of solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas: a comparison with standard pancreatic neoplasms [^f9e59a1a]. World Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs) of the pancreas are increasingly diagnosed, but the exact surgical management in terms of extent of the resection is not well defined.

Materials and Methods

Patients operated on in our hospital between January 1993 and March 2005 formed the study groups.

Results

From 659 consecutive resections for pancreatic neoplasms, 12 female patients (1.8%) with a median age of 21 years who underwent resection for (SPN) are compared with the remaining 647 pancreatic resection patients. Jaundice (SPN 0 versus PR 73%, p < 0.001) and weight loss (SPN 0 versus PR 49%, p = 0.001) occurred significantly less often. Neoplasms were distributed equally among the pancreatic head (SPN 5 out of 12 patients versus PR 88%, p < 0.001) and corpus/tail (SPN 6 out of 12 patients versus PR 8%, p < 0.001). The operative time was significantly shorter (SPN 233 min versus PR 280 min, p = 0.012), and there were significantly fewer complications (SPN 1 of 12 patients versus PR 48%, p = 0.007). The mortality was not different (SPN 0 versus PR 1.6%, p = 1.000), and the hospital stay was significantly shorter (SPN 9 days versus PR 15 days, p = 0.012). The median size of the neoplasms was significantly larger (SPN 6.9 cm versus PR 2.5 cm). The median number of lymph nodes harvested was significantly fewer (SPN 1 versus PR 6, p = 0.001), and lymph node metastases occurred significantly less often (SPN 0 versus PR 64%, p < 0.001). The 5-year survival of SPN patients was 100% and is significantly better compared with survival of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (12%, p < 0.001) and ampulla of Vater adenocarcinoma (22%, p = 0.005).

Conclusions

Patients with solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas present differently and the course of the disease is more benign. These patients can be adequately managed by pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy or spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with excellent early and long-term results.

### Prognostic factors of pancreatic tumors in children and adolescents: a population study based on the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database [^d109628c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

The role of complete surgical resection in the management of localized, resectable pancreatic tumors is underscored. The primary tumor and any surrounding lymph nodes or tissues that are impacted are to be removed during surgery. As the current standard of care, total primary resection and debulking of metastatic lesions are advised in certain tumor forms (solid pseudopapillary tumors, endocrine tumors, pancreatoblastoma). Consequently, it is not unexpected that patients who underwent surgery had much higher survival rates. Surgical resection was linked to longer survival on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio (HR) 7.88, 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.67–23.20). However, because of selection bias, surgery was predominantly performed in situations of early stage or favorable biology, it is uncertain if surgical intervention or simply being eligible for surgery is genuinely connected with improved survival. While patients who have had their lymph nodes removed seem to have a better prognosis after this treatment, it should be emphasized that the significantly enhanced survival may be due to the procedure's high prevalence in solid pseudopapillary tumors. In our analysis, chemotherapy was associated with significantly lower overall survival. This could be related to the increased use of chemotherapy in palliative care, as well as patients with advanced pancreatic tumors being unable to undergo surgery.

This study has some limitations that should be noted. Firstly, only 30% of the US population was included in the SEER database, and the database lacks information on family history or inherited disorders, both of which are known to increase the risk of pancreatic tumors. Similarly, the absence of clinical data (such as biomarkers or biopsy results) could have aided in explaining the treatment strategy. Secondly, while information on the surgical resection recipient was accessible, details on the degree of surgical resection were not. Finally, there is no recurrence information in the database, which could have helped define oncologic outcomes for this patient cohort. Therefore, further research is warranted to validate our findings.

In conclusion, pancreatic tumors represent a rare and diverse subset of neoplastic diseases in children. Neuroendocrine tumors were the most common histologic type while solid pseudopapillary tumors exhibited the most favorable prognosis. The most important predictors of survival were the SEER stage and surgery.

Results

Case presentation

A 55-year-old male presented with several months of progressive abdominal discomfort. Blood work showed cholestatic liver enzyme elevation and abdominal ultrasound demonstrated scattered heterogenous isoechoic hepatic nodules. Magnetic resonance imaging of the liver followed by multiphasic computed tomography (CT) of the pancreas identified a 4.5 cm pancreatic tail mass with peripancreatic and portal hepatic lymphadenopathy, and disseminated multifocal solid hepatic masses, the largest measuring 6.5 cm (Fig. 1A), in keeping with metastatic disease. There was no vascular involvement. CT chest showed no thoracic metastasis.

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy of the pancreatic mass was performed for pathologic evaluation, revealing solid nests and sheets of uniform cells with round to oval nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm consistent with SPN, and tumor cells were seen infiltrating into the adjacent pancreatic parenchyma (Fig. 2A–C). Immunohistochemical staining was positive for beta-catenin (nuclear and cytoplasmic; Fig. 2D) and CAM5.2, with patchy positivity for cytokeratin (CK) 20 and CDX-2. Negative stains included CK7, synaptophysin, and chromogranin. Ki-67 index was 30% (Fig. 2E). One of the liver lesions was biopsied and showed the same tumor morphology, confirming metastatic involvement from the primary pancreatic SPN. The immunohistochemical profile of the metastatic tumor was similar, with immuno-expression positive for beta-catenin, membranous E-cadherin, CK cocktail, CD99 (dot-like), and negative for the progesterone receptor, synaptophysin, and p40. Ki-67 index was also 30%.

### The nomograph predicting the recurrence of solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas: a study of the SEER database and a Chinese cohort [^a30c1e91]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) is a relatively rare pancreatic tumor first reported in 1959 by.

Franz Virginia. It was officially named as a solid pseudopapillary neoplasm by the World Health.

Organization in 2010, accounting for approximately 0.13–2.70% of all pancreatic tumors. These symptoms are nonspecific and often present as two or more symptoms. The SPN shows a cystic solid mass on radiography and diagnosis is still mainly dependent on pathological and immunohistochemical examinations. Although the disease is rare, some researches has confirmed that its prognosis is good. The clinical value of other auxiliary treatment methods is not obvious to the tumor.

A small percentage of SPN may recur or metastasize to the liver or lungs after surgery. There are few studies analyzing the factors related to its recurrence. Thus, this study is to identify recurrence factors and construct nomograph model.

### Solid pseudopapillary and malignant pancreatic tumors in childhood: a systematic review and evidence quality assessment [^a0ae3565]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

A systematic review of 32 studies reporting on 489 children with pancreatic tumors was performed. The most prevalent histologic subtype was solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) (61.3%). Pancreaticoduodenectomy was the most commonly performed operation (48%). Neoadjuvant chemo/radiotherapy was utilized in 3.9, 36.2, 25, and 27.8% of patients with SPTs, pancreatoblastomas (PBLs), neuroendocrine tumors, and exocrine carcinomas, respectively. Adjuvant chemotherapy (75.6%) and radiation (34%) were most commonly utilized in PBLs. All-cause mortality was highest in exocrine carcinomas (50%). Overall, 98.8% of patients with SPTs survived. PBL exhibited the highest recurrence rate (14.7%) within a mean of 23.5 months.

### The nomograph predicting the recurrence of solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas: a study of the SEER database and a Chinese cohort [^db181d7c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials

The patients were from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Database and our two hospitals (the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University & the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University). The International Classification of Diseases histological type ICD-O-3 code of the SPN was 8452/3.

Exclusion criteria encompassed the following: (1) no evidence of primary tumor; (2) unavailability of histological or cytological pathology records; (3) without surgery experience; (4) with synchronous metastasis. Pertinent clinicopathological data incorporated the following variables: sex, age, tumor location, tumor size, chemotherapy experience, summary stage, excisional and positive regional nodes and etc. Recurrence was defined as the reappearance of the tumor during the follow-up period after patients underwent surgery and (or) combined chemoradiotherapy. Positive regional lymph node was based on pathological examination after surgery. Chemoradiotherapy was completed when patients received chemotherapy and (or) radiotherapy. It is unclear whether chemoradiotherapy was performed preoperatively or postoperatively. Synchronous metastasis was defined as "distance" stage in the "summary stage" column of the SEER database, whereas in the external validation cohort, it was identified by the presence of hepatic or pulmonary metastases.

### Recurrence of solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas: results of a nationwide study of risk factors and treatment modalities [^1e5488c9]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas (SPPN) can relapse very late, but little is known about risk factors for recurrence and optimal treatment. We aimed to identify risk factors for recurrence and to analyze treatment modalities in all French pediatric cases of SPPN over the past 20 years.

Material and Methods

Data were collected from pediatric oncologists and surgeons, and also from adult pancreatic surgeons in order to identify late recurrences.

Results

Fifty-one patients (41 girls) were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 13.1 years [8.7–17.9]. Abdominal pain was the commonest presenting symptom (32/49, 65%). The tumor was located in the pancreatic head in 24 patients (47%). Preoperative biopsy or cytology was performed in 14 cases (28%). All patients were operated with a median of 23 days [0–163] after diagnosis. The rate of postoperative morbidity was 29%. With a median follow-up of 65 months [0.3–221], the overall and event-free survival was 100% and 71%, respectively. Seven patients (13.7%) relapsed with a median of 43 months [33–94] after initial surgery. Six were treated surgically, either alone (n = 3) or with perioperative chemotherapy (n = 2) or hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (n = 1). One patient in whom further treatment was not feasible was still alive at last news. Risk factors for recurrence were positive surgical margins (P = 0.03) and age less than 13.5 years at diagnosis (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

SPPN recurrence in this pediatric series was a rare and late event that did not undermine overall survival. Complete surgical removal of recurrent tumors appears to be the best option.

### Molecular alterations associated with metastases of solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas [^20118a03]. The Journal of Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPN) of the pancreas are rare, low-grade malignant neoplasms that metastasise to the liver or peritoneum in 10–15% of cases. They almost invariably present somatic activating mutations of CTNNB1. No comprehensive molecular characterisation of metastatic disease has been conducted to date. We performed whole-exome sequencing and copy-number variation (CNV) analysis of 10 primary SPN and comparative sequencing of five matched primary/metastatic tumour specimens by high-coverage targeted sequencing of 409 genes. In addition to CTNNB1-activating mutations, we found inactivating mutations of epigenetic regulators (KDM6A, TET1, BAP1) associated with metastatic disease. Most of these alterations were shared between primary and metastatic lesions, suggesting that they occurred before dissemination. Differently from mutations, the majority of CNVs were not shared among lesions from the same patients and affected genes involved in metabolic and pro-proliferative pathways. Immunostaining of 27 SPNs showed that loss or reduction of KDM6A and BAP1 expression was significantly enriched in metastatic SPNs. Consistent with an increased transcriptional response to hypoxia in pancreatic adenocarcinomas bearing KDM6A inactivation, we showed that mutation or reduced KDM6A expression in SPNs is associated with increased expression of the HIF1α-regulated protein GLUT1 at both primary and metastatic sites. Our results suggest that BAP1 and KDM6A function is a barrier to the development of metastasis in a subset of SPNs, which might open novel avenues for the treatment of this disease. © 2018 The Authors.

Abstract

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPN) of the pancreas are rare, low‐grade malignant neoplasms that metastasise to the liver or peritoneum in 10–15% of cases. They almost invariably present somatic activating mutations of CTNNB1. No comprehensive molecular characterisation of metastatic disease has been conducted to date. We performed whole‐exome sequencing and copy‐number variation (CNV) analysis of 10 primary SPN and comparative sequencing of five matched primary/metastatic tumour specimens by high‐coverage targeted sequencing of 409 genes. In addition to CTNNB1‐ activating mutations, we found inactivating mutations of epigenetic regulators (KDM6A, TET1, BAP1) associated with metastatic disease. Most of these alterations were shared between primary and metastatic lesions, suggesting that they occurred before dissemination. Differently from mutations, the majority of CNVs were not shared among lesions from the same patients and affected genes involved in metabolic and pro‐proliferative pathways. Immunostaining of 27 SPNs showed that loss or reduction of KDM6A and BAP1 expression was significantly enriched in metastatic SPNs. Consistent with an increased transcriptional response to hypoxia in pancreatic adenocarcinomas bearing KDM6A inactivation, we showed that mutation or reduced KDM6A expression in SPNs is associated with increased expression of the HIF1α‐regulated protein GLUT1 at both primary and metastatic sites.

### Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas: a surgical and genetic enigma [^8b0701ee]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas are rare tumors accounting for 1–2% of pancreatic exocrine neoplasms. This entity was first described by Dr. Frantz in 1959 and was defined by the World Health Organization in 1996 as "solid pseudopapillary tumor". It is most often a benign neoplasm, but 10–15% of the cases are malignant. Over the past decades, the incidence of this tumor is increasing. However, many surgeons are still unfamiliar with this neoplasm and its unique characteristics, which can lead to pitfalls in the diagnosis and treatment. The correct diagnosis of SPNP is of utmost importance since it has a low malignant potential and with the appropriate treatment, patients have a long life expectancy. There are many genetic alterations, involving various signaling pathways that have been associated with SPNP and are very important in diagnosing the tumor. The cornerstone of SPNP treatment includes surgical excision of the tumor, preserving as much pancreatic tissue as possible. We review the information in the literature regarding more organ-preserving techniques and possible clinical features that might indicate a malignant potential, thus demanding a more radical intraoperative excision.

### Endoscopic ultrasound for pancreatic cystic lesions: a narrative review [^b0b216d9]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

A comparison between AGA, IAP (2017 version)and European guidelineson diagnostic accuracy for IPMN has been reported in a recent study, finding a lower sensitivity in predicting advanced neoplasia for the AGA guidelines as compared with the IAP and European guidelines (27% vs 94% and 96%). More recently, a new publication compared both the IAP from the 2017and 2024guidelines and the ESGTCP, showing higher specificity, positive predictive value and accuracy for malignant IPMN with the newest guidelines compared with the 2017 version and the ESGTCP. This study also showed a better area under the curve (AUC) for surgical indication (AUC = 0.623) when comparing with IAP guidelines from 2017 (AUC = 0.524) and ESGTCP (AUC = 0.582); these differences were statistically significant (p = 0.008 and p < 0.001, respectively).

Mucinous cystic neoplasm

In the 2012 edition of the IAP guidelines, surgery was recommended for all MCNs. Unfortunately, these recommendations have not been updated in the subsequent version of the guidelines. According to the ESGCTP, only MCN larger than 40 mm or smaller with risk features (such as mural nodules or symptoms) should undergo a standard oncologic resection. Then, for cysts measuring < 40 mm without mural nodules or symptoms, follow-up with MRI or EUS is advised, starting every 6 months for the first year and then annually. EUS-FNA is indicated when the diagnosis is not already established. The same indications for both IPMN and MCN are suggested by AGA guidelines.

Serous cystic neoplasm

According to the ESGCTP, asymptomatic patients with radiological evidence of an SCN should be followed up for 1 year and then only symptom-based or in cases of uncertainty. When follow-up is required, the same recommendations of BD-IPMN should be followed. Surgery is recommended only for patients with compression-related symptoms. On the other hand, no recommendations for SCN are given by AGA or IAP.

Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm

Only the ACG guidelinesmention SPN management. All of them have a surgical indication. There is little evidence, but the ACG guideline recommends follow-up imaging on a yearly basis for 5 years after surgery.

### Molecular alterations associated with metastases of solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas [^8dec7453]. The Journal of Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite our sequencing cohort representing the largest analysed to date, we could not identify recurrent genetic alterations in metastatic SPNs. This may be due to either the number of cases analysed or the targeted sequencing approach, which have possibly precluded us from identifying common drivers of SPN progression. Nevertheless, this study provides the most comprehensive description, to date, of the molecular events that characterise the progression of malignancy in SPN and indicates alterations of BAP1 and KDM6A as potential drivers of metastasis in SPNs. This might have important therapeutic implication as, in other tumour types, BAP1 loss and reduced expression of KDM6A have been shown to drive malignancy through epigenetic alterations that can be pharmacologically reverted 28. Although we have provided evidence that mechanisms can be shared between different malignancies, it remains to be determined whether BAP1 and KDM6A alterations are promoting tumour growth in SPNs through a similar epigenetic mechanism. In the absence of preclinical models, this might only happen through multidimensional tumour profiling that will necessarily involve the integration of genetic and epigenetic analyses of a larger cohort of SPNs.

### Presentation and management of pancreatic cystic neoplasms [^a8c556de]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cystic neoplasms are less frequent than other pancreatic tumors, but because of the wide availability and improvement of modern imaging methods, these neoplasms are being recognized with increasing frequency and it is often possible to be differentiated preoperatively not only from other cystic pancreatic disorders but also from one another. Most patients have no symptoms while clinical signs are not really useful in the clinical work up, and when they are present, they never help us to identify the type of pathology. Treatment differs with the diagnosis. Serous cystic neoplasms are uniformly benign and usually do not mandate resection unless this lesion is symptomatic. In contrast, mucinous cystic neoplasms and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms have a premalignant or malignant tendency, and therefore should be managed aggressively by pancreatic resection; in the absence of invasive disease, prognosis is excellent after appropriate surgery, but the presence of invasive malignancy signifies a poor prognosis. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms have nonaggressive behavior and their management is related to the extension of the disease. The purpose of this article is to review the types of pancreatic cystic neoplasms, their diagnosis, indications for surgical treatment, and outcome.

### European experts consensus statement on cystic tumours of the pancreas [^5b20abf6]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Cystic lesions of the pancreas are increasingly recognized. While some lesions show benign behaviour (serous cystic neoplasm), others have an unequivocal malignant potential (mucinous cystic neoplasm, branch- and main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and solid pseudo-papillary neoplasm). European expert pancreatologists provide updated recommendations: diagnostic computerized tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging are indicated in all patients with cystic lesion of the pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasound with cyst fluid analysis may be used but there is no evidence to suggest this as a routine diagnostic method. The role of pancreatoscopy remains to be established. Resection should be considered in all symptomatic lesions, in mucinous cystic neoplasm, main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and solid pseudo-papillary neoplasm as well as in branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with mural nodules, dilated main pancreatic duct > 6mm and possibly if rapidly increasing in size. An oncological partial resection should be performed in main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and in lesions with a suspicion of malignancy, otherwise organ preserving procedures may be considered. Frozen section of the transection margin in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm is suggested. Follow up after resection is recommended for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, solid pseudo-papillary neoplasm and invasive cancer.

Non-mucinous lesions

Serous cystic neoplasm

SCNs are cysts with cuboidal or flattened glycogen-rich cells that produce a serous content (periodic acid–Schiff-positive, diastase-sensitive). They are considered benign lesions without malignant potential, and only some exceptional cases of malignant forms of cystadenocarcinoma have been reported in the literature (< 0.01%), so conservative management is recommended. Generally, SCNs have a typical morphology on EUS that allows their differentiation and confident diagnosis, but when there is diagnostic uncertainty, mainly in solid forms, a combination of B-mode with CE-EUS, elastography (with a soft pattern)and fine needle aspiration (FNA) with cystic fluid analysis could give the final diagnosis. On some occasions, mainly in microcystic forms that may appear as solid lesions, immunohistochemistry is helpful for the differential diagnosis. Neuron-specific enolase, α-inhibin and mucin-related glycoprotein (MUC1 and MUC6) are specific immunoprofiles for SCNs.

Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm

SPNs are infrequent PCLs, accounting for 1% of pancreatic neoplasms. SPNs are considered low-grade malignant lesions with low metastatic potential (15%), but surgery is indicated.

Cystic NET

cNETs represent 10%–17% of all resected pancreatic NETs (pNETs). They can be larger than solid pNETs, more symptomatic and more frequently associated with MEN-1, despite seeming to be less aggressive than solid forms. CH-EUS shows a typical behaviour, meaning rapid and intense enhancement in the early arterial phase, which is different from other solid pancreatic lesions. Recent studies have also evaluated the role of CE-EUS behaviour in predicting aggressiveness and prognosis of pNETs, although it still cannot guide clinical decisions, and further validation is still needed.

### NCCN evidence blocks [^c4707076]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2016). Low credibility.

NCCN has developed a series of Evidence Blocks: graphics that provide ratings for each recommended treatment regimen in terms of efficacy, toxicity, quality and consistency of the supporting data, and affordability. The NCCN Evidence Blocks are currently available in 10 tumor types within the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines). At a glance, patients and providers can understand how a given treatment was assessed by the NCCN Guidelines Panel and get a sense of how a given treatment may match individual needs and preferences. Robert W. Carlson, MD, CEO of NCCN, described the reasoning behind this new feature and how the tool is used, and Eric Jonasch, MD, Professor of Genitourinary Medical Oncology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and Vice Chair of the NCCN Kidney Cancer Panel, described its applicability in the management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma: today and tomorrow [^0971c9de]. The Oncologist (2011). Low credibility.

In the U.S. and Europe, clinical practice guidelines for metastatic renal cell carcinoma have undergone several revisions as a result of the introduction of molecular-targeted therapies. Recently, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the European Association of Urology (EAU) published updated guidelines to reflect these new treatment approaches that provide greater efficacy and better tolerability than the previous standard of care, cytokine therapy with interleukin-2 or interferon-α. Recommendations are classified by line of therapy, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk level for survival, and level of evidence. Although many similarities exist, levels of evidence between the NCCN and EAU guidelines have differing designations and definitions, and timing of updates varies. New research developments, such as identification of effective combinations of targeted agents, optimal regimens for sequential therapy, newly designed targeted agents, benefits in special populations, and identification of additional prognostic factors and biomarkers, will prompt continued updates and refinements of today's clinical practice guidelines, with the goal of providing physicians with the most up-to-date clinical consensus upon which to base treatment decisions. Because clinical trial populations may not represent real-life patient populations, recommendations should serve only as a guide and must be tailored to the needs of each patient.

### Laparoscopic resection of uncinate process of the pancreas [^dddc161a]. Surgical Endoscopy (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas is an uncommon but distinctive pancreatic neoplasm with low metastatic potential [1]. Therefore, whenever feasible, an organ-preserving operation should be performed. As previously reported, women with solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas may be best treated by more conservative procedures [2]. Recently, laparoscopic pancreatic resections became more common and are being performed in highly specialized centers. There are only six cases of laparoscopic resection for solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of pancreas published in the English literature and, to our knowledge, laparoscopic resection of uncinate process of the pancreas has never been reported [3–6]. This video demonstrates the technical aspects of a totally laparoscopic resection of the uncinate process of the pancreas in a patient with solid pseudopapillary neoplasm.

Methods

A 26-year-old woman with a 4-cm solid pseudopapillary pancreatic neoplasm was referred for surgical treatment. According to preoperative echoendoscopy, there was a safe margin between neoplasm and main pancreatic duct. The patient was placed in supine position with the surgeon standing between her legs. Four trocars, one 10-mm and three 5-mm, were used. At inspection, the inferior vena cava, transverse colon, duodenum, and pancreas are clearly identified. A Kocher maneuver was performed with complete exposure of pancreatic head and uncinate process. The uncinate process was dissected from the superior mesenteric vein and venous branches were divided between metallic clips or by use of laparoscopic coagulation shears (LCS; Ethicon Endo Surgery Industries, Cincinnati, OH, USA). Blood supply of the duodenum was preserved by ligature of small pancreatic branches from inferior pancreatoduodenal artery. Transection of pancreatic parenchyma was performed using laparoscopic coagulation shears, which is an effective tool for cutting the pancreas [7, 8]. Surgical specimen was removed through a suprapubic incision inside a retrieval bag. A hemostatic absorbable tissue (Surgicel; Ethicon Inc, Cincinnati, OH) was placed in the cutting pancreatic surface, and one round 19F Blake abdominal drain (Ethicon) was left in place.

Results

Operative time was 180 minutes and blood loss estimated in 40 mL with no blood transfusion. Hospital stay was 4 days. The patient did not have postoperative pancreatitis or pancreatic leakage, and the abdominal drain was removed on the tenth postoperative day. Final pathology confirmed the diagnosis of solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of pancreas with free surgical margins. The patient was well and asymptomatic 2 months after the procedure.

Conclusions

Laparoscopic resection of uncinate process of the pancreas is safe and feasible and should be considered for patients suffering from pancreatic neoplasms.

### NCCN guidelines updates: management of metastatic kidney cancer [^31dbf879]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). Medium credibility.

The NCCN Guidelines for Kidney Cancer have undergone a major shift in the risk categorization used for designating "preferred" and "other recommended" or "useful under certain circumstances" first-line treatments. In the most recent version of the guidelines, "favorable risk" is now its own risk category and "intermediate risk" and "poor risk" are combined into one category. The treatment recommendations for clear cell renal cell carcinoma are continually revised and more new options are anticipated based on encouraging results from pivotal trials. In his presentation at the NCCN 2019 Annual Conference, Dr. Jonasch described these promising findings.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) consensus definitions for resistance to combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors with targeted therapies [^b2acd100]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

This manuscript defines resistance based on clinical response (or lack thereof), drug exposure, and duration of clinical benefit (if any). The definitions fall into four main categories: (1) primary resistance, where no benefit is obtained with treatment; (2) secondary resistance, where initial clinical benefit occurs but then progression subsequently ensues; (3) resistance in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings for early-stage disease; and (4) resistance after discontinuation of therapy for metastatic disease. For resistance in the perioperative setting, the definitions assume that surgery occurs within 6 weeks after the last dose of neoadjuvant therapy and that adequate drug exposure was received during adjuvant therapy.

The majority of approved indications for anti-PD-(L)1 ICIs in combination with TT prescribe continuous administration of both agents. Therefore, primary and secondary resistance as defined in the subsequent sections of this manuscript can be assumed to be to the full combination. In scenarios where one drug is discontinued, as described in later sections of this manuscript, it may not be possible to parse resistance to monotherapy versus the full combination. In these scenarios, monoclonal antibodies (such as ICIs) were assumed to have half-lives on the order of 2–3 weeksand small molecule TKIs were assumed to have half-lives on the orders of hours to days. Additionally, although spatially and temporally distinct lineages of variant cancer cells may arise throughout the course of treatment and these subpopulations likely play an important role in the genesis of resistance, intratumoral heterogeneity is beyond the scope of these definitions.

Finally, for the purposes of this manuscript, progressive disease (PD), stable disease (SD), partial response and complete response are assessed as described in the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). For the tumors in which standard RECIST v1.1 are not commonly used (eg, glioblastoma, prostate cancer, HCC, and ovarian cancer), however, the disease-specific radiographic response criteria should be applied. Paradoxical increases in tumor size due to necrosis are a possibility with TTs. These morphological changes can be ruled out as true progression, however, using metabolic imaging or MRI, as recommended in RECIST v1.1. Atypical radiologic responses are a possibility after anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy, including apparent tumor growth followed by regression. However, pseudoprogression is rarely, if ever, observed in patients treated with ICIs in combination with TT and antiangiogenic therapies. As such, the consensus was that confirmatory scans are not required in any setting for these definitions.

### Spleen preservation in solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the distal pancreas: a single-center experience [^84aadaac]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs) are rare tumors of the pancreas that are typically low-grade but may carry malignant potential. While concurrent splenectomy is recommended for oncologic resection of malignant distal pancreas tumors, this is not well-described for SPN. This study evaluates the outcomes of spleen preservation for distal pancreas SPN.

Methods

A retrospective review was conducted for adult patients with SPN who underwent surgical resection at a single tertiary center (2010–2023). Distal tumors were located within the pancreatic body or tail. Patient factors and outcomes were compared between those who underwent spleen-preserving (SP) versus nonspleen-preserving (NSP) distal pancreatectomy.

Results

In total, 52 patients underwent surgery for SPN. Thirty six had localized distal pancreatic tumors and underwent distal/subtotal pancreatectomy: 25 (69%) were SP and 11 (31%) were NSP. Overall, median age was 31 y, 86% were female, and 61% were symptomatic at diagnosis. Median tumor size (4.9 cm SP versus 6.0 cm NSP, P = 0.469) and number of lymph nodes examined (6 SP versus 11 NSP, P = 0.241) were similar. The majority of SP operations were completed minimally invasively via laparoscopic or robotic approaches (84% SP versus 36% NSP, P = 0.008). There was no difference in operative time, complications, length of stay, or readmission between groups. Neither cohort had recurrence of SPN at median follow-up of 3 y.

Conclusions

SP pancreatectomy can be performed safely for distal SPN with excellent long-term oncologic outcomes. This technique may be achieved minimally invasively and should be considered for localized SPN in the body or tail of the pancreas.

### NCCN roundtable: what are the characteristics of an optimal clinical practice guideline? [^eb711cfa]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2015). Low credibility.

Much has changed in the treatment of cancer since the first NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) were rolled out for 8 different tumor types in November 1996. NCCN Guidelines now include involved algorithms often containing multiple treatment alternatives and detailed pathways of care that depend on more-specific patient characteristics and molecular tumor diagnostics. With 47 different individual NCCN panels, all members of the cancer care team are now better informed than ever to guide patients through the often complex decision-making required to improve the odds of successful outcomes. At the NCCN 20th Annual Conference, a distinguished panel assembled to take a closer look at these invaluable clinical practice guidelines, first glancing backward to how it all started and then forward to explore the key ingredients of trustworthy guidelines.

### Evolving trends towards minimally invasive surgery for solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms [^9ec5147b]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms are rare pancreatic neoplasms with low malignant potential that predominantly arise in young women. We sought to characterize this population and the evolving trend at our institution towards laparoscopic management.

Methods

We identified all patients at our institution that were surgically treated for solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm from 2008–2015. Demographic and clinical information were queried from the medical record, and descriptive statistics were performed. Student's t test and chi-square analysis were used for comparison where appropriate.

Results

We identified 11 women and 1 man (average age 26 years; range 14–48 years) who were surgically treated for solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms; 5 with distal pancreatectomy (4 open, 1 laparoscopic), 6 with pancreaticoduodenectomy (3 open, 3 laparoscopic), and 1 open enucleation. From 2008 to 2013, seven of eight (87%) procedures were performed open. Since 2014, three of four (75%) procedures have successfully been completed laparoscopically (see video clips). Length of stay was similar for patients who had open versus laparoscopic procedures (8 vs. 9 days, p = 0.61). Two-thirds of patients (5/8) who had open procedures experienced postoperative complications compared with half (2/4) of patients who had laparoscopic procedures (p = 0.28). There have been no recurrences.

Conclusions

Minimally invasive surgical management of solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms is becoming more popular, can be performed safely, and appears to have comparable outcomes to an open approach. Quality of life is an important metric for this relatively young population and may be improved with a laparoscopic approach, which warrants further investigation.

### Summary of the standards, options and recommendations for the management of patients with carcinoma of unknown primary site (2002) [^415e2c91]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Carcinomas of unknown primary site are metastatic malignant epithelial tumours whose primary site cannot be identified during pretreatment assessment. They are characterised by their slow local development and their high metastatic potential. The primary site remains unknown in 20–50% of the patients, but the results from autopsies show that the primary tumours are most often located in the pancreas, lung, gut or kidney.

In France, the incidence of carcinomas of unknown primary site is eight out of 100 000 per year, corresponding to between 5 and 7% of the solid tumours in adults. The average age at detection is 60 years old, with slightly more men being affected. The median survival time is only a few months.

The heterogeneity of carcinoma of unknown primary site is due to the different histopathological types and anatomical localisations, making this a difficult topic to cover. In this document, we present the diagnostic strategy based on these two parameters, with the first entry point being the histopathological type. The therapeutic strategies to be used depend on the prognostic factors: specific anatomoclinical entities (neuroendocrine tumours, cervical lymph node metastases from squamous cell carcinoma, axillary lymph node metastases from an adenocarcinoma in women, undifferentiated carcinoma of the mediastinum in young men) and other nonspecific situations. Although primary papillary serous carcinoma is no longer included in the classification of peritoneum carcinomas of unknown primary site, we covered the management in women here in an attempt to be exhaustive.

### Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas in a young pediatric patient: a case report and systematic review of the literature [^6596b7f6]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs) are the most common pediatric pancreatic tumor; however, most data in children are extrapolated from adults. This study describes a young presentation of SPN in a 5-year-old girl and presents a comprehensive systematic review of the literature regarding SPNs in children. A systematic review was performed using PubMed and Embase for all articles in English using predetermined search terms, including "solid pseudopapillary neoplasm" and "pediatric" and historical terms for SPN. A total of 523 pediatric patients were identified in 135 articles. Eighty-three percent of patients were female, and median age was 13.6 years. Abdominal pain was the most frequent presenting symptom (78%), and median tumor size was 8.2 cm. The pancreatic head was involved in 46% of cases. Computed tomographic scan was the most common imaging modality (87%), and 61% were diagnosed by fine needle aspiration. Surgical resection was reported in 507 patients, with a complication rate of 21.1% reported in 393 patients. Only 3.8% received adjuvant therapy, and 6.7% had recurrent disease. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas are rare tumors in childhood. Male sex and pancreatic head involvement are seen more often in children than in adults. Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment with excellent results.

### Consensus guideline for the management of peritoneal metastases from neuroendocrine neoplasms [^a5b43072]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) with peritoneal metastases (PM) represent a complex clinical challenge due to low incidence and heterogeneous phenotypes. This manuscript describes the results of a national consensus aimed at addressing clinical management of patients with NEN-PM.

Methods

An update of the 2018 Chicago consensus guidelines was conducted using a modified Delphi technique, encompassing two rounds of voting. The levels of agreement for various pathway blocks were assessed. Key systemic therapy concepts were summarized by content experts. Supporting evidence was evaluated via a rapid literature review.

Results

Overall, the level of evidence for the management of PM in this disease was universally low. In total, 107 participants responded in the first round, with 88/107 (82%) participating in the second round. Strong consensus (> 90%) was achieved in 5/7 (71%) and 7/7 (100%) blocks in rounds I and II respectively. A multidisciplinary approach including psychosocial and wellness assessments received a strong positive recommendation. Management of NENs with PM was organized according to disease grade and symptom profiles. In grade 1 and 2 well-differentiated NENs, cytoreductive surgery (CRS) received strong support (> 95%) following the management of functional syndromes (if present). For grade 3 well-differentiated NENs, systemic therapy is the primary recommendation, with surgical resection considered in select cases.

Conclusion

Given limited evidence, the consensus-driven clinical pathway offers vital clinical guidance for the management on NENs with PM. The need for high-quality evidence remains critical to the field.

### Childhood pancreatic cancer treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^9eb3f0d7]. NCI (2019). Medium credibility.

Treatment of Solid Pseudopapillary Tumor of the Pancreas The outcomes of patients with solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas are excellent, with 10-year survival rates exceeding 95%. Treatment options for solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas include the following: Surgery Treatment of solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas is primarily surgical. However, preoperative and operative spillage is not unusual. Whipple procedures are often necessary, but non-Whipple, pancreatic-sparing resections may be possible with a pancreatico-jejunostomy procedure. Surgery is usually curative, although local recurrences occur in 5% to 15% of cases. Chemotherapy Single-agent gemcitabine is reportedly effective in cases of unresectable or metastatic disease. Metastatic disease, usually in the liver, may occur in up to 15% of cases.

Chemotherapy For large, unresectable, or metastatic tumors, preoperative chemotherapy is indicated. Pancreatoblastoma often responds to chemotherapy. A cisplatin-based regimen is usually recommended. The PLADO regimen, which includes cisplatin and doxorubicin, is most commonly used. Treatment is modeled after the management of hepatoblastoma, with two to three cycles of preoperative therapy, followed by resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with relapsed or persistent pancreatoblastoma have responded to treatment with gemcitabine and vinorelbine and oral cyclophosphamide. Clinical Presentation, Risk Factors, and Diagnosis The most common type of functioning islet cell tumor is insulinoma, followed by gastrinoma. Treatment of Islet Cell Tumors Treatment options for islet cell tumors include the following:

- Surgery.
- Chemotherapy.
- Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor therapy.

Treatment of islet cell tumors includes medical therapy for control of the syndrome and complete surgical resection. For patients with malignant tumors and unresectable or metastatic disease, chemotherapy and mTOR inhibitors are recommended. The management of these tumors in children follows the consensus guidelines established for adult patients. For more information, see Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors Treatment.

Biopsy of primary vs metastatic site

The purpose of the biopsy in high-grade NENs is to secure the diagnosis, assess the proliferation index (especially in G3 NET), assign site of origin if possible (in metastases of unknown primary), and identify clinically actionable molecular genetic events. Biopsy of either primary or metastatic tumor should achieve these goals and there was consensus that a biopsy of both the primary and a metastasis is not necessary. As systemic and biologic therapies are directed at metastatic disease, this is theoretically the optimal tissue to target, though most oncogenic drivers are stable in matched primary-metastatic pairs. In general, there is no reason to re-biopsy NEC on disease progression as this does not generally change management (majority). It is reasonable to re-biopsy G3 NET patients, particularly if there is an escalation in the pace of the disease or if one lesion seems to be growing faster than others and the majority of the group agreed with this approach as it may impact treatment selection. It is very unusual for G3 NET to transform to NEC although there is consensus that this would certainly change how a patient would be managed.

Summary of recommendations

High-grade NENs include both G3 NET and NEC and Ki-67 IHC is indispensable to NET grading and is prognostic and predictive in NEC. Mutant-pattern p53 staining and/or Rb loss generally support a diagnosis of NEC over G3 NET. Biopsy of either primary or metastatic tumor is sufficient for diagnosis and biomarker testing.

Imaging

Anatomical imaging

Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) all have well-established roles for imaging NENs with CT, particularly multiphase CT, being the cornerstone of neuroendocrine imaging. This modality is well suited for the identification of the primary tumor, staging, and for response assessments, but multiple studies have also shown that key characteristics can be used to differentiate high-grade lesions from their low or intermediate counterparts. Among characteristics associated with G3 lesions are larger size, ill-defined features, portal and arterial enhancement and textural analysis to name a few. For pancreatic primaries, larger tumor size and main pancreatic duct obstruction are associated with G2/G3 tumors. Multiphase MRI is an acceptable alternative with advantages including the lack of ionizing radiation and better soft-tissue contrast than CT. As with CT, a variety of MRI features have been shown to differentiate grade, including the apparent diffusion coefficient and diffusion-weighted imaging.

### Somatic genomic testing in patients with metastatic or advanced cancer: ASCO provisional clinical opinion [^e99a59ab]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

ASCO Provisional Clinical Opinion — Section 1, multigene panel–based genomic sequencing, states that for patients with metastatic or advanced solid tumors with adequate performance status, genomic testing should be performed when there are genomic biomarker–linked therapies approved by regulatory agencies for their cancer or when considering a treatment for which there are specific genomic biomarker–based contraindications or exclusions (strength of recommendation: strong). For patients with metastatic or advanced solid tumors, genomic testing using multigene genomic sequencing is preferred whenever patients are eligible for a genomic biomarker–linked therapy that a regulatory agency has approved (strength of recommendation: moderate), and multigene panel–based genomic testing should be used whenever more than one genomic biomarker is linked to a regulatory agency–approved therapy (strength of recommendation: strong). If the genomic sequencing results are used to inform clinical care, such testing must be performed in an appropriately certified laboratory (strength of recommendation: strong), and clinical decision making should incorporate (1) the known or predicted impact of a specific genomic alteration on protein expression or function and (2) clinical data on the efficacy of targeting that genomic alteration with a particular agent (strength of recommendation: strong). Germline testing for genetic alterations linked to approved therapies should be performed in patients with metastatic or advanced solid tumors considered for such treatment and should not be limited by family history–based or clinical criteria used for familial risk assessment; patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants should be referred for genetic counseling for education about secondary cancer risks, possible inheritance of germline mutations among blood relatives, and the differences between germline and somatic mutations, if they did not receive pretest counseling (strength of recommendation: strong). Germline testing and genetic counseling may still be needed in patients with personal or family histories suggestive of an inherited predisposition, even when no germline alterations are identified during tumor genomic sequencing using various sequencing panels.

### Expert consensus practice recommendations of the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society for the management of high grade gastroenteropancreatic and gynecologic neuroendocrine neoplasms [^3aacf44a]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

High-grade neuroendocrine neoplasms are a rare disease entity and account for approximately 10% of all neuroendocrine neoplasms. Because of their rarity, there is an overall lack of prospectively collected data available to advise practitioners as to how best to manage these patients. As a result, best practices are largely based on expert opinion. Recently, a distinction was made between well-differentiated high-grade (G3) neuroendocrine tumors and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas, and with this, pathologic details, appropriate imaging practices and treatment have become more complex. In an effort to provide practitioners with the best guidance for the management of patients with high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and gynecologic system, the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society convened a panel of experts to develop a set of recommendations and a treatment algorithm that may be used by practitioners for the care of these patients. Here, we provide consensus recommendations from the panel on pathology, imaging practices, management of localized disease, management of metastatic disease and surveillance and draw key distinctions as to the approach that should be utilized in patients with well-differentiated G3 neuroendocrine tumors vs poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas.

### Metastatic pancreatic cancer: ASCO guideline update [^c15559b3]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Rationale for 2020 update and regulatory context — This 2020 update was triggered by new evidence for poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib as an option for maintenance therapy after first-line treatment, as well as new studies of tissue agnostic agents that target fusions of the neurotrophin tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) 1/2/3 genes, and the Expert Panel considered that these newer agents have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the target population.

### Special treatment issues in lung cancer: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^d936bdfe]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Background

This chapter of the guidelines addresses patients who have particular forms of non-small cell lung cancer that require special considerations. This includes patients with Pancoast tumors, T4N0,1M0 tumors, satellite nodules in the same lobe, synchronous and metachronous multiple primary lung cancers (MPLCs), solitary brain and adrenal metastases, and chest wall involvement.

Methods

The nature of these special clinical cases is such that in most cases, metaanalyses or large prospective studies of patients are not available. For ensuring that these guidelines were supported by the most current data available, publications that were appropriate to the topics covered in this chapter were obtained by performance of a literature search of the MEDLINE computerized database. When possible, we also referenced other consensus opinion statements. Recommendations were developed by the writing committee, graded by a standardized method (see "Methodology for Lung Cancer Evidence Review and Guideline Development" chapter), and reviewed by all members of the lung cancer panel before approval by the Thoracic Oncology NetWork, Health and Science Policy Committee, and the Board of Regents of the American College of Chest Physicians.

Results

In patients with a Pancoast tumor, a multimodality approach seems to be optimal, involving chemoradiotherapy and surgical resection, provided appropriate staging has been conducted. Patients with central T4 tumors that do not have mediastinal node involvement are uncommon. Such patients, however, seem to benefit from resection as part of the treatment as opposed to chemoradiotherapy alone when carefully staged and selected. Patients with a satellite lesion in the same lobe as the primary tumor have a good prognosis and require no modification of the approach to evaluation and treatment than what would be dictated by the primary tumor alone. However, it is difficult to know how best to treat patients with a focus of the same type of cancer in a different lobe. Although MPLCs do occur, the survival results after resection for either a synchronous presentation or a metachronous presentation with an interval of < 4 years between tumors are variable and generally poor, suggesting that many of these patients may have had a pulmonary metastasis rather than a second primary lung cancer. A thorough and careful evaluation of these patients is warranted to try to differentiate between patients with a metastasis and a second primary lung cancer, although criteria to distinguish them have not been defined. Selected patients with a solitary focus of metastatic disease in the brain or adrenal gland seem to benefit substantially from resection. This is particularly true in patients with a long disease-free interval. Finally, in patients with chest wall involvement, as long as tumors can be completely resected and there is absence of N2 nodal involvement, primary surgical treatment should be considered.

Conclusions

Carefully selected patients may benefit from an aggressive surgical approach.

### Neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^a27f4071]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

MEN1 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors — management emphasizes selective surgery and observation. Observation can be considered for non-functioning, indolent tumors. Surgical resection should be considered in cases of symptomatic functional tumors refractory to medical management, a tumor > 2 cm in size, or a tumor with a relatively rapid rate of growth over 6 to 12 months, and the Panel recommends endoscopy with EUS prior to pancreatic surgery to preoperatively assess and localize tumors. For clinically significant progressive disease or symptomatic patients, treatment options are as for metastatic disease in the sporadic setting.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: gastrointestinal stromal tumors, version 2.2022 [^374a53a8]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastrointestinal stromal tumors - NCCN, more specifically with respect to management of resectable disease (adjuvant therapy), NCCN 2022 guidelines recommend to consider gross residual disease (R2 resection) or preoperative/intraoperative tumor rupture as metastatic disease. Recognize that some stratification schemes have included tumor rupture, which is associated with a much higher risk of recurrence.

General treatment of carcinoma of unknown primary site not belonging to a specific anatomoclinical entity.

Locoregional treatment: Patients with a single metastatic site can be offered specific treatment (option, expert agreement).

Systemic treatment: Several treatments can be envisaged (options): chemotherapy (level of evidence: B2), symptomatic treatment only, or a treatment based on bisphosphonates in patients with bone metastases. If chemotherapy is prescribed, it is recommended to administer a combination therapy with two drugs, containing cisplatin (recommendation, expert agreement) for patients with a good general health status (WHO performance status of 1 or less). The treatment response should be evaluated early (after two cycles) to avoid treatment in patients with known progressive disease (recommendation).

### Bone cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^b73f4179]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Bone Cancer — Biomarker-directed systemic therapy is outlined as follows: For MSI-H/dMMR tumors, Preferred pembrolizumab is listed. For TMB-H (≥ 10 mutations/megabase) tumors, Useful in Certain Circumstances options include pembrolizumab and ipilimumab + nivolumab. Pembrolizumab is a systemic treatment option for adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic, MSI-high (MSI-H) or MMR deficient (dMMR) solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. Not for giant cell tumor of bone. Consider MGPT with a validated and/or FDA-approved assay to determine targeted therapy opportunities. TMB testing is recommended for patients with unresectable or metastatic tumors who have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. Not for giant cell tumor of bone. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.
