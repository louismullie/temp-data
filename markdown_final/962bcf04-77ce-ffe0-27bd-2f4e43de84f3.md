## Question

A teacher teaches 5 periods a day and works 24 days a month. He is paid $5 per period. if he has been working for 6 months now how much has he earned in total?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much a teacher earns in total over 6 months, given 5 periods per day, 24 working days per month, and $5 per period. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the daily earnings. Then, I should verify the monthly earnings. Next, I will calculate the 6‑month total. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and consider whether any assumptions need clarification, like whether the 24 days already account for weekends and holidays or if there are any unpaid days to consider.

> Let me first confirm the daily earnings. At 5 periods per day and $5 per period, that is 5 × 5 = $25 per day, which seems straightforward.

> Wait, let me verify the monthly earnings before moving on. If the teacher works 24 days per month, then 24 days × $25 per day equals $600 per month, so the monthly gross is $600.

> I will now examine the 6‑month total. Six months at $600 per month is 6 × 600 = $3,600, so the total earnings over 6 months would be $3,600.

> Hold on, I should verify the arithmetic one more time to avoid a mistake. 5 periods × $5 = $25 per day; 24 days × $25 = $600 per month; 6 months × $600 = $3,600. Yes, that checks out.

> But wait, what if the 24 days per month already excludes weekends and holidays, and there are no unpaid leave deductions mentioned? The calculation assumes the teacher is paid for exactly 24 days each month for 6 months at the stated per‑period rate; if there are unpaid days or different pay structures, the total would change, but based on the information given, the total is $3,600.

---

The teacher earns **$3,600** in total over 6 months. This is calculated as 5 periods/day × $5/period × 24 days/month × 6 months = **$3,600**.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

| **Step** | **Description** | **Calculation** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Periods per day | 5 periods |
| 2 | Pay per period | $5 |
| 3 | Working days per month | 24 days |
| 4 | Number of months | 6 months |
| 5 | Total earnings | 5 × $5 × 24 × 6 = **$3,600** |

---

## Final answer

The teacher has earned a total of **$3,600** over 6 months.

### Organisational interventions for improving wellbeing and reducing work-related stress in teachers [^d6e90b27]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The teaching profession is an occupation with a high prevalence of work-related stress. This may lead to sustained physical and mental health problems in teachers. It can also negatively affect the health, wellbeing and educational attainment of children, and impose a financial burden on the public budget in terms of teacher turnover and sickness absence. Most evaluated interventions for the wellbeing of teachers are directed at the individual level, and so do not tackle the causes of stress in the workplace. Organisational-level interventions are a potential avenue in this regard.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of organisational interventions for improving wellbeing and reducing work-related stress in teachers.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ASSIA, AEI, BEI, BiblioMap, DARE, DER, ERIC, IBSS, SSCI, Sociological Abstracts, a number of specialist occupational health databases, and a number of trial registers and grey literature sources from the inception of each database until January 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs, and controlled before-and-after studies of organisational-level interventions for the wellbeing of teachers.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

Four studies met the inclusion criteria. They were three cluster-randomised controlled trials and one with a stepped-wedge design.Changing task characteristicsOne study with 961 teachers in eight schools compared a task-based organisational change intervention along with stress management training to no intervention. It found a small reduction at 12 months in 10 out of 14 of the subscales in the Occupational Stress Inventory, with a mean difference (MD) varying from -3.84 to 0.13, and a small increase in the Work Ability Index (MD 2.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.64 to 2.90; 708 participants, low-quality evidence).Changing organisational characteristicsTwo studies compared teacher training combined with school-wide coaching support to no intervention. One study with 59 teachers in 43 schools found no significant effects on job-related anxiety (MD -0.25 95% CI -0.61 to 0.11, very low-quality evidence) or depression (MD -0.26 95% CI -0.57 to 0.05, very low-quality evidence) after 24 months. The other study with 77 teachers in 18 schools found no significant effects on the Maslach Burnout Inventory subscales (e.g. emotional exhaustion subscale: MD -0.05 95% CI -0.52 to 0.42, low-quality evidence) or the Teacher Perceived Emotional Ability subscales (e.g. regulating emotions subscale: MD 0.11 95% CI -0.11 to 0.33, low-quality evidence) after six months.Multi-component interventionOne study with 1102 teachers in 34 schools compared a multi-component intervention containing performance bonus, job promotion opportunities and mentoring support to a matched-comparison group consisting of 300 schools. It found moderately higher teacher retention rates (MD 11.50 95% CI 3.25 to 19.75 at 36 months follow-up, very low-quality evidence). However, the authors reported results only from one cohort out of four (eight schools), demonstrating a high risk of reporting bias.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low-quality evidence that organisational interventions lead to improvements in teacher wellbeing and retention rates. We need further evaluation of the effects of organisational interventions for teacher wellbeing. These studies should follow a complex-interventions framework, use a cluster-randomised design and have large sample sizes.

### Academic outcomes 2 years after working memory training for children with low working memory: a randomized clinical trial [^c7168c3b]. JAMA Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Working memory training may help children with attention and learning difficulties, but robust evidence from population-level randomized controlled clinical trials is lacking.

Objective

To test whether a computerized adaptive working memory intervention program improves long-term academic outcomes of children 6 to 7 years of age with low working memory compared with usual classroom teaching.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Population-based randomized controlled clinical trial of first graders from 44 schools in Melbourne, Australia, who underwent a verbal and visuospatial working memory screening. Children were classified as having low working memory if their scores were below the 15th percentile on either the Backward Digit Recall or Mister X subtest from the Automated Working Memory Assessment, or if their scores were below the 25th percentile on both. These children were randomly assigned by an independent statistician to either an intervention or a control arm using a concealed computerized random number sequence. Researchers were blinded to group assignment at time of screening. We conducted our trial from March 1, 2012, to February 1, 2015; our final analysis was on October 30, 2015. We used intention-to-treat analyses.

Intervention

Cogmed working memory training, comprising 20 to 25 training sessions of 45 minutes' duration at school.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Directly assessed (at 12 and 24 months) academic outcomes (reading, math, and spelling scores as primary outcomes) and working memory (also assessed at 6 months); parent-, teacher-, and child-reported behavioral and social-emotional functioning and quality of life; and intervention costs.

Results

Of 1723 children screened (mean [SD] age, 6.9 [0.4] years), 226 were randomized to each arm (452 total), with 90% retention at 1 year and 88% retention at 2 years; 90.3% of children in the intervention arm completed at least 20 sessions. Of the 4 short-term and working memory outcomes, 1 outcome (visuospatial short-term memory) benefited the children at 6 months (effect size, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.25-0.62]) and 12 months (effect size, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.28-0.70]), but not at 24 months. There were no benefits to any other outcomes; in fact, the math scores of the children in the intervention arm were worse at 2 years (mean difference, -3.0 [95% CI, -5.4 to -0.7]; P=.01). Intervention costs were A$1035 per child.

Conclusions and Relevance

Working memory screening of children 6 to 7 years of age is feasible, and an adaptive working memory training program may temporarily improve visuospatial short-term memory. Given the loss of classroom time, cost, and lack of lasting benefit, we cannot recommend population-based delivery of Cogmed within a screening paradigm.

### The impact of worksite clinics on teacher health care utilization and cost, self-reported health status, and student academic achievement growth in a public school district [^9929b5be]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to examine the impact of worksite clinics on health care utilization and cost, self-reported health status, and student achievement growth in a public school district.

Methods

We used insurance claims, health risk assessment, and student achievement growth data for active teachers during 2007 to 2015. A difference-in-differences approach was applied to measure the impact of worksite clinics.

Results

Compared with using a community-based clinic as the usual source of primary care, using a worksite clinic was associated with significantly lower inpatient admissions (53 vs 31 per 1000 teacher years), annual health care cost ($5043 vs $4298 in 2016 US dollars, a difference of $62 per teacher per month), and annual absent work hours (63 vs 61). No significant differences were detected in self-reported health status or student achievement growth.

Conclusion

Worksite clinics reduce teacher health care cost and absenteeism.

### School readiness [^86aa658f]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

School readiness—economic returns of preschool education indicate substantial long-term benefits: A California model estimated a $7000 net present-value benefit per child, with a return of $2.62 for every $1 invested and an annual return rate of 10% over 60 years. For the Perry Preschool Program, a real return on investment, adjusted for inflation, of 16%, with at least 75% of benefits going to the general public was reported, and the benefit/cost ratio was greater than 8:1. Benefits persisted to age 40, with higher employment (76% vs 56%), more earning over $20 000 dollars per year (60% vs 40%), and fewer arrested more than 5 times (36% vs 55%) in the program group.

### Can improving working memory prevent academic difficulties? A school based randomised controlled trial [^e8e6bc9d]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Economic evaluation

The economic evaluation of the intervention will be a two-stage analysis. We will use cost-consequences analysis as a first step to compare any incremental costs of the intervention (costs accrued in the intervention arm, from intervention and resource use over the period of follow-up, compared to costs accrued in the control arm) to all primary and secondary outcomes, expressed in their natural units of measurement. We will then proceed to cost-effectiveness analysis to compare incremental costs to difference in the WRAT4, the pre-specified primary outcome of academic achievement.

All analyses will be conducted from health and education service, as well as the broader societal, perspectives, as interventions cost-effective from a service perspective can add substantially to family costs. Research assistants will prospectively record resources used in screening and intervention delivery. Parents will retrospectively recall service use over the previous year at recruitment, 12 and 24 months. Parental recall of child service, financial and time resource use over periods up to one year can capture family resource use inside and outside the formal health care sector. Measured resource use will be valued using existing unit cost estimates (e.g. education department salary scales, Medical Benefit Schedule fee rates). Uncertainty in cost and outcome data and sensitivity of economic evaluation results to chosen methods of evaluation will be tested by extensive sensitivity analyses.

Measurement training - face to face measures

Measurement training will be conducted by other research staff at the Centre for Community Child Health who have previously used the measure. The training will involve familiarisation with the assessment components, how they are delivered and scoring. Role plays will be conducted to allow for mock assessments to be conducted in the presence of the trainer. Staff will observe the assessments being used either in a clinic or as part of another research project. In addition, the first assessment conducted by each staff member will be observed by a more experienced member of the research team. A fortnightly meeting will be conducted to ensure assessment fidelity and to troubleshoot any issues which may arise from the assessments.

### Storylines of family medicine XI: professional identity formation-nurturing one's own story [^8ea18f5a]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Day in and day out, we are being taught and learning how to teach. Our patients, our colleagues, our staff members and our learners—they are all our teachers, as are the structures of medical school, residency training and society. How we translate to others all we have learnt and are learning, how we package the thousands of lessons, big and small, in support of others—that is our task in return.

Being a teacher is a constant process of humility and growth so that we can give the best we have to our learners at each juncture. It is learning new methods and being open to learning new words, new ways and new futures—and given the current circumstances around the world of medicine, change is about the only thing teachers can bank on. By teaching, we will never be alone, we will never be stagnant. Teaching is a way to be alive and active, always learning, as much at the end of our careers as at the beginning (figure 5).

### Welfare-to-work interventions and their effects on the mental and physical health of lone parents and their children [^ea92dc50]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Income and earnings

Nine studies reported measures of income. CJF 2002, FTP 2000, MFIP 2000 and New Hope 1999 reported total average income for the year of data collection. IWRE 2002 reported income for the month prior to the survey annualised to represent the previous year's income. IFIP 2002 and NEWWS 2001 reported average income in the month prior to the survey. SSP Applicants 2003 and SSP Recipients 2002 reported average income per month in the six months prior to data collection. At 60 months, NEWWS 2001 also reported total income for years 1 to 5. Income included earnings, food stamps, supplements provided by the intervention and AFDC/TANF payments. IWRE 2002, New Hope 1999, SSP Applicants 2003 and SSP Recipients 2002 also included earned income tax credit (EITC) in the total income figure.

Eleven studies reported a measure of earnings. CJF 2002, MFIP 2000, New Hope 1999, SSP Applicants 2003, SSP Recipients 2002 and UK ERA 2011 reported average total earnings for the year prior to the survey. IWRE 2002 reported annualised earnings in the month prior to the survey. California GAIN 1994 reported average weekly earnings since randomisation, and IFIP 2002 reported average earnings in the month prior to the survey. NEWWS 2001 reported total earnings for years 1 to 5. FTP 2000 did not report earnings directly, but we calculated this by subtracting income from AFDC/TANF and food stamps from the figure for total income.

Many of the interventions included either an earned income disregard or a financial supplement in order to make work pay and ease the transition from welfare to work. Most of these were time limited, with limits ranging from 21 to 36 months (although extensions were often available for people with particular difficulties). Where earned income was disregarded, respondents could claim welfare while earning at much higher levels than previously. However, the periods while working and claiming welfare counted towards the respondent's lifetime limit on welfare receipt. While supplements or disregards were being paid, respondents' total income could increase even if their earned income was low. Obviously when time limits were reached, this effect ceased. In all cases, time limits were reached during the period defined as T2 (24 to 48 months). A number of studies also reported total earnings. We extracted both measures in order to investigate the relationship between earned and total income.

### The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the incredible years® teacher classroom management programme in primary school children: results of the STARS cluster randomised controlled trial [^1911c01d]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Children in the intervention arm were exposed to TCM strategies for a relatively short duration; teachers in our parallel process evaluation anticipated larger effects in subsequent years when they could apply the skills gained from TCM training during their planning and from the outset of the academic year (Ford et al.). The impact of the intervention might arguably increase in the year after the teacher attended the course, which we were unable to asses as our trial design followed the children rather than the teacher. As most effective universal programmes employ a whole school approach (Greenberg and Abenavoli,), training all school staff to use the same strategies might amplify and sustain any initial impact on children's mental health that training a single teacher might have, as children could then benefit from the intervention throughout their school years. Both questions should be addressed empirically by training more than one member of staff per school and by following the children subsequently taught by these staff in the year after they have accessed the course. The North Carolina trial randomised 4–14 teachers per school from Kindergarten, First and Second Grade (4–7 years) to TCM immediately (n = 45) or the following year (n = 46). The study involved 1192 pupils, and selected across 3-year groups, but may have introduced contamination between arms since every school had at least one class allocated to the intervention (Murray et al.)

The small but sustained effects on disruptive behaviour (PBQ) and inattention/hyperactivity (SDQ) across all three follow-ups are interesting and warrant replication. The PBQ was used because it examines low-level disruption in the classroom, whilst the SDQ behaviour scale taps a broader range of more severe antisocial behaviours (fighting, disobedience, tantrums, lying and stealing), which may explain the lack of change in the latter. More than 40% of secondary school children reported in a survey that their classroom was too noisy to work in (Wilson et al.), while overactivity/inattentive traits predict poorer academic attainment at GCSE (Stergiakouli et al.). Children in poorly managed classrooms observe that disruptive behaviour commands staff attention, which may amplify later disruptive behaviour and disengagement from school with its attendant risks to health and education. Teacher training and professional development might usefully explore how classroom management style may influence children's mental health as well as their behaviour and attainment.

### My first year in academic practice: If I could turn back time, what I would Do differently-10 years later [^b45db2d9]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2015). Low credibility.

"Joining a practice for the first time after training, whether in academia or the private sector is fraught with challenges and a learning curve. Postgraduate education has not sufficiently taught anyone how to manage the nuances of this new arena, or completely how to become successful. Success is not solely a function measured by reportable taxable income. Respect by colleagues, patients, partners, and staff are just as important, if not more so, and the financial attributes will be realized if the tangibles and intangibles discussed are appropriately executed in the correct environment." Although the preceding statements were made as reflecting on the first year of practice, they hold true 10 years later, and always. This article discusses what can be learned from a decade of "doing" even when having "planned well." Some concepts that have not changed are maintained throughout, some have been updated from experience, and some have been completely changed. Just remember, what you do should be dynamic and adaptable over time, but the principles, if sound from the start, never change.

### The cumulative, timing-specific, and enduring associations between student-teacher relationships and early elementary outcomes [^2750be23]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

Analytic strategy

All analyses were conducted using a regression framework in Stata. Robust standard errors were used to address violations of normality and full information maximum likelihood estimation was used to address missing data, averaging at 21% (range 0%–40%). Additionally, all analyses were weighted to be nationally representative and standard errors were clustered at the school level. And given the number of outcomes, all main “effect” analyses adjust for multiple comparisons using a Benjamini adjustment (Benjamini & Hochberg,).

To minimize the possibility of spurious associations, we controlled for an extensive set of covariates. These covariates included indicators related to children's characteristics (i.e. gender, race/ethnicity, English language learner status, and an indicator for whether a parent rated the child as having poor health), children's educational experiences (i.e. enrollment in full‐day kindergarten, school type, and the number of hours that the child spent in center‐based pre‐kindergarten and before/after school care during the kindergarten year), household characteristics (i.e. household structure, number of siblings, low‐income status as proxied by whether the family received benefits from the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children, parent education, parent employment, number of books in the home, home learning activities [9 items, α =.72]), and school‐going practices and household routines (i.e. whether the child took a school bus to school, how far the child lived from school, in miles, number of breakfasts and dinners that the family regularly had together at home). When available, all models also adjusted for lagged dependent variables (discussed in more detail below), which is recognized as one of the strongest adjustments for omitted variable bias (NICHD & Duncan,).

### Effect of intervention aimed at increasing physical activity, reducing sedentary behaviour, and increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in children: active for life year 5 (AFLY5) school based cluster randomised controlled trial [^200342ce]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

What the intervention involves, including who delivers different aspects of it, where, and how

Full details of the intervention have been published in the trial protocol and pilot study and are available on the study website.The intervention has five components, as described below.

Training for year 5 classroom teachers and learning support assistant s—This was provided by the trial manager, a nutritionist, and a physical education specialist. The training took place over a whole day (8-9 hours) in a location away from any of the schools and where the teachers/learning support assistants and people delivering the training would not be interrupted. Teachers/learning support assistants were given a choice of days to attend the training, and schools were financially compensated for the cost of replacement teachers while their staff attended training. At the training days, the rationale for the intervention was explained, and each lesson and homework activity was discussed and then taught in interactive ways. Time was provided for questions and discussion. Teachers were instructed to deliver 16 lessons, 10 of which had associated homework to be handed out by the teachers. They were told that they could adapt the teaching plans and materials, as they would with other lessons (for example, to suit their own style and the range of abilities in their class), but the aims and knowledge/skills to be imparted should remain the same.

Provision of 16 lesson plans and teaching materials —These included pictures, CDs, and journals for year 5 teachers or learning support assistants to deliver over two out of the three school terms in year 5 (6-7 months). The 16 lessons included nine lessons that were primarily related to how to be more active and less sedentary and why this was important, six related to healthy nutrition and how to achieve this, and one about reducing screen viewing. Each lesson did, however, combine different aspects of healthy behaviour. For example, in the physical activity lessons the children played games based on the food groups (using photographs of food), which reinforced the content of the nutrition lessons. Similarly, in the lesson (and associated homework) for reducing screen viewing (called “Freeze my TV”), children were taught how to replace regular television watching with active play on some days.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^2a2e8477]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Dysphonia and occupation—People in vocations with high vocal demands have increased likelihood of developing dysphonia; an estimated 28 million workers in the United States experience voice problems daily, 1 out of 10 individuals with voice disorders file short-term disability claims, and among teachers, 20% miss work due to dysphonia with absenteeism in this occupation alone associated with economic ramifications of $2.5 billion in the United States annually.

### Risk of hospital admission with COVID-19 among teachers compared with healthcare workers and other adults of working age in scotland, March 2020 to July 2021: population based case-control study [^91026d1b]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the risk of hospital admission with covid-19 and severe covid-19 among teachers and their household members, overall and compared with healthcare workers and adults of working age in the general population.

Design

Population based nested case-control study.

Setting

Scotland, March 2020 to July 2021, during defined periods of school closures and full openings in response to covid-19.

Participants

All cases of covid-19 in adults aged 21 to 65 (n=132420) and a random sample of controls matched on age, sex, and general practice (n=1306566). Adults were identified as actively teaching in a Scottish school by the General Teaching Council for Scotland, and their household members were identified through the unique property reference number. The comparator groups were adults identified as healthcare workers in Scotland, their household members, and the remaining general population of working age.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was hospital admission with covid-19, defined as having a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 during hospital admission, being admitted to hospital within 28 days of a positive test result, or receiving a diagnosis of covid-19 on discharge from hospital. Severe covid-19 was defined as being admitted to intensive care or dying within 28 days of a positive test result or assigned covid-19 as a cause of death.

Results

Most teachers were young (mean age 42), were women (80%), and had no comorbidities (84%). The risk (cumulative incidence) of hospital admission with covid-19 was <1% for all adults of working age in the general population. Over the study period, in conditional logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, general practice, race/ethnicity, deprivation, number of comorbidities, and number of adults in the household, teachers showed a lower risk of hospital admission with covid-19 (rate ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 0.92) and of severe covid-19 (0.56, 0.33 to 0.97) than the general population. In the first period when schools in Scotland reopened, in autumn 2020, the rate ratio for hospital admission in teachers was 1.20 (0.89 to 1.61) and for severe covid-19 was 0.45 (0.13 to 1.55). The corresponding findings for household members of teachers were 0.91 (0.67 to 1.23) and 0.73 (0.37 to 1.44), and for patient facing healthcare workers were 2.08 (1.73 to 2.50) and 2.26 (1.43 to 3.59). Similar risks were seen for teachers in the second period, when schools reopened in summer 2021. These values were higher than those seen in spring/summer 2020, when schools were mostly closed.

Conclusion

Compared with adults of working age who are otherwise similar, teachers and their household members were not found to be at increased risk of hospital admission with covid-19 and were found to be at lower risk of severe covid-19. These findings should reassure those who are engaged in face-to-face teaching.

### Global health degrees: at what cost? [^83c86baa]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

We focused on tuition fees for the entire degree programme rather than the annual tuition fees, since duration of degree programme varied from 1 to 3 years, with some degrees structured in such a way that students’ graduation time was tied to their experiences and training garnered prior to programme entry. Thus, it should be noted that when the final cost was calculated this was based on the typical time to graduation indicated either on the website itself or by the respective school’s programme coordinator. In most European schools, fees are fixed regardless of how long a student takes to complete their degree. However, in North America time to graduation can be quite variable and students usually pay tuition for each semester or credit. This is particularly true of the US system where a degree cost can vary substantially between students. We chose to calculate total tuition based on a typical student’s experience as suggested by either the school’s website or the coordinator.

In addition, some programmes require a project (eg, summer practicum) be conducted in elsewhere (typically, a low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC)—the costs for these were not always absorbed by the tuition fees. While some students had their costs for projects abroad covered by a supervisor and others could apply for scholarships, the remainder would have to pay for the additional costs out of pocket. This information was not transparent across degree programmes.

Given the difficulty in collecting data on tuition itself, we did not quantify cost of living directly for each school. Rather, we aimed to account for differences in living costs for any given school using an adjustment measure used by the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC), established by the United Nations (UN).The UN postadjustment system is designed to ensure that the net remuneration pay of UN staffers garners an equivalent purchasing power to that same staffer at the base of the system, New York City, regardless of their posting location. Post adjustment multiplier considers differences in prices between the city in question and New York; local inflation; exchange rate of local currency relative to the USD; and average expenditure pattern of staff members currently at a given location. The multiplier is adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the cost of living in a given city. We used the multiplier from the March 2020 update. All cost information was converted into US dollars using the ICSC conversion factor (March 2020 update) to make international comparisons possible.

### COVID-19-related school closures, United States, July 27, 2020-June 30, 2022 [^be0937a2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The most frequently documented reason for closure in both school years was COVID-19 cases in the school or school district. School year 2020–21 also had a significant number of closures attributable to increased community transmission and to state or local mandates to close schools in response to COVID-19, consistent with the changing incidence of COVID-19 among both the general population and children during the study period. COVID-SCs attributable to teacher absenteeism (because of illness in themselves or others) and teacher or staff shortages were more common in 2021–22 than in SY 2020–21. Although teacher shortages also were reported before the pandemic, they were exacerbated by the pandemic.

In 2020–21, the number of schools open to in-person education varied throughout the semester; some schools were teaching in-person, some relied solely on distance learning, some used hybrid or mixed methods, and others moved among different modalities in response to disease transmission and related guidance throughout the school year. COVID-19 transmission during 2020–21 was primarily dominated by the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2, which would only later be supplanted by new variants as the predominating virus in circulation. Most COVID-SCs in 2020–21 occurred in the first semester (August– December 2020) before peaks in COVID-19 epidemiologic surveillance data; the bulk occurred in the 2 weeks leading up to the 2020 Thanksgiving holiday break. The wording of reasons for closure as abstracted from some school closure announcements suggested that, amidst increasing transmission, schools and school districts were trying to take advantage of a planned break and lengthen the total time outside of the classroom by closing schools early. Despite recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention against travel during the holiday, travel during Thanksgiving week of 2020 (November 22–28, 2020) was at its highest since the start of the pandemic 8 months prior. During this time of increased social gatherings and movement, many schools that closed before Thanksgiving chose to stay shuttered until after the subsequent winter break (–). Annual (school year) COVID-19 peaks in the epidemiologic surveillance data occurred in January 2021. After Emergency Use Authorization was issued by the Food and Drug Administration for the first COVID-19 vaccine in December 2020, teachers and staff became eligible for vaccination as part of the essential workforce on March 2, 2021, and all those > 16 years of age became eligible for vaccination on April 19, 2021. Subsequently, the succeeding Alpha variant began to predominate in early April 2021, holding that position until June as the number of COVID-SCs slowed and remained comparably low.

### Study protocol for the ACTIVE SCHOOL study investigating two different strategies of physical activity to improve academic performance in schoolchildren [^64e33892]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Training of school staff

Teachers and pedagogues receive specific training for delivering either RJF or ML interventions. The training is conducted by educators from University College Copenhagen teacher education and pedagogue education. To ensure the sustainability of the interventions, a gradual introduction to the intervention principles has proven effective in previous studies. Therefore, a gradual introduction will be applied in both interventions.

The RJF teacher training program includes a 6-hour introduction course held at a central location for all schools before the intervention starts, a 3-hour follow-up course held at each school after 2 months, and a 5-hour thematic follow-up course held at a central location for all schools after 6 months.

The ML teacher training program includes a 6-hour introduction course held at a central location for all schools before the intervention starts, a 3-hour follow-up course held at each school after 2 months, a 2-hour thematic follow-up course held in hybrid formats (on-site or online) at local schools after 4 months, and a 3-hour advanced course held at a central location for all schools after 7 months.

In both interventions, school staff are expected to organize internal team-meetings in the months without planned courses. These serve to maintain focus throughout the whole intervention period. A reflection paper will guide the internal staff-meetings in common reflections regarding progression and delivery of the interventions.

Control condition

The control schools will continue their normal practice but take part in all baseline- and post-testing of primary and secondary outcomes.

Recruitment of participants

Once schools agree to participate, all children and parents or legal guardians in participating classes will receive written information and consent forms from the research team. For a child to participate in the scientific measurements the parents/legal guardians must return a written informed consent prior to baseline measurement, but all children from intervention schools will participate in the intervention activities (See fig. 1: Phases and timeline in the ACTIVE SCHOOL study). Participation in the project is voluntary and free of charge, and it is possible to withdraw consent at any time without giving a reason.

There are no exclusion criteria for children in the participating classes. It is unlikely that adverse events and other unintended effects of the interventions will occur when using the described scientific methods. In the rare cases where incidental findings, like mis-thriving and anxiety may occur, the person responsible for the research will contact the school for further contact to parents/guardians and relevant authorities.

### Fatigue risk management in the workplace [^feef1348]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Fatigue risk management—business drivers of overtime and productivity notes that cutting staffing and relying on overtime reduces benefits and training costs, usually estimated to be around 40% of base salary, but paying time and a half or even double time on holidays may yield little actual savings; the amount of productive work performed per week per employee comes out at as little as about 50 hours, so more than 50 hours of overtime per week may not produce much additional productive work; efforts to increase utilization of capital equipment by as much as 40% by converting sites to seamless 24/7 operations can extend schedules from 24-hours a day for 5 days a week to 6 or 7 days, with employees working 6 or 7 days a week with occasional days off and experiencing burnout from fatigue and stress.

### Clinical practice guidelines: childhood hearing screening [^03f0c904]. AAA (2011). Medium credibility.

Childhood hearing loss—educational attainment, employment, and cost—includes evidence that school districts spend 2.4 times more on average for each student enrolled in a program for the deaf and hard of hearing than for a child who does not receive special education services. The page reports that children who are deaf attained median reading scores at the 4.0 grade level by the age of 17 or 18 years, and that of students who are deaf or hard of hearing who are accepted into higher education, 70% withdraw from college before earning a college degree. Employment statistics note that data from the 2000 U.S. census indicate that the total unemployment rate for 16-64 years is 60% for persons with severe sensory disabilities, that less than one-third of adults who are deaf and under the age of 35 who want to work can find a job, and that wages earned by males who are deaf are 77% of the national wage average whereas the wages earned by females who are deaf are 88% of the national wage average within every occupational group.

### The cumulative, timing-specific, and enduring associations between student-teacher relationships and early elementary outcomes [^6736fe4d]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

Days absent

During the spring of each year, teachers reported on the number of absences for study students using a 6‐point scale (0 = no absences, 1 = 1–4 absences, 2 = 5–7 absences, 3 = 8–10 absences, 4 = 11–19 absences, and 5 = 20 or more absences). To ease interpretability, we recoded the response options to equal the midpoint (e.g. 8–10 absences were recoded as 9 absences). Students who were never absent and those who were absent for 20 or more days of the school year were coded as being absent for 0 and 20 days, respectively.

School health guidelines—early and middle childhood (EMC) objectives focus on strengthening school health education by increasing the proportion of elementary, middle, and senior high schools that require school health education, requiring newly hired staff who teach required health education to have undergraduate or graduate training in health education, requiring newly hired staff who teach required health instruction to be certified, licensed, or endorsed by the state in health education, and increasing the proportion of required health education classes or courses with a teacher who has had professional development related to teaching personal and social skills for behavior change within the past 2 years.

### Consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine on the recommended amount of sleep for healthy children: methodology and discussion [^38618a74]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Human performance outcomes across childhood—study designs and key thresholds: Most studies were cohort or cross-sectional with some case-control and experimental designs, and sample sizes ranged from less than 100 to over 3,000. In an experimental sample of 10 children aged 30–36 months, loss of a daytime nap resulting in total 24-h sleep of less than 11 hours was associated with more negative emotional responses. In preschoolers, less than 8 h in the previous 24 hours was associated with a more than 2-fold increased risk of accidental falls. A longitudinal cohort of 1,492 children aged 6 years found that sleep durations less than 10 hours as toddlers and preschoolers were associated with higher parent-reported hyperactivity indices and lower cognitive performance. Among 812 school-aged children, sleeping less than 9 hours per night was associated with worse teacher-reported academic achievement but not with attention, motivation, or relationships.

### Asthma education for school staff [^26dcc42a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Teachers and school staff should be competent in managing asthma in schools. Demonstrated low levels of asthma knowledge mean that staff may not know how best to protect a child with asthma in their care, or may fail to take appropriate action in the event of a serious attack. Education about asthma could help to improve this knowledge and lead to better asthma outcomes for children.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of asthma education programmes for school staff, and to identify content and attributes underpinning them.

Search Methods

We conducted the most recent searches on 29 November 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing an intervention to educate school staff about asthma versus a control group. We included studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only and unpublished data.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors screened the searches, extracted outcome data and intervention characteristics from included studies and assessed risk of bias. Primary outcomes for the quantitative synthesis were emergency department (ED) or hospital visits, mortality and asthma control; we graded the main results and presented evidence in a 'Summary of findings' table. We planned a qualitative synthesis of intervention characteristics, but study authors were unable to provide the necessary information.We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios, and continuous data as mean differences or standardised mean differences, all with a random-effects model. We assessed clinical, methodological and statistical heterogeneity when performing meta-analyses, and we narratively described skewed data.

Main Results

Five cluster-RCTs of 111 schools met the review eligibility criteria. Investigators measured outcomes in participating staff and often in children or parents, most often at between 1 and 12 months.All interventions were educational programmes but duration, content and delivery varied; some involved elements of training for pupils or primary care providers. We noted risk of selection, performance, detection and attrition biases, although to a differing extent across studies and outcomes.Quanitative and qualitative analyses were limited. Only one study reported visits to the ED or hospital and provided data that were too skewed for analysis. No studies reported any deaths or adverse events. Studies did not report asthma control consistently, but results showed no difference between groups on the paediatric asthma quality of life questionnaire (mean difference (MD) 0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.03 to 0.31; 1005 participants; we downgraded the quality of evidence to low for risk of bias and indirectness). Data for symptom days, night-time awakenings, restricted activities of daily living and school absences were skewed or could not be analysed; some mean scores were better in the trained group, but most differences between groups were small and did not persist to 24 months.Schools that received asthma education were more adherent to asthma policies, and staff were better prepared; more schools that had received staff asthma training had written asthma policies compared with control schools, more intervention schools showed improvement in measures taken to prevent or manage exercise-induced asthma attacks and more staff at intervention schools reported that they felt able to administer salbutamol via a spacer. However, the quality of the evidence was low; results show imbalances at baseline, and confidence in the evidence was limited by risk of bias and imprecision. Staff knowledge was higher in groups that had received asthma education, although results were inconsistent and difficult to interpret owing to differences between scales (low quality).Available information about the interventions was insufficient for review authors to conduct a meaningful qualitative synthesis of the content that led to a successful intervention, or of the resources required to replicate results accurately.

Authors' Conclusions

Asthma education for school staff increases asthma knowledge and preparedness, but studies vary and all available evidence is of low quality. Studies have not yet captured whether this improvement in knowledge has led to appreciable benefits over the short term or the longer term for the safety and health of children with asthma in school. Randomised evidence does not contribute to our knowledge of content or attributes of interventions that lead to the best outcomes, or of resources required for successful implementation.Complete reporting of the content and resources of educational interventions is essential for assessment of their effectiveness and feasibility for implementation. This applies to both randomised and non-randomised studies, although the latter may be better placed to observe important clinical outcomes such as exacerbations and mortality in the longer term.

### Recommendations for echocardiography laboratories participating in cardiac point of care cardiac ultrasound (POCUS) and critical care echocardiography training: report from the American Society of Echocardiography [^f5b40966]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Recommendation 5—advocate for resources: Ideally, resources will be readily available to meet the needs of UAPE, cardiac point of care cardiac ultrasound (POCUS) and critical care echocardiography (CCE) trainees, but the echocardiography lab director and others must thoughtfully consider what is necessary and then advocate for those resources, whether from the cardiology division, the hospital or clinic, or the trainees’ department(s). Contributions logically take the form of financial compensation for expert time and use of equipment and teaching tools, and the writing group conservatively estimates that if an expert sonographer spends the time equivalent of one comprehensive study per day in mentoring a UAPE, cardiac POCUS or CCE trainee in 50 scans over a 2-week period, the relevant reimbursement would be around $5,000. For comparison, the CHSE/ ACCP ultrasound curriculum is $8,000, and other modes of financial compensation may include contributions to sonographer/staff continuing education or the salaries of educators who serve the needs of multiple different departments; salary support of a “teaching sonographer”, “teaching echocardiographer” or “teaching fellow” could be shared by departments, and departments and/or training programs may share or jointly buy ultrasound equipment with the echocardiography laboratory and/or contribute to PACS expansion and maintenance; alternatively, an echocardiography laboratory may seek in-kind contributions or exchanges.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^b279e70d]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

If we go further, and abandon the idea that all clusters must begin in the control condition and end in the intervention condition, we arrive at the design in figure 1D, in which all the clusters are randomised to one condition or the other for the duration of the trial—that is, a ‘parallel groups’ design conducted over the same timescale as our stepped wedge design. This turns out to be the most statistically powerful design we have yet considered. Not all of the clusters receive the intervention within 10 months, but we do not have to leave things like that: we could have an agreement with sites to roll out the intervention to all of them immediately after the 11-month trial period, while we get on with analysing and publishing our results.

But what about that excess power? Could we get away with collecting less data? Figure 1E–G shows designs run over a 6-month interval, still divided into 1 month periods. This shows that we can achieve 86% power with a design that randomises half the clusters to the intervention for 6 months, and half to control (figure 1G). With a bit more tweaking it may be possible to uncover even more powerful alternative designs,but this is not the point of the present exercise. The point is this: given 10 clusters and a step length of 1 month we might have jumped to the naïve conclusion that we should run a stepped wedge trial lasting 11 months. But this fixed idea would have prevented us from seeing in this instance that we could get the evidence we needed in a much shorter time and with a simpler design—randomising half the clusters to the intervention for 6 months, and half to control—with all sites then being free to receive the intervention (preferentially perhaps) or to go and seek it for themselves.

7 Method

7.1 Participants and Procedure

Participants (n = 1159) came from the Behavior Outlook Norwegian Developmental Study (BONDS), a prospective, longitudinal study following children (51.8% male) and their families beginning at 6 months of age. Families were recruited from health clinics in two southeast regions of Norway between 2006 and 2008. In Norway, child health clinics are public, free, and attended almost universally. Eligibility criteria included having a child who was 5 months old at the time of recruitment and at least one parent being proficient in Norwegian (i.e. did not require a translator). A comparison of BONDS families with population statistics for births in Norway during the same period showed that the sample was comparable to the Norwegian population with some exceptions: within BONDS, there was a higher percentage of mothers with a university or college degree (58%) compared to the general population (50%), more firstborn children (47% vs. 42%), fewer mothers from outside Europe (6% vs. 12%) and fewer single mothers (5% vs. 11%; see Nærde et al.for additional details). The BONDS study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics and the Norwegian Social Sciences Data Services (approval numbers S‐06067; 2009/224a).

Assessments took place annually between child ages 12 to 48 months, in addition to an initial assessment when children were 6 months, in which both parents participated. Due to financial constraints and to reduce participant burden and dropouts, alternate parents (i.e. mothers or fathers) were targeted for annual assessments. Families were included in the present study if the mother had completed the 24‐month assessment (n = 881 mothers) and/or the father had completed the 36‐month assessment (n = 624 fathers), both of which included a series of parent–child interaction tasks from which observations of parental sensitivity were drawn. Although parents were encouraged to participate in all parts of the assessments, they were retained in the study even if they chose not to participate in the observational assessments at a given time point. Reasons for not participating could include not wanting to be observed, perceived burden related to bringing the child to the lab, or difficulties scheduling around work. Parents were compensated for their participation at each assessment, and children received a small gift following the test session.

### A successful nationwide implementation of the 'FIFA 11 for health' programme in Brazilian elementary schools [^534b3fb1]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Table 3 
Number of cities, schools, teachers and children taking part in the intervention and the evaluation sample population completing pre and postintervention questionnaires

For the first stage of the implementation, two F-MARC master instructors (1 male, 1 female) delivered a 5-day training course to 22 male and female teachers; these teachers received instruction about the philosophy, structure, content and delivery of the ‘FIFA 11 for Health’ programme and the implementation of the data collection instruments. These teachers then presented the programme to children aged 9–12 years who attended their schools over a 3-month period.

Following this, for the cascade-training stage of the implementation, the same 22 teachers received a further 5-day training course on how to teach other teachers to deliver the programme. These 22 teachers were then divided into 11 mixed-gender teacher-pairs who travelled to three regional training centres in Brasilia (3 teacher-pairs), Natal (4) and São Paulo (4) where they taught 227 teachers how to deliver the programme to children. The overall numbers of schools, teachers and children taking part in the five separate Regions of Brazil over the two stages are recorded in table 3.

### Multi-strategy intervention increases school implementation and maintenance of a mandatory physical activity policy: outcomes of a cluster randomised controlled trial [^f709fcd6]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary outcome: weekly minutes of structured PA implemented by classroom teachers at 12 months and 18 months

At 12-month intervention teachers increased their overall implementation of PA per week by an average of 44.2 min (95% CI 32.8 to 55.7; p<0.001) more than the control group (table 4). This was maintained at 18 months, with the intervention group increasing their implementation from baseline to 18 months by an average of 27.1 min (95% CI 15.5 to 38.6; p≤0.001) more than the control. The difference in the change from 12-month to 18-month follow-up between the two experimental groups was statistically significant (−17.2 min (95% CI –28.8 to –5.64; p=0.004)), with the intervention group recording a within group change of - 1.3 min (95% CI −9.3 to 6.6; p=0.74), compared with the usual care group which recorded an increase of 15.9 min (95% CI 7.4 to 24.3; p<0.001).

Table 4 
Changes in weekly minutes of physical activity implemented from baseline to 12-month and 18-month follow-up

The proportion of teachers in the intervention group meeting the mandated 150 min of PA per week was 61.9% (n=138) at 12 months and 59.4% (n=117) at 18 months compared with the control group which had 17.2% (n=31) and 29.9% (n=58) at 12 months and 18 months, respectively. The difference in the change in proportion of teachers scheduling 150 min of PA per week between intervention and control was significantly different from baseline to 12 months (OR: 7.56; 95% CI 3.88 to 14.7, p<0.001) and from baseline to 18 months (OR: 3.62; 95% CI 1.93 to 6.79, p≤0.001).

### School suspension and expulsion: policy statement [^94eeff03]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

The education-health gradient and exclusionary school discipline are linked by evidence that exclusionary school discipline is associated with school failure, which can limit career opportunities and put students at risk for worse health outcomes; many suspended and expelled students experience decreased instructional time, disruption in student-teacher relationships, and lack of adult supervision while removed from the school environment; these factors can contribute to academic disengagement and low academic achievement; and suspended and expelled students are more likely to drop out of high school, which severely stunts their lifetime earning potential.

### Centre-based day care for children younger than five years of age in high-income countries [^60e3cc38]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A large proportion of children younger than five years of age in high-income countries experience significant non-parental care. Centre-based day care services may influence the development of children and the economic situation of parents.

Objectives

To assess the effects of centre-based day care without additional interventions (e.g. psychological or medical services, parent training) on the development and well-being of children and families in high-income countries (as defined by the World Bank 2011).

Search Methods

In April 2014, we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) and eight other databases. We also searched two trials registers and the reference lists of relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of centre-based day care for children younger than five years of age. We excluded studies that involved co-interventions not directed toward children (e.g. parent programmes, home visits, teacher training). We included the following outcomes: child cognitive development (primary outcome), child psychosocial development, maternal and family outcomes and child long-term outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the single included study. We contacted investigators to obtain missing information.

Main Results

We included in the review one trial, involving 120 families and 143 children. Risk of bias was high because of contamination between groups, as 63% of control group participants accessed day care services separate from those offered within the intervention. No evidence suggested that centre-based day care, rather than no treatment (care at home), improved or worsened children's cognitive ability (Griffiths Mental Development Scale, standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.01 to 0.69, 127 participants, 1 study, very low-quality evidence) or psychosocial development (parental report of abnormal development, risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% CI 0.25 to 5.78, 137 participants, 1 study, very low-quality evidence). No other measures of child intellectual or psychosocial development were reported in the included study. Moreover, no evidence indicated that centre-based day care, rather than no treatment (care at home), improved or worsened employment of parents, as measured by the number of mothers in full-time or part-time employment (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.48, 114 participants, 1 study, very low-quality evidence) and maternal hours per week in paid employment (SMD 0.20, 95% -0.15 to 0.55, 127 participants, 1 study, very low-quality evidence) or household income above £200 per week (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.29, 113 participants, 1 study, very low-quality evidence). This study did not report on long-term outcomes for children (high-school completion or income).

Authors' Conclusions

This review includes one trial that provides inconclusive evidence as regards the effects of centre-based day care for children younger than five years of age and their families in high-income countries. Robust guidance for parents, policymakers and other stakeholders on the effects of day care cannot currently be offered on the basis of evidence from randomised controlled trials. Some trials included co-interventions that are unlikely to be found in normal day care centres. Effectiveness studies of centre-based day care without these co-interventions are few, and the need for such studies is significant. Comparisons might include home visits or alternative day care arrangements that provide special attention to children from low-income families while exploring possible mechanisms of effect.

### The effect of a 13-hour curriculum to improve residents' teaching skills: a randomized trial [^27981c2a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Although resident physicians often teach, few trials have tested interventions to improve residents' teaching skills. A pilot trial in 2001-2002 found that 13 trained resident teachers taught better than did untrained control residents.

Objective

To determine whether a longitudinal residents-as-teachers curriculum improves residents' teaching skills.

Design

Randomized, controlled trial from May 2001 to February 2002 (pilot trial) and March 2002 to April 2003.

Setting

4 generalist residencies affiliated with an urban academic medical center.

Participants

62 second-year residents: 23 in the 2001-2002 pilot trial and 39 more in 2002-2003; 27 of the 39 participants were medicine residents required to learn teaching skills.

Intervention

A 13-hour curriculum in which residents practiced teaching and received feedback during 1-hour small-group sessions taught twice monthly for 6 months.

Measurements

A 3.5-hour, 8-station, objective structured teaching examination that was enacted and rated by 50 medical students before and after the intervention. Two trained, blinded raters independently assessed each station (inter-rater reliability, 0.75).

Results

In the combined results for 2001-2003, the intervention group (n = 33) and control group (n = 29) were similar in sex, specialty, and academic performance. On a 1 to 5 Likert scale, intervention residents outscored controls on overall improvement score (post-test-pretest difference, 0.74 vs. 0.07; difference between intervention and control groups, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.55 to 0.81]; P < 0.001) by a magnitude of 2.8 standard deviations and on all 8 individual stations. The intervention residents improved 28.5% overall, whereas the scores of control residents did not increase significantly (2.7%). In 2002-2003, 19 intervention residents similarly outscored 19 controls (post-test-pretest difference, 0.83 vs. 0.14; difference between intervention and control groups, 0.69 [CI, 0.53 to 0.84]; P < 0.001). Twenty-seven medicine residents required to learn teaching skills achieved scores similar to those of volunteers.

Limitations

The study was conducted at a single institution. No "real life" assessment with which to compare the results of the objective structured teaching examination was available.

Conclusions

Generalist residents randomly assigned to receive a 13-hour longitudinal residents-as-teachers curriculum consistently showed improved teaching skills, as judged by medical student raters. Residents required to participate improved as much as volunteers did.

### Preparing fourth-year medical students to teach during internship [^37402989]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Interns are expected to teach medical students, yet there is little formal training in medical school to prepare them for this role. To enhance the teaching skills of our graduating students we initiated a 4-hour "teaching to teach" course as part of the end of the fourth-year curriculum. Course evaluations demonstrate that students strongly support this program (overall ratings 2000 to 2005: mean=4.4 [scale 1 to 5], n=224). When 2004 course participants were surveyed during the last month of their internship, 84%"agree" or "strongly agree" with the statement: "The teaching to teach course helped prepare me for my role as a teacher during internship" (2005: mean 4.2 [scale 1 to 5], n=45, response rate 60%). A course preparing fourth-year students to teach during internship is both feasible and reproducible, with a minimal commitment of faculty and resident time. Participants identify it as an important addition to their education and as useful during internship.

### Hospital staff's attitudes toward and knowledge about dementia before and after a two-day dementia training program [^ede71a5c]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

The dementia training program: “People with dementia in the general hospital”

During the period from October 2018 to December 2018, six two-day training blocks on dementia were offered. Each day consisted of eight 45 minutes training sessions. Lessons were held in an educational center equipped for teaching. The group size varied between six and 16 persons. The training was conducted by an external lecturer from the “Alzheimer’s Society of Bavaria” with profound theoretical knowledge about dementia and experience in teaching and science. A brief overview of contents is given in Table 1. Different types of delivering methods were used: teacher-centered teaching using Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, interactive exchanges between teacher and participants via verbal communication or using a flip chart, (educational) videos, individual- and partner work using worksheets, group discussions, as well as case studies. At the end of each day, a manual summarizing the key points of the training was given to all attendees.

Table 1 
Overview of the training content

Study design

The analyzed data were part of a comprehensive mixed methods study including interviews and questionnaires. A single group repeated measures design was used to observe the training impact on staff and its consistency over a longer period of time. Questionnaire data were collected prior to the training (baseline) and follow-ups were conducted 3 months (follow-up 1), and 6 months (follow-up 2) after completion of the training.

### Estimated US pediatric hospitalizations and school absenteeism associated with accelerated COVID-19 bivalent booster vaccination [^29d32566]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Model Outcomes

We estimated the age-specific number of asymptomatic infections, mild symptomatic cases, severe nonhospitalized cases, hospitalized cases, and intensive care unit cases in the pediatric population aged 0 to 17 years across the study period of October 1, 2022, to March 31, 2023, for the baseline scenario and each counterfactual scenario. We further calculated isolation days among the entire pediatric population (aged 0 to 17 years) and school absenteeism among those aged 5 to 17 years. Guidance from the CDC stipulates that individuals who test positive for COVID-19 should isolate for at least 5 days and for at least 1 day beyond the resolution of symptoms.A minimum 10-day isolation period is advised for those who experience severe illness, including shortness of breath, low oxygen levels, or hospitalization. In our model, we calculated pediatric isolation days as 5 days per event for children who experienced mild symptomatic illness and 10 days per event for those with severe illness or hospitalization.

Considering that school is typically held only 5 days per week, when calculating days of school absenteeism, we multiplied pediatric isolation days among children aged 5 to 17 years by five-sevenths. We further adjusted the total days of absenteeism by 3.23% to account for children who received homeschooling.

Based on the model estimates, we calculated the mean number of days of student and teacher absenteeism averted under each counterfactual scenario compared with the baseline scenario for typical school sizes at the elementary, middle, and high school levels. We obtained data on school enrollment and teacher count from the National Center for Education Statistics,stratified into tertiles as lower enrollment, middle enrollment, or higher enrollment, which we referred to as small, midsize, and large, respectively (Table 1). We assumed that students in elementary school were aged 5 to 10 years, students in middle school were aged 11 to 13 years, and students in high school were aged 14 to 17 years. We also assumed that teachers were representative of the population aged 21 to 64 years. To calculate student and teacher isolation days and absenteeism, we multiplied the estimated age-specific per capita isolation and absentee rates by the number of students or teachers at each category of school.

### US infant pertussis incidence trends in the maternal tdap vaccine era (...) [^f095eee0]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

During the pre–maternal Tdap vaccination period, annual pertussis incidence did not change among infants younger than 2 months but increased slightly among infants aged 6 months to less than 12 months. Incidence rates were calculated using population estimates from the CDC National Center for Health Statistics as denominators. 19 To obtain denominators for each infant age group, estimates for infants younger than 1 year were divided by 12 to get monthly denominators and were multiplied by infant age in months. Incidence rates for each age group for the 2 maternal vaccination periods were modeled using weighted, segmented linear regression assuming a Poisson distribution; the weights were the inverse of the variances of incidence. Piecewise regression lines were joined at the year when the maternal vaccination recommendation was made.

Pertussis incidence trends, as indicated by the slope of the regression line, were compared for each maternal vaccination period for both the target and the comparison age groups. During the pre–maternal Tdap vaccination period, the mean annual pertussis incidence among infants younger than 2 months was 165. 3 per 100 000 infants, with large fluctuations but no significant trend in annual incidence during this period. Among infants aged 6 months to less than 12 months, mean annual pertussis incidence was 19. 7 per 100 000 infants and annual incidence fluctuated less compared with that among infants younger than 2 months during the pre–maternal Tdap vaccination period. Annual incidence rates did not change significantly among infants aged 6 months to less than 12 months during the post–maternal Tdap vaccination period.

There was no change in incidence trends between the pre–maternal and post–maternal Tdap vaccination periods among infants aged 6 months to less than 12 months.

### 'Physical activity 4 everyone' school-based intervention to prevent decline in adolescent physical activity levels: 12 month (mid-intervention) report on a cluster randomised trial [^2450f435]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Figure 1 
Intervention delivery baseline to 12-month follow-up.

Figure 1 summarises the physical activity strategies delivered, the adoption strategies used to facilitate their delivery and the desired standard and dose delivered within the first 12  months of the intervention period. In the first 12-month period, two curriculum-based strategies started, including teaching strategies to maximise activity in PE and the development of individualised student physical activity plans. To facilitate adoption, PE teachers were provided training on strategies to maximise physical activity in PE, prompted by the change agent to teach pedometer-based lessons and support students to complete personalised physical activity plans, were given resources (such as templates and instructions for use) to support students in developing personal activity plans, and given feedback on activity levels in PE based on SOFIT observations. One strategy targeting the school ethos and environment started within the first 12-month period. Offering physical activity in school breaks (lunch and/or recess) started in each school twice per week. Schools were provided equipment, including a variety of balls, hoops and ropes in a secure locked box to facilitate the start of these activities. The final strategy to start within the first 12-month period focused on parent engagement, whereby hard copy newsletters and websites were used to provide parents with updates in the programme being implemented at school plus articles about ways to support students to be active outside of the school. To facilitate the adoption of these physical activity strategies, schools established committees to oversee the changes and were provided with feedback reports outlining the schools progress towards programme adoption at the end of each term. Meetings were held with school executives, PE teachers and the school change agent to communicate the content of each feedback report.

Comparison

Schools allocated to the control group participated in the measurement components of the study only. They were asked to continue with their usual physical activity practices, including time table-based Health and Physical Education lessons, school sport, breaks for recess and lunch and any scheduled professional development for teachers.

Data collection procedures

Data collection was undertaken by trained research assistants, blinded to group allocation. Baseline data were collected from March to June 2012, and 12-month follow-up data (mid-intervention) data collected from the same cohort of students 12 months later in March–June 2013. The average duration between baseline and follow-up measurements for all schools was 12 months.

### Effectiveness of a school-based educational intervention to improve hypertension control among schoolteachers: a cluster-randomized controlled trial [^1eb5ac4a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

We screened 2216 schoolteachers from 92 schools and identified 402 teachers with hypertension implying a hypertension prevalence of 18.1%,much lower than anticipated. We randomly assigned 92 schools equally into usual care and intervention groups using computer‐generated random sequences. In the follow‐up survey, 6% migrated, 1% reported inconvenience to participate during the follow‐up period, and the remaining 1% were under treatment for other diseases and did not give consent to participate. Therefore, we were able to contact 92% of the teachers during the follow‐up survey.

The average age of the participants was 47 years (range, 30–55), 29% were men, and 90% were currently married. More than half (51%) of the teachers were from government schools, and the remaining 49% were from government‐aided private schools. Fifty‐nine percent had postgraduate education, and 41% were graduates or had other technical qualifications. Current tobacco use was reported by 2% and alcohol use by 7% of the participants. Use of extra salt to food was reported by 5%, and the median servings of fruits and vegetables per week was 8. Around 70% were found to be inactive (<600 metabolic equivalent tasks‐min/week). The baseline characteristics of the study groups are well balanced between study groups, except for education, type of school, and medical history of diabetes (Table 1).

Table 1 
Baseline Characteristics of Participants by Study Group

The control rate of hypertension at baseline was 31.9% in the usual care group and 35.5% in the intervention group. We found a significantly improved change in hypertension control rate among all individuals with hypertension in both of the study groups, with a greater rate of improvement in the intervention group (49%) compared with the usual care group (38%). Teachers with hypertension in the intervention group were nearly 2 times more likely to achieve adequate control of hypertension compared with those in the usual care group (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.06–3.35), after adjusting for baseline control of hypertension (Table 2). Similar results were found in complete case analysis (Table S1) and also after adjusting for baseline control of hypertension and variables that were different between study groups at baseline (Table S2).

### School and work absences after critical care hospitalization for pediatric acute respiratory failure: a secondary analysis of a cluster randomized trial [^b0407a36]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Patients who survive pediatric critical illness and their caregivers commonly experience physical, emotional, and cognitive sequelae. However, the rate and duration of school absence among patients and work absence among their caregivers are unknown.

Objective

To determine the rates and duration of school absence among children who survived hospitalization with acute respiratory failure and work absence among their caregivers.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Randomized Evaluation of Sedation Titration for Respiratory Failure (RESTORE) cluster randomized trial included 2449 children from 31 sites to protocolized sedation (intervention) vs usual care (control) from June 6, 2009, to December 2, 2013. In total, 1360 children survived hospitalization and were selected for follow-up at 6 months after pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) discharge, which was completed from January 12, 2010, to April 13, 2015. This secondary analysis was conducted from July 1, 2020, to September 30, 2021.

Exposures

PICU hospitalization for acute respiratory failure, including invasive mechanical ventilation.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Postdischarge assessments with caregivers of eligible participants at 6 months after PICU discharge, including questions about school and work absence. Risk factors associated with longer absence from school and work were identified.

Results

Postdischarge assessments were completed for 960 children who survived treatment for acute respiratory failure, of whom 443 (46.1%) were girls and 517 (53.9%) were boys; 509 of 957 (53.2%) were non-Hispanic White. Median age was 1.8 years (IQR, 0.4-7.9 years). In total, 399 children (41.6%) were enrolled in school, of whom 279 (69.9%) missed school after discharge. Median duration of postdischarge absence was 9.1 days (IQR, 0-27.9 days) among all children enrolled in school and 16.9 days (IQR, 7.9-43.9 days) among the 279 children with postdischarge absence. Among 960 primary caregivers, 506 (52.7%) were employed outside the home, of whom 277 (54.7%) missed work. Median duration of postdischarge work absence was 2 days (IQR, 0-10 days) among all employed primary caregivers, and 8 days (IQR, 4-20 days) among the 277 caregivers who missed work after discharge. The odds of postdischarge school absence and greater duration of absence increased for children 5 years or older (compared with 0-4 years, odds ratios [ORs] for 5-8 years, 3.20 [95% CI, 1.69-6.05] and 2.09 [95% CI, 1.30-3.37], respectively; ORs for 9-12 years, 2.49 [95% CI, 1.17-5.27] and 2.32 [95% CI, 1.30-4.14], respectively; and ORs for 13-18 years, 2.37 [95% CI, 1.20-4.66] and 1.89 [95% CI, 1.11-3.24], respectively) and those with a preexisting comorbidity (ORs, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.10-3.29] and 1.76 [95% CI, 1.14-2.69], respectively).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this secondary analysis of a cluster randomized trial, 2 in 3 children hospitalized for acute respiratory failure missed school after discharge, for a median duration of nearly 2 weeks. In addition, more than half of primary caregivers missed work after discharge. The magnitude of school absenteeism suggests that children may be at increased risk for lower educational achievement, economic hardship, and poor health outcomes in adulthood.

### Digital supervision in the clinical learning environment: characterizing teamwork in the electronic health record [^3c17d326]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Our sample included 1721 observed day shifts by 55 unique attendings, split evenly between direct care and teaching service shifts (see Supporting Information S1: Appendix Table 1). Each attending had an average of 34‐day shifts over the 6‐month study period. The 860 teaching shifts corresponded with 1357 observed resident shifts.

Teaching versus direct care service

We observed substantially less mean total EHR time per shift for those on teaching service compared to direct care (128.7 vs. 239.9 min) (Table 1 ; Supporting Information S1: Appendix Figure 1). Providers on teaching service had fewer activated shift hours per day (10.4 vs. 12.5) and spent less average time in the EHR within each activated hour (12.2 vs. 19.2 min).

Table 1 
Descriptive statistics comparing direct care and teaching service EHR behavior.

Attendings on teaching service apportioned their time differently within the EHR compared to direct service. Teaching service apportioned more time to review—both passive review and attestation of notes (32.6% compared to 14.7% on direct service, p <.001), as well as chart review (24.5% compared to 17.7% on direct service, p <.001). Direct service attendings spent proportionally more time directly writing notes as well as actively managing orders. When on teaching service, attendings completed a lower percentage of their documentation during shift hours compared to pre‐/postshift (82.5% of work completed on‐shift vs. 77.6% for teaching service, p <.001). (For histograms of EHR activity by hour, see Supporting Information S1: Appendix Figure 2).

Direct service shifts demonstrated a normal distribution of observations both for active and passive notes (Figure 1). For teaching service shifts, passive note time showed a much more dispersed, flatter distribution, and active note time showed significant right skew. That is, the median observation showed time in active notes to be only about 10% of total EHR time, but the top quartile of observations of teaching attendings spent 20%–40% of total EHR shift time in active notes (more aligned with observed time allocation on direct service).

### Components related to long-term effects in the intra-and interpersonal domains: a meta-analysis of universal school-based interventions [^54f7d197]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Descriptive Characteristics

In total, 54 studies were included that reported on 52 unique interventions, from which we extracted 283 effect sizes. Of these intervention effects, 128 were in the intrapersonal domain and 155 were in the interpersonal domain. Six effect sizes from two studies (Bonell et al.; Kaveh et al.) were extreme outliers (Cohen’s d = 1.38–3.69) and believed to be unrepresentatively high. We therefore winsorized these six effect sizes.

The included studies were published between 1988 and 2021 (median year of publication: 2015). They were conducted in Europe (k = 26), the USA (k = 13), Australia (k = 6), Asia (k = 5), Africa (k = 2), and Canada (k = 2). Studies mostly allocated participants randomly to the conditions (k = 37) and slightly more often used a passive control group (k = 32) than an active control group (k = 22). On average, the follow-up measurement occurred 27.70 weeks (SD = 20.80) after the end of the intervention. The follow-up periods ranged from 2 to 109 weeks with 4 studies (7.4%) having a follow-up period of less than 3 months and 42 studies (78%) having a follow-up period of 24 weeks or longer.

In total, 51,017 participants participated in the included studies with an average age of 13.65 years (SD = 1.43) at the start of the intervention. Roughly half of these participants were boys (46%). Of the studies that reported on participants’ ethnic backgrounds (k = 31), 20 (37%) included participants mainly from an ethnic majority background, 8 (15%) included participants mostly from an ethnic minority background, and 3 (6%) included participants from a mix of majority and minority ethnic backgrounds. On average, participants’ drop-out rate in the studies was 17% (SD = 14.20). The interventions consisted of 11 sessions (SD = 7.32) on average, with an average timespan of 20.85 weeks (SD = 28.36). Teachers conducted the interventions about half the time (k = 24), while professionals conducted the other half (k = 30). Additionally, peers were involved in the implementation of 3 interventions.

### Hourly step recommendations to achieve daily goals for working and older adults [^45deacdb]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Studies have shown that prompts are an effective intervention in changing step behaviour for most participants,. As different demographic groups exercise at different timings (e.g. working versus older adults), personalised prompts may be more beneficial at specific times convenient for individuals. We provide the step counts that participants should achieve in the evenings to ensure they achieve the daily step goals (5000, 7500, or 10,000 steps) by the end of the day (Table 3 and Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). These recommendations could then be experimentally tested in future studies.

The results suggest that the daily step goals (5000, 7500, or 10,000 steps) influenced the steps behaviour of the participants. The number of participant days rose sharply from 1090 (2.08%) with 9500–9999 steps to 7507 (14.3%) with 10,000 to 10,499 steps (Fig. 1a). The increase in the HealthPoints earned (from 25 (7500–9999 steps) to 40 (10,000 steps and above) HealthPoints) would reduce the days required to complete the first tier from 30 to 19 days (Supplementary Table S1). By setting a 10,000 daily step goal, participants whose daily step counts were just below 10,000 could have been motivated by the incentives to put in extra effort to achieve the goal, leading to the observed spike. However, we also observed a decreasing number of participant days after each goal, which may indicate that participants lose motivation once the goal has been achieved.

### 'FIFA 11 for health' for europe. 1: effect on health knowledge and well-being of 10-to 12-year-old Danish school children [^d68e06f1]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The study, which was carried out in the period August to December 2015, began with a training course for teachers during week-0 followed by a 13-week intervention period. During week-0, two or three teachers (at least 1 female and 1 male) from each participating school, together with support football coaches from the Danish Football Association and University of Copenhagen, were taken through a 2½-day interactive training course. Participants received a detailed course manual that outlined the programme's philosophy of health enhancement through education and physical activity, discussed the presentational skills required to deliver the programme in an entertaining but informative way, described the content and timing of each aspect of the programme, discussed the health knowledge associated with each session, demonstrated the football skills, and finally tested participants' ability to deliver the sessions using a series of teach backs. Week-1 was used for preintervention testing at both the intervention and control schools, when children responded to questionnaires about health knowledge and well-being. Each week from week-2 to week-12, the seven intervention schools completed the two parts of one session during two scheduled 45 min physical education periods; in this same time period, the two control schools undertook their normal physical education classes. Finally, in week-13, the children from both intervention and control schools completed the same questionnaires as in week-1 (see figure 1).

Figure 1 
‘FIFA 11 for Health’ intervention time scales.

Sessions began at each of the intervention schools during the third to sixth week of the 2015/2016 academic year; during this period, the two control schools continued with their standard school curriculum, which included a similar number of physical activity lessons. One teacher usually delivered each session to classes of 20 to 25 children (mixed boys and girls). During the intervention period, the school's head-teacher was responsible for ensuring that the programme remained on schedule and that sufficient support was provided to the teachers delivering the programme. All assessments were performed by staff from Copenhagen University with support from the school teachers.

The Committees on Biomedical Research Ethics for the Capital Region of Denmark (J.nr. H-15008117) approved the study; child assent and written informed parental consent were obtained for participants included in the study. Those children whose parents did not provide consent also received the programme each week as it was delivered as part of the formal school curriculum; however, these children were not asked to complete the preintervention and postintervention questionnaires.

### The cumulative, timing-specific, and enduring associations between student-teacher relationships and early elementary outcomes [^3a1a2e26]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

With this framework in mind, our analyses proceeded in several steps. First, we examined the associations between teacher–student closeness and conflict and students' academic, executive function, absenteeism, and social–emotional outcomes between kindergarten and third grade, separately for each grade and outcome. We included both closeness and conflict as predictors in the same model to isolate the associations between each dimension, above and beyond the effect of the other dimension. Given our focus on timing‐specific associations, these models controlled for lagged variables from the wave immediately prior. For instance, when considering the links between teacher–student relationships in second grade and students' second‐grade internalizing behavior, models controlled for the spring of first‐grade internalizing behavior. In contrast, when examining the links between third‐grade relationships and students' internalizing behavior, we controlled for students' internalizing behavior in second grade.

Following the above, we estimated models that considered whether these associations endured over time. These models are extensions of our earlier models discussed above, but rather than looking at end‐of‐year outcomes, we included outcomes from subsequent grades. For example, when considering whether the links between teacher–student relationships in kindergarten persist over time, we included outcomes in first, second, and third grade.

Next, we considered cumulative associations. In these models, we created aggregate indicators of closeness and conflict. For example, when examining the cumulative outcomes of teacher–student closeness between kindergarten and first grade, we created an index of closeness between these periods (i.e. kindergarten and first grade). As another example, when examining the cumulative outcomes of teacher–student closeness between kindergarten and third grade, we created an index of closeness between these periods (i.e. kindergarten, first grade, second grade, and third grade). These models adjusted for either lagged dependent variables from the fall of kindergarten or lagged dependent variables from the wave immediately prior. By doing so, these analyses assess the extent to which student–teacher relationships have cumulative associations with students' development over time, in addition to year‐to‐year learning. Finally, to determine whether the links between student–teacher relationships and student outcomes varied for different groups of children, interaction terms were added between our focal predictors of interest and the indicators for child sex, race/ethnicity, home language, and socioeconomic status.

### A multicomponent, preschool to third grade preventive intervention and educational attainment at 35 years of age [^ef88aa12]. JAMA Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The full spectrum of secondary and postsecondary education was assessed. All measures were dichotomous except years of education. Data were obtained from administrative records of various sources and were supplemented by interviews with youths and family members. For higher education, the National Student Clearinghouse was the primary source.More than 3600 public and private colleges, representing 98% of all students, report enrollment and graduation data. We used data collected from matched records from those reports and the Illinois Shared Enrollment and Graduation Consortium (now part of the National Student Clearinghouse) from January 1, 2002, to May 31, 2015 (mean age, 35.1 years) (eMethods in the Supplement). The amount and sources of information were similar among the intervention groups.

Secondary education was measured by 5 indicators: dropout by 16 years of age, 4-year graduation (earned diploma within 4 years of ninth grade entry), and 3 others, including high school completion (earned diploma or General Educational Development credential). Postsecondary education was measured by years of education (range, 7-22 years), college attendance (2 or 4 years), degree completion (associate’s and higher), and a credential (eg, occupational certificate) (eMethods in the Supplement).

### The cumulative, timing-specific, and enduring associations between student-teacher relationships and early elementary outcomes [^d353eac8]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study—Kindergarten Class of 2011 (n = 14,370; 51% Male; 51% White; 14% Black; 25% Hispanic; 4% Asian; and 6% Other), this study examined the cumulative, timing‐specific, and enduring associations between student–teacher relationships in the United States and a broad range of student outcomes. Student–teacher conflict and closeness were consistently associated with outcomes between kindergarten and third grade, both contemporaneously and over time. The main exception was for student absenteeism, where there were less consistent associations with student–teacher conflict. Cumulative models underscore the significance of the overall experiences of high‐quality relationships over time. Despite little evidence of variability, girls fared less well socially due to more conflictual and less close relationships with their teachers than boys.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^7769a386]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Chronic low back pain—randomized controlled trial of yoga versus standard medical care in adults reports that patients with LBP for greater than 3 months were randomized to a yoga group (n=43) or control group of standard medical care (n=47), yoga participants completed a 24-week program of biweekly yoga classes, and outcomes were recorded upon enrollment, after 12 weeks, upon completion of the program (24 weeks), and 6-month follow-up; the yoga group experienced significantly greater functional disability, pain intensity and depression improvements compared to the usual care group at 24 weeks, and the authors concluded that yoga results in improved functional disability, pain intensity and depression in adults with chronic LBP; patient follow-up was less than 80%, therefore the work group downgraded this study from Level I to Level II; this group had chronic LBP that was mild in severity at baseline, and this study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that yoga provides significant improvements in pain and disability at 6 months compared to standard care, although at least in part due to the low starting scores at baseline, the magnitude of these improvements were small.

### The temporal dynamics of group interactions in higher-order social networks [^26fb0303]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Preschool

We also consider another data set, collected in a preschool as part of the DyLNet projectto follow the social interactions of children of age 3 − 6 and their teachers and assistants. The data describes proximity social interactions between 174 children and 34 adults in seven classes, recorded by Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Wireless Proximity Sensors carried by each participant. Interactions were recorded with a temporal resolution of 5 seconds, during periods of 5 consecutive days, for 10 consecutive months (overall 50 days of data collection) of a single academic year in a French pre-school. For the purpose of our study we rely on a pre-processed data set shared inand a temporal network reconstructed from the cleaned interaction signals as explained in, and we remove the data of interactions with and between adults, to focus on the childrens’ group dynamics.

Similarly to the university setting, we also divide the data according to the contexts that may impose different constraints on the emergence of possible group interactions. We differentiate between in-class periods, during which the social grouping of children was strongly influenced by the teachers’ instructions and scheduled activities, and out-of-class periods, when children could choose freely to interact with anyone from their own and potentially other classes. For more details on the data pre-processing, network reconstruction, and context selection, we refer to the Methods section.

Worked examples

We demonstrate with hypothetical examples the predicted risk of persistent PCC in Table 3. As an example, the predicted risk of persistent PCC from 3 to 24 months post-infection for a hypothetical male, with a history of asthma and a family history of ongoing problems due to COVID-19 was 8.1% (worked example 3). If a similar boy also had learning difficulties at school pre-pandemic, it would be 22.8% (worked example 4).

Table 3 
Hypothetical examples of predicted risk of persistent PCC, using our prediction models

* Family defined as “family in your house”

Variables highlighted in grey are only used as predictors in the persistent PCC 6 to 24 months post-infection model. Hence examples 1 and 2 have the same predicted risk of persistent PCC 3 to 24 months (i.e. the only characteristic that differs between examples 1 and 2 [having an education, health and care plan pre-pandemic] is not used to predict risk of persistent PCC 3 to 24 months). In contrast, predict risk of persistent PCC 6 to 24 months and 3 to 24 months differs for examples 3 and 4 because the characteristic that differs between the examples (learning difficulties at school pre-pandemic) is used in both prediction models

Student-focused interventions for classroom engagement (B: Moderate)—Practitioners could consider providing student-focused explicit teaching interventions to promote engagement in daily classroom routines for autistic students age 4–10 yr or in Grades 3–5 through individual or group interactions, with 5–40-min sessions either daily for 2 wk or through 28 lessons. Evidence includes Hanrahan et al. in a school in the United Kingdom: N = 15 autistic children ages 5–10 yr received an individually developed social story via an electronic device, delivered at 1x/school day (5 min) for 2 wk, and the intervention group showed significantly greater improvement on goal behaviors from baseline to the 6-wk follow-up compared with the control group. Kenworthy et al. in U.S. schools: N = 67 autistic children in Grades 3–5, ages 7–11 yr received group, school-based Unstuck and On-Target lessons with 28 lessons (30–40 min) over the course of a school year plus 2 parent training sessions and 1 classroom teacher session, and the intervention group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in the ability to follow directions, transition smoothly, and avoid getting stuck.

### 'Physical activity 4 everyone' school-based intervention to prevent decline in adolescent physical activity levels: 12 month (mid-intervention) report on a cluster randomised trial [^e13ccc3a]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Changes in physical activity from baseline to follow-up across subgroups (sex, baseline weight status and baseline activity level)

The subgroup interaction term indicated time by intervention effects that differed by subgroup for each variable: sex (p≤0.01), baseline weight status (p=≤0.01) and baseline physical activity status (p=≤0.01); therefore subgroup analyses were progressed for each. The 12-month physical activity analyses by subgroup are reported in table 3. A greater effect was observed in male students in the intervention group compared with the control group on mean minutes of MVPA per day (6.47 min (1.24 to 12.95), p=0.02) and percentage of wear time spent in MVPA (0.9%, p=0.02). No significant differences between groups for females were observed at 12-month follow-up. There were no detected differences between intervention and control based on weight status or activity level detected.

Process measures

Table 4 outlines process evaluation data collected from teachers and students at 12-month follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, 95.5% of teachers reported using pedometers to increase activity levels in PE, 70.3% reported incorporating student personal physical activity plans each term and providing feedback to students on these plans, and 75% reported the school offered organised physical activity at recess and/or lunchtimes, at least twice per week. The school change agent records showed that all schools had started use of the pedometers in PE classes, with four of the five schools (80%) using them with the desired frequency (figure 1). Similarly, while all schools had administered student physical activity plans at least once, three (60%) had administered these as per the desired termly standard (2 or 3 per student). All schools had implemented recess and/or lunch activities at least once per week, and four (80%) had these implemented at least twice per week. All schools had provided parents with additional information regarding physical activity via newsletters and the school website with the requested termly frequency.

### Anaesthetic specialist registrars in Ireland: current teaching practices and perceptions of their role as undergraduate teachers [^7be6ae59]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Teaching is an important responsibility of non-consultant hospital doctors. In Ireland, specialist registrars (SpRs) in anaesthesia are contractually obliged to teach medical students, other doctors and nurses. Both medical students and fellow non-consultant hospital doctors attribute between 30 and 40% of their knowledge gain to non-consultant hospital doctors.

Methods

We carried out a confidential telephone survey of anaesthetic SpRs in Ireland regarding their current teaching practices and the perceptions of their role as undergraduate teachers. All the SpRs currently working in clinical practice in Ireland were eligible.

Results

Fifty-five of the 79 (70%) SpRs responded to the questionnaire. Only 7 (12.7%) of the respondents said they had been well trained as a teacher. The majority of the respondents stated that they would attend a learning-to-teach course/workshop if one was available, and felt that such a course would improve their ability as a teacher. Only 8 (14.5%) agreed that adequate emphasis is placed on commitment to teaching in the assessment of SpRs, both by individual departments and by the College of Anaesthetists. Anaesthetic SpRs in Ireland spend a considerable amount of time each day teaching undergraduate medical students, the majority (68.9%) stated that they had inadequate time to prepare for teaching.

Conclusion

The majority of the respondents stated that they enjoy teaching, feel that they play an important role in undergraduate teaching but have inadequate time to prepare for teaching. An adequate emphasis is not placed on their commitment to teaching.

Working conditions

Table 5 shows the working conditions of domestic workers and informal traders. Domestic workers were more likely to have regular working hours (p = 0.004) and to be working indoors (p < 0.001) and to be earning > R3000 ($200) per month (p = 0.003). In contrast informal traders were more likely to be working 6-7 days per week (p < 0.001) and to be unpaid or paid in kind (p = 0.006). There were no other significant differences shown between working conditions of domestic workers and informal traders.

Table 5 
Working conditions of participating mothers

There were 118 workers who received payment from an employer, including almost all (76/77) domestic workers and a minority of informal traders (42/170). Most paid workers reported that they received a fixed salary (112/ 118; 94.9%), and that their salary was paid according to a rate that was either hourly (2/118; 1.7%), daily (24/118; 20.3%), weekly (18/118; 15.3%) or monthly (68/119; 57.1%). Some mothers reported that they had received pay when they were unable to work because they were sick (40/118; 33.9%). In this sub-group of paid employees, domestic workers were more likely than informal traders to be paid monthly (p < 0.001) and were more likely to receive sick pay (p = 0.02).

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^b8e6778e]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Randomized controlled trials of dietary intake interventions in children—The RCTs in the Expert Panel’s evidence review for overweight and obesity were reviewed to identify a total of 17 studies that specifically addressed dietary intake in normal children within the context of overweight and obesity prevention. Many of these studies evaluated dietary interventions designed to address the prevention of overweight and obesity by lowering fat intake and increasing fruit and vegetable intake to meet the published nutritional goal of five servings per day of fruits and vegetables. Most were school-based and often were part of multicomponent programs designed to simultaneously change dietary intake and increase physical activity levels. The age groups addressed ranged from preschoolers to teenagers, and the study sizes from 213 to over 5,000 subjects. Measures of overweight and obesity varied and included weight, BMI, BMI percentile, and BMI z-score, and dietary intake was assessed by a variety of methods, including parental report, self-report, diet records, and direct observation of meals. Most studies were minimally successful in improving dietary quality, with small decreases in fat intake, small increases in fruit and vegetable intake, and small increases in physical activity; however, measures of obesity were rarely changed. An example was a 2-year school-based health behavior intervention in children in grades 6–8 using sessions taught by classroom teachers focused on decreasing the consumption of high-fat foods, increasing fruit and vegetable intake, decreasing TV viewing, and increasing moderate and vigorous physical activity, and there was no attempt to change caloric intake. Obesity was defined as a composite indicator based on BMI and triceps skinfold thickness greater than or equal to age- and gender-specific 85th percentiles. After 2 years, fruit and vegetable consumption increased and TV viewing time decreased in boys and girls, there was no change in time spent in moderate and vigorous physical activity, the primary outcome of the trial, and prevalence of obesity decreased among girls but not boys. Another example is the Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health (CATCH), the largest school-based study ever funded in the United States, taking place in 96 schools, which resulted in improvement in children’s diets, with significantly lower saturated fat intakes.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analysis perspectives—Table 1 delineates cost components and examples by perspective (Health Care Sector, “Modified Societal,” Full Societal). Components and examples include health care costs paid by third-party payers (drug/device costs, hospital services, physician services, home care services, allied health), costs paid out-of-pocket by patients (drug copayment/coinsurance and user fees), patient-time costs (time spent seeking care), unpaid caregiver-time costs (time spent in caregiving), and productivity losses (formal/informal labor earnings lost, cost of unpaid lost productivity due to illness, cost of uncompensated household production). Broader sectors listed include social services, housing, legal or criminal justice, education, and environmental. Footnotes instruct that analysts should attempt to capture all relevant costs from a societal perspective and describe a “modified” societal perspective that includes some societal costs, such as patient time and lost productivity, but excludes costs from other sectors of the economy.

Occupational asthma (OA) outcomes after exposure cessation versus reduction—systematic reviews and comparative studies indicate that stopping exposure for an average of 31 months yielded recovery rates of 10 to 100% with a pooled estimate of 32% (95% confidence interval [CI], 26–38%), and the pooled prevalence of persisting airway hyperresponsiveness was 73% (95% CI, 66–79%). Seven studies compared outcome of OA in those who left exposure versus those reducing exposure; four studies found a better outcome in those who stopped exposure and three studies showed a similar outcome with reduction, and pooled analyses and an evidence-based review concluded that asthma outcome was better with complete removal. A Cochrane review confirmed benefit from stopping versus continuing exposure but considered data too limited to draw conclusions on reducing exposure. If patients continue in lower-exposure areas, they require careful monitoring at regular intervals and appropriate interventions.

### Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate) [^63e96858]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adults: Short-Term Treatment in ADHD

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (Study 7) was conducted in adults ages 18 to 55 (N=420) who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. In this study, patients were randomized to receive final doses of 30 mg, 50 mg, or 70 mg of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules or placebo for a total of four weeks of treatment. All patients receiving lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules were initiated on 30 mg for the first week of treatment. Patients assigned to the 50 mg and 70 mg dose groups were titrated by 20 mg per week until they achieved their assigned dose. The primary efficacy outcome was change in Total Score from baseline to endpoint in investigator ratings on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS). Endpoint was defined as the last post-randomization treatment week (i.e., Weeks 1 through 4) for which a valid score was obtained. All lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules dose groups were superior to placebo in the primary efficacy outcome (Study 7 in Table 6).

The second study was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, modified analog classroom study (Study 8) of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules to simulate a workplace environment in 142 adults ages 18 to 55 who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD. There was a 4-week open- label, dose optimization phase with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules (30 mg/day, 50 mg/day, or 70 mg/day in the morning). Patients were then randomized to one of two treatment sequences: 1) lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules (optimized dose) followed by placebo, each for one week, or 2) placebo followed by lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules, each for one week. Efficacy assessments occurred at the end of each week, using the Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP), a skill-adjusted math test that measures attention in ADHD. PERMP total score results from the sum of the number of math problems attempted plus the number of math problems answered correctly. Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules treatment, compared to placebo, resulted in a statistically significant improvement in attention across all post-dose time points, as measured by average PERMP total scores over the course of one assessment day, as well as at each time point measured. The PERMP assessments were administered at pre-dose (-0.5 hours) and at 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, and 14 hours post-dose (Study 8 in Table 6, Figure 6).

### The five-minute moment [^811bf905]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In today's hospital and clinic environment, the obstacles to bedside teaching for both faculty and trainees are considerable. As electronic health record systems become increasingly prevalent, trainees are spending more time performing patient care tasks from computer workstations, limiting opportunities to learn at the bedside. Physical examination skills rarely are emphasized, and low confidence levels, especially in junior faculty, pose additional barriers to teaching the bedside examination.

### 2025 ACC / AHA clinical practice guidelines core principles and development process: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^8421d2e9]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Patient education—Patient education is the delivery of information from clinicians to patients to improve health behavior and outcomes, and clinicians are ideally positioned to engage in meaningful dialogue with individuals who are at risk for or have cardiovascular conditions; education about self-care skills to prevent and manage risk factors and conditions is essential, and the clinical encounter provides a teachable moment to deliver structured education. Systematic reviews of educational interventions targeting secondary prevention in patients with coronary heart disease have demonstrated effectiveness in improving disease-related knowledge, healthy behaviors, and medication adherence; the majority of the programs used multiple sessions (median duration, 2 months) and the programs’ duration has a significant influence on outcomes, with those lasting >3 months having more benefit, although published studies are markedly heterogeneous in intensity, duration, delivery mode, resources needed, and outcome assessments including length of follow-up.

### Impact of school-based malaria case management on school attendance, health and education outcomes: a cluster randomised trial in Southern Malawi [^fef05d2f]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Children were informed that whenever they felt unwell, they could report to an LTK dispenser during break time for assistance. LTK dispensers followed a simple algorithm, recording symptoms reported and the actions taken in a treatment register. In the event of any complicated or urgent health complaint, the child’s caregiver was contacted and the child immediately referred to a local health centre.

Following the baseline surveys in 2011, the LTK intervention and training materials were refined across a series of stakeholder meetings between June 2012 and June 2013 at which point they were tested at a pilot training.Subsequently 97 teachers were trained for the trial in November and December 2013 (29 head teachers and 68 teachers). This development and piloting of the intervention had the consequence of extending the time between baseline and follow-up surveys. The LTK dispensers received regular supervision and monitoring visits from the study team, during which supplies were checked, referral forms reviewed, and protocols and treatment registers verified through direct observation of schoolchildren receiving a consultation. Overall, implementation ran between December 2013 and March 2015 in the schools, covering two rainy seasons.

A passive surveillance system based on routine reporting systems used by the MoEST was used to monitor adverse events. A simultaneous active surveillance system whereby study officers interviewed head teachers on a termly basis was also established. Where possible, reported cause of death was recorded using head teachers’ reports, as death certificates were frequently unavailable.

Assessments

The primary outcome (school attendance) was measured in all schools using two methods: daily attendance rate and attendance during unannounced spot check visits, both assessed via days absent. Daily attendance was recorded by the class teachers on standardised 5-week long class registers generated using full enrolment lists for each school. These were distributed to the teachers to be filled in daily for each child and were collected in by the study team. Spot check attendance was assessed through unannounced school visits by study officers at least once a term for children being followed from classes 2, 4 and 6 (a maximum of five rounds) in which presence or absence was documented for every child in the class. As the intervention took place across two academic years they were followed into classes 3, 5 and 7, respectively, as they moved up over the course of the study. If the child was absent, a specific absentee code was assigned based on the reason for absence reported by siblings, classmates or teacher. Transfers and dropouts were tracked through the daily attendance registers and the spot check visits.

Recommendations for pediatric providers—Promoting the 5 Rs: Pediatric providers can promote the 5 Rs of early childhood education by encouraging parents to read together daily as a favorite family activity that strengthens family relationships and builds language, literacy, and social-emotional skills that last a lifetime; rhyme, play, sing, talk, and cuddle with their young children throughout the day; create and sustain routines for children around sleep, meals, and play; provide frequent rewards for everyday successes, especially for effort toward worthwhile goals such as helping; and remember that relationships that are nurturing and secure provide the foundation of healthy child development.

Circadian sleep physiology in adults indicates typical sleep need and timing. Most individuals require between 7 and 8 hours of sleep per night to be fully alert, although some require only 6 hours, and others may require as many as 10 hours per night. Humans operate on a daily cycle that is generally slightly longer than 24 hours, with sleep drive reaching a peak in the early morning hours and a small increase in the early to midafternoon.

### DNA double-strand break end synapsis by DNA loop extrusion [^fff38326]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Broken DNA-end synapsis is a key but understudied step in DSB repair. Our theory provides a new framework for rethinking this initial step of the NHEJ process in the context of our current understanding of 3D chromosome organization by loop extrusion. In summary, we predict that DNA loop extrusion plays a previously underappreciated role in DNA repair by mediating DNA double-strand break synapsis.
