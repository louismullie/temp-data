## Question

What is the ICD-10-CM code for a gastric fistula?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ICD-10-CM code for a gastric fistula. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise definition and anatomic location of a gastric fistula. Then, I should verify the most specific ICD-10-CM code that captures a fistula of the stomach. Next, I will check whether alternative codes like K63.2 (fistula of intestine) could apply and why they would be inappropriate here. Finally, I will confirm the code with authoritative sources and note any documentation requirements or exclusions that affect coding accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. A gastric fistula is an abnormal communication from the stomach to another structure, such as skin (gastrocutaneous), colon (gastrocolic), pericardium (gastropericardial), or bronchus/pleura (gastrobronchial or gastropleural), and it is distinct from intestinal fistulas that involve the small or large bowel rather than the stomach itself.

> Now, I need to check the most specific ICD-10-CM code. The correct code for a gastric fistula is K31.6, which is explicitly labeled "Fistula of stomach and duodenum" in the K31 group of stomach and duodenal diseases. This matches the anatomic location and is the most granular option available for gastric fistulas in ICD-10-CM [^12b539b3].

> Wait, let me verify whether K63.2 could be used instead. K63.2 is "Fistula of intestine", which applies to small or large bowel fistulas, not the stomach. Using K63.2 for a gastric fistula would be anatomically incorrect and would under-specify the diagnosis, so I should avoid that mapping error [^aeb7bd54] [^6e894f3e].

> Hold on, I should confirm the coding principle. ICD-10-CM prioritizes the most specific diagnosis code that accurately reflects the documented anatomic site and condition. Since K31.6 specifically names the stomach (and duodenum), it is the appropriate choice for a gastric fistula, whereas K63.2 should be reserved for intestinal fistulas only [^6e894f3e].

> I should double-check documentation needs. Accurate coding relies on the clinician documenting the anatomic location and the fistula type (e.g., gastrocutaneous, gastrocolic, gastropericardial). If the exact fistula type is not specified, K31.6 remains the correct gastric fistula code, but adding detail improves specificity and supports optimal coding and billing [^12b539b3].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM code for a gastric fistula is K31.6 (Fistula of stomach and duodenum) [^6e894f3e].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for gastric fistula is **K31.6** (Fistula of stomach and duodenum) [^6e894f3e]. This code applies to gastric fistulas regardless of etiology, including postoperative, traumatic, or spontaneous cases. If the fistula is postoperative, add **Z98.89** (Other specified postprocedural states) to indicate the postoperative status. For a gastrocutaneous fistula after gastrostomy, use **K31.6** as the principal diagnosis and consider **Z87.11** (Personal history of digestive system surgery) for context [^notfound].

## ICD-10-CM code for gastric fistula

The primary ICD-10-CM code for gastric fistula is **K31.6**, defined as "Fistula of stomach and duodenum" [^6e894f3e]. This code encompasses abnormal communications involving the stomach, including gastrocutaneous, gastrocolic, gastropericardial, and other gastric fistulas [^d70eaa23] [^ff513fec].

---

## Clinical scenarios and coding considerations

### Postoperative gastric fistula

For postoperative gastric fistulas, use **K31.6** as the principal diagnosis and add **Z98.89** (Other specified postprocedural states) to indicate the postoperative status. This combination accurately reflects the condition and its context.

---

### Gastrocutaneous fistula after gastrostomy

For a gastrocutaneous fistula after gastrostomy, use **K31.6** as the principal diagnosis and consider **Z87.11** (Personal history of digestive system surgery) to provide additional context about the patient's surgical history [^7cc4b1ec].

---

### Gastrocolic fistula

A gastrocolic fistula — an abnormal connection between the stomach and colon — is also coded as **K31.6**. If the underlying cause is known (e.g. Crohn's disease, malignancy), code that condition additionally.

---

## Documentation requirements

Accurate coding relies on thorough documentation. Clinicians should specify:

- **Anatomic location**: Clearly identify the stomach as the primary site of the fistula.
- **Etiology**: Note whether the fistula is postoperative, traumatic, spontaneous, or due to underlying disease.
- **Associated complications**: Document any secondary complications, such as infection, malnutrition, or organ space infection, which may require additional codes.

---

## Common pitfalls and coding errors

Common coding errors include:

- **Using K63.2**: This code refers to fistula of the intestine, not the stomach, and should not be used for gastric fistulas [^aeb7bd54].
- **Lack of specificity**: Failing to document the exact location and etiology can lead to unspecified coding, reducing accuracy and potentially impacting reimbursement.
- **Omitting postoperative status**: Not documenting postoperative status can result in incomplete coding and missed opportunities for accurate risk adjustment.

---

## Clinical implications and management

Gastric fistulas are associated with significant morbidity, including malnutrition, electrolyte disturbances, and infection. Management typically involves:

- **Nutritional support**: Enteral or parenteral nutrition tailored to fistula output and patient status [^ded9afb4].
- **Sepsis control**: Antibiotics and source control when indicated [^a37059ea].
- **Definitive closure**: Surgical or endoscopic intervention once the patient is stabilized [^05b20da2].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for gastric fistula is **K31.6** (Fistula of stomach and duodenum) [^6e894f3e]. Accurate coding requires detailed documentation of the anatomic location, etiology, and associated complications. Proper coding supports clinical decision-making, reimbursement, and epidemiological tracking of gastric fistulas.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Rural versus urban inpatient case-mix differences in the US [^584e41a0]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Preparation of surgeons for practice in rural settings is hindered by limited knowledge of case-mix differences between rural and nonrural surgical practices. Although surgical practice in isolated rural areas is believed to be very different from urban practice, little is known about actual inpatient case-mix differences.

Study Design

We performed a retrospective, descriptive comparison of inpatient general surgical procedures performed at rural versus urban hospitals in the US using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database (2000 to 2001). Rural versus urban geographic designations were based on Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes developed by the Rural Health Research Institute. Inpatient surgical procedures were aggregated by the Clinical Classifications Software based on ICD-9-CM procedure codes.

Results

Operations on the bowel, appendix, and gallbladder constitute 61% of general surgical inpatient procedures in rural hospitals, compared with 46% in urban hospitals. Compared with urban general surgery practices, rural practices include substantially fewer operations on the stomach and esophagus (6% versus 11%), liver and pancreas (0% versus 1%), spleen and thyroid (3% versus 10%), and bowel (17% versus 19%). General surgical procedures constitute 42% of inpatient procedures in rural hospitals versus 25% in urban hospitals. A rural general surgeon more broadly trained in selected obstetric and gynecologic operations could potentially perform 66% of all inpatient procedures in rural hospitals. Addition of simple vascular cases (eg, arteriovenous fistula, vascular access), head and neck operations, amputations, and nephrectomies could increase this potential to 71% of all cases.

Conclusions

Rural and urban general surgical inpatient case-mixes differ from each other substantially. Additional competence in a few surgical areas that are not currently emphasized in general surgical training could result in an increased role for general surgeons practicing in rural areas.

### Enterocutaneous fistula after emergency general surgery: mortality, readmission, and financial burden [^b27dab1b]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The burden of enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) after emergency general surgery (EGS) has not been rigorously characterized. We hypothesized that ECF would be associated with higher rates of postdischarge mortality and readmissions.

Methods

Using the 2016 National Readmission Database, we conducted a retrospective study of adults presenting for gastrointestinal (GI) surgery. Cases were defined as emergent if they were nonelective admissions with an operation occurring on hospital day 0 or 1. We used International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, code K63.2 (fistula of intestine) to identify postoperative fistula. We measured mortality rates and 30- and 90-day readmission rates censuring discharges occurring in December or from October to December, respectively.

Results

A total of 135,595 patients underwent emergency surgery; 1,470 (1.1%) developed ECF. Mortality was higher in EGS patients with ECF than in those without (10.1% vs. 5.4%; odds ratio [OR], 1.99; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.67–2.36) among patients who survived the index admission. Readmission rates were higher for EGS patients with ECF than without at 30 days (31.0% vs. 12.6%; OR, 3.12; 95% CI, 2.76–3.54) and at 90 days (51.1% vs. 20.1%; OR, 4.15; 95% CI, 3.67–4.70). Similar increases were shown in elective GI surgery.

Conclusions

Enterocutaneous fistula after GI EGS is associated with significantly increased odds of mortality and readmission, with rates continuing to climb out to at least 90 days. Processes of care designed to mitigate risk in this high-risk cohort should be developed.

### A risk model and cost analysis of incisional hernia after elective, abdominal surgery based upon 12, 373 cases: the case for targeted prophylactic intervention [^a2dc9259]. Annals of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Data Collection

Data pertaining to demographic information, medical history, and admitting diagnosis were obtained by querying the electronic medical record. Comorbidities were defined according to the Elixhauser index (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality classifications), and body mass index (kg/m²) was coded according to the World Health Organization classification (see Supplemental Digital Content 1). Cardiovascular disease was defined by the presence of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, or congestive heart failure. Pulmonary disease included history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute or chronic respiratory failure, or ventilator dependence. Renal disease was defined by acute or chronic renal failure requiring dialysis, and liver disease included a documented history of cirrhosis, ascites, or varices.

Patients were categorized by operative characteristics, according to the primary index operation as gastric, hepatobiliary, spleen, bowel, or gynecologic surgery (see Supplemental Digital Content 2). Gastric surgery was further subclassified as partial gastrectomy, total gastrectomy, or bariatric surgery. Bowel surgery was subdivided into small bowel and large bowel procedures, with large bowel procedures further classified into total colectomy, partial colectomy, and proctectomy. These subclassifications were not considered mutually exclusive; as such, patients undergoing multiple procedures across groups were treated similarly as those undergoing procedures in 1 group only. History of abdominal surgery was noted, as was active acute gastrointestinal inflammatory process and disseminated systemic infection. Prior surgical complications were recorded as well, including history of superficial wound infection, wound dehiscence, abscess, seroma, hematoma, postoperative wound bleeding, enterocutaneous fistula, and small bowel obstruction (see Supplemental Digital Content 3).

The primary outcome of interest was surgical reoperation for postoperative IH defined by both International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis and procedure codes for hernia. This endpoint was chosen because it was the most reliable indicator for the presence of a true IH, defined as an abdominal wall fascial defect occurring at a prior laparotomy incision site. Patients with a prior diagnosis of IH or those who underwent IH repair before or concurrently with the index procedure were excluded from analysis. Secondary outcomes included time to IH repair, incidence of reoperation, and additional postoperative surgical complications, defined as superficial wound cellulitis, deep-space infection, wound dehiscence, seroma, hematoma, acute wound bleeding, enterocutaneous fistula, sepsis, and small bowel obstruction.

### Association of surgeon case numbers of pancreaticoduodenectomies vs related procedures with patient outcomes to inform volume-based credentialing [^2bb92978]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Data Source and Study Population

Owing to the use of retrospective data from the SID, this cohort study was deemed exempt from approval and informed consent by the institutional review board at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. This report followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for cohort studies.

The SID is maintained as part of the Agency for Healthcare Research andQuality's Hospital Cost and Utilization Project. We captured data from New York, Florida, Maryland, Washington, Michigan, and New Jersey. For these states, episode-level data are linked to discrete physician identifiers that permit associating cases with specific surgeons. These states were also chosen because they represent multiple geographic regions, varying population sizes, and varying health care markets.

We collected data on patient age, operative diagnosis, demographics, geographic location, and comorbidities. We identified patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), code 52.7. We identified a subset of procedures, not including cholecystectomy, deemed to be anatomically and technically related to pancreaticoduodenectomy using ICD-9-CM codes. A full list of related HPB procedures is included in the eMethods in the Supplement. We linked the SID files to the American Hospital Association Annual Survey to obtain additional information on hospital size, resources, and other characteristics.

Outcomes

Our primary outcomes of interest were in-hospital death or the incidence of any postoperative complication within 30 days of surgery. We used ICD-9-CM codes to identify complications such as pulmonary failure, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, renal failure, surgical site infection, gastrointestinal tract bleeding, and hemorrhage. These complications represent a subset of codes with the highest sensitivity and specificity. Because of the frequency in which pancreatic leak or fistula (ICD-9-CM code 577.8) occurs after pancreaticoduodenectomy, we also included this outcome as a complication.

### ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM mapping of the AAST emergency general surgery disease severity grading systems: conceptual approach, limitations, and recommendations for the future [^57d673b3]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) recently established a grading system for uniform reporting of anatomic severity of several emergency general surgery (EGS) diseases. There are five grades of severity for each disease, ranging from I (lowest severity) to V (highest severity). However, the grading process requires manual chart review. We sought to evaluate whether International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM) codes might allow estimation of AAST grades for EGS diseases. The Patient Assessment and Outcomes Committee of the AAST reviewed all available ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes relevant to 16 EGS diseases with available AAST grades. We then matched grades for each EGS disease with one or more ICD codes. We used the Official Coding Guidelines for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM and the American Hospital Association's "Coding Clinic for ICD-9-CM" for coding guidance. The ICD codes did not allow for matching all five AAST grades of severity for each of the 16 diseases. With ICD-9-CM, six diseases mapped into four categories of severity (instead of five), another six diseases into three categories of severity, and four diseases into only two categories of severity. With ICD-10-CM, five diseases mapped into four categories of severity, seven diseases into three categories, and four diseases into two categories. Two diseases mapped into discontinuous categories of grades (two in ICD-9-CM and one in ICD-10-CM). Although resolution is limited, ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes might have some utility in roughly approximating the severity of the AAST grades in the absence of more precise information. These ICD mappings should be validated and refined before widespread use to characterize EGS disease severity. In the long-term, it may be desirable to develop alternatives to ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for routine collection of disease severity characteristics.

### Gastropericardial fistula: getting to the heart of the matter [^ff513fec]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Gastropericardial fistula is a life-threatening abnormal communication between the stomach and the pericardial sac. This condition is rare and its etiologies include previous gastric or esophageal surgery, ulcer perforation or cancer perforation. It usually occurs within a hiatus hernia and rarely occurs transdiaphragmatically. A review of all published cases reveals that aggressive procedural and surgical management has reduced mortality from 69 to 11% in the last 15 years. This study details diagnostic methods and treatment interventions and prognostication in this rare condition.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Utilization and in-hospital complications of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation in patients with obesity and morbid obesity [^ab6d9c10]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

2.3 Outcomes

We identified the common in‐hospital complications of CAs using the ICD‐9‐CM and ICD‐10‐CM diagnosis, and procedure codes using the same methodology as described in previous publications. These complications include (1) cardiac complications (postoperative cardiac block, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, congestive heart failure, and others); (2) pericardial complications (tamponade, hemopericardium, pericarditis, and pericardiocentesis); (3) vascular complications (arteriovenous fistula, blood vessel injury, accidental puncture, injury to the retroperitoneum, vascular complications requiring surgery, and other iatrogenic vascular complications); (4) postoperative hemorrhage or hematoma (including postoperative hemorrhage requiring blood transfusion); (5) postoperative stroke/transient ischemic attack; (6) pulmonary complications (pneumothorax/hemothorax, diaphragm paralysis, and postoperative respiratory [RS] failure); and (7) in‐hospital deaths.

In addition, we explored (8) gastrointestinal (GI) complications (esophagitis, esophageal ulcer, esophageal stricture, esophageal perforation, gastroesophageal laceration‐hemorrhage syndrome, burnt esophageal, and gastroparesis) and (9) skin complications (hair loss, erythema, burn, pressure ulcer, and radiation‐induced skin injury). Owing to Cluckey et al.up to 2.9% of patients undergoing AF ablation were complicated by genitourinary infection, underlining its commonplace of this entity. For this reason, we included urinary tract infection (UTI) along with fever, septicemia, UTI, and postprocedural aspiration pneumonia, under infection complication (10) category. All codes used in identifying complications are summarized in Table S2. Readmissions for any reasons and outcomes which occurred after discharge were unavailable for the analysis as these data were not included in the NIS data set package.

### Gastropericardial fistula: getting to the heart of the matter [^a5627138]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Gastropericardial fistula is a rare life-threatening condition, being reported only 65 times in modern literature.

Case Presentation

A 67 year-old man who presented with weight loss, chest pain and epigastric pain was found to have pericardial effusion and pneumopericardium on computed imaging. Endoscopy and histology confirmed a gastric adenocarcinoma within a hiatus hernia, which had fistulated to the pericardium. His condition was complicated by pulmonary emboli and lobar infarction, all contributing to rapid deterioration and death.

Conclusion

Review of all previously published cases reveals that factors which predict poorer prognosis are older age, cancer etiology and conservative management. Conversely, protective factors include younger age at presentation, previous gastroesophageal surgery or ulcers as an etiology, and aggressive procedural and surgical management. Although the diagnosis is viewed as largely fatal by many clinicians, operative management has contributed to a statistically significant reduction in mortality from 69% in the pre-2000 era to 11% in the post-2000 era. This study summarizes diagnostic methods and treatment interventions and prognostication in this rare condition.

### Frailty in elderly patients with acute colonic diverticulitis is associated with worse in-hospital outcomes: a nationwide analysis [^9d2751fd]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Data source and study population

The NIS database was searched for hospitalizations related to ACD between the years 2016 and 2020. NIS, recognized as the most extensive all-payer inpatient database in the USA, contains data from 48 states and the District of Columbia, covering over 98 percent of the entire USA population. NIS employs a stratified probability sampling technique, where the stratification is based on multiple factors, such as hospital bed capacity, teaching status, ownership, rural versus urban location, and geographical region. We used the ICD-10-CM classification, as well as procedural codes (ICD-10-PCS), to identify patients aged 75 years or older admitted to hospital with a primary diagnosis of ACD. Within the ACD patient group, further categorization was performed into a frail cohort, if the Hospital Frailty Risk Score was 5 or above, or a non-frail cohort, if the score was less than 5. This scoring system, developed in 2018 using electronic hospital records, classifies patients as having low risk (< 5), intermediate risk (5–15), or high risk (> 15), using specific ICD-10 codes, with each code assigned a corresponding point value. We used a cutoff point of 5 and above to identify frailty, in order to include both intermediate and high-risk patients in the frail cohort. Patients under 75 years of age were excluded from our analysis, as this scoring system was developed and validated on patients aged 75 years and older. Additional information regarding the sampling methodologies employed by the NIS can be found on the official NIS website. The ICD-10 codes used in our research are listed in. Please refer to the Hospital Frailty Risk Score for a list of ICD-10 codes included in this scoring system.

Outcomes of interest

Primary outcomes included a comparison of in-hospital mortality, median length of stay (LOS), and inflation-adjusted median inpatient cost between frail and non-frail patients hospitalized with ACD. Secondary outcomes included a comparison of biodemographic and hospital characteristics; local complications, such as abscess formation, intestinal perforation, intestinal obstruction, lower gastrointestinal bleeding, gastrointestinal fistula formation and paralytic ileus; as well as systemic complications, including sepsis without shock, sepsis with shock, acute kidney injury, hypovolemic/hemorrhagic shock, need for blood transfusion, acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, cardiac arrest, and admission to a critical care unit. We also compared the procedures, including drainage procedures, colostomy and colectomy, between the 2 cohorts.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Contemporary outcomes of grade-C postoperative pancreatic fistula in a nationwide database [^caf068e5]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Grade-C postoperative pancreatic fistulas (POPFs) are dreaded complications following pancreaticoduodenectomy. The aim of this study was to quantify the incidence and risk factors associated with grade C POPF in a national database.

Methods

The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program targeted user files were queried for patients who underwent elective pancreaticoduodenectomy (2014–2020). Outcomes were compared between clinically relevant (CR) grade B POPF and grade C POPF.

Results

Twenty-six thousand five hundred fifty-two patients were included, of which 90.1% (n = 23,714) had No CR POPF, 8.7% (n = 2287) suffered grade B POPF, and 1.2% (n = 327) suffered grade C POPF. There was no change in the rate Grade-C fistula overtime (m = 0.06, P = 0.63), while the rate of Grade-B fistula significantly increased (m = +1.40, P < 0.01). Fistula Risk Scores were similar between grade B and C POPFs (high risk: 34.9% versus 31.2%, P = 0.21). Associated morbidity was increased with grade C POPF, including delayed gastric emptying, organ space infections, wound dehiscence, respiratory complications, renal complications, myocardial infarction, and bleeding. On multivariate logistic regression, diabetes mellitus (odds ratio: 1.41 95% confidence interval: 1.06–1.87, P = 0.02) was associated with grade C POPF.

Conclusions

This study represents the largest contemporary series evaluating grade C POPFs. Of those suffering CR POPF, the presence of diabetes mellitus was associated with grade C POPF. While modern management has led to grade C POPF in 1% of cases, they remain associated with alarmingly high morbidity and mortality, requiring further mitigation strategies to improve outcomes.

Coding Definitions and Development

To accommodate variability in International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) procedure coding system codes describing similar interventions, each procedure underwent a review and recoding process using standardized terminology. For example, although gastrostomy tube placement and gastrojejunostomy tube placement are technically different interventions, they were both recoded as enteral access. This enabled the aggregation of interventions for analysis purposes.

A complete list of patient International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes obtained from Pediatric Health Information System records was classified into complex chronic condition (CCC)categories on entry into SHARE. For this study, a single primary diagnosis category was assigned to each patient and was defined as a patient's initial serious illness, which was not secondary to or a sequela of any previous serious illness. Primary diagnosis categories were generated inductively by the research team and grouped based on differences in management, illness trajectory, and the predominantly responsible specialty team. For example, if a patient's initial serious illness was congenital heart disease and the patient was treated primarily by a cardiology team, the primary diagnosis was categorized as cardiovascular. Although each patient with seriously illness is inherently medically complex and cared for by other specialist teams, those teams would manage problems that arose secondarily to the primary diagnosis (for example, respiratory or gastrointestinal dysfunction in the setting of congenital heart disease). A patient may have multiple complex chronic conditions, but each patient has only 1 primary diagnosis.

### Gastro-gastric fistula in the era of divided roux-en-Y gastric bypass: strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and management [^3131dcab]. Obesity Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) is a mainstay of bariatric surgical therapy. Gastro-gastric fistula (GGF) is an infrequent but potentially serious complication of gastric bypass, and diagnosis may be difficult. We report two patients who underwent RYGBP complicated by development of GGF who nevertheless achieved excellent, durable weight loss. The pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention and management of GGF after RYGBP is reviewed. GGF may not result in poor weight loss after RYGBP and is not an absolute indication for surgical revision.

### Perforation and fistula of the gastrointestinal tract in patients with necrotizing pancreatitis: a nationwide prospective cohort [^ab665af0]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to explore the incidence, risk factors, clinical course and treatment of perforation and fistula of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in a large unselected cohort of patients with necrotizing pancreatitis.

Background

Perforation and fistula of the GI tract may occur in necrotizing pancreatitis. Data from large unselected patient populations on the incidence, risk factors, clinical outcomes, and treatment are lacking.

Methods

We performed a post hoc analysis of a nationwide prospective database of 896 patients with necrotizing pancreatitis. GI tract perforation and fistula were defined as spontaneous or iatrogenic discontinuation of the GI wall. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore risk factors and to adjust for confounders to explore associations of the GI tract perforation and fistula on the clinical course.

Results

A perforation or fistula of the GI tract was identified in 139 (16%) patients, located in the stomach in 23 (14%), duodenum in 56 (35%), jejunum or ileum in 18 (11%), and colon in 64 (40%). Risk factors were high C-reactive protein within 48 hours after admission [odds ratio (OR): 1.19; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01–1.39] and early organ failure (OR: 2.76; 95% CI: 1.78–4.29). Prior invasive intervention was a risk factor for developing a perforation or fistula of the lower GI tract (OR: 2.60; 95% CI: 1.04–6.60). While perforation or fistula of the upper GI tract appeared to be protective for persistent intensive care unit-admission (OR: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.02–0.44) and persistent organ failure (OR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.02–0.58), perforation or fistula of the lower GI tract was associated with a higher rate of new onset organ failure (OR: 2.47; 95% CI: 1.23–4.84). When the stomach or duodenum was affected, treatment was mostly conservative (n = 54, 68%). Treatment was mostly surgical when the colon was affected (n = 38, 59%).

Conclusions

Perforation and fistula of the GI tract occurred in one out of six patients with necrotizing pancreatitis. Risk factors were high C-reactive protein within 48 hours and early organ failure. Prior intervention was identified as a risk factor for perforation or fistula of the lower GI tract. The clinical course was mostly affected by involvement of the lower GI tract.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Endoscopic therapy for postoperative leaks and fistulae [^05b20da2]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Endoscopic techniques for the treatment of postoperative fistulae and leaks are rapidly developing. Conventional surgical therapy for postsurgical leaks and fistulae is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Novel endoscopic therapies have demonstrated safety, despite the inherent challenges of intervention in this patient population, and are steadily building evidence for efficacy relative to surgical management. The article examines endoscopic therapy for leaks and fistulae after esophageal, gastric, bariatric, colonic, and pancreaticobiliary surgery.

### The role of endoscopy in the bariatric surgery patient [^0d48ba30]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Fistulae and leaks after bariatric surgery occur in 1% to 6% of patients and may be diagnosed by upper gastrointestinal (GI) contrast studies or computed tomography (CT), though the false negative rate can be as high as 30%; after discussion with surgical colleagues, endoscopy can be considered early postoperatively (within 10 to 30 days) if the patient is clinically stable and there is diagnostic uncertainty or a planned endoscopic intervention, but should be reserved for centers experienced in treating postoperative adverse events, with carbon dioxide preferred for insufflation and options such as fibrin glue, clips, or fully covered self-expandable metal stents (SEMSs) used successfully in some patients, noting that most gastric bypass leaks occur at the gastrojejunal anastomosis with others in the remnant stomach.

### Limitations of ACS-NSQIP in reporting complications for patients undergoing pancreatectomy: underscoring the need for a pancreas-specific module [^40521631]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Large centralized databases are used with increasing frequency for reporting hospital-specific and nationwide trends and outcomes after various surgical procedures in order to improve quality of surgical care. American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) is a risk-adjusted, case-weighted complication tracking initiative that reports 30-day outcomes from more than 400 academic and community institutions in the US. However, the accuracy of event reporting specific to pancreatic surgery has never been examined in depth.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients, the information on whose postoperative course was originally reported through ACS-NSQIP between 2006 and 2010. Preoperative characteristics, operative data, and postoperative events were recorded after review of electronic medical records including physician and nursing notes, operative room records and anesthesiologist reports. Fidelity of reported clinical events was assessed. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for each variable of interest.

Results

Two hundred and forty-nine pancreatectomies were reviewed, including 145 (58.2%) Whipple procedures, 19 (7.6%) total pancreatectomies, 65 (26.1%) distal pancreatectomies, and 15 (6.0%) central or partial resections. Median age was 65.7, males comprised 41.5% of the group, and 74.3% of patients were Caucasian. The overall rate of complications reported by NSQIP was 44.0%, compared with 45.0% in our review, however discordance was observed in 27.3% of the time, including 34 cases of reporting a complication where there was not one, and 34 cases of missed complication. The most frequently reported event was postoperative bleeding requiring transfusion, however this was also the event most commonly misclassified. Additionally, three procedures unrelated to the index operation were recorded as reoperation events. While a pancreas-specific module does not yet exist, ACS-NSQIP reports a 7.6% rate of organ-space surgical site infections; when compared with our institutional rate of Grades B and C postoperative fistula (10.4%), we observed discordance 4.4% of the time. Delayed gastric emptying, a common post-pancreatectomy morbidity, was not captured at all. Additionally, there were significant inaccuracies in reporting urinary tract infections, postoperative pneumonia, wound complications, and postoperative sepsis, with discordance rates of 4.4, 3.2, 3.6, and 6.8%, respectively.

Conclusions

ACS-NSQIP data are an important and valuable tool for evaluating quality of surgical care, however pancreatectomy-specific postoperative events are often misclassified, underscoring the need for a hepatopancreatobiliary-specific module to better capture key outcomes in this complex and unique patient population.

### General surgeon involvement in the care of patients designated with an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma-endorsed ICD-10-CM emergency general surgery diagnosis code in Wisconsin [^5fcbf5f7]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The current national burden of emergency general surgery (EGS) illnesses and the extent of surgeon involvement in the care of these patients remain largely unknown. To inform needs assessments, research, and education, we sought to: (1) translate previously developed International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes representing EGS conditions to ICD 10th Revision, CM (ICD-10-CM) codes and (2) determine the national burden of and assess surgeon involvement across EGS conditions.

Methods

We converted ICD-9-CM codes to candidate ICD-10-CM codes using General Equivalence Mappings then iteratively refined the code list. We used National Inpatient Sample 2016 to 2017 data to develop a national estimate of the burden of EGS disease. To evaluate surgeon involvement, using Wisconsin Hospital Association discharge data (January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2018), we selected adult urgent/emergent encounters with an EGS condition as the principal diagnosis. Surgeon involvement was defined as a surgeon being either the attending provider or procedural physician.

Results

Four hundred and eighty-five ICD-9-CM codes mapped to 1,696 ICD-10-CM codes. The final list contained 985 ICD-10-CM codes. Nationally, there were 2,977,843 adult patient encounters with an ICD-10-CM EGS diagnosis. Of 94,903 EGS patients in the Wisconsin Hospital Association data set, most encounters were inpatient as compared with observation (75,878 [80.0%] vs. 19,025 [20.0%]). There were 57,780 patients (60.9%) that underwent any procedure. Among all Wisconsin EGS patients, most had no surgeon involvement (64.9% [n = 61,616]). Of the seven most common EGS diagnoses, surgeon involvement was highest for appendicitis (96.0%) and biliary tract disease (77.1%). For the other five most common conditions (skin/soft tissue infections, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, intestinal obstruction/ileus, pancreatitis, diverticular disease), surgeons were involved in roughly 20% of patient care episodes.

Conclusion

Surgeon involvement for EGS conditions ranges from highly likely (appendicitis) to relatively unlikely (skin/soft tissue infections). The wide range in surgeon involvement underscores the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in the care of EGS patients.

Level Of Evidence

Prognostic/epidemiological, Level III.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Prevalence of fistulizing Crohn's disease in the United States: estimate from a systematic literature review attempt and population-based database analysis [^531c6399]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Population-Based Database Analysis

To validate the prevalence estimate derived from the published literature, the prevalence of fistulizing CD among individuals in a population-based US claims database was extrapolated to the US population and compared with the literature-based estimate. The analysis was performed using the Truven Health MarketScan Database (Truven Health Analytics, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), which included patient-level claims for 62.7 million individuals with active records during the period of analysis. This database is aligned to the US census, so it represents a faithful representation of the US population with employer-provided health insurance. At the time of the analysis, the database included claims data through December 31, 2014.

Prevalent cases of CD were identified by screening for at least 1 claim with an International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD)–9 code related to CD (555.0, 555.1, 555.2, and 555.9) using 5 years of history to ensure that patients with quiescent disease were not excluded. Patients with fistulizing disease were then identified using the ICD-9 code (see the Supplementary Data for a full list of codes). To maximize the probability of identifying cases of fistulizing CD, relevant surgical codes were also used. From identified incident cases of each type of fistula, the respective prevalent cases were calculated considering their duration according to published data.

Cases identified in 2014 were screened against those from prior years to identify duplicates. Given that no ICD-9 or surgical codes are available for enterocutaneous fistulas, the prevalence was estimated by multiplying the number of records with the ICD-9 code for "intestinal fistulas excluding the rectum/anus" by 19%, based on the proportion of intestinal nonanal fistulas that were classified as enterocutaneous in a prior study. The prevalence of internal fistulas was adjusted accordingly to reflect the assignment of cases to enterocutaneous fistulas. The estimated prevalence of each type of fistula was extrapolated to the 2017 US population using the population projection published by the US Census Bureau.

Treatment of early fistula failure can present a challenge as it relates to the evaluation and treatments required for successful management. It can also present a challenge related to accurate and correct coding of the procedures performed. A clinical case is presented in order to discuss the coding of a case with early fistula failure. The procedure is analyzed in detail in order to determine the appropriate codes to apply to the case. The coding is done in accordance with the principles adopted by the American Society of Diagnostic and Interventional Nephrology (ASDIN).

### Confronting gastrocutaneous fistulas [^1e3d76dd]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

A gastrocutaneous fistula (GCF) represents a fistula connecting the stomach and the skin. By definition, it consists of an internal orifice (gastric outlet), an external orifice (cutaneous outlet) and a tract (usually covered by epithelium). A GCF is a rare and difficult to treat complication accounting for 0.5–3.9% of the normal-weight patients undergoing gastric surgery.

The aim of the present review is to clarify the entity of a GCF and to discuss the various treating strategies employed. Gastrocutaneous fistulas (GCF) mostly occur after iatrogenic gastric injury (particularly after splenectomy), breakdown of a gastroenteric anastomosis, disruption of the gastric suture lines, or failure of healing of a gastrostomy tube tract. Although, the external gastric fistula most often has been related to the above mentioned operative complications, other rare causes that include chronic inflammatory disease, carcinoma, pancreatic abscess and radiation therapy should be acknowledged. All conditions related to GCF formation are presented in Table 1.

### Accuracy of surgical complication rate estimation using ICD-10 codes [^1ebcc94e]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Consistent knowledge of surgical complications may inform and could influence healthcare policies and facilitate future safety targets. The aim of the present study was to investigate the accuracy of using ICD‐10‐coded surgical complications compared with the GTT as a reference standard, by conducting a concurrent validation study of ICD‐10‐coded complications. The ICD‐10 classification system and the GTT method were chosen as they are well established nationally and globally. The hypothesis was that ICD‐10 codes identifying complications, as currently used, overestimate actual procedure‐related complications, especially as those present on admission are not distinguished from complications that arise during the hospital stay.

### Diagnosis and management of intraabdominal infection: guidelines by the Chinese society of surgical infection and intensive care and the Chinese college of gastrointestinal fistula surgeons [^342d2e13]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The Chinese guidelines for IAI presented here were developed by a panel that included experts from the fields of surgery, critical care, microbiology, infection control, pharmacology, and evidence-based medicine. All questions were structured in population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes format, and evidence profiles were generated. Recommendations were generated following the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system or Best Practice Statement (BPS), when applicable. The final guidelines include 45 graded recommendations and 17 BPSs, including the classification of disease severity, diagnosis, source control, antimicrobial therapy, microbiologic evaluation, nutritional therapy, other supportive therapies, diagnosis and management of specific IAIs, and recognition and management of source control failure. Recommendations on fluid resuscitation and organ support therapy could not be formulated and thus were not included. Accordingly, additional high-quality clinical studies should be performed in the future to address the clinicians' concerns.

### Gastropericardial fistula: radiologic findings and literature review [^c54f325d]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Gastropericardial fistula, a rare condition characterized by an abnormal communication between the stomach and the pericardium, is an emergency as sequelae such as cardiac tamponade and sepsis may lead to hemodynamic instability and death. We aimed to summarize the surgical and radiologic findings of the reported cases published to date, describe their pertinent surgical history, and present an algorithm for diagnosis.

Methods

The Pubmed database was searched using the terms: gastropericardial, pericardiogastric, pneumopericardium, pericardial, and pneumopericardium with the term "fistula" added to each term. The search was limited to January 2000-October 2015 and English language publications.

Results

Thirty five cases were identified. The most common etiology was prior esophageal and/or gastric surgery (80% of cases; esophagectomy = 26%/gastrointestinal reflux disease associated surgery = 23%/bariatric surgery = 11%/partial gastrectomy = 6%/other = 20%). The average duration between presentation and surgery was 7.3 ± 6.2 years (SD). Radiology typically played a crucial role in diagnosis with computed tomography most commonly demonstrated to be the most appropriate modality to demonstrate the fistula and assist in surgical planning. Contrast studies were frequently helpful to confirm the diagnosis. Chest x-ray findings including pneumopericardium and pericardial thickening were contributory but nonspecific. Esophagoduodenoscopy characterized the fistula in cases where imaging was equivocal and may provide therapeutic options.

Conclusions

We present the clinical radiologic findings of the 35 cases of gastropericardial fistula reported. This is the first literature review of gastropericardial fistula to focus on the effectiveness of these various diagnostic modalities and to present an algorithm for diagnosis.

### Confronting gastrocutaneous fistulas [^c8cc8048]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

When the patient with the GCF does not present with hemodynamic instability or a septic condition, a conservative approach can be tried. Conservative treatment of GCFs has to have multiple aims traditionally starting with excluding the leak site, then draining the existing debris and finally occluding the fistulas' tract.

Upon the establishment of the diagnosis of a GCF, exclusion of the leak site by employing parenteral nutrition or post-GCF enteral nutrition will allow the leak to heal spontaneously most of the time. At the same time blood and electrolyte imbalance restoration, optimal nutrition, and infection management must be the absolute priority; then, gastric acid secretion suppression by PPI, as well as inhibition of total gastrointestinal secretion by somatostatin, must be applied. When the GCF is the result of a chronic inflammatory disease, then in the general approach we should include the etiologic treatment of the disease.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for enterocutaneous fistula, more specifically with respect to nutritional evaluation, ASPEN/FELANPE 2017 guidelines recommend to assess patients with ECF for malnutrition at the time of diagnosis. Obtain periodic nutrition assessment if malnutrition is not present at baseline as patients with fistulas have a high likelihood of becoming malnourished due to nutrient malabsorption, fluid and electrolyte losses, and sepsis.

After an initial improvement with antibacterial therapy and hemodynamic stabilization, drainage of his contaminated pericardial cavity was considered, but the patient rapidly deteriorated with uncontrolled sepsis and multi-organ failure. Management of a complex case such as this requires multidisciplinary team discussion. It was felt that aggressive management of a cachectic man with a poor cancer prognosis and a multiple serious clinical conditions arising from this was not in his best interest as he was unlikely to survive intervention or surgery. These discussions included the patient and his family, and led to a palliative management approach.

### Repairing a remote complication of abdominal penetrating trauma: diagnosis and management of a debilitating gastrocolic fistula [^b73a09e6]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

What we did and why?

Management of gastrocolic fistulas often starts with supportive care, including rehydration, TPN, and acid suppression. Endoscopic options like over-the-scope clip placement, fibrin glue, and stenting have shown variable success depending on fistula size and tissue integrity; however, surgical resection remains the standard treatment.

In our case, the fistula origin was unclear, but since it was in close proximity to the prior marginal ulcer, we surmised that they may have been related. Regardless of cause, we felt that no amount of TPN would correct this state — a surgical fistula repair was necessary. Given the patient was chronically malnourished, we thought the safest choice would be the simplest operation possible to restore normal passage of enteric contents and allow for appropriate nutritional absorption. Furthermore, due to the proximity of the gastrocolic fistula to the opening of the gastrojejunostomy, a fistula takedown would prove extremely difficult and risk devitalizing the gastrojejunostomy.

Comparison of characteristics and outcomes between gastrointestinal bleeding events identified using the ICD-10 coding algorithm compared to those that were missed

Patients identified in the final coding algorithm more commonly had history of peptic ulcer disease (6.8% vs. 2.8%, p = 0.03) and history of prior GIB (15.8% vs. 6.9%, p = 0.001). Otherwise, the baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar (Table 1).

GIB events identified using this ICD-10 coding algorithm less commonly had an unknown location (9% vs. 17%, odds ratio [OR] 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31–0.75, p = 0.002) compared to those whose GIB event was missed (Table 4). Otherwise, the proportion of patients with upper or lower GIB did not differ between the two groups. Patients whose GIB events were identified using the ICD-10 code were more likely to have complete blood count drawn upon presentation compared to those whose GIB events were missed. They were also more likely to have esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) performed as their sole endoscopic study (34% vs. 23%, OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.23–2.41, p = 0.002) and less commonly had both EGD and colonoscopy performed (31% vs. 45%, OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.40–0.74, p < 0.001). The proportion of patients that had no endoscopic studies performed during their work-up did not differ between the two groups (Table 4).

Materials and Methods

Study Design and Patients

This is a retrospective cohort study of claims data from the IBM MarketScan Commercial database from October 1, 2015, to September 30, 2018 (study period; Figure 1). The IBM MarketScan Database contains longitudinal, de-identified, patient-level medical and pharmacy administrative claims from commercial plans across the United States. It is one of the largest claims data sources that contains employer-sponsored insurance claims. In the most recent 5 years of IBM MarketScan data, nearly 29 million patients had ≥ 12 months of continuous enrollment.

Figure 1.
Study design. Abbreviations: CD, Crohn's disease; PAF, perianal fistula.

Patients with CD included those with ≥ 2 diagnoses of CD (International Classification of Disease [ICD]-9-Clinical Modification [CM]: 555.xx; ICD-10-CM: K50.xxx) ≥ 30 days apart during the study period. Patients with PAF CD were CD patients with ≥ 1 ICD-9/10-CM or Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code for a PAF diagnosis or procedure (Supplementary Data Content 1) between October 1, 2016, and September 30, 2017 (identification period; Figure 1). The index date was the first claim date for a PAF diagnosis or procedure at any time during the identification period. The baseline period was the 12 months before the index date, and the follow-up period was the 12 months postindex date.

Patients with non-PAF CD had no PAF diagnosis or procedure during the study period. Non-PAF CD patients were matched to PAF CD patients based on birth year (± 2 years) and sex. The same index date of the matched PAF CD patients was assigned to the non-PAF CD patients. Further matching was based on the presence or absence of a CD diagnosis during the baseline period, the location of CD in the body, and duration of the follow-up period (in months). The location of CD was incorporated into the matching process as follows: Among patients with the presence of CD during the baseline period, the disease location at the first CD diagnosis during the baseline period was considered and matched. Among patients with absence of CD during the baseline period, the disease location at the first CD diagnosis during the follow-up period was considered and matched. Each PAF CD patient was matched to up to 4 non-PAF CD patients. The PAF CD patients for whom a matched non-PAF CD patient could not be identified were excluded from the analysis.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^d719b817]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study suggest that the transition to ICD-10-CM in October 2015 was associated with changes in levels and trends for most diagnostic categories in 3 common diagnostic classification systems. While the broad categories used in WHO disease chapters showed only small changes at the transition, numerous large changes (ie, ≥ 20%) in diagnostic category prevalence occurred in the more detailed HHS-HCCs and AHRQ-CCS categories. These 2 classification systems have been widely adopted by health care organizations for many purposes. Given the frequent, large discontinuities in diagnostic category prevalence rates that we identified, predictive models and diagnostic category mappings developed for ICD-9-CM should be refined for ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for health care payment, performance assessment, or disease surveillance.

### Early postoperative imaging after non-bariatric gastric resection: a primer for radiologists [^d70eaa23]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Anastomotic fistulas

Well-known to radiologists, fistulas represent abnormal communications between the stomach and other structures such as the skin, bronchial tree or pleural cavity, which allow passage of enteral fluids. After gastrectomy, subphrenic infection secondary to anastomotic leak may occasionally be complicated by formation of gastro-cutaneous, gastro-bronchial or gastro-pleural (Fig. 14) fistulas, which represent rare occurrences described in sparse case reports. Albeit CF studies may show abnormal passage of CM through the fistula, CT more effectively depicts associated changes and consequences such as subphrenic abscess, pneumonia or empyema (Fig. 14).

Anastomotic ulcers and strictures

Anastomotic ulcers may develop after gastrectomy, but are unreliably depicted by imaging compared to endoscopy. Ulcers plus ischemia and scar formation may ultimately lead to the formation of an anastomotic stricture at the GJS (Fig. 7). Anastomotic strictures develop in up to 3–4.4% of operated patients, generally present weeks or months after surgery and manifest with nausea, vomiting, dysphagia or post-prandial pain.

Definitions of comorbidities, medicine and other factors

We analyzed characteristics, comorbidities, and medication of study subjects. Age was classified into four categories of 18–44, 45–64, 65–84, and over 85 years old. Income was divided into three strata according to insurance fees: low (less than 20,000 New Taiwan Dollar [NTD] per month), intermediate (between 20,000 and 40,000 NTD per month), and high (more than 40,000 NTD per month). Urbanization levels were categorized into four levels, with level 1 was defined as the most urbanized and level 4 the least urbanized community, by adjustment of a population-based stratification study. Dialysis frequency was stratified into two categories: one was less than 10 sessions per month, denoting twice or less HD a week; and the other was 10 sessions or more per month, denoting thrice HD a week. Provider level was defined as the facility where patients began receiving chronic HD. Comorbidities were defined as covariates, subjects experienced at least one hospitalization or two ambulatory visits within 1 year before starting HD due to any of the following illnesses: hypertension (HTN, International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD–9–CM] code 401–405), ischemic heart disease (IHD, ICD–9–CM code 410–414), congestive heart failure (CHF, ICD–9–CM code 402.01, 402.11, 402.91, 425, 428, and 429.3), PVD (ICD–9–CM code 440–444, and 447), arrhythmia (ICD–9–CM code 426,427, V450, and V533), cerebrovascular accident (CVA, ICD–9–CM code 430–438), DM (ICD–9–CM code 250), hyperlipidemia (ICD–9–CM code 272), hypotension (ICD–9–CM code 458), shock (ICD–9–CM code 785.5), and bloodstream–related infection (ICD–9–CM code 038, 041.9, 790.7). We also applied the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) to denote burden of comorbidities. Patients with DM were defined as DM with end organ damage. We categorized CCI into three groups as scores 0–2, 3–4, and ≥ 5 according to tertiles of our data distribution. Medicine, including anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and statins, was defined as the prescription over 30 days per year within 1 year before starting HD. We also assessed midodrine, which was commonly prescribed for intradialytic hypotension, and defined it as the prescription over two times per year during HD vintage. As a sensitivity approach, we re-run the models and analyzed patients started chronic HD through their fistula without indwelling of non-tunneled or tunneled dialysis catheters.

Methods

Data source

US Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project

Both NIS and NASS are sponsored by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.NIS is the largest nationally representative sample of administrative discharge encounter data from all Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) participating community hospitals, excluding rehabilitation and long-term acute care hospitals, in the USA.NASS, starting in 2016, provides national estimates of ambulatory surgery encounters performed in hospital-owned facilities across the USA. Both provide patient-level information on clinical diagnoses and conditions using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), demographics, facility characteristics, and outcomes. Since 2016, procedures in NIS are coded using the ICD-10 Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS), while NASS uses Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. To estimate the total number of MBS, we concatenated both NIS and NASS encounters during 2016–2020.

National Health Interview Survey

NHIS is an ongoing national survey designed to monitor the health status of the US civilian non-institutionalized population. This survey collects data through personal household or phone interviews on a wide range of health-related topics, including but not limited to socioeconomic factors, medical conditions, and health behaviors.NHIS data for 2016−2020 were used to define the denominator, that is, US adult population with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) with and without diabetes during the same time frame as the HCUP data.

Definition of incident MBS

Incident MBS was defined using ICD-10-PCS and the Diagnosis Related Group system (2016−2020: 619, 620, and 621) or CPT codes and the Clinical Classification Software Refined system (2016−2022: 244) (online supplemental table 1). To minimize multiple encounters for the same patient, we excluded patients with previous MBS. We also excluded patients with BMI < 30 kg/m², pregnant women, and patients with abdominal neoplasms, gastrointestinal stromal tumor of stomach, carcinoma in situ of digestive organs, or non-infective enteritis and colitis. The detailed algorithm and medical codes for defining MBS are presented in online supplemental figure 1 and table 1. We defined types of MBS (sleeve gastrectomy (SG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and others) using codes used by other studies (online supplemental table 1).

### Optimal pediatric outpatient antibiotic prescribing [^dab614d0]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Visit Diagnosis

Prior to data analysis, we adapted an antibiotic tier system originally created by Fleming-Dutra et alfrom the ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) to the ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes (eTable 1 in Supplement 1) and added first-line antibiotic choice and duration recommendations from published guidelines. In this system, tier 1 diagnoses were considered to nearly always require antibiotics, tier 2 diagnoses sometimes require antibiotics, and tier 3 diagnoses rarely ever require antibiotics. We assessed all clinician-assigned ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes for a clinical encounter and categorized them into tiers. We then assigned a single overall visit diagnosis for each encounter using the clinician-assigned ICD-10-CM diagnosis code with the lowest suitable tier. Examples of visit diagnoses that were evaluated include acne, acute and chronic sinusitis, acute otitis media (AOM), community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, Helicobacter pylori infections, lymphadenitis, otitis externa, pharyngitis, sexually transmitted infections, and urinary tract infections (UTIs) (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).

When there was a specific tier 2 diagnosis (eg, acute pharyngitis) listed with a broad tier 1 diagnosis (eg, bacterial infection), the overall visit diagnosis was then attributed to the specific tier 2 diagnosis. If there were multiple diagnoses from the same tier, priority was given to the diagnosis with the most options for optimal antibiotics listed in the guidelines and/or the longest optimal duration of therapy (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). Antibiotics prescribed for clinical encounters in tiers 1 and 2 were then compared with those recommended by national guidelines to ascertain whether antibiotic choice and duration were optimal. Antibiotics prescribed for visits in tier 3 were deemed unnecessary and were always considered suboptimal for both antibiotic choice and duration (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1).

### Emergency general surgery: definition and estimated burden of disease [^08ab5731]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acute care surgery encompasses trauma, surgical critical care, and emergency general surgery (EGS). While the first two components are well defined, the scope of EGS practice remains unclear. This article describes the work of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma to define EGS.

Methods

A total of 621 unique International Classification of Diseases-9th Rev. (ICD-9) diagnosis codes were identified using billing data (calendar year 2011) from seven large academic medical centers that practice EGS. A modified Delphi methodology was used by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Committee on Severity Assessment and Patient Outcomes to review these codes and achieve consensus on the definition of primary EGS diagnosis codes. National Inpatient Sample data from 2009 were used to develop a national estimate of EGS burden of disease.

Results

Several unique ICD-9 codes were identified as primary EGS diagnoses. These encompass a wide spectrum of general surgery practice, including upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, hepatobiliary and pancreatic disease, soft tissue infections, and hernias. National Inpatient Sample estimates revealed over 4 million inpatient encounters nationally in 2009 for EGS diseases.

Conclusion

This article provides the first list of ICD-9 diagnoses codes that define the scope of EGS based on current clinical practices. These findings have wide implications for EGS workforce training, access to care, and research.

### Gastrogastric fistula after gastric bypass – is surgery always needed? [^4210ed9a]. Obesity Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Because of regain of weight to BMI 37.1 kg/m² 6 years after a VBG, a 41-year-old female now underwent revision to divided Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, performed laparoscopically. 12 days postoperatively, she started bleeding from the main stomach, and CT scan revealed that the bypassed stomach was distended with clot. She was treated conservatively and stopped bleeding. Upper GI series 2 weeks postoperatively revealed a large gastrogastric fistula between the tiny pouch and the bypassed stomach. We initially planned to close the fistula. However, upper GI series 2 months and 4 months postoperatively showed no sign of gastrogastric fistula, and proton pump inhibitors were stopped. At 1 year after gastric bypass, our patient has had good weight loss.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^5ad88265]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, we only examined the association of diagnostic category prevalence with the ICD-10-CM transition for individuals younger than 65 years who were privately insured by employer-sponsored insurance, a population mostly enrolled in relatively generous health plans. Coding patterns and discontinuities in frequencies of diagnostic categories may not generalize to individuals covered by other insurers (eg, the ACA marketplace, Medicare, and Medicaid). Many health care practitioners have been encouraged by their institutions to maximize the capture of patient complexity in their billing. However, our study data came from commercial plans whose payments are rarely risk adjusted for disease prevalence. Specifically, their payments do not generally rely on HHS-HCCs, reducing the explicit incentive to increase the prevalence of well-reimbursed HHS-HCC categories. Second, we did not examine changes at the ICD-10-CM transition on coding for particular conditions for specific patients or in category prevalence based on other sources of diagnoses, such as electronic medical records. Third, we used a piecewise linear model to look for changes in level and trend, but for some categories in which diagnostic category prevalence trends are not linear, our model may find changes at the transition when a nonlinear model would not.

### Outcomes associated with the use of a new powered circular stapler for left-sided colorectal reconstructions: a propensity score matching-adjusted indirect comparison with manual circular staplers [^4b126184]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Though striking, the relative incidence of these complications must be interpreted in the context of the MAIC approach and use of different methods of complication ascertainment between the ECP trial cohort and historical cohort. Specifically, whereas complications were prospectively identified through case report forms in the ECP trial, they were retrospectively identified through ICD-10-CM/PCS coding in the historical cohort (see Supplemental Appendix 1). The impact of differing methods of ascertainment was likely ambiguous: within the historical cohort, only those complications that are deemed severe enough to warrant coding are likely to be documented in a medical record, and thus identification of surgical complications via ICD codes may associated with high positive predictive value, but low sensitivity; in contrast, active concerted prospective ascertainment of complications may have led to greater sensitivity. Use of ICD-10-CM/PCS coding may also result in false positives; however, to reduce the risk of false positives we required that all complication diagnoses not be designated as 'present on admission', which is an administrative designation made within hospital records to delineate those conditions that were pre-existing upon admission vs. those that developed during the admission. Nevertheless, some code descriptions, such as those associated with anastomotic leak, are non-specific. Similarly, the ICD-10-PCS codes for bleeding are relatively nonspecific. Circular staplers are most likely to affect anastomotic bleeding. In the historical cohort, the most frequently-observed ICD-10-CM codes related to bleeding were "Postprocedural hemorrhage of a digestive system organ or structure following a digestive system procedure" and "Melena". Notably, anastomotic bleeding would indeed be coded to "Postprocedural hemorrhage of a digestive system organ or structure following a digestive system procedure" and melena is a common way in which anastomotic bleeding may present. As data on ECP begin to accrue in real-world databases such as the PHD, future analyses directly and concurrently comparing ECP with manual circular staplers using the same measurement mechanisms will be possible.

Enteral access device (EAD) selection — assessment and placement site: The selection of an EAD requires an evaluation of the patient's disease state, GI anatomy, gastric and intestinal motility and function, and the estimated length of therapy, and the healthcare team decides whether to place the distal tip in the stomach or in the small bowel. Gastric access is appropriate for patients with a functional stomach free of delayed gastric emptying, obstruction, or fistula, whereas small bowel feedings are most appropriate for patients with gastric outlet obstruction, severe gastroparesis, and in those with known reflux and aspiration of gastric contents. Patients who need simultaneous gastric decompression with small bowel feedings can be accommodated by a dual-lumen gastrojejunal EAD.

### Updating and validating the rheumatic disease comorbidity index to incorporate ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes [^d94d131b]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Others have similarly developed ICD-10-CM code sets for comorbidity indices developed during the ICD-9-CM era. Quan et al. constructed ICD-10-CM coding algorithms for the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities using Canadian administrative data. They found the frequency of most comorbidities to be similar between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM coding algorithms and the ICD-10-CM code set to either match or outperform the ICD-9-CM versions in predicting in-hospital mortality. As in our study, peptic ulcer disease was a condition that differed in frequency between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM. Glasheen et al. have since updated the ICD-10-CM coding for the Charlson Comorbidity Index, validating the predictive performance of ICD-10-CM codes for hospital admission and mortality. Sears and Rundell developed updated ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM code lists for the Functional Comorbidity Index (FCI), assessing concordance before and after the transition to ICD-10-CM. The frequency of individual comorbidities was consistent between coding algorithms for thirteen of eighteen comorbidities. While the Functional Comorbidity Index retained predictive value for hospital length of stay with ICD-10-CM codes, there was an interaction between the index and coding algorithm suggesting modest reduced performance with ICD-10-CM codes. Our findings are in agreement with these studies; appropriate ICD-10-CM code sets for comorbidity indices can have concordance with ICD-9-CM versions and retain predictive value for health outcomes.

Comorbidity burden is a crucial determinant of long-term outcomes that include mortality and functional status among people with rheumatic diseases (,–). Thus, we tested the validity of the ICD-10-CM codes by assessing the predictive ability of the RDCI score for mortality and functional status. As expected, higher RDCI scores, indicating a greater comorbidity burden, were associated with higher mortality risk and poorer functional status during follow-up in both the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM cohorts. Moreover, metrics of overall model performance (AIC, QICu) for predicting these same outcomes in each cohort also showed substantial improvement when the RDCI was included. Together, these findings demonstrate that the RDCI calculated with the proposed ICD-10-CM codes maintains expected predictive value for key long-term outcomes.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^d495525c]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity", and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity". Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice". New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness", and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs". To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service", exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms".

### Accuracy of surgical complication rate estimation using ICD-10 codes [^e7ffe2e7]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Sample size calculations were based on the assumption that 14 per cent of the study population would acquire a complication in hospital according to ICD‐10 codes, based on available evidence 28, 30. Because patient record review is expected to reveal more complications 12, it was further assumed that, if an ICD‐10 complication code were attributed to an admission, the risk of identifying a complication according to the GTT (patient harm of category E, F, G, H, I) would be twice the risk had no such code been present. Based on these assumptions, to obtain 90 per cent power and a significance level of 5 per cent, inclusion of at least 636 patient admissions was required.

A Venn diagram was used to illustrate associations between surgical complications identified by ICD‐10 codes and GTT reviews. Cohen's κ and weighted κ statistics were used to test reliability, with assessment of the strength of agreement among the ICD‐10 code reviewers and between the GTT teams by means of inter‐rater reliability tests 33. Standard classification of κ coefficient values was used: less than 0.20, poor agreement; 0.21–0.40, fair; 0.41–0.60, moderate; 0.61–0.80, good; and 0.81–1.00, very good 33.

Logistic regression was used to analyse the relationship between complications identified using a verified ICD‐10 code compared with complications identified by the GTT review of patients' records; the results are reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95 per cent confidence intervals. P ≤ 0.050 was considered statistically significant. Data were analysed using SPSS ® version 24 for Windows ® (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA). Weighted κ analysis was performed using Stata ® version 14.0, and Venn diagrams were drawn using the Stata procedure pvenn (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).

### AGA clinical practice update on evaluation and management of early complications after bariatric / metabolic surgery: expert review [^c538b752]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Internal drainage strategy for staple-line leaks — indications, approach, and monitoring are outlined: Techniques attempting to close the leak might not be the ideal treatment strategy, particularly after 6 weeks, when the leak site is mature and epithelialized; therefore, facilitating internal drainage by "keeping the fistula open" maybe a superior approach than closing the leak orifice. For internal drainage to conceivably work as a sole strategy, the following should not be present: the perigastric collection is organized, high intragastric pressure secondary to downstream stenosis, or existence of a gastropleural fistula. Markers of success include the ability to tolerate diet and a decrease in the size of the perigastric cavity, and internal drainage is most commonly achieved by 3 approaches: placement of double pigtail stent(s) through the leak, septotomy or endoscopic vacuum therapy (EVT). Where there is infected debris in the perigastric cavity, necrosectomy expedites clinical improvement and should be performed every 2 weeks until the cavity is clean, and if a percutaneous drain exists or the patient is not clinically and radiologically responding in a timely manner, aggressive lavage via a percutaneous drain every 4–6 hours should be performed.

### Is patient diagnosis a risk factor for organ space infection after colorectal resections? [^363ef7ae]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Validated risk adjustment programs do not use patient diagnosis as a potential covariate in the evaluation of organ space infections.

Objective

We hypothesized that patient diagnosis is an important risk factor for organ space infection after colorectal resections.

Design

We conducted a retrospective cohort study abstracting data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from January 2005 through December 2009.

Patients

Patients who underwent 1 of 3 types of colorectal resections (ileocolostomy, partial colectomy, and coloproctostomy) were identified by the use of Current Procedural Terminology codes. We excluded patients with concomitant formation of diverting or end stoma.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measured was organ space infection.

Analysis

Validated risk adjustment models were used with the addition of diagnostic codes.

Results

We identified 52,056 patients who underwent a colorectal resection of whom 1774 patients developed an organ space infection (3.4%) and 894 (50.2%) returned to the operating room for further surgery. For ileocolostomy, operations for endometriosis (OR, 7.8; 95% CI, 1.7–36.6) and intra-abdominal fistula surgery (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.5–6.0) were associated with increased risk of organ space infection. For partial colectomy, operations for intra-abdominal fistula surgery (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2–4.3), IBD (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.6–3.8), and bowel obstruction (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2–2.6) were associated with an increased risk of organ space infection. For coloproctostomy, operations for malignant neoplasm (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1–4.3) and diverticular bleeding (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1–9.0) were associated with an increased risk of organ space infection.

Limitations

This study was limited by the retrospective study design.

Conclusions

After adjustment for National Surgical Quality Improvement Program covariates, intra-abdominal fistula, endometriosis, and diverticular bleeding were the diagnoses associated with the highest risk of organ space infection following colorectal resections.

### Gastrocolic fistula due to staple line leak following metabolic bariatric surgery: a systematic review [^c62d47de]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Nevertheless, the relationship between the anatomical location of upper gastrointestinal tract leaks and the onset of GCF in this SR remains unclear. We can hypothesize that tissue healing was complete, as most studies occurred more than six months after the index surgery. Despite this, the formation of fistulas was consistently observed along the staple line to the transverse colon in 31.3% of the studies described in this SR. This pattern suggests that factors beyond initial tissue healing, such as the mechanical stress at the staple line or persistent subclinical inflammation, may play a role in the development of GCF, but it stays unclear. For other fistulas that develop after MBS, gastrocutaneous fistulas commonly form from the proximal third of the gastric remnant. This condition is associated with extended hospitalizations and significant morbidity and mortality, with an incidence reported to range between 1.7 and 4.0%. Gastric fistulas in the chest following LSG present unique challenges due to the distinct physiology of the sleeved stomach. The high-pressure system, resulting from an intact pylorus at the distal end and a lower esophageal sphincter at the proximal end, contributes to the increased risk of persistent leaks or fistulation into adjacent anatomical compartments. Additionally, several other factors can contribute to the formation of gastric fistulas, including iatrogenic injuries, improper vascularization, ischemia, hematoma formation, technical issues, and staple misfiring.

Treatment Options

The management of GCFs typically necessitates a multimodal approach, incorporating both non-surgical and surgical interventions based on the severity and complexity of the condition. Non-surgical management is the preferred initial strategy for well-controlled leaks without hemodynamic instability. This approach includes drainage, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and adequate nutritional support to control local sepsis and facilitate healing. This SR confirms the use of a nasojejunal tube for enteral nutrition. Nevertheless, this SR shows that exploratory laparoscopy was necessary in almost all studies (81.3%). And seven out of 16 studies (43.75%) conducted another intervention first (stent, dilation, over-the-scope clip) before converting to exploratory laparoscopy.

### Bariatric surgery, gastrointestinal hormones, and the microbiome: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2022 [^1129a53c]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Obesity Medicine Association Clinical Practice Statement (OMA CPS) 2022 — Bariatric surgery can help reduce body weight and improve health outcomes, with the two most common procedures being Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and vertical sleeve gastrectomy, both of which can be performed laparoscopically and improve metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. Gastric bypass divides the stomach into a small proximal gastric pouch attached to a "roux" limb, bypassing the gastric remnant, the duodenum, and remaining proximal jejunum. Acute gastric bypass complications include leaks or perforations leading to peritonitis with severe abdominal pain, fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis; imaging may include soluble contrast abdominal CT or upper GI, and treatment is immediate surgical exploration. Chronic gastric bypass complications include gastro-gastric fistula with weight regain, dumping syndrome with facial flushing, lightheadedness, reactive hypoglycemia, and postprandial diarrhea, and internal hernias with intermittent postprandial abdominal pain and emesis. Sleeve gastrectomy removes a portion of the stomach, leaving less stomach and altering gastrointestinal hormones, with acute complications including intestinal obstruction and staple line leaks and chronic complications including onset or worsening of gastroesophageal reflux disease for which proton pump inhibitor therapy may be used and which may prompt consideration of conversion to gastric bypass; other complications include sleeve dilation and luminal stenosis.

### Gastroenteric fistula complicating percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy [^8345a2cc]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Gastroenteric fistula occurs in 2% to 3% of patients undergoing percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The authors identified 12 children with this major complication.

Methods

A retrospective case note review was performed.

Results

Over a 5-year period, the complication rate for gastroenteric fistula was 3.5% (12 of 343 procedures). Presentation ranged from 1 day to 25 months post-PEG insertion. Eight patients presented with acute intestinal obstruction. The gastroenteric fistulous tract involved the posterior wall of the stomach in all cases. The plain abdominal x-ray was useful in establishing the diagnosis of the gastroenteric fistula.

Conclusions

Patients with gastroenteric fistula as a complication of PEG insertion can remain asymptomatic for prolonged periods. It often is difficult to make the diagnosis. A plain abdominal x-ray is a useful diagnostic modality.

### Accuracy of surgical complication rate estimation using ICD-10 codes [^3ed8d1a6]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Validating complications by ICD‐10 versus Global Trigger Tool

To investigate concurrent validity, it was determined whether admissions with ICD‐10 complications were the same admissions as those identified as having one or more complications by the GTT methodology. The similarity between the two classification methods increased from 68.3 per cent before clinical verification of the ICD‐10 complication codes to 83.3 per cent after excluding ICD‐10 codes representing complications already present on admission (Fig. 1).

Figure 1
Agreement between methods of identifying admissions with complications versus no complications: a using ICD‐10 codes extracted from administrative data and b using ICD‐10 codes verified from patients' records. GTT, Global Trigger Tool

Logistic regression was used to quantify the importance of clinically verifying ICD‐10 complication codes rather than using them without verification. Admissions with unverified ICD‐10 codes (332) were at increased odds of also having a GTT‐identified complication (OR 5.85, 95 per cent confidence interval 4.06 to 8.44), whereas admissions with verified ICD‐10 codes (141) increased the odds substantially (OR 25.38, 15.41 to 41.79). Ninety‐four admissions with complications according to GTT methodology did not have an ICD‐10 code reflecting a complication (Fig. 1).

### Disparities in utilization and outcomes of minimally invasive techniques for gastric cancer surgery in the United States [^ae1dd38b]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Patient and hospital characteristics, including age, sex, race, income level, payer status, hospital teaching status, and region, were defined in accordance with the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project data dictionary. The van Walraven modification of the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index was used to numerically tabulate the extent of chronic conditions. Patients also were stratified by extent of resection (partial vs. total gastrectomy) as well as by those undergoing concomitant operations (splenectomy, colectomy, feeding jejunostomy, or pancreatectomy). Hospitals were stratified into low-, medium-, and high-volume tertiles based on annual institutional caseload of gastrectomy for gastric cancer using previously validated methodology. As the NIS does not track hospitals across years, MIG capable centers were defined as those who performed at least one minimally invasive surgery for gastric cancer in each calendar year. Complications also were identified using ICD-9/10 procedure codes and were grouped into cardiac (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest, cardiac tamponade), thrombotic (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), respiratory (pneumonia, empyema, invasive mechanical ventilation > 96 hours, pneumothorax, respiratory failure), and infectious (urinary tract infection, bacterial infection, sepsis, infectious postoperative seroma, wound disruption, Clostridium difficile colitis, peritoneal abscess) categories. Hospitalization costs were defined by application of hospital-specific, cost-to-charge ratios to overall charges, and inflation was adjusted to the 2018 Personal Health Care Index.

### Comparison of endoscopic and surgical gastrojejunostomy in patients with malignant gastric outlet obstruction: a national cohort analysis (2016–2020) [^8b1b4a4c]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Malignant gastric outlet obstruction (MGOO) is an unfortunate adverse event of advanced upper GI malignancies. Historically, surgical gastrojejunostomy (SGJ) has been the procedure of choice to achieve enteral bypass. Recently, endoscopic techniques have gained popularity in the management of MGOO. We aimed to compare periprocedural outcomes between SGJ and endoscopic gastrojejunostomy (EGJ) in patients with MGOO.

Methods

The National Inpatient Sample was queried from 2016 through 2020. The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes were used to identify adult admissions with a principal diagnosis of gastric, pancreatic, or duodenal cancer undergoing EGJ or SGJ. The 2 cohorts were compared for periprocedural adverse events.

Results

Of 20,930 patients undergoing gastrojejunostomy for MGOO, 16,585 underwent SGJ and 4345 underwent EGJ. The SGJ cohort had a higher proportion of patients with pancreatic cancer (36.16% vs 19.56%) and a lower proportion of patients with gastric cancer (55.16% vs 71.99%). A higher percentage of EGJs were performed in the Northeast (20.33% vs 27.66%, P < .001), whereas a smaller percentage of EGJs were performed in the South (30.56% vs 39.52%, P < .001). Between the 2 groups, the difference in mortality rates was not significantly different (0.62; 95% CI, 0.35–1.10; P = 0.106), but the EGJ group had lower odds of respiratory failure (4.7% vs 7.4%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48–0.96; P = 0.032), blood transfusion (9.25% vs 13.74%; aOR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.48–0.82; P = 0.001), and peritonitis (2.19% vs 4.5%; aOR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.33–0.91; P = 0.022). The EGJ group had lesser hospitalization charges (mean $164,794 vs $183,519; adjusted difference on regression, $16,495; 95% CI, 29,204–3786; P = 0.011) and shorter hospital stays (mean, 9.88 vs 12.56 days; adjusted difference, 2.24 days; 95% CI, 1.53–2.96; P < .001). The use of EGJ increased over 5 years (16.86% in 2016 to 24.14% in 2020, P for trend = .002), whereas the use of SGJ decreased (83.13% in 2016 to 75.85% in 2020, P for trend = .002).

Conclusions

Compared with SGJ, EGJ is associated with lower rates of periprocedural adverse events, hospitalization charges, and length of stay. For these reasons, EGJ should be strongly considered in managing MGOO.

### Adherence to extended venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and outcomes after complex gastrointestinal oncologic surgery [^668f431b]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

A diagnosis of cancer was established based on claims using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes (Table 6) in the period from 6 months before the surgery to 1 month after the surgery. The study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.

The surgery eligibility window (index surgery date) was from January 2010 to December 2021. The look-back window, assessing comorbidities and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, was 6 months before the index surgery through the date of surgery. The outcome assessment window started on the date of surgery and went through 90 days postoperatively (Fig. 1 A). The study excluded patients who were not continuously enrolled for medical and prescription benefits throughout the entire study time frame (from 6 months before the date of surgery to 3 months afterward).

Fig. 1
A Project time frame definitions. B Flow chart of the patient selection process.

The exclusion criteria during the development of our cohort ruled out preexisting coagulopathy or history of VTE or bleeding (based on ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes) as well as prior receipt of anticoagulation (based on prescription claims). Patients who experienced postoperative VTE or bleeding while they were inpatients and those hospitalized 28 days or longer postoperatively during the index hospital admission (when the index surgery took place) were excluded from the final analyses because they were not eligible for extended VTE prophylaxis.

Exposure

Exposure was defined as a prescription filled for prophylactic low-dose anticoagulation within 7 days after discharge from the index hospitalization during which the index surgery occurred. The agents and dosing of eligible anticoagulants are presented in Table 7.

Outcomes

The primary outcomes of interest were the occurrence of post-discharge VTE and bleeding events during the 90 days after the index surgery. The study defined VTE as deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) with a primary diagnosis recorded in the inpatient, emergency department (ED), or outpatient setting, or resulting in prescription of therapeutic anticoagulation or insertion of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. Bleeding was defined as gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage diagnosed in the inpatient or ED setting. Thromboembolic and bleeding events were based on the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes (Table 6), which had been previously validated. Administrative claims data have been deemed an accurate source for identification of "clinically significant" events because these would invariably lead to a prescription, intervention, hospitalization, or death.

### Defining the emergency general surgery patient population in the era of ICD-10: evaluating an established crosswalk from ICD-9 to ICD-10 diagnosis codes [^47636275]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2015, the United States moved from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), coding system. The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Committee on Severity Assessment and Patient Outcomes previously established a list of ICD-9 diagnoses to define the field of emergency general surgery (EGS). This study evaluates the general equivalence mapping (GEM) crosswalk to generate an equivalent list of ICD-10 -coded EGS diagnoses.

Methods

The GEM was used to generate a list of ICD-10 codes corresponding to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma ICD-9 EGS diagnosis codes. These individual ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes were aggregated by surgical area and diagnosis groups. The volume of patients admitted with these diagnoses in the National Inpatient Sample in the ICD-9 era (2013–2014) was compared with the ICD-10 volumes to generate observed to expected ratios. The crosswalk was manually reviewed to identify the causes of discrepancies between the ICD-9 and ICD-10 lists.

Results

There were 485 ICD-9 codes, across 89 diagnosis categories and 11 surgical areas, which mapped to 1,206 unique ICD-10 codes. A total of 196 (40%) ICD-9 codes have an exact one-to-one match with an ICD-10 code. The median observed to expected ratio among the diagnosis groups for a primary diagnosis was 0.98 (interquartile range, 0.82–1.12). There were five key issues identified with the ability of the GEM to crosswalk ICD-9 EGS diagnoses to ICD-10: (1) changes in admission volumes, (2) loss of necessary modifiers, (3) lack of specific ICD-10 code, (4) mapping to a different condition, and (5) change in coding nomenclature.

Conclusion

The GEM provides a reasonable crosswalk for researchers and others to use when attempting to identify EGS patients in with ICD-10 diagnosis codes. However, we identify key issues and deficiencies, which must be accounted for to create an accurate patient cohort. This is essential for ensuring the validity of policy, quality improvement, and clinical research work anchored in ICD-10 coded data.

### ICD-10-AM codes for cirrhosis and related complications: key performance considerations for population and healthcare studies [^b89ff492]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD) codes stored in large health system databases are increasingly used in epidemiological studies and health services research to explore the burden of cirrhosis and its complications. These data can provide valuable information about the distribution and determinants of chronic liver disease to guide delivery of health services and strategies to improve health outcomes. However, the utility of ICD codes relies on the accuracy of clinical reporting and administrative coding, which may be influenced by country-specific codes and coding rules, or changes in codes during ICD revisions.

The 9th revision of the ICD (ICD-9) and, more recently, selected ICD-10 codes for cirrhosis and related complications have been validated in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative databasesand other US health system databases. ICD code lists generated from these studies have formed the basis for case definition of many clinical and epidemiological studies of cirrhosis and its complications. While the Australian Modification of the ICD-10 (ICD-10-AM) is similar to its parent classification, the ICD-10-AM does not have specific codes for certain common cirrhosis complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatic encephalopathy (HE), which may lead to discrepancies in the reporting of these problems.

The aim of this study was to: (i) evaluate the performance of ICD-10-AM codes to detect the presence of cirrhosis and a subset of key complications (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ascites, varices, SBP and HE) in admitted episodes of care for which they are coded; (ii) explore limitations of individual codes to accurately detect cirrhosis and complications and (iii) evaluate (and if needed, revise) an algorithm of ICD-10-AM codes for cirrhosis and related complications to identify admitted episodes of care among patients with known cirrhosis, for the purpose of future large-scale epidemiological research and healthcare studies.

### Confronting gastrocutaneous fistulas [^6d057c05]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Percutaneous gastrostomy, endoscopic or not, was introduced in order to provide sufficient enteral feeding in patients unable to feed satisfactorily orally. Nowadays, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is widely used and constitutes the golden standard. Development of persistent GCF after removal of a PEG tube is a rare but difficult to manage problem. Several factors hamper healing such as delayed gastric emptying, poor wound healing, flow of gastric juice through the fistula, medication and mainly long-term use of the gastrostomy. Nevertheless, the crucial element in GCF formation is epithelialization of the fistula tract. Actually, the only evidence–based statement concerning GCF formation is that chronic gastrostomies (> 6 months) are more likely to epithelialize and lead to a persistent fistula.

Concerning the rare causes responsible for GCF, the etiopathologic mechanism should be considered case-by-case: In chronic inflammatory disease a GCF can be precipitated by inflammatory erosion of the gastric wall, creation of an abscess and finally fistula formation. When radiation therapy is applied, it influences the gastric mucosa and induces gastric ulcerations. Seldom these micro-ulcerations can perforate and lead to abscess and fistula formation. When GCFs are associated with pancreatitis and pancreatic abscesses they have as common denominator the ongoing active pancreatic inflammation. Vascular thrombosis is well known within areas affected by severe pancreatitis, perhaps due to the action of liberated enzymes on blood vessels, and may have caused ischemic necrosis of the gastric wall. Finally, carcinomas may guide to an undeviating GCF formation due to destruction of the gastric wall together with direct adhesion of the tumor to the abdominal wall. This process could lead to the GCF formation.

### Persistent gastrocutaneous fistula: factors affecting the need for closure [^dc8b32a7]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The occurrence of gastrocutaneous fistula (GCF) is a well-known complication after gastrostomy tube placement. We explore multiple factors to ascertain their impact on the rate of persistent GCF formation.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed patient records for all gastrostomies (GT) constructed at our institution from 2007 to 2011. Association of GCF with method of placement, concomitant fundoplication, neurologic findings, duration of therapy, and demographics was evaluated using logistic regression.

Results

Nine hundred fifty patients had GTs placed, of which 148 patients had GTs removed and 47 (32%) of 148 required surgical closure secondary to persistent GCF. Laparoscopic and open procedures comprised 79 (53%) of 148 and 69 (47%) of 148, respectively. Seventeen (22%) patients in the laparoscopic group developed persistent GCF, compared to 30 (43%) in the open group (P = 0.035, OR = 2.52). Seventy-one patients had concomitant Nissen fundoplication. Thirty-one (44%) developed GCF, compared to 16 (21%) without a Nissen (P = 0.002, OR = 4.94). Patients with button in place for 303 days had persistent GCF incidence of 23%, compared to 45% at 540 days (P < 0.001, OR = 3.51) and 50% at 850 days (P = 0.011, OR = 4.51). Patients with device placed at 1.8 months of age were more likely to develop GCF compared to those with device placed at 8.9 months of age (P = 0.017, OR = 2.35).

Conclusion

Open operations, concurrent Nissen and younger age at placement were all statistically significant factors causing persistent GCF.

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^8b6d266d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system with clinical modifications (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures associated with health care utilization. The pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) classification system uses ICD codes to determine the presence of 1 or more CCCs (10 body-system categories) and includes posttransplant and technology variables to signify additional complexity (Box). The open-source code CCC system is the most widely used classification system to study patients younger than 18 years with medical complexities. The CCC system has evolved alongside the ICD system and must account for updates in the underlying ICD codes: CCC version 1 (V1)corresponded to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and version 2 (V2) to the transition to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Since implementation of the ICD-10-CM in the US in 2015, however, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The CCC system thus required a major update to capture the full spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

Clinical Review

We used clinical review to explore potential reasons for large changes at the time of transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM for diabetes-, cardiac-, and pregnancy-related conditions in the examined classification systems. For each HHS-HCC and AHRQ-CCS condition category with a statistically significant change of 20% or more in prevalence level or trend that was selected for clinical review, we examined frequencies of individual ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnoses before and after the ICD-10-CM transition. We also reviewed guidance documents for hospital coding staff regarding changes in coding practices related to the ICD-10-CM transition for these diagnostic categories.

Available therapies and post-procedure follow up

Subsequently, the endoscopist should decide which next step will provide the maximum benefit in each individual scenario. Tables 3 and 4 provide details of the endoscopic modalities along with their advantages and limitations. Once the fistula site is closed, the adequacy of the closure should be evaluated during the procedure, immediately after the closure and during follow up. This is achieved by water-soluble contrast radiography or computed tomography, or by clinically measuring the output from the fistula site (if feasible).

Methods

Patient selection

The 2011–2021 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) was queried for patients undergoing partial or total gastrectomy for gastric cancer using appropriate Current Procedural Terminology (CPT 43611, 43,620, 43,621, 43,622, 43,631, 43,632, 43,633, and 43,634) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 or ICD-10) codes (ICD-9 151.0, 151.1, 151.2, 151.3, 151.4, 151.5, 151.6, 151.8, 151.9 and ICD-10 C16.0, C16.1, C16.2, C16.3, C16.4, C16.5, C16.6, C16.8, C16.9). Patients with no available data on mFI-5 score variables were excluded.

mFI-5 score calculation

The mFI-5 score was calculated for each patient based on the presence of the following comorbidities: history of congestive heart failure (CHF) within 30 days of surgery, diabetes mellitus, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), non-independent functional status at the time of surgery, and hypertension requiring medication. The patient received 1 point for each comorbidity present, with a maximum score of 5 and minimum score of 0. Patients were stratified into three groups according to mFI-5 score: non-frail (mFI-5 = 0), mild frailty (mFI-5 = 1), and moderate-to-severe frailty (mFI-5 ≥ 2).

Outcomes and definitions

Rates of 30-day postoperative complications, overall complications, serious complications, 30-day mortality, reoperation, readmission, and non-home discharge were analyzed. Overall complications was defined as the presence of any post-operative complication within 30 days of surgery. Serious complications was defined as organ space surgical site infection (SSI), deep incisional SSI, wound disruption, pneumonia, unplanned intubation, pulmonary embolism, failure to wean from the ventilator for over 48 h, acute renal failure (ARF), cerebrovascular accident/stroke with neurological deficit (CVA), cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), myocardial infarction (MI), sepsis, septic shock, bleeding requiring transfusion, and/or progressive renal insufficiency.

### Controversies in the care of the enterocutaneous fistula [^b5242d45]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Enterocutaneous fistula and its variations are some of the most difficult problems encountered in the practice of general surgery. Reliable evidence that can be used to direct the care of patients afflicted with this malady is limited. There are controversies in several areas of care. This article addresses some of the gray areas of care for the patient with enterocutaneous fistula. There is particular attention directed toward the phenomenon of enteroatmospheric fistula, as well as prevention and abdominal wall reconstruction, which is often required in these individuals.
