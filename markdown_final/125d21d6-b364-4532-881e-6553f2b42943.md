## Question

Is it appropriate to prescribe Viagra to patients with hypogonadism?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is appropriate to prescribe Viagra (sildenafil) to patients with hypogonadism, and if so when and how to do so, including sequencing with testosterone therapy, safety, dosing, and monitoring considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiologic relationship between hypogonadism and erectile dysfunction and whether testosterone status alters PDE5 responsiveness. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (EAU, AUA, Endocrine Society, EAA) recommend regarding first-line therapy and combination strategies. Next, I will review diagnostic prerequisites for confirming hypogonadism before initiating testosterone therapy and how that influences sildenafil use. After that, I need to check contraindications and key safety issues for sildenafil, along with correct dosing and patient counseling. Finally, I will integrate this into a practical clinical algorithm with scenario-based nuances and monitoring, anchoring decisions on FDA labeling and international guidelines.

> Let me consider the biology first. Hypogonadism reduces libido and can impair erectile physiology by downregulating nitric oxide synthase and PDE5 expression in the corpora, so low testosterone can both cause sexual desire problems and blunt PDE5 inhibitor responsiveness, but ED in hypogonadal men is often multifactorial and not fully corrected by testosterone alone, which means I should be cautious not to over-attribute ED to androgens alone [^114WKCrF]. I should confirm that guidelines consistently advise screening men with ED for hypogonadism to avoid missing a reversible contributor and to optimize subsequent PDE5 responsiveness, and yes, androgen society and urology guidelines align on screening and targeted treatment in this context [^111K8ekU] [^112CeEKd].

> Next, I should review the treatment hierarchy. Wait, let me verify that for symptomatic hypogonadism with mild ED, testosterone is generally preferred first, while for severe ED, combination therapy may be warranted earlier. EAU 2025 and EAA 2020 advise initiating testosterone replacement therapy first in men with symptomatic hypogonadism and mild ED, reserving combination therapy with a PDE5 inhibitor for severe ED from the outset or for TRT-refractory cases, and AUA endorses the concept that PDE5 efficacy may improve with concomitant testosterone in testosterone-deficient men [^112K91o1] [^116TpRFf] [^111vwgYg] [^1117GZML] [^115YLhe3].

> I will now examine the evidence for adding testosterone when sildenafil alone fails, because I need to ensure I am not over-interpreting small studies. Randomized data in hypogonadal men unresponsive to sildenafil show that adjunctive testosterone gel significantly improves IIEF erectile function versus placebo gel plus sildenafil, with early separation of curves by week 4, and similar trends in orgasmic function and satisfaction, although sample sizes are modest and the trials are relatively short, so I should acknowledge limitations even as I use them to guide practice in TRT-refractory ED [^116yCouR] [^117SwWTU]. Observational and open-label data similarly suggest that normalizing testosterone alone often does not restore erections in all men, but adding sildenafil after TRT optimization markedly increases potency rates, reinforcing a stepwise approach rather than monotherapy dogma in refractory presentations [^111Qkz4G] [^111xKr6W]. But wait, I should not jump to conclusions that sildenafil is ineffective overall; systematic reviews confirm robust efficacy of PDE5 inhibitors for ED broadly, though nonresponse occurs in subgroups including some with androgen deficiency, which is why addressing testosterone can convert nonresponders [^115HveZe].

> Before deciding on therapy, I need to ensure the diagnosis of hypogonadism is correct and the etiology assessed. Let me first confirm the requirement for two separate morning total testosterone measurements below normal to establish hypogonadism, followed by consideration of free testosterone when total levels are borderline or SHBG is altered, and an evaluation to identify hypothalamic, pituitary, or testicular causes, all of which are mandated in endocrine and andrology guidance and echoed in FDA labeling for testosterone products [^113WCKUP] [^114kkr5h] [^114mNUJU] [^116v16Zb]. I should double-check baseline safety labs before TRT, including hematocrit and prostate evaluation with PSA and, when appropriate, DRE, and plan interval monitoring if TRT is initiated, as recommended by AAFP, EAA, and Endocrine Society guidance [^111SoYaH] [^116ZgBM1] [^115frEKF].

> Now, I need to check key contraindications and safety issues for Viagra to avoid harm. Hold on, I should verify absolute and relative contraindications: sildenafil is absolutely contraindicated with any nitrate use due to profound hypotension risk, requires caution with soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators like riociguat, and carries rare but serious warnings for NAION and sudden hearing loss, while the common adverse effects are typically mild and include headache, flushing, and dyspepsia, which meta-analyses also quantify as increased versus placebo but with no difference in serious adverse events, supporting overall tolerability when used correctly [^111pMShk] [^1179DQLF] [^111uvhgG].

> Next, I should review dosing and correct administration because misuse is a frequent cause of apparent "nonresponse". The standard sildenafil starting dose is 50 mg approximately 1 hour before anticipated sexual activity, titratable to 100 mg maximum once daily as needed, while comprehensive counseling on timing relative to meals, sexual stimulation requirements, and trial of multiple attempts is essential to maximize effect per AUA and EAU guidance and FDA labeling, and I need to remind patients to avoid coadministration with other PDE5 inhibitors and to stop sexual activity if they experience cardiac symptoms [^114xYUWu] [^117DtUMB] [^1163xXQg] [^1179DQLF] [^111pMShk].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, but I should verify it aligns with guideline hierarchies. In a man presenting with ED and suspected hypogonadism, I confirm low morning testosterone on two occasions and assess ED severity; if testosterone is normal, I proceed with a PDE5 inhibitor per ED guidelines with appropriate counseling and titration, whereas if testosterone is low and symptoms are consistent, I initiate TRT for mild ED and reassess in 3 to 6 months, adding sildenafil if ED persists or if the initial ED is severe enough to warrant upfront combination, always ensuring no nitrate use and individualized cardiovascular risk assessment for sexual activity [^117DtUMB] [^112K91o1] [^116TpRFf] [^111vwgYg] [^111pMShk].

> I will now apply this to common clinical scenarios to ensure the nuance holds. In a hypogonadal man with marked libido loss and only minimal erectile impairment, I should confirm the diagnosis and start TRT alone first, reserving sildenafil only if ED persists after biochemical and symptomatic improvement with testosterone, which aligns with EAA and EAU recommendations for staged therapy in mild ED presentations [^1117GZML] [^112K91o1]. Conversely, in a hypogonadal man with severe ED at baseline or with TRT-refractory ED, combination therapy with TRT and sildenafil is reasonable to initiate or escalate, supported by EAU guidance and adjunctive trial data showing improved erectile outcomes when testosterone is added to sildenafil in prior nonresponders [^111vwgYg] [^116yCouR] [^111xKr6W]. But wait, I should confirm safety constraints in complex comorbidity: if the patient uses nitrates, sildenafil is absolutely contraindicated, and if there has been a recent MI or stroke or there is uncontrolled heart failure, TRT itself may be contraindicated until stabilized per endocrine and andrology guidance, so cardiology input and risk mitigation come first [^111pMShk] [^112uJAkp].

> Next, I should review monitoring to ensure ongoing safety and efficacy. I need to check that testosterone and hematocrit are measured at 3, 6, and 12 months after starting TRT and then annually, pausing therapy if hematocrit exceeds 54% and evaluating for hypoxia or sleep apnea before reinitiating at a lower dose, while prostate surveillance follows PSA and DRE intervals in the first year with urologic referral for concerning changes, and ED outcomes should be reassessed with symptom tools and counseling reinforcement to optimize PDE5 use [^115uFZrG] [^112vT6mz] [^114KeVjE] [^116YU4Cx].

> Pulling this together, I should confirm the final recommendation clearly. It is appropriate to prescribe Viagra to patients with hypogonadism when ED persists despite initiation and optimization of TRT, or when ED is severe enough to warrant upfront combination, provided there are no PDE5 contraindications and patients receive correct use counseling, whereas in symptomatic hypogonadism with mild ED, guidelines favor starting with TRT alone and adding sildenafil only if needed, and in eugonadal ED, TRT should be avoided altogether while PDE5 inhibitors remain first-line, which keeps therapy evidence-based and safety-conscious [^116TpRFf] [^112K91o1] [^112CeEKd].

Yes, **Viagra (sildenafil) can be given to men with hypogonadism who have erectile dysfunction** [^117DtUMB], as it is effective and safe when used appropriately [^114eqZHH] [^115HveZe]. However, **testosterone therapy is first-line** for symptomatic hypogonadism with mild ED [^112K91o1], and PDE5 inhibitors are added if ED persists or is severe [^116TpRFf] [^111vwgYg]. Sildenafil does not treat **hypogonadism** itself, so testosterone replacement should be initiated to address the underlying deficiency [^1117GZML] [^112XtTwV]. Always screen for contraindications (e.g. nitrates [^111pMShk], severe cardiovascular disease) and monitor for adverse effects [^111uvhgG] [^1179DQLF].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from major urology and endocrinology societies provide clear recommendations on **the use of PDE5 inhibitors** [^117DtUMB], including sildenafil, in patients with hypogonadism:

- **EAU 2025 guidelines**: Recommend initiating testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) as first-line treatment in patients with symptomatic hypogonadism and mild erectile dysfunction (ED) [^112K91o1]. For more severe forms of ED, a combination of PDE5 inhibitors and testosterone therapy is recommended [^116TpRFf].

- **AUA 2018 guidelines**: Recommend offering approved oral PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, as a treatment option for ED, unless contraindicated [^117DtUMB]. The guidelines also emphasize that PDE5 inhibitors may be more effective when combined with testosterone therapy in patients with testosterone deficiency [^115YLhe3].

- **EAA 2020 guidelines**: Recommend initiating testosterone replacement therapy to improve libido, erectile function, and sexual satisfaction in patients with hypogonadism and sexual dysfunction [^1117GZML] [^115x7nqZ].

---

## Efficacy of sildenafil in hypogonadal patients

Sildenafil improves erectile function in hypogonadal men [^115HveZe]. However, efficacy may be limited in patients with severe testosterone deficiency because testosterone plays a crucial role in regulating nitric oxide synthase and PDE5 expression in erectile tissue [^114WKCrF]. Accordingly, **testosterone replacement therapy may enhance sildenafil efficacy** [^116yCouR] in hypogonadal patients who do not respond adequately to sildenafil alone [^114WKCrF].

---

## Safety considerations and contraindications

Sildenafil is generally safe and well-tolerated, but key **safety considerations and contraindications** must be reviewed when prescribing it to hypogonadal patients:

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Sildenafil can cause vasodilation and hypotension, which may pose risks in patients with cardiovascular disease. It is contraindicated in patients taking nitrates or guanylate cyclase stimulators due to the risk of severe hypotension [^111pMShk].

- **Adverse effects**: Common adverse effects of sildenafil include headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and visual disturbances. Serious adverse events are rare but may include cardiovascular events and priapism [^111uvhgG] [^115HveZe].

- **Drug interactions**: Sildenafil may interact with other medications commonly used in hypogonadal patients, such as antihypertensives and alpha-blockers, potentially increasing the risk of hypotension [^1179DQLF].

---

## Clinical scenarios for sildenafil use in hypogonadism

Based on current guidelines and clinical evidence, **sildenafil can be appropriately prescribed** in the following clinical scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended treatment approach** |
|-|-|
| Symptomatic hypogonadism with mild ED | Testosterone replacement therapy as first-line treatment [^112K91o1] [^1117GZML] |
| Symptomatic hypogonadism with moderate to severe ED | Combination therapy with testosterone replacement and sildenafil [^116TpRFf] [^111vwgYg] |
| Hypogonadal patients unresponsive to sildenafil alone | Addition of testosterone replacement therapy to enhance sildenafil efficacy [^114WKCrF] [^116yCouR] |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular **monitoring and follow-up** are essential when prescribing sildenafil to hypogonadal patients. Clinicians should assess efficacy, monitor for adverse effects, adjust therapy as needed, and educate patients on correct use and potential side effects to optimize outcomes [^113qGcLa] [^117DtUMB].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

In summary, sildenafil (Viagra) can be prescribed safely and effectively to patients with hypogonadism who experience erectile dysfunction [^114eqZHH]. Testosterone replacement therapy should be considered the **primary treatment** for symptomatic hypogonadism, particularly in cases of mild ED [^112K91o1]. Combination therapy with testosterone and sildenafil is recommended for patients with more severe ED or those who do not respond adequately to sildenafil alone [^116TpRFf] [^115YLhe3]. Clinicians should carefully assess cardiovascular risk [^111pMShk], monitor for adverse effects [^111uvhgG], and provide patient education to ensure safe and effective treatment outcomes [^113qGcLa].

Viagra (vi-AG-rah), also known by its chemical name sildenafil citrate, is available in tablet form.

- **What is the most important information I should know about Viagra**: Viagra can cause your blood pressure to drop suddenly to an unsafe level if combined with certain other medications. Do not take Viagra if you are currently using medications known as "nitrates". Nitrates are typically used to treat chest pain (angina), and a sudden drop in blood pressure can lead to dizziness, fainting, or even a heart attack or stroke.

- **Contraindications**: It is important not to take Viagra if you are using guanylate cyclase stimulators, which include medications like Riociguat (Adempas®) that treat pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

- **Healthcare provider communication**: Inform all of your healthcare providers that you are taking Viagra. This information is crucial, especially in cases where you might require emergency medical care for heart-related issues.

- **Sexual activity and health considerations**: Discontinue sexual activity and seek immediate medical help if you experience symptoms such as chest pain, dizziness, or nausea during sex. Sexual activity can place additional strain on your heart, particularly if it is already weakened from a heart attack or heart disease. Consult with your doctor to ensure your heart is healthy enough to endure this additional strain.

### Oral sildenafil citrate (viagra) for erectile dysfunction: A systematic review and meta-analysis of harms [^111uvhgG]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

To summarize and compare evidence on harms in sildenafil- and placebo-treated men with erectile dysfunction (ED), a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted.

Randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) were identified through an electronic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, and Cochrane CENTRAL. The rates of any adverse events (AEs), most commonly reported AEs, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events were ascertained and compared between sildenafil and placebo groups. The results of men with ED were stratified by clinical conditions, and statistical heterogeneity was explored. Meta-analyses based on a random-effects model were also performed.

A total of 49 RCTs were included. Sildenafil-treated men had a higher risk for all-cause AEs (RR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.38, 1.76), headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and visual disturbances compared with placebo-treated men. The magnitude of excess risk was greater in fixed- than in flexible-dose trials. The rates of serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events did not differ between sildenafil and placebo groups. A higher dose of sildenafil corresponded to a greater risk of AEs, with the increased risk of harms observed within and across clinically defined specific groups of patients.

There was a lack of RCTs reporting long-term (> 6 months) harms data. In short-term trials, men with ED randomized to sildenafil had an increased risk of all-cause any AEs, headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and visual disturbances.

Male hypogonadism (MH) is a common endocrine disorder; however, uncertainties and variations in its diagnosis and management exist. Several guidelines on testosterone replacement therapy have been driven predominantly by single disciplines. The Society for Endocrinology commissioned this new guideline to provide all care providers with a multidisciplinary approach to treating patients with MH. This guideline has been compiled using expertise from endocrine (medical and nursing), primary care, clinical biochemistry, urology, and reproductive medicine practices. These guidelines also provide a patient perspective to help clinicians best manage MH.

### Cardiovascular health, erectile dysfunction, and testosterone replacement: Controversies and correlations [^112BEEBm]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction and cardiovascular disease share a similar underlying pathophysiology, and low serum testosterone, known as hypogonadism, is a significant player in both conditions. Hypogonadism is a known risk factor for cardiovascular events and worsened mortality, thus influencing physicians to recommend testosterone replacement in hypogonadal men. However, at least four recent reports suggest that testosterone replacement may worsen cardiovascular risk, heightening hesitancy in the medical community to treat patients with hypogonadism with testosterone. This review highlights the triad of cardiovascular disease, erectile dysfunction, and testosterone therapy and provides the physician with some guiding principles for navigating these recent concerns.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^111uCxqL]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Combining all information on 50 mg and 100 mg with dose-optimized regimens, both all-cause and lack of efficacy withdrawals were reported in about 5,600 men. These were lower with sildenafil than with placebo, with NNTp values of 23 (17 to 37) and 25 (21 to 34), respectively. Adverse event withdrawals were higher with sildenafil than with placebo, with an NNH of 120 (67 to 560).

Combining all information on 50 mg and 100 mg with dose-optimized regimens, particular adverse events were reported in 2,600 to 6,300 men and were generally higher with sildenafil than with placebo, except for serious adverse events, which showed no difference. NNH values varied between 4.9 (4.2 to 6.0) for men reporting at least one adverse event (49% of men taking sildenafil), to 18 (15 to 23) for men reporting dyspepsia.

Headache was the most commonly reported individual adverse event in 17% of men taking sildenafil, followed by flushing in 13% and dyspepsia in 7.8%. The majority of trials reported that adverse events were mostly mild or moderate, and frequently transient.

### Natestonasal gel [^113WCKUP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: Prior to initiating Natesto, confirm the diagnosis of hypogonadism by ensuring that serum testosterone concentrations have been measured in the morning on at least two separate days and that these serum testosterone concentrations are below the normal range.

- **Dosing**: The recommended dose of Natesto is 11 mg of testosterone (2 pump actuations; 1 actuation per nostril) administered intranasally three times daily, totaling a daily dose of 33 mg.

Serum total testosterone concentrations should be checked periodically, starting as soon as one month after initiating treatment with Natesto. When the total testosterone concentration consistently exceeds 1050 ng/dL, therapy with Natesto should be discontinued. If the total testosterone concentration is consistently below 300 ng/dL, an alternative treatment should be considered.

### Testosterone treatment comes of age: new options for hypogonadal men [^115ESkDg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2006). Low credibility.

Male hypogonadism is one of the most frequent but also most underdiagnosed endocrinopathies. The required testosterone treatment is simple and very effective if properly administered. Although testosterone has been available for clinical use for seven decades, until quite recently, the treatment modalities were far from ideal.

- **Subdermal testosterone pellets**: These require minor surgery for insertion and often cause local problems.
- **Injectable testosterone enanthate**: This has been the most frequently used mode of administration for a long period, lasting for two to four weeks. However, it produces supraphysiological levels initially and low levels before the next injection.
- **Oral testosterone undecanoate**: This must be taken three times daily, has an uncertain absorption pattern, and results in peaks and valleys of serum testosterone levels throughout the day.
- **Transdermal testosterone preparations**: These, including scrotal testosterone patches, were the first to achieve the desired physiological serum levels. They were followed by nonscrotal skin patches, which can cause considerable skin reactions, including erythema and blisters.
- **Transdermal testosterone gels**: Recently introduced, these invisible gels increase the intervals of application and are now gradually replacing other modalities.
- **Mucoadhesive buccal testosterone tablet**: A recent competing modality with sustained release.
- **Injectable testosterone undecanoate in castor oil**: This has been developed into a real depot preparation, requiring only four injections per year for replacement therapy.

### Adjunctive use of AndroGel (testosterone gel) with sildenafil to treat erectile dysfunction in men with acquired androgen deficiency syndrome after failure using sildenafil alone [^111Qkz4G]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate whether combination therapy with testosterone gel (T-gel) and sildenafil citrate is effective in achieving adequate potency in subjects with low-normal serum testosterone levels in whom sildenafil alone has failed.

- **Methods**: From July 2000 to June 2001, we evaluated 90 men (aged 32 to 72 years) in whom 3 months of sildenafil therapy at the maximal recommended dose (100 mg) with at least three attempts at intercourse during the 3-month period had failed. Of these, 24 men had testosterone levels less than 400 ng/dL (range 92 to 365, mean 231.4) and were subsequently started on 1% T-gel monotherapy (AndroGel, 5 g daily). After 4 weeks of T-gel alone (week 4), sildenafil citrate (Viagra, 100 mg) was added to the treatment regimen for an additional 12 weeks (through week 16). Potency was defined as the ability to have at least one episode of satisfactory intercourse during the treatment period.

- **Results**: All the men had normalized serum testosterone levels after 4 weeks of T-gel monotherapy (range 424 to 596 ng/dL, mean 525). However, none of the men regained potency. At week 16, almost all (22 of 24, 92%) of the men reported improved potency with combination therapy. Improvement in erection quality was also observed.

- **Conclusions**: The results of this study support the use of T-gel with sildenafil citrate in men with low-normal serum testosterone levels in whom sildenafil alone fails. It also underscores the numbers of men with low to low-normal testosterone levels who would benefit from testosterone screening when evaluated for erectile dysfunction.

### Does sildenafil combined with testosterone gel improve erectile dysfunction in hypogonadal men in whom testosterone supplement therapy alone failed [^111xKr6W]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

We evaluated the efficacy of testosterone gel (T-gel) alone and in combination with sildenafil in hypogonadal patients with erectile dysfunction (ED).

A total of 49 hypogonadal men (mean age 60.7 years) with ED participated for a mean of 20.2 months. Blood was tested for total and bioavailable testosterone, and prostate-specific antigen. Sexual function was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire and a global assessment question (GAQ). Men received 1% 5 gm T-gel for 6 months, and 100 mg sildenafil was added to those with a "no" response to the GAQ after 3 months on testosterone supplement.

A total of 31 patients reported significant improvement in the sexual desire domain (from a mean ± SD of 4.2 ± 0.8 to 8.6 ± 0.4) and erectile function (EF) domain (from 13.6 ± 1.9 to 27 ± 0.8) following treatment with testosterone supplement alone. One patient was excluded from the study after urinary retention developed and 9 reported irritation at the gel application site. In spite of normalization of total and bioavailable testosterone values, and significant improvement of sexual desire domain scores, the EF of 17 men remained less than 26 or they responded "no" to the GAQ. These men received combined T-gel and sildenafil, after which all graded EF greater than 26 and responded positively to the GAQ.

Combined treatment with sildenafil and T-gel has a beneficial effect on ED in hypogonadal patients in whom treatment with testosterone supplement alone failed.

### Improved sexual function with testosterone replacement therapy in hypogonadal men: Real-world data from the Testim Registry in the United States (TRiUS) [^112eRuCp]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Up to 30% of erectile dysfunction (ED) patients treated with phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors do not show improved sexual function, which may be due in part to low serum testosterone. Hypogonadal patients already receiving testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can still suffer from symptoms of sexual dysfunction. In these patient populations, augmenting or switching TRT treatment may improve sexual function.

- **Aim**: To determine if 12-month treatment with a testosterone gel improves sexual function in hypogonadal men, as measured by the Brief Male Sexual Function Inventory (BMSFI), and in subgroups defined by low testosterone, PDE5 inhibitor use, and prior TRT.

- **Methods**: The Testim Registry in the United States (TRiUS) was a large (N = 849) multicenter registry of hypogonadal men treated with Testim (testosterone 1%) topical gel and followed for 12 months.

- **Main outcome measures**: Data collected at suggested visits (baseline; 1, 3, 6, and 12 months) included total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), BMSFI scores, physical exam, and body measurements.

- **Results**: TRiUS had 271 patients with baseline testosterone and BMSFI measurements. At 12 months of TRT, TT and FT levels significantly increased from baseline (P < 0.001), with mean ± standard deviation final TT = 17.37 ± 8.61 nmol/L (500.6 ± 248.2 ng/dL) and FT = 240.1 ± 296.0 pmol/L (69.2 ± 85.3 pg/mL). The mean total BMSFI score significantly increased from baseline at 12 months (27.4 ± 10.3 to 33.8 ± 9.8, P < 0.001) at each visit in all domains (sex drive/libido, erectile function).

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^11618rAB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for male hypogonadism, specifically concerning testosterone therapy, the ES 2018 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of testosterone replacement therapy in patients aged 55–69 with hypogonadism and a life expectancy greater than 10 years. This should occur only after discussing the potential benefits and risks, including evaluating prostate cancer risk and monitoring. It is essential to engage the patient in shared decision-making concerning prostate cancer monitoring. Assess prostate cancer risk before and 3–12 months after initiating testosterone therapy in patients who choose monitoring.

### Symptomatic benefits of testosterone treatment in patient subgroups: A systematic review, individual participant data meta-analysis, and aggregate data meta-analysis [^1121QL3c]. The Lancet Healthy Longevity (2023). High credibility.

Testosterone replacement therapy is known to improve sexual function in men younger than 40 years with pathological hypogonadism. However, the extent to which testosterone alleviates sexual dysfunction in older men and men with obesity is unclear, despite the fact that testosterone is being increasingly prescribed to these patient populations. We aimed to evaluate whether subgroups of men with low testosterone derive any symptomatic benefit from testosterone treatment.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate characteristics associated with the symptomatic benefit of testosterone treatment versus placebo in men aged 18 years and older with a baseline serum total testosterone concentration of less than 12 nmol/L. We searched major electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) and clinical trial registries for reports published in English between Jan 1, 1992, and Aug 27, 2018. Anonymized individual participant data were requested from the investigators of all identified trials.

Primary (cardiovascular) outcomes from this analysis have been published previously. In this report, we present the secondary outcomes of sexual function, quality of life, and psychological outcomes at 12 months. We conducted a one-stage individual participant data meta-analysis with a random-effects linear regression model, and a two-stage meta-analysis integrating individual participant data with aggregated data from studies that did not provide individual participant data. This study is registered with.

### Testosterone therapy in erectile dysfunction and hypogonadism [^114WKCrF]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Laboratory experiments indicate that the nitric oxide erectile pathway is testosterone-dependent. Castration induces erectile dysfunction (ED) and leads to a reduction in nitric oxide synthase and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the erectile tissue. Furthermore, castration causes apoptosis, adversely affecting smooth muscle content and penile hemodynamics, leading to veno-occlusive dysfunction. Testosterone therapy reverses these structural, biochemical, and physiological changes. In humans, testosterone therapy improves erectile function in men with hypogonadism. However, the efficacy of testosterone monotherapy may not be adequate due to the multifactorial nature of the pathophysiology of ED.

- **Methods**: Preliminary data from several studies have been reviewed.

- **Results**: Emerging evidence suggests benefits of using a combination of testosterone and PDE5 inhibitors. A recently published multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety and efficacy of testosterone gel 1% plus sildenafil versus placebo gel plus sildenafil in producing an erectile response in hypogonadal men who had failed prior sildenafil treatment for ED. Screening revealed a prevalence of hypogonadism in ED patients who failed prior sildenafil. Following randomization, the double-blinded treatment phase lasted 12 weeks. Testosterone therapy with testosterone gel significantly improved erectile function in response to sildenafil. Additionally, it significantly improved orgasmic function and patient satisfaction.

- **Conclusion**: It is important to screen all men with ED for hypogonadism.

### Randomized study of testosterone gel as adjunctive therapy to sildenafil in hypogonadal men with erectile dysfunction who do not respond to sildenafil alone [^116yCouR]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

We compare the efficacy of testosterone gel (T-gel) versus placebo as adjunctive therapy to sildenafil in hypogonadal men with erectile dysfunction who do not respond to sildenafil alone.

- **Materials and methods**: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter study was performed. A total of 75 hypogonadal men (18 to 80 years old, morning serum total testosterone 400 ng/dl or less) with confirmed lack of response to sildenafil monotherapy were randomized (1:1) to receive a daily dose of 1% T-gel or 5 gm placebo gel as adjunctive therapy to 100 mg sildenafil during a 12-week period. Subjects were evaluated for sexual function, primarily based on the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), quality of life, and serum testosterone levels at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12.

- **Results**: Testosterone-treated subjects had greater improvement in erectile function compared to those who received placebo, reaching statistical significance at week 4 (4.4 vs 2.1, p = 0.029, 95.1% CI 0.3, 4.7). Similar trends were observed for improvements in orgasmic function, overall satisfaction, total IIEF score, and percentage of IIEF responders. T-gel significantly (p ≤ 0.004) increased total and free testosterone levels throughout the study, although no significant correlations were made between testosterone levels and the IIEF at endpoint.

- **Conclusions**: T-gel taken with sildenafil may be beneficial in improving erectile function in hypogonadal men with erectile dysfunction who are unresponsive to sildenafil alone.

### Comparing vardenafil and sildenafil in the treatment of men with erectile dysfunction and risk factors for cardiovascular disease: a randomized, double-blind, pooled crossover study [^115PELZt]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Data from head-to-head clinical trials of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are scarce, making it difficult for clinicians to differentiate among these agents to select the most appropriate treatment for their patients with erectile dysfunction (ED).

- **Aim**: This randomized, double-blind, crossover head-to-head clinical trial compared patient preference, efficacy, and safety of vardenafil and sildenafil in men with ED and diabetes, hypertension, and/or hyperlipidemia.

- **Methods**: A prospective analysis was performed on two studies in which 1,057 men were randomized to vardenafil 20 mg (N = 530) or sildenafil 100 mg (2 x 50 mg encapsulated tablets) (N = 527) for 4 weeks. Following a 1-week washout, patients switched treatment for another 4 weeks.

- **Main outcome measures**: Patients were asked about overall preference: "Overall, which medication do you prefer?" Additionally, 11 other preference questions relating to their ED treatment were included. Efficacy assessments after each treatment period included the erectile function (EF) domain score of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF); Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) diary questions SEP2 and SEP3; Global Assessment Question (GAQ); and Treatment Satisfaction Scale (TSS). Data regarding adverse events were collected throughout the study.

- **Results**: A total of 931 men (mean age 57.9 years) were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Non-inferiority of vardenafil over sildenafil was achieved for overall preference (vardenafil 38.9%; sildenafil 34.5%; and no preference 26.6%). Additionally, the change from baseline in the…

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^111ejDpg]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

All studies provided background information on participants. Typically, men had to have a history of erectile dysfunction of at least three to six months, and the average age of men was generally in the mid-50s or older. Some studies had an enriched enrollment in which previous unsuccessful treatment with a PDE-5 inhibitor was an exclusion criterion. This applied to five of eight tadalafil studies and six of seven vardenafil studies [see Additional file 1], but none of the sildenafil studies. One vardenafil study included only men previously unresponsive to sildenafil.

Studies almost always documented that a PDE-5 inhibitor was to be taken as needed to a maximum of one treatment a day, with the additional instruction for sildenafil and vardenafil that the dose be taken about an hour before intercourse. Some studies gave information on the number of doses actually taken. Many of the dose-optimized studies reported the proportion of men on the maximum dose at the end of the study, which was always over 50%, and typically 60–80%. The trial duration was typically four to 12 weeks, with 12 weeks being the most common duration.

A number of different conditions causing erectile dysfunction were studied. All three PDE-5 inhibitors had a similar proportion of men with mixed aetiology (organic, psychogenic, or mixed) and diabetes. Erectile dysfunction after prostatectomy was studied for tadalafil and vardenafil, but not sildenafil; none of a number of studies of sildenafil after prostatectomy could be included, mainly because they were not randomised.

### Oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and hormonal treatments for erectile dysfunction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115HveZe]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common male sexual disorder. The relative benefits and harms of pharmacologic therapies for ED, as well as the value of hormonal testing in men with ED, are uncertain.

- **Purpose**: To evaluate the efficacy and harms of oral phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors and hormonal treatments for ED and assess the effect of measuring serum hormone levels on treatment outcomes for ED.

- **Data sources**: English-language studies from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, AMED, and SCOPUS through April 2009. Trial reference lists also were scanned.

- **Study selection**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of oral PDE-5 inhibitors and hormonal treatment for ED, and observational studies reporting measurement of serum hormone levels, prevalence of hormonal abnormalities, or both in men with ED.

- **Data extraction**: Two independent reviewers abstracted data on study, participant, and treatment characteristics; efficacy and harms outcomes; and prevalence of hormonal abnormalities.

- **Data synthesis**: Data, primarily from short-term trials (≤ 12 weeks), indicate that PDE-5 inhibitors were more effective than placebo in improving sexual intercourse success (69.0% vs. 35.0%). The proportion of men with improved erections was significantly greater among those treated with PDE-5 inhibitors (range: 67.0% to 89.0%) than with placebo (range: 27.0% to 35.0%). The PDE-5 inhibitors were associated with increased risk for any adverse events compared with placebo, for example, relative risk with sildenafil, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.53 to 1.93].

### Modern pharmacotherapy for erectile dysfunction: evolving concepts with central and peripheral acting agents [^1127vFxY]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapy for men experiencing erectile dysfunction has undergone dramatic advances over the past five years with the introduction of an effective oral agent. Sildenafil has increased the pool of couples seeking treatment for this important health issue as well as expanding the number of physicians treating it. Research into the growing field of erectile dysfunction is expanding at a rapid pace. Independent investigators worldwide now regularly contribute to our body of scientific knowledge. Novel oral therapies targeted at specific points along the erectile cascade are undergoing pre-clinical and early phase registration trials with the promise of rapid action, extended duration of responsiveness, and an improved side effect profile. In this review, we have highlighted recent information on the next generation of phosphodiesterase inhibitors and summarized the evolving research into centrally acting agents, which may lead to effective combination therapy.

### Clomiphene citrate: A potential alternative for testosterone therapy in hypogonadal males [^1143rJ7P]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Hypogonadism is a worldwide issue among men, causing sexual, physical, and mental problems. Testosterone therapy is the first-choice treatment for male hypogonadism, although it has several side effects, such as subfertility. Clomiphene citrate (CC) is an alternative off-label therapy for a certain group of hypogonadal males, especially for those with an active or future desire for children. There is limited literature on the use of CC for men with hypogonadism. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CC for hypogonadal males.

In this single-centre study, men treated with CC for hypogonadism were evaluated retrospectively. The primary outcome was hormonal evaluation, including total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Secondary outcomes included hypogonadal symptoms, metabolic and lipid parameters, haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit (Ht), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), side effects, the effect of a trial without medication, and potential predictors for biochemical and clinical response.

In total, 153 hypogonadal men were treated with CC. Mean TT, FT, LH, and FSH levels increased during treatment. TT increased from 9 to 16 nmol/L, with a biochemical increase in 89% of the patients. In patients who continued CC treatment, an increased level of TT persisted after 8 years of treatment. With CC treatment, 74% of the patients experienced improvement in hypogonadal symptoms. LH at the lower normal range before CC treatment was predictive of a better TT response.

### Recent advancement in the treatment of boys and adolescents with hypogonadism [^112pEH3V]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

In boys with a well-established diagnosis of central hypogonadism, treatment should not be delayed beyond the age of 12 years to avoid the psychosocial burden and the negative effect that the delay in exposure to sex steroids may have on the skeleton and pubertal growth spurt. Treatment is initiated even if a differential diagnosis between constitutional delay of puberty and central hypogonadism could not be determined. Although all treatments are off-label, the protocol of intramuscular testosterone administration with progressive increase, already described for primary hypogonadism, is the most widely used. The initial doses of approximately 50 mg every 4 weeks are too low to inhibit the reactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis in boys with constitutional delay of puberty, allowing testosterone administration to stop if testicular volume reaches 4 ml.

A frequently used alternative is to administer testosterone for 6 months, then discontinue it for 3 months to assess whether testicular volume progresses. In a few cases, patients feel satisfied with the androgenic effects and are not willing to discontinue testosterone administration. Treatment discontinuation can then be delayed until full development is attained, approximately 3 years after treatment initiation. In such cases, a longer washout period of around 6 months is needed to confirm that no spontaneous development occurs, given that a full dosage of 250 mg every 4 weeks inhibits the HPT axis. While undergoing treatment, it is important to monitor potential side effects of androgen treatment on haematocrit and liver function.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^112rVxjX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m² and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question of whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

### A 4-year update on the safety of sildenafil citrate (Viagra) [^115qjgFr]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Clinical studies have demonstrated that sildenafil citrate (Viagra) is an effective and well-tolerated oral treatment for erectile dysfunction. Despite its established safety profile, concerns about its cardiovascular safety persist among some physicians and the general public. These concerns have primarily stemmed from sporadic reports of adverse events published in the literature and sensationalized by the media. However, the only absolute contraindication for sildenafil is the concurrent use of nitrates.

Because sildenafil has been on the market for 4 years, and under clinical investigation for even longer, we can now evaluate its long-term safety in men who have been taking the drug for several years. We review this issue from three perspectives.

- **Overall safety profile**: We reassess the overall safety profile of sildenafil by reviewing the initial controlled clinical trials and open-label studies. We present new data from patients who have been exposed to sildenafil for up to 4.5 years. We also evaluate the results from independent postmarketing studies.

- **Cardiovascular-specific results**: We review the cardiovascular-specific results from the clinical trials, long-term extensions, and postmarketing studies.

- **Effects on the visual system**: Lastly, we review the specific effects on the visual system based on findings from studies conducted during drug development and postmarketing.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1132LYjC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Men with low serum testosterone concentrations can be characterized as having classic hypogonadism (sometimes called organic hypogonadism) due to an identifiable pathology or disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT, gonadal) axis, or they can be characterized as eugonadal with suppression of the gonadal axis due to a systemic disorder or condition. A low serum testosterone due to suppression of the gonadal axis by a systemic disorder is analogous to the changes in thyroid function seen in euthyroid sick syndrome and is sometimes described as functional hypogonadism.

Similar to euthyroid sick syndrome (or nonthyroidal illness), men with low serum testosterone due to suppression of the HPT axis by systemic disease might have underlying normal HPT function. Because the serum testosterone might normalize if the underlying disorder is treated and health restored, eugonadal sick syndrome or nongonadal illness might be more accurate terms than functional hypogonadism. These terms have the advantage of identifying the underlying gonadal axis as normal and not conflating functional with reversible; pathologies and disorders associated with classic hypogonadism are also potentially reversible (e.g. hyperprolactinemia, iron overload syndromes).

Classic pathologic hypogonadism is relatively uncommon with estimated lifetime prevalence < 1%. Low serum testosterone due to suppression of the HPT axis is common and increases with age and body mass index (BMI). Some experts use the term late-onset hypogonadism for functional hypogonadism in older men.

### Lessons learnt from the variation across 6741 family/general practices in England in the use of treatments for hypogonadism [^113YGk2p]. Clinical Endocrinology (2021). Low credibility.

We have previously reported rates of diagnosis of male hypogonadism in United Kingdom (UK) general practices and aimed to identify factors associated with testosterone prescribing in UK general practice.

- **Methods**: We determined, for 6741 general practices in England, the level of testosterone prescribing in men and the relation between the volume of testosterone prescribing and (1) demographic characteristics of the practice, (2) percentage of patients with specific comorbidities, and (3) national GP patient survey results.

- **Results**: The largest volume (by prescribing volume) agents were injectable preparations, with a total cost in the 12-month period 2018/19 of £8,172,519. Gel preparations were in second place, with a total cost of £4,795,057. Transdermal patches, once the only alternative to testosterone injections or implants, were little prescribed, totaling £222,022. The analysis accounted for 0.27 of the variance in testosterone prescribing between general practices. Therefore, most of this variance was not accounted for by the analysis. There was a strong univariant relation (r = .95, P < .001) between PDE5-I prescribing and testosterone prescribing. Other multivariant factors independently linked with more testosterone prescribing included a higher proportion of men with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) on target control (HbA1c ≤ 58 mmol/mol) and a higher overall practice rating on the National Patient Survey for good experience. In contrast, non-white ethnicity and socio-economic deprivation were associated with less testosterone prescribing. There were a number of comorbidity factors associated with prescribing patterns.

### Recent advancement in the treatment of boys and adolescents with hypogonadism [^111TiXG7]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

All treatments used in pediatric patients with hypogonadism are off-label. The administration of testosterone intramuscularly (IM) is the most frequently used therapy to provoke genital enlargement in childhood or the full development of secondary sexual characteristics and growth spurt in adolescents. While this is the only possibility for patients with primary hypogonadism, the administration of gonadotrophins or GnRH may represent a more physiological therapy in boys with central hypogonadism. Clinical trials with long-term follow-up are needed to assess whether gonadotrophin treatment yields better results than initial androgen replacement, followed by gonadotrophin treatment in adulthood when fertility is sought. Other possibilities based on recently developed technologies, such as Leydig cell or spermatogenic development in vitro, represent stimulating alternatives.

### Therapeutic effectiveness and patient satisfaction after 6 months of treatment with tadalafil, sildenafil, and vardenafil: Results from the erectile dysfunction observational study (EDOS) [^114S5nKV]. European Urology (2007). Low credibility.

This observational study was conducted across Europe to assess health outcomes in men with erectile dysfunction (ED) who took tadalafil, sildenafil citrate (sildenafil), or vardenafil HCl (vardenafil) for 6 months.

- **Methods**: Therapy effectiveness and patient satisfaction were evaluated using established and new questions on erectile function. Behavioral, psychological, and relationship outcomes were assessed using the short form of the Psychological and Interpersonal Relationship Scales (SF-PAIRS).

- **Results**: In nine European countries at 904 sites, 8047 patients were enrolled, and 94% (7560) selected either tadalafil (5315), sildenafil (1252), or vardenafil (993) for treatment at baseline. Of the 7560, 3998 (52.9%) took the same drug for 6 months. Baseline characteristics across the three treatment groups were comparable: mean age approximately 56 years, moderate or severe ED, and mean International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function domain score about 13. Tadalafil, sildenafil, and vardenafil were therapeutically effective and improved patient satisfaction in the 40–58% of men who completed 6 months of a single therapy. Patients taking tadalafil consistently had numerically higher levels of therapeutic effectiveness and satisfaction compared with patients who took sildenafil or vardenafil. The three cohorts had statistically significant changes from baseline in response to SF-PAIRS, with significant differences in favor of tadalafil in the Time Concerns domain.

- **Conclusion**: In a large observational study that mimics a routine clinical setting, tadalafil demonstrated superior therapeutic effectiveness and patient satisfaction compared to sildenafil and vardenafil.

### Management of erectile dysfunction by combination therapy with testosterone and sildenafil in recipients of high-dose therapy for haematological malignancies [^114dC7M5]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a well-recognized complication of bone marrow transplantation that affects the quality of life in adult patients. Although the major contributory factors include hypogonadism and psychogenic factors, the best treatment remains to be established due to the complex aetiopathology of the condition. Here, we report our preliminary results in eight patients treated with testosterone replacement therapy and sildenafil. We studied eight male recipients of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) aged 22–58 years, presenting with clinical features of hypogonadism, ED, diminished libido, and ejaculatory disorders. ED was assessed clinically and by color flow Doppler studies of the cavernosal vessels. Testicular function was assessed by testicular volume and FSH, LH, and testosterone (T) measurements. Erectile performance, libido, and ejaculatory function were determined by a structured interview.

Patients had severe primary hypogonadism as evidenced by low mean testicular volume, elevated gonadotrophins, and low normal mean testosterone levels compared with controls. All had Leydig cell insufficiency (LCI) with or without frank serum testosterone insufficiency. All except one had cavernosal arterial insufficiency. All patients received intramuscular injections of testosterone cypionate (250 mg every 4 weeks) for 6 months and 50–100 mg of sildenafil orally, one to two times per week. All patients responded favorably as substantiated by the NIH consensus criteria. Our preliminary results suggest that this combined therapy is a safe and effective therapeutic approach in recipients of high-dose therapy for haematological malignancies.

### An update on new oral PDE5 inhibitors for the treatment of erectile dysfunction [^114LHhf4]. Nature Reviews Urology (2010). Low credibility.

The management of erectile dysfunction (ED) has been revolutionized by the discovery of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, which have been commercially available for more than a decade and are the first-line therapeutic option for men with ED. Sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil were approved by the European Medicine Agency and the US FDA for the treatment of ED due to their high efficacy rates and favorable safety profiles. However, despite more than 50 million patients with ED worldwide having been successfully treated with one of these PDE5 inhibitors, some men — most notably those with severe neurologic damage, diabetes mellitus, or severe vascular disease — are resistant to the currently available drugs and require more invasive treatments, such as intracavernosal injection therapy.

Partly as a consequence of this, research into alternative therapeutic approaches continues, including the development of new PDE5 inhibitors, centrally acting pharmaceutical agents, and the application of molecular technologies such as gene therapy and stem cell therapy.

### The effects of treating male hypogonadism on couples' sexual desire and function [^115jQxoC]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Hypogonadism is a common endocrine condition characterized by low levels of testosterone (T) and marked by numerous symptoms, one of which is low sexual desire. Studies comparing T delivery systems have suggested that hypogonadal men's partners may be at risk from exposure to T gels. Little other mention is found of the impact of hypogonadism and its treatment on a man's partner and the couple's sexual function.

- **Aim**: To assess sexual desire and sexual function in hypogonadal men and their female partners before and after treatment with T replacement therapy.

- **Methods**: Twenty-one hypogonadal men and eighteen partners were recruited from a tertiary endocrine clinic and were compared with a control group of twenty eugonadal age-matched men and their partners. All men had baseline blood tests to confirm their status as hypogonadal or eugonadal, and hypogonadal men repeated tests at 3-month intervals. All participants completed the Sexual Desire Inventory (SDI) and sexual function questionnaires at baseline and at 3-month intervals until the hypogonadal men attained normal T levels.

- **Main outcome measures**: Pre- and post-treatment SDI and sexual function questionnaires were compared once T normalization was achieved. Between- and within-group comparisons were carried out.

- **Results**: Pretreatment hypogonadal men recorded lower levels of sexual desire and function than controls but significantly improved once hypogonadism was corrected. Eugonadal controls recorded no significant changes in either sexual desire or function during the study. Partners of the hypogonadal men reported data towards the end of the study.

### Testosterone cypionate [^114kkr5h]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Prior to initiating testosterone cypionate, confirm the diagnosis of hypogonadism by ensuring that serum testosterone concentrations have been measured in the morning on at least two separate days and that these serum testosterone concentrations are below the normal range.

Testosterone cypionate injection is for intramuscular use only. It should not be given intravenously. Intramuscular injections should be given deep in the gluteal muscle.

The suggested dosage for testosterone cypionate injection varies depending on the age, sex, and diagnosis of the individual patient. Dosage is adjusted according to the patient's response and the appearance of adverse reactions.

Various dosage regimens have been used to induce pubertal changes in hypogonadal males. Some experts have advocated for lower dosages initially, gradually increasing the dose as puberty progresses, with or without a decrease to maintenance levels. Other experts emphasize that higher dosages are needed to induce pubertal changes, while lower dosages can be used for maintenance after puberty. The chronological and skeletal ages must be taken into consideration for both determining the initial dose and adjusting the dose.

For replacement in the hypogonadal male, 50 to 400 mg should be administered every two to four weeks.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Warming and shaking the vial should redissolve any crystals that may have formed during storage.

### Sildenafil [^113uk8nj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Sildenafil injection is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor, in the form of the citrate salt of sildenafil, which selectively inhibits cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5). It is also marketed as VIAGRA® for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.

Chemically, sildenafil citrate is designated as 1-[[3-(6,7-dihydro-1-methyl-7-oxo-3-propyl-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)-4-ethoxyphenyl]sulfonyl]-4-methylpiperazine citrate, and it has a structural formula. Sildenafil citrate USP appears as a white or almost white slightly hygroscopic crystalline powder, with a solubility of 3.5 mg/mL in water and a molecular weight of 666.7.

The sildenafil injection is provided as a clear, colorless, sterile, ready-to-use solution in a single-dose vial containing 10 mg/12.5 mL of sildenafil. Each milliliter of this solution contains 1.124 mg sildenafil citrate USP equivalent to 0.8 mg sildenafil, 50.5 mg dextrose, and water for injection.

### Testosterone therapy can enhance erectile function response to sildenafil in patients with PADAM: A pilot study [^111eyZGb]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Recent studies suggest a direct relationship between free testosterone and cavernous vasodilatation. Some men with erectile dysfunction (ED) associated with PADAM (partial androgen deficiency in aging men) might benefit from testosterone undecanoate therapy (TRT).

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy of testosterone undecanoate in facilitating the erectile response and patient satisfaction with sildenafil in men aged 40–70 with PADAM symptoms.

- **Design and methods**: This prospective study included 40 patients recruited following a sildenafil therapeutic trial. Total testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured to calculate the free androgen index. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was measured and repeated 2 months after treatment. A rating score was used for PADAM symptoms, and the 5-point abbreviated version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) was used to assess erectile function. Men failing to respond to sildenafil were randomized into two groups: those receiving sildenafil plus continuous TRT (group 1ST) and TRT alone (group 1T). Men partially responding to sildenafil were randomized into two groups: those receiving sildenafil plus continuous TRT for 2 months (group 2ST), or sildenafil alone (group 2S). Treatment efficacy was assessed by analysis of between-group differences.

- **Results**: Groups 1T, 2S, and 2ST showed significant improvement in PADAM scores (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon matched pairs test). Patients receiving both sildenafil plus continuous TRT (groups 1ST and 2ST) showed significant improvement in IIEF-5 scores (P < 0.5, paired t-test).

### Testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone: A clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^117Ubn9i]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations based on the evidence of the benefits and harms of testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone. This guideline is endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians.

- **Methods**: The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and included sexual function, physical function, quality of life, energy and vitality, depression, cognition, serious adverse events, major adverse cardiovascular events, and other adverse events.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adult men with age-related low testosterone.

- **Recommendation 1a**: ACP suggests that clinicians discuss whether to initiate testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone who have sexual dysfunction and want to improve sexual function (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The discussion should include the potential benefits, harms, costs, and patient's preferences.

- **Recommendation 1b**: ACP suggests that clinicians should reevaluate symptoms within 12 months and periodically thereafter. Clinicians should discontinue testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone with sexual dysfunction.

### After sildenafil: Bridging the gap between pharmacologic treatment and satisfying sexual relationships [^117XbcE5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction is a prevalent and distressing problem. The availability of sildenafil citrate has significantly altered the way in which erectile dysfunction is treated. While this medication is extremely effective in restoring erectile function, it is often necessary to ensure that the partner is actively involved in treatment since many men are in relationships characterized by sexual apathy and avoidance as well as relationship conflict. These problems, if left untreated, can thwart the transition from sexual abstinence to sexual intimacy. Suggestions are offered for evaluating and intervening with men and their partners who are planning to resume a sexual life with sildenafil treatment for erectile dysfunction.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^112uJAkp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for male hypogonadism, specifically in relation to testosterone therapy, the Endocrine Society 2018 guidelines recommend not initiating testosterone replacement therapy in patients with any of the following contraindications:

- **Severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)**: Patients presenting with severe LUTS should avoid testosterone therapy.
- **Palpable prostate nodule or induration**: Therapy is contraindicated if a prostate nodule or induration is detected.
- **Elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA)**: PSA level greater than 4 ng/mL or a PSA level greater than 3 ng/mL combined with a high risk of prostate cancer without further urological evaluation.
- **Breast or prostate cancer**: Existing cancers of the breast or prostate contraindicate therapy.
- **Elevated hematocrit**: Patients with elevated hematocrit should not receive therapy.
- **Thrombophilia**: Increased risk of blood clots makes testosterone therapy inadvisable.
- **Recent myocardial infarction or stroke**: Patients with these conditions within the last 6 months should avoid therapy.
- **Uncontrolled heart failure (HF)**: Those with uncontrolled HF are advised against therapy.
- **Untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea**: This condition should be treated prior to considering testosterone therapy.

### Testosterone and the cardiovascular system: A comprehensive review of the basic science literature [^11338M6D]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Because of the increase in the number of prescriptions and use of testosterone in adult males for the treatment of hypogonadism, low libido, and weakness, an investigation of the effects of testosterone on the cardiovascular system in basic science studies was carried out. The benefits of testosterone relating to the cardiovascular system are as follows: Testosterone has been shown to exhibit potential antiarrhythmic properties by decreasing action potential duration, early after depolarizations, and shortening the QTc interval. Testosterone has also been shown to reduce myocardial infarct size compared with subjects not treated with testosterone by modulating the myocardial K ATP channel, enhancing vasodilation, improving lipid metabolism, and improving DM.

These conclusions do not come without controversy. Much of the literature suggests that testosterone attenuates atherosclerosis, but some studies suggest otherwise. Further deleterious effects of testosterone on the cardiovascular system have been shown in studies on vasoconstriction, inflammation, and death signaling. These findings suggest that testosterone may simultaneously benefit and harm the cardiovascular system through different pathways. The complexity of this relationship is obvious, and thus additional basic science studies are required for a better understanding of the relationship between testosterone and the cardiovascular system.

### Treatment of erectile dysfunction: What should we do next [^113HMNNA]. World Journal of Surgery (2000). Low credibility.

Because sildenafil (Viagra) is scheduled to be clinically available in the near future, urologists in Japan must prepare for changes in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. The drug will surely influence our clinical style of diagnosis and treatment of the dysfunction. We herein discuss this issue, referring to favorable and unfavorable effects that will be brought about by the drug. We also propose several future studies that we should do, including those on testosterone replacement therapy. We present results of our experiment using testosterone replacement therapy in aged rats and speculate about the mechanism by which the hormone replacement works in the sex center of the brain.

### Psychosocial outcomes and drug attributes affecting treatment choice in men receiving sildenafil citrate and tadalafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction: Results of a multicenter, randomized, open-label, crossover study [^114PCRjg]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Although sildenafil citrate (sildenafil) and tadalafil are efficacious and well-tolerated treatments for erectile dysfunction (ED), preference studies have shown that patients may favor one medication over the other. The aim of the study was to determine whether psychosocial outcomes differed when men with ED received tadalafil compared with sildenafil.

- **Main outcome measures**: Measures included a treatment preference question, Psychological and Interpersonal Relationship Scales (PAIRS), and Drug Attribute Questionnaire.

- **Methods**: This randomized, open-label, crossover study involved a 4-week baseline period. Men with ED (N = 367; mean age = 54 years; naïve to type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitor therapy) were randomized to receive either tadalafil for 12 weeks and then sildenafil for 12 weeks, or vice versa. There were 8-week dose optimization and 4-week assessment phases. During dose optimization, patients started with either 10 mg of tadalafil or 25 or 50 mg of sildenafil and could titrate to their optimal dose (10 or 20 mg of tadalafil; 25, 50, or 100 mg of sildenafil). Medications were taken as needed. Patients who completed both 12-week periods chose which medication to continue during an 8-week extension.

- **Results**: Of the 291 men who completed both treatment periods, 71% (N = 206) chose tadalafil and 29% (N = 85) chose sildenafil (P < 0.001) for the 8-week extension. When taking tadalafil compared with sildenafil, men had higher mean endpoint scores on PAIRS Sexual Self-Confidence (tadalafil = 2.91 vs. sildenafil = 2.75; P < 0.001) and Spontaneity (tadalafil = 3.32 vs. sildenafil = 3.17; P < 0.001) domains and a lower mean endpoint score on Time Concern.
