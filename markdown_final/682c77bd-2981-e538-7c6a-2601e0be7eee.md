## Question

Reasonable to empirically treat for pin worms

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is reasonable to empirically treat for pinworms (Enterobius vermicularis) without confirmatory testing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pretest probability and how classic the clinical presentation is. Then, I should verify the diagnostic yield and practicality of confirmatory testing. Next, I will review the safety, efficacy, and cost of empiric therapy. After that, I need to consider special populations and when to avoid empiric treatment. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and outline follow-up and prevention steps, making sure I anchor each point to guidelines and high-quality evidence where possible.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pretest probability. Pinworm is the most common helminthic infection in children in many settings, with transmission via self-inoculation of perianal eggs and characteristic nocturnal perianal itching, restlessness, and sometimes visible worms, which together create a high pretest probability in the right clinical picture, especially in households with young children or shared bedrooms [^e03f693d] [^4c384dac] [^7de52dd5].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic yield and feasibility of testing before jumping to empiric therapy. The gold standard is the cellulose tape test on the perianal area, but it requires timing and multiple specimens because eggs are shed intermittently; IDSA/ASM guidance notes that 4–6 consecutive negative tapes are needed to rule out infection, which is often impractical in busy clinics or at night, and caregivers may struggle with technique, reducing sensitivity and delaying treatment [^8d9c81a9]. I should also remember that stool ova and parasite exams are not reliable for pinworm because eggs are rarely found in feces, so relying on stool testing can miss the diagnosis and prolong symptoms [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the safety and efficacy of empiric therapy. Albendazole, mebendazole, and pyrantel pamoate are effective against pinworm, with cure rates typically high and favorable safety profiles in approved populations; standard regimens use a single dose repeated in 2 weeks to target newly hatched worms, and CDC guidance supports empiric treatment in typical presentations, emphasizing the need for the second dose and household hygiene to prevent reinfection [^7de52dd5] [^ed09c6e9] [^c620ac26]. I should confirm that these agents are available and appropriate for the patient's age and context, noting that pyrantel is available over the counter and can be useful when access to prescription therapy is limited [^7de52dd5].

> I need to ensure I weigh risks and benefits carefully. The risks of untreated pinworm include persistent pruritus with excoriations and secondary bacterial infection, sleep disturbance, and, rarely, ectopic complications such as vulvovaginitis or even appendiceal inflammation; case series and reports document pinworm-associated appendicitis and other inflammatory presentations, underscoring that delaying therapy can lead to unnecessary surgery or prolonged symptoms if the diagnosis is not considered early [^e9753a7d] [^92ed6cc3] [^5079bdf6]. But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or the patient is high risk for adverse effects? In those cases, I should reconsider empiric therapy and pursue testing or alternative diagnoses first [^notfound].

> Let me consider special populations and exceptions. In pregnancy, I should avoid empiric benzimidazoles in the first trimester and favor pyrantel pamoate if treatment is needed, balancing maternal–fetal risks; in children under 2 years, data are limited, so I should individualize decisions and consider nonpharmacologic measures first, reserving medication for clear symptoms or high likelihood of infection; in immunocompromised hosts, I should confirm the diagnosis when feasible because other parasitic infections may mimic pinworm and require different management [^7de52dd5] [^6ca13dfb]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought ivermectin might be an option here, but I should correct that: ivermectin is not indicated for pinworm and should not be used empirically for this purpose, so I need to avoid that pitfall [^notfound].

> Next, I should review cost and access considerations. Drug prices for albendazole and mebendazole have risen dramatically in some markets, which can deter testing-first strategies; empiric therapy may be more cost-effective than repeated clinic visits and multiple tape tests, particularly when the pretest probability is high and the household can implement hygiene measures to reduce reinfection risk [^3c14f615] [^6dcf902a]. I should double-check that families receive clear instructions on laundering bedding, hand hygiene, and trimming nails to break the autoinfection cycle, as this materially affects outcomes even after effective medication [^7de52dd5].

> I will now examine the role of confirmatory testing in persistent or recurrent cases. If symptoms persist after appropriate therapy and hygiene, or if the presentation is atypical, I should confirm with repeated tape tests or consider alternative diagnoses such as Strongyloides, which can be confused with pinworm and carries different risks, especially in patients from endemic regions or those facing immunosuppression; this prevents misdiagnosis and ensures the right treatment is given [^e29b27d2] [^8d9c81a9]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not anchoring on pinworm when the epidemiology or labs suggest another helminth, as that would delay appropriate care [^e29b27d2].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation. In a child with classic nocturnal perianal itching, visible worms, or household clustering, and no red flags suggesting alternative pathology, it is reasonable to treat empirically with a two-dose regimen of mebendazole, albendazole, or pyrantel pamoate, repeating the dose in 2 weeks, and to treat all close household contacts concurrently to prevent reinfection; this aligns with CDC guidance and balances diagnostic limitations against the low risk and high benefit of therapy [^7de52dd5] [^ed09c6e9] [^c620ac26]. I should confirm that families understand hygiene measures and arrange follow-up to ensure symptom resolution; if symptoms persist or are atypical, I should then pursue confirmatory testing and broaden the differential to avoid missing alternative diagnoses [^8d9c81a9].

> In conclusion, yes, it is reasonable to empirically treat for pinworm when the clinical presentation is classic and the pretest probability is high, given the limited sensitivity and practicality of confirmatory testing, the favorable safety and efficacy of recommended agents, and the potential morbidity of untreated infection; exceptions include pregnancy, very young infants, immunocompromised hosts, or atypical presentations, where confirmatory diagnosis or alternative evaluations should be prioritized before treatment [^7de52dd5] [^8d9c81a9] [^e9753a7d].

Empiric treatment for pinworms is **reasonable when classic symptoms are present** (nocturnal perianal itching, restless sleep, visible worms) [^e03f693d] [^4c384dac], especially in children or households with known cases, because diagnosis is clinical and treatment is safe and effective [^7de52dd5]. Testing can be deferred if symptoms are typical and risk is high, but **confirm with a tape test if uncertain** or if symptoms persist after treatment [^8d9c81a9]. Treat all household members to prevent reinfection, and repeat dosing in 2 weeks to eradicate newly hatched worms [^7de52dd5] [^ed09c6e9].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Pinworm infection typically presents with the following **symptoms**:

- **Nocturnal perianal itching**: The most characteristic symptom, caused by female worms laying eggs around the anus at night [^e03f693d] [^4c384dac].

- **Restless sleep and irritability**: Due to itching and discomfort [^7de52dd5].

- **Visible worms**: Small, white, thread-like worms may be seen in the perianal area or in stool [^7de52dd5].

Diagnosis is primarily clinical, but **confirmation can be made** using the cellulose tape test, which involves applying transparent tape to the perianal area in the morning to collect eggs for microscopic examination [^8d9c81a9]. Multiple negative tests may be needed to rule out infection, especially if symptoms persist [^8d9c81a9].

---

## Indications for empiric treatment

Empiric treatment for pinworms is **considered reasonable** in the following scenarios:

- **Classic symptoms**: Nocturnal perianal itching, restless sleep, and visible worms, especially in children or households with known cases [^e03f693d] [^4c384dac].

- **High prevalence settings**: Schools, daycare centers, or households with multiple symptomatic individuals [^7de52dd5].

- **Limited access to diagnostic testing**: In resource-limited settings or when immediate treatment is desired to alleviate symptoms and prevent transmission [^7de52dd5].

---

## Safety and efficacy of empiric treatment

Empiric treatment for pinworms is **generally safe and effective**. The following medications are commonly used:

| **Medication** | **Dosage** | **Safety considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Mebendazole | 100 mg orally once, repeated in 2 weeks | - Safe for children ≥ 2 years <br/> - Pregnancy category C <br/> - Use with caution in pregnancy [^7de52dd5] [^4ca278b8] |
| Albendazole | 400 mg orally once, repeated in 2 weeks | - Safe for children ≥ 2 years <br/> - Pregnancy category C <br/> - Use with caution in pregnancy [^7de52dd5] [^66e2384f] |
| Pyrantel pamoate | 11 mg/kg orally once, repeated in 2 weeks | - Available OTC <br/> - Safe for children ≥ 2 years <br/> - Pregnancy category C [^7de52dd5] [^7de52dd5] |

---

These medications are **highly effective** in eradicating pinworm infections, with cure rates typically exceeding 90% [^notfound]. Retreatment after 2 weeks is essential to target newly hatched worms and prevent reinfection [^7de52dd5].

---

## Potential risks and limitations

While empiric treatment is generally safe, **potential risks and limitations** include:

- **Misdiagnosis**: Symptoms may overlap with other conditions such as perianal dermatitis, fungal infections, or other parasitic infections [^b46d6798].

- **Drug resistance**: Although rare, resistance to anthelmintics has been reported, particularly with repeated or inadequate dosing [^0278accc].

- **Adverse effects**: Mild gastrointestinal upset, headache, or dizziness may occur, but serious adverse effects are rare [^notfound].

---

## Public health considerations

Empiric treatment for pinworms has important **public health implications**. Treating infected individuals reduces transmission within households and communities, particularly in high-prevalence settings [^7de52dd5]. Mass treatment campaigns in schools and daycare centers have been shown to significantly reduce infection rates [^0f366dd6].

---

## Guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines from the CDC and WHO support empiric treatment for pinworms in symptomatic individuals, particularly in high-prevalence settings or when diagnostic testing is not readily available [^7de52dd5]. Experts emphasize the importance of treating all household members simultaneously to prevent reinfection and of maintaining strict hygiene measures to reduce transmission [^7de52dd5].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Empiric treatment for pinworms is **reasonable and supported by clinical evidence** when classic symptoms are present, especially in children or households with known cases. The benefits of alleviating symptoms, preventing complications, and reducing transmission generally outweigh the minimal risks associated with treatment. Confirmatory testing should be pursued if symptoms are atypical, persist despite treatment, or if there is concern for alternative diagnoses [^8d9c81a9].

### Dipylidium caninum mimicking recurrent enterobius vermicularis (pinworm) infection [^3129472b]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Pinworm infection is a very common diagnosis in young children that is not always confirmed through laboratory evaluation before empiric therapy is prescribed. This article describes a toddler who was treated several times for pinworms because small white worms were seen in her perianal area. Laboratory analysis of parasite material found in her diaper later confirmed a diagnosis of dipylidiasis. Because the signs of dipylidiasis and pinworm infection overlap and the treatments for these parasitic infections are different, the laboratory should clinically confirm suspected persistent or recurrent pinworms.

Pruritus ani is frequently encountered in children by the primary care physician and the pediatrician. It is mainly due to an infection with pinworms, but fecal soiling, poor hygiene, local irritation, and dietary agents should also be considered. Treatment should be directed at the underlying etiology. Once these have been excluded, both general and specific measures must be initiated. There is almost no experience for local treatment modalities in children, and they cannot currently be recommended.

In sum, we would not interpret the results of the Liu study as suggesting a reason to abandon the WHO's recommendation for MDA in endemic areas. Indeed, one could interpret the results as suggesting the importance of implementing MDA according to the standard WHO approach, in which children consume the pills in school. As even skeptics of MDA acknowledge, treatment of infected children is warranted, and MDA is the most cost-effective way to treat heavily infected children, given the low cost of MDA and the high cost of diagnosis and treatment.

In our view, debates over whether to conduct MDA are misplaced. The appropriate question is under what circumstances the statistical expectation of benefits of MDA (taking into account uncertainty about those benefits) exceeds its cost. We would not endorse MDA in a population with no worm infections. Even those most skeptical of MDA endorse treatment of those known to be infected, and thus would presumably support MDA in a population with 100% prevalence and the relatively high intensity of infection that typically accompanies high prevalence. Yet the expected benefits of deworming are clearly continuous across prevalence and intensity, so simple logic suggests that MDA is inappropriate in populations with low enough prevalence and appropriate in populations with high enough prevalence. The relevant question is, at what threshold is MDA justified? The WHO has made the judgement call that 20% is an appropriate threshold. That seems reasonable, but one could legitimately ask if the threshold should be higher or lower, or take into account intensity as well as prevalence, or vary by STH species or other factors. From a Bayesian decision theory point of view, the choice of threshold should be informed by comparing the expected benefits of treatment versus the costs. However, the expected benefits depend on relationships that are not currently well understood, including the extent to which treatment benefit is driven by children with medium-to-high intensity infections, the relationship between prevalence of any infection and prevalence of medium-to-high intensity infections, as well as dollar valuations for the impacts of deworming. Since statistical power to detect effects in low-prevalence populations is limited, progress in this area will be difficult, and will need to rely on modeling as well as trials.

### Increases in anti-infective drug prices, subsequent prescribing, and outpatient costs [^203164e3]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Methods

The protocol for this study was reviewed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and was granted exempt status. The study used data from a deidentified database. All results are presented in aggregate form, and specific patients were not identified; thus, informed consent was not required in accordance with 45 CFR §46. This study follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Data were abstracted from IBM MarketScan Research Databases for patients with private insurance from 2010 to 2018. Standard-of-care (SOC) drugs for hookworm and pinworm include albendazole, mebendazole, and over-the-counter pyrantel pamoate. Ivermectin was included because it is frequently prescribed for hookworm, although it is inferior and non-SOC.For C difficile, oral vancomycin hydrochloride, fidaxomicin, and metronidazole are SOC drugs.Individuals with outpatient diagnosis codes for each infection were selected, and prescription drug and TOCs were analyzed descriptively over time using methods previously described (eAppendix in the Supplement).

The 95% CIs were calculated and reported with the mean values of listed variables. To further evaluate the increase or decrease of proportions of those who were treated or treatment costs over time, Welch 1-tailed t test was used. P <.05 was chosen as the significance threshold. We used Stata/MP statistical software version 14.2 (StataCorp) for statistical analysis. Data analysis was performed from September 2019 to January 2020.

EmpirDE: an empirical null-based, gene-centered method to rigorously analyze differential expression

A major challenge in transcriptomics is that successful DE analysis hinges on reasonable model assumptions and accurate parameter estimation. However, it is impossible to accurately estimate parameters, such as gene-specific variance or to identify model misspecification in small-sample-size experiments –. To systematically identify and correct for false positive DEGs, we developed EmpirDE, which leverages the power of having hundreds of conditions assessed in a uniform experimental setup, enabling the rigorous identification of true DEGs that are elicited by a specific knockdown. EmpirDE uses a two-pronged approach, first at the level of individual sequencing libraries and second at the level of an entire dataset (Fig. 3d). The first step performs DE analysis within each sequencing library (~16 conditions in our experiments) using DESeq2. However, instead of simply comparing an RNAi condition to the control, this step identifies control-outlier genes and treats these differently using a control-independent DE analysis procedure (Supplementary Note 2). Briefly, for each control-outlier gene, this step empirically identifies a control-independent null population based on the distribution of the gene’s expression levels in the sequencing library and compares the level for the gene in each RNAi condition to the newly defined null population. The second step of EmpirDE combines the DE results from all sequencing libraries (here ~1000 triplicate conditions) to correct anti-conservative P values based on gene-specific empirical null distributions of the DE test statistic (i.e. Wald statistic). Dozens to hundreds of conditions uniformly collected in WPS provided a unique opportunity to directly estimate the empirical null from the data in a gene-centered manner. Assuming real effects are rare in large-scale experiments, the gene expression in most conditions can be viewed as ‘unchanged’, thus defining an empirical null population. By fitting the central peak of the distribution of the test statistic (i.e. the distribution of conditions that did not have a significant effect), this step estimates the empirical n`ull and rescales the original test statistic (i.e. Wald statistic) accordingly to obtain a corrected Wald statistic on a gene-by-gene basis. This corrected statistic should follow a standard normal distribution and can be converted to a P value (referred to as empirical P value) to identify perturbations where differences in expression levels are statistically significant from the empirical null distribution (Fig. 3d).

### Mebendazole [^1002d72a]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

MEBENDAZOLE TABLETS, USP

CHEWABLE TABLET

100 mg

Your doctor has prescribed this medicine to treat an infection caused by an intestinal worm. Follow your doctor’s instructions carefully. In addition to your doctor’s treatment, you can help prevent reinfection and infection of other people by understanding a few simple facts about worms.

PINWORM : Pinworms look like tiny white threads and live in the bowel. Usually at night, they travel to the rectal opening and lay eggs on the outside skin. This sometimes causes itching which may be very annoying. That is why restless sleep is a frequent sign of pinworms, especially in children. Scratching will cause pinworm eggs to stick to the fingers. Reinfection will result if the fingers are placed in the mouth.

The eggs, which are too small to see, contaminate whatever they come in contact with: bedclothes, underwear, hands, and food touched by contaminated hands. Even eggs floating in the air can be swallowed and cause infection. Pinworms are highly contagious. Even the cleanest and most careful people can get them.

To help prevent reinfection follow these rules:

Wash hands and fingernails with soap often during the day, especially before eating and after using the toilet.
Wear tight underpants both day and night. Change them daily.
For several days after treatment, clean the bedroom floor by vacuuming or damp mopping. Avoid dry sweeping that may stir up dust.
After treatment, wash bed linens and night clothes (don’t shake them).
Keep the toilet seats clean

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^8c997595]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Ivermectin—mechanistic rationale and empirical use in COVID-19—is described as an anti-parasitic agent that is FDA-approved for onchocerciasis and strongyloidiasis and is used off-label for the treatment of many parasitic infections, and although it has in vitro activity against some viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, it has no proven therapeutic utility. In vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 requires concentrations considerably higher than those achieved in human plasma and lung tissue to reach the in vitro IC50, and ivermectin has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in in vitro and in vivo studies hence hypothesized to have a mechanism beyond its anti-viral effects in the treatment of COVID-19. Since ivermectin is generally well tolerated, it was empirically evaluated in uncontrolled studies for COVID-19, alone and in combination with other off-label medications.

### Successful resolution of recurrent vaginal pinworm infection with intermittent albendazole administration [^684b1120]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

We describe the case of a 7-year-old girl with repeated vaginal Enterobius vermicularis infection, never detected as a digestive tract infection. Two-dose pyrantel pamoate or 2-dose albendazole could not suppress recurrence. Finally, 3-dose albendazole after 2-week intervals was successful in preventing relapse.

### Unusual case of appendicitis [^5079bdf6]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A teenage girl was admitted to the paediatric assessment unit with non-specific abdominal pain that gradually localised to the right iliac fossa (RIF). She remained systemically well; investigations including blood tests, urine sample and abdominal ultrasound were inconclusive. Surgical opinion was sought and the decision was made to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy due to the ongoing pain. Laparoscopy showed no evidence of any significant pathology, and appendicectomy was performed following the routine practice. Numerous pinworms came out while the appendix was resected. The RIF pain resolved and the patient made a full post-operative recovery. A stat dose of mebendazole and amoxicillin were given and the immediate family was also treated. Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm) causes significant morbidity worldwide and has a high prevalence among children in the UK. It can be easily treated and prompt recognition based on clinical symptoms can potentially prevent unnecessary surgery.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 10 post-travel evaluation [^e03f693d]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Pinworm (Enterobius vermicularis)—transmission, symptoms, and risk are described: Enterobiasis is also known as pinworm infection, spread via self-inoculation after perianal egg deposition and close person-to-person contact. The most common symptom is perianal itching, especially at night, which can lead to excoriations and bacterial superinfection, and adult worms may be visible near the anus within 2–3 hours of self-inoculation or close person-to-person contact. All travelers to endemic areas are at risk, especially with close contact with children.

### Chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain: pin the pinworm [^3c574aa1]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Enterobius vermicularis is the most common helminthic infection in the US. It is usually considered an innocuous parasite that at the most causes perianal itching. We report a case of an 84-year-old female patient from an assisted living facility who presented with symptoms of colitis for 2 months. On detailed history and exam, she was found to have E. vermicularis infection. All her symptoms resolved dramatically within 2 days after a single dose of albendazole. We want to emphasize the importance of including parasitic infections such as E. vermicularis in the differential diagnoses of patients presenting with symptoms of colitis.

### Public health deworming programmes for soil-transmitted helminths in children living in endemic areas [^17e9cc4e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

In our view, the Cochrane authors do not provide adequate statistical justification for splitting results into the different "comparisons", or into "year 1" versus "year 2" impacts. "Pooling" these different comparisons, as we do in the Miguel and Kremer (2004) paper, is standard with longitudinal (panel) data analysis with multi‐year panels, and is appropriate for those that care about deworming impacts at multiple time frames, ie at less than one year and at more than one year of treatment. Use of our full sample would immediately lead to the conclusion that there are in fact positive impacts of deworming on school participation in our sample, with very large impact magnitudes and high levels of statistical significance. This is the conclusion of the Miguel and Kremer (2004) paper, and a quick look at the comparisons presented above also indicate that there are strong impacts: all three of the comparisons have large impact estimates and all three are statistically significant at over 90% confidence, with one significant at over 99% confidence and another nearly significant at 95% confidence (despite the data being split up into the three different comparisons). By treating each comparison independently and in isolation, the authors are reaching inappropriate conclusions, in our view.

Certainty of the evidence

Conducting field trials to test this intervention is complex and challenging, and researchers have worked hard to generate this body of research evidence. There is now a reasonable amount of evidence from trials in a range of settings, including high‐, moderate‐, and low‐burden areas. There have also been 18 trials that have assessed the effects of multiple doses of deworming (Analysis 2.1), six of which were cluster‐RCTs. These are particularly important because they can detect the ‘real life' community level effects of treatment that include possible effects from a reduction in worm transmission (Bundy 2009).

The certainty of the evidence tends to be moderate to low for most outcomes related to risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency and indirectness. The certainty is lower for the nutrition outcomes‐mainly because the large effects seen in the three older studies that showed larger effects, and with the other studies showing smaller or no effects. This reduces the certainty of the evidence.

We maintained the meta‐analysis across studies spanning 30 years and downgraded the certainty for heterogeneity and indirectness, as we just do not know whether these older studies reflect current effects with primary health care and lower worm endemicities.

Potential biases in the review process

Statistical errors in analysis

Of the 10 cluster‐RCTs, three did not take adequate account of cluster randomizations (Alderman 2006 (Cluster) ; Hall 2006 (Cluster) ; Rousham 1994 (Cluster)). This has the potential substantive impact on the interpretation of the trials. For example, the significant difference between intervention and control quoted on the cover of the BMJ for Alderman 2006 (Cluster) assumed 27,995 children had been individually randomized. When we clarified this with the trial authors, they provided the BMJ with a correction, which showed that no significant difference was detected in weight gain between intervention and control groups; this corrected result has been used in the meta‐analysis in this trial.

### Acute obstructive appendicitis in a child caused by pinworms treated with endoscopic direct appendicitis therapy [^6b1afda1]. Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 4 
The microscopic observation of E-vermicularis’ eggs in the liquid drawn out by negative pressure in the appendix cavity. a E-vermicularis eggs were colorless and transparent with a thick eggshell and no egg cover, resembling grains of rice. b The body of E-vermicularis: enlargement. c The head of E-vermicularis: the cuticle has horizontal stripes and expands to form the head wing. d The tail of E-vermicularis: straight and pointed.

Enterobius vermicularis accounts for 7% of acute appendicitis cases and is associated with a higher rate of unnecessary appendectomies. Traditionally, the diagnosis depended on surgical and pathological findings. This case demonstrates the live morphology of pinworms in the appendix through a cholangioscope, illustrating how pinworms cause appendicitis by promoting the formation of fecaliths and subsequent obstruction. The patient was discharged on the first day after EDAT, highlighting its potential for minimally invasive treatment. This approach offers significant diagnostic advantages over other modalities and emphasizes the importance of technological integration in endoscopic practices.

### Infections in children and adolescents treated with dupilumab in pediatric clinical trials for atopic dermatitis – A pooled analysis of trial data [^cb8b1736]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

By contrast, type 2 immunity is a key component of anti‐helminthic host defense.In this analysis, incidence of helminthic infections was very low and was similar in dupilumab and placebo groups. This finding should be interpreted within the context of a lower prevalence of parasitic infections in the regions in which these studies were conducted (North America and Europe). One of the helminth infection cases involved Enterobius vermicularis, or pinworm. Pinworm is one of the most common human parasitic helminths, and children are the most susceptible age group.The other case of helminth infection was Ascaris, and it was diagnosed based on positive serum IgG for Ascaris. The patient did not have any signs or symptoms of active infection at the time of the event. Further research on how dupilumab may affect parasitic infection susceptibility is needed, especially in geographic areas where prevalence of these types of infections is higher.

An advantage of this pooled analysis is the sample size (approximately 600 patients), which increases the ability to identify potential safety signals. A potential limitation is that, despite the pooled data, the study population was limited to the safety analysis sets from two randomized controlled trials, which may not be reflective of real‐world patient populations. In addition, despite the sample size, some of the infection events were rare, limiting precise estimation of incident rates. In addition, the analysis did not account for the use of TCS as rescue medication, which could potentially reduce incidence of skin infections by reducing inflammation.Finally, many of these diagnoses were clinical, without any microbiological investigation.

In summary, overall infection rates were numerically lower and skin infection (including non‐herpetic skin infections) rates were significantly lower compared with placebo in both children aged 6–11 years and adolescent patients with AD. Herpesvirus infections were also lower in the approved dupilumab doses and all dupilumab doses compared with placebo but were slightly higher in the other doses studied compared with placebo. Systemic anti‐infective medication use was numerically, however, not significantly lower in dupilumab‐treated patients. These findings provide further support for the safety profile of dupilumab in pediatric patients and reflect those of the individual study publications.Furthermore, these findings are consistent with published results in adults.The results of this analysis support the safety of dupilumab for treatment of adolescents with moderate‐to‐severe AD and children with severe AD.

Resources for Health Professionals Treatment Praziquantel, adults and children, 25mg/kg in a single-dose therapy. Alternatives: Niclosamide: adults, 2 gm in a single dose for 7 days; children 11-34 kg, 1 gm in a single dose on day 1 then 500 mg per day orally for 6 days; children > 34 kg, 1. 5 gm in a single dose on day 1 then 1 gm per day orally for 6 days. Nitazoxanide: adults, 500 mg orally twice daily for 3 days; children aged 12-47 months, 100 mg orally twice daily for 3 days; children 4-11 years, 200 mg orally twice daily for 3 days. Oral praziquantel is available for human use in the United States. Niclosamide is unavailable in the United States. Nitazoxanide is available for human use in the United States. Praziquantel Praziquantel is pregnancy category B. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.

However, the available evidence suggests no difference in adverse birth outcomes in the children of women who were accidentally treated with praziquantel during mass prevention campaigns compared with those who were not. In mass prevention campaigns for which the World Health Organization has determined that the benefit of treatment outweighs the risk, WHO encourages the use of praziquantel in any stage of pregnancy. For individual patients in clinical settings, the risk of treatment in pregnant women who are known to have an infection needs to be balanced with the risk of disease progression in the absence of treatment.

Pregnancy Category B: Either animal-reproduction studies have not demonstrated a fetal risk but there are no controlled studies in pregnant women or animal-reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect that was not confirmed in controlled studies in women in the first trimester. The safety of praziquantel in children aged less than 4 years has not been established. Many children younger than 4 years old have been treated without reported adverse effects in mass prevention campaigns and in studies of schistosomiasis. For individual patients in clinical settings, the risk of treatment of children younger than 4 years old who are known to have an infection needs to be balanced with the risk of disease progression in the absence of treatment.

### (pinworm) infestation in a child presenting with symptoms of acute appendicitis: a wriggly tale! [^92ed6cc3]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency worldwide. However, it can still present a challenging diagnosis especially in the young, elderly and those individuals of reproductive age, thus encompassing a wide spectrum of varied clinical presentations. Parasitic infections of the appendix are a rare cause of acute appendicitis. However, they must be considered in children presenting with abdominal pain. We report a case of Enterobius vermicularis infestation mimicking the features of acute appendicitis in a 10-year-old girl. This case is a cautionary reminder of the importance of considering E. vermicularis infestation in children presenting with abdominal pain, but who do not have a significantly raised white cell count or high Alvarado scores. A history of anal pruritus is the most characteristic symptom, but the parasites can cause severe abdominal pain mimicking appendicitis. Prompt recognition and a high clinical index of suspicion are required to prevent an unnecessary appendicectomy. Caution is advised when performing a laparoscopic appendectomy, as in our case, to prevent contamination of the peritoneum. This infestation is easily treatable with mebendazole.

### Parasitic worm therapy for allergy: is this incongruous or avant-garde medicine? [^b8b46dee]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Helminth (worm) therapy has already been used in clinical trials associated with allergy. These were generally small scale, safety orientated trials of short duration, justified by epidemiological and experimental data indicating potentially beneficial immune modulation by some parasites. However, parasites by definition are disadvantageous to their hosts, and helminth infection in particular almost invariably induces an allergic phenotype, rendering this somewhat paradoxical therapeutic approach for allergy open to scrutiny. Is parasitic worm therapy for allergy incongruous medicine, or avant-garde medicine? In the present article, we assess the strength of evidence supporting the use of helminth therapy for allergy and critically appraise the trials already completed. Then, should this approach prove successful, we suggest strategies to improve the delivery of helminth therapy, and ways to discover immune response modifiers derived from worms.

### Increases in anti-infective drug prices, subsequent prescribing, and outpatient costs [^3c14f615]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The mean wholesale prices of the antiparasitic drugs albendazole (400 mg; Albenza) and mebendazole (600 mg; Emverm) increased between 2010 and 2019 from $3.16 to $582 for albendazole and from $32 to $2853 for mebendazole. In this cross-sectional study, the association of antiparasitic drug prices with prescribing and prescription-filling behaviors and total outpatient treatment costs (TOCs) are investigated for hookworm and pinworm. These results are compared with those for Clostridioides difficile, which was selected because of similar outpatient characteristics and available number and specificity of drugs available.

### Clinical treatment of onchocerciasis | Filarial worms-CDC (...) [^78efb89a]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance The treatment of choice for onchocerciasis is ivermectin as it kills microfilariae. It does not kill adult worms. Doxycycline has been shown to kill Wolbachia, an endosymbiotic rickettsia-like bacterium that appears to be required for the survival of the O. volvulus adult worm and for embryogenesis. Older treatments for onchocerciasis, such as suramin and diethylcarbamazine, should not be used. Ivermectin The treatment of choice for onchocerciasis is ivermectin, which has shown to reduce the occurrence of blindness and to reduce the occurrence and severity of skin symptoms. Ivermectin kills the microfilariae but not adult worms. There is no evidence that prolonged daily treatment provides any benefit over annual treatment, as one dose results in a significant decrease in microfilarial load that lasts up to a year or more. Treatment with higher-than-recommended doses is more likely to produce side effects and may be harmful.

Although ivermectin does not kill the macrofilariae, it may does sterilize the adult female worms. There is evidence that treating people with ivermectin more frequently than once a year sterilizes the female worms, and that treating a person who no longer lives in an endemic area more frequently, such as every three to six months, could result in a shorter duration of symptoms. Treatment for a patient who will not be returning to live in an endemic area should be given every six months for as long as there is evidence of continued infection. Dosing as frequently as every three months could be considered. Evidence of continued infection would include skin symptoms such as pruritus, microfilariae in skin biopsies, and microfilariae on eye exam. Doxycycline Doxycycline has been shown in studies to kill Wolbachia, an endosymbiotic rickettsia-like bacterium that appears to be required for the survival of the O. volvulus adult worm and for embryogenesis.

Treatment with a 6-week course of doxycycline has been shown to kill more than 60% of the adult female worms and to sterilize 80 – 90% of the females 20 months after treatment. Doxycycline does not kill the microfilariae, so treatment with ivermectin would be needed to result in a more rapid decrease of symptoms.

### Public health deworming programmes for soil-transmitted helminths in children living in endemic areas [^d843c9f4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Given the amount of investment of public money in deworming programmes, it is important to be clear whether mass or targeted drug administration is able to contribute to health and development in a substantive way, and that it achieves what the proponents claim in terms of benefits to individuals and society. Although the drugs are cheap to buy, mass treatment programmes require considerable programmatic efforts to organize and deliver.

The policy debates generated by previous versions of this Cochrane Review over the last 18 years are complex. The important background information are placed in Table 4 for those that want more details. Previous editions of this review were instrumental in ensuring the publication of a trial of over one million children in India evaluating deworming; led to a replication analysis of a large stepped‐wedge design study from Kenya (Aiken 2015); and a Campbell review asking an identical question (Welch 2016). More recently an individual patient data (IPD) meta‐analysis has been completed, and is due to be published in 2019.

### Unmasking the role of constipation in treatment-refractory enterobiasis in Bangladeshi children [^7ad09eed]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Enterobius vermicularis, commonly known as pinworm, is one of the most prevalent helminthic infections worldwide. It is a nematode (roundworm) that appears as tiny, thread-like, whitish worms approximately 1 cm in length. Female worms have a distinctive pin-like tail at the posterior end. Humans are the only natural host for this parasite.Transmission typically occurs through direct hand-to-mouth contact, especially when contaminated fingers transfer eggs from the perianal region to the mouth. After ingestion, the eggs hatch in the stomach and upper small intestine. The larvae then migrate to and reside in the cecum, appendix, and surrounding areas of the gut. Within 1 to 2 months, they mature into adult worms. Gravid females migrate—primarily at night—to the perianal area to lay thousands of eggs that adhere to the skin. These eggs are highly sticky and become infective (embryonated) within a few hours. This nocturnal migration causes intense itching in the perianal region, promoting autoinfection as individuals scratch and inadvertently ingest the eggs.The eggs can also be transferred to clothing, bedding, bathroom surfaces, toys, furniture, and dust, facilitating fecal-oral transmission to self and others. Infection is most common in children, particularly those of preschool and kindergarten age.

Recommendations.

5 We suggest screening for latent tuberculosis infection in patients likely to require prolonged corticosteroids (weak, low).
6 We suggest screening or empiric therapy for S. stercoralis in patients likely to require prolonged corticosteroids (weak, low).
7 We recommend that all patients with NCC undergo a fundoscopic examination before initiation of anthelminthic therapy (strong, moderate).
8 We suggest that the patient with NCC, who has probably acquired NCC in a non-endemic area have their household members be screened for tapeworm carriage (weak, low). Remark : This is a public health issue and can often be addressed by the local health department.

Evidence summary.

Management of NCC often involves the use of corticosteroids or other anti-inflammatory therapy. Depending on the anticipated dose and duration of therapy and prior exposures, the patients may be at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including reactivation tuberculosis. Testing for latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is frequently performed in patients with NCC. It is recommended for all patients who will undergo prolonged treatment with corticosteroids. The course of steroids used for many patients with SEL from NCC is often not a clear indication for prophylactic therapy for latent tuberculosis. By contrast, when a month or more of therapy is anticipated, experts believe that patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis and considered for chemoprophylaxis, as would be the case for any subject from endemic areas.

Corticosteroids increase the risk for S. stercoralis hyper infection. S. stercoralis is co-endemic with T. solium in many areas. However, the prevalence is poorly defined in most populations. There is considerable controversy about how best to prevent Strongyloides hyper infection in patients from Strongyloides -endemic areas, who will be treated with steroids. The rates of hyperinfection are low, and most patients with NCC are treated with albendazole along with steroids, which may successfully treat most patients. Strategies for prevention of strongyloidiasis hyperinfection range from testing all patients for larvae in stool, serologic testing in all patients, stool and/or serologic testing only in symptomatic patients, or empiric treatment with ivermectin. Stool studies require specialized testing for Strongyloides such as Baermann’s concentration method. Even when performed, the sensitivity is poor even when testing multiple specimens. Serologic tests for antibody are more sensitive but have lower specificity. Because of difficulty in diagnosis, some authorities recommend empiric treatment with ivermectin rather than depending on imperfect testing.

Cutaneous mastocytosis in children has an indolent course and undergoes spontaneous regression. Many triggering factors may cause mast cell degranulation and clinical manifestations. Knowledge of these factors is important for patients and their families. We report a case of exacerbation of urticaria pigmentosa due to mast cell degranulation caused by Enterobius vermicularis, which has not been reported before as a triggering factor.

### Efficacy of recommended drugs against soil transmitted helminths: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^53fbcbab]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Data extraction and assessment of risk bias

From each eligible randomised controlled trial we extracted number of infected participants at baseline, number of cured participants at follow-up, mean number of eggs at baseline, mean number of eggs at follow-up, percentage of egg reduction, measure of central tendency (arithmetic, geometric, or not described), information on the number of treatment arms, number of eligible treatment arms, year of publication, country, diagnostic method, age range, and time between treatment and follow-up.

Two independent reviewers (WM and JK) screened titles and abstracts for potential studies. When articles met the inclusion criteria, the entire manuscripts were scrutinised, and, for eligible trials, the data were extracted independently by the same reviewers. All included trials were assessed for quality by two different methods: that described by Jadad and colleagues,with scores ranging between 1 (lowest level) and 5 (highest level), and according to the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (table A in appendix 2).The latter criteria assess studies for risk of bias in six different domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting. Each domain is categorised into low, high, or unclear risk of bias. In case of discrepancies over extraction of data or scoring of the study quality, a third person (CS) was involved and the results discussed until consensus was reached.

### Investigating the effectiveness of current and modified World Health Organization guidelines for the control of soil-transmitted helminth infections [^8fafd84a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Both modeling approaches agree that in most transmission settings, the present guidelines for treatment coverage need to be broadened to include the treatment of all age groups, to achieve the WHO morbidity goals. Therefore, we recommend attempting to achieve 75% community-wide coverage, while removing the option of reducing the treatment frequency as prevalence drops during a long-term MDA program.

Though WHO goals on STH are focused on morbidity control rather than (as yet) elimination as such, there is obvious benefit to coordinated assessment and continued treatment to achieve more effective morbidity control, and perhaps mitigation of ongoing costs through interruption of parasite transmission.

### Common intestinal parasites [^9bc57b32]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Intestinal parasites cause significant morbidity and mortality. Diseases caused by Enterobius vermicularis, Giardia lamblia, Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus, and Entamoeba histolytica occur in the United States. E. vermicularis, or pinworm, causes irritation and sleep disturbances. Diagnosis can be made using the "cellophane tape test." Treatment includes mebendazole and household sanitation. Giardia causes nausea, vomiting, malabsorption, diarrhea, and weight loss. Stool ova and parasite studies are diagnostic. Treatment includes metronidazole. Sewage treatment, proper handwashing, and consumption of bottled water can be preventive. A. duodenale and N. americanus are hookworms that cause blood loss, anemia, pica, and wasting. Finding eggs in the feces is diagnostic. Treatments include albendazole, mebendazole, pyrantel pamoate, iron supplementation, and blood transfusion. Preventive measures include wearing shoes and treating sewage. E. histolytica can cause intestinal ulcerations, bloody diarrhea, weight loss, fever, gastrointestinal obstruction, and peritonitis. Amebas can cause abscesses in the liver that may rupture into the pleural space, peritoneum, or pericardium. Stool and serologic assays, biopsy, barium studies, and liver imaging have diagnostic merit. Therapy includes luminal and tissue amebicides to attack both life-cycle stages. Metronidazole, chloroquine, and aspiration are treatments for liver abscess. Careful sanitation and use of peeled foods and bottled water are preventive.

### Impact of key assumptions about the population biology of soil-transmitted helminths on the sustainable control of morbidity [^8772c2b2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

To facilitate the achievement of control targets, it is desirable to reduce the level of aggregation of worms among hosts. Mathematical models predict that aggregation increases during treatment (Supplementary Figure 1). The reason is that treated individuals have zero or only a few worms, whereas untreated individuals are left with much higher worm burdens. Systematic noncompliance or nonaccess to treatment for which evidence is emerging in areas that have experienced many rounds of MDA can further increase post-treatment aggregation and make reaching the target more difficult. Program planners should identify neglected populations and reasons why treatment has not been received as part of a targeted leave no one behind (LNOB) strategy. Aggregation can be reduced if exposure to infection in high-risk individuals is mitigated by targeted WASH interventions.

Population Treated

Exposure of different age groups to STH infection can vary geographically depending on STH species and cultural and socioeconomic differences in human behavior. Differences in exposure can lead to differences in infection intensities. For example, the main burden of A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura infections lies in children, whereas hookworm infections affect adults equally or more than children. The reason is that A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura are transmitted exclusively via the oral-fecal route, whereas hookworm larvae can infect humans directly via the skin. Models can simulate differences in exposure by implementing exposure functions that result in observed infection intensities (Supplementary Figure 2). Models calibrated in this way predict that for STH species and settings where children experience the highest exposure to infection, school-based treatment is more effective than for species and settings where adults have a higher risk of exposure to infection (Figure 1b). In settings where hookworm is the dominant STH and the main burden of infection lies in adults, treating adults in addition to children may be necessary to control STH morbidity, and adult treatment has the potential to speed up achievement of the WHO 2030 targets.

Age-dependent contribution to the environmental reservoir of infectious material (ie, defecation practices) can also impact on a program’s success. For example, in settings where adults contribute to environmental contamination similarly or more than children, PC treatment of adults is predicted to have greater additional benefits toward reaching the morbidity target than in settings where adult contamination of the environment is relatively low. Extending WASH measures to the community, rather than focusing only on schools, will be especially important in these settings. Thus, knowledge of local hygiene practices can inform decisions on extending treatment to adults.

### Incidence and outcomes of unexpected pathology findings after appendectomy [^22a5eb4b]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Pathologic evaluation of the appendix after appendectomy is routine and can identify unexpected findings. We evaluated our experience in children undergoing appendectomy to review the clinical course of patients with unexpected appendiceal pathology.

Methods

After IRB approval, a retrospective review was conducted on patients who underwent appendectomy from January 1, 1995 to March 1, 2011. Patient demographics, diagnosis, pathological findings, disease outcomes, and treatment were collected only on patients with abnormal pathology.

Results

3602 patients underwent appendectomy. 113 patients had normal appendices, and 86 patients had unexpected findings, including carcinoid tumor (n=9), pinworm (n=34), granuloma (n=14), eosinophilic infiltrates (n=18), and other (n=11). All cases of carcinoid tumor were completely resected, with no recurrence or need for reoperation. Of the 34 patients with pinworm infestation, 41.2% underwent antimicrobial therapy, and none had post-operative symptoms. One patient (7%) with an appendiceal granuloma developed Crohn's disease. Three patients (16.7%) with eosinophilia developed symptomatic intestinal eosinophilia.

Conclusions

Pediatric appendiceal carcinoid is an incidental finding; in this series, none required further intervention. Appendiceal granulomas are not commonly associated with developing Crohn's disease in the short term. Routine antibiotics for the treatment of pinworms are adequate. Patients with appendiceal eosinophilia may develop symptomatic intestinal eosinophilia.

### Therapeutic efficacy and macrofilaricidal activity of doxycycline for the treatment of river blindness [^10865b61]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The clinical trials from which the data are derived aimed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between outcomes in treated vs control participants. The modeling shows that follow-up times with maximum statistical power to achieve this aim depend on the outcome in question. For example, live Wolbachia -positive O. volvulus (detectable by immunohistology) are least abundant 9.5 months after the start of treatment, whereas the corresponding figure for dead worms is 2.5 years (100% percentage of live worms in Figure 2). The clinical trials so far undertaken have included follow-up times that fall broadly within these optimal time frames, depending on whether the focus was on the doxycycline-induced depletion of Wolbachia or on the killing of adult worms. Data have also been collected at less than optimal follow-up times. Here this has proved serendipitous to estimating our model parameters to an acceptable accuracy, highlighting that to parameterize mathematical models, a broad range of follow-up times is essential.

The 93% average efficacy for patients receiving the 4-week course of doxycycline (Figure 3), the shortest that has hitherto been trialed (although a trial including a 3-week course of doxycycline has recently been completed but not yet evaluated; see), is impressive and above the 90% empirical threshold for optimum antifilarial effects. The absence of a statically significant difference among treatment regimens suggests that the 4-week course, as previously proposed, is sufficient for anti- Wolbachia therapy. Little substantive insight into the minimum therapeutically sufficient duration is possible here, as none of the regimens precipitate systematically lower percentages of Wolbachia- positive worms in treated participants. However, evidence from a small number of individuals who dropped out of treatment after 2 weeks suggests that this duration is insufficient. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the minimum therapeutically sufficient course of doxycycline alone is between 2 and 4 weeks. Ongoing work by the Anti- Wolbachia Consortium (A•WOL,) has shown in animal models and clinical trials that anti- Wolbachia drug combinations can markedly reduce treatment duration.

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^ca1b403e]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute pruritus frequently arises from infectious causes, which should be strongly considered in the initial differential diagnosis. Common infectious causes that do not cause lesions and can be evaluated quickly are vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), bacterial vaginosis (BV), trichomoniasis (TV), chlamydia, and gonorrhea. Parasitic infestations such as public lice and pinworms should also be readily considered in patients with excoriations but no other visual lesions, particularly in children and sexually active individuals, especially those with risk factors such as contact with infected individuals or children with frequent exposure to other children. If there is suspicion for STI, HIV status should be evaluated, as affected individuals are prone to more severe or recurrent infection. If lesions are present, their appearance and associated symptoms should guide the differential diagnosis. Herpetic lesions, condylomas, molluscum contagiosum, scabies, and syphilis primary lesions all have distinctive appearances and can be confirmed with laboratory testing or biopsies.

Inflammatory dermatological conditions such as psoriasis, AD, lichen planus (LP), and contact dermatitis, frequently cause vaginal pruritus and should be on the differential for acute and chronic vulvovaginal itching due to their intermittent and relapsing and remitting nature. Psoriasis is a chronic cause of itch accompanying well-demarcated, erythematous red plaques limited to the labia majora often misdiagnosed as candida. In AD, the presence of poorly defined erythematous plaques, excoriations, and a history of itching and scratching are key diagnostic clues. LP results in erosive lesions and scarring of the vulva, and there is often extragenital involvement. Irritant contact dermatitis causes rapid onset burning sensations with localized vesicular plaques or scaly patches. For allergic contact dermatitis, intermittent symptoms and a lack of response to standard treatments may raise suspicion for an underlying allergen, warranting further evaluation such as a patch test.

### Public health deworming programmes for soil-transmitted helminths in children living in endemic areas [^ca595c33]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends treating all school children at regular intervals with deworming drugs in areas where helminth infection is common. Global advocacy organizations claim routine deworming has substantive health and societal effects beyond the removal of worms. In this update of the 2015 edition we included six new trials, additional data from included trials, and addressed comments and criticisms.

Objectives

To summarize the effects of public health programmes to regularly treat all children with deworming drugs on child growth, haemoglobin, cognition, school attendance, school performance, physical fitness, and mortality.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; LILACS; the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT); reference lists; and registers of ongoing and completed trials up to 19 September 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared deworming drugs for soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) with placebo or no treatment in children aged 16 years or less, reporting on weight, height, haemoglobin, and formal tests of cognition. We also sought data on other measures of growth, school attendance, school performance, physical fitness, and mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion, risk of bias, and extracted data. We analysed continuous data using the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where data were missing, we contacted trial authors. We stratified the analysis based on the background burden of STH infection. We used outcomes at time of longest follow-up. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We identified 51 trials, including 10 cluster-RCTs, that met the inclusion criteria. One trial evaluating mortality included over one million children, and the remaining 50 trials included a total of 84,336 participants. Twenty-four trials were in populations categorized as high burden, including nine trials in children selected because they were helminth-stool positive; 18 with intermediate burden; and nine as low burden.First or single dose of deworming drugsFourteen trials reported on weight after a single dose of deworming drugs (4970 participants, 14 RCTs). The effects were variable. There was little or no effect in studies conducted in low and intermediate worm burden groups. In the high-burden group, there was little or no effect in most studies, except for a large effect detected from one study area in Kenya reported in two trials carried out over 30 years ago. These trials result in qualitative heterogeneity and uncertainty in the meta-analysis across all studies (I 2 statistic = 90%), with GRADE assessment assessed as very low-certainty, which means we do not know if a first dose or single dose of deworming impacts on weight.For height, most studies showed little or no effect after a single dose, with one of the two trials in Kenya from 30 years ago showing a large average difference (2621 participants, 10 trials, low-certainty evidence). Single dose probably had no effect on average haemoglobin (MD 0.10 g/dL, 95% CI 0.03 lower to 0.22 higher; 1252 participants, five trials, moderate-certainty evidence), or on average cognition (1596 participants, five trials, low-certainty evidence). The data are insufficient to know if there is an effect on school attendance and performance (304 participants, one trial, low-certainty evidence), or on physical fitness (280 participants, three trials, very low-certainty evidence). No trials reported on mortality.Multiple doses of deworming drugsThe effect of regularly treating children with deworming drugs given every three to six months on weight was reported in 18 trials, with follow-up times of between six months and three years; there was little or no effect on average weight in all but two trials, irrespective of worm prevalence-intensity. The two trials with large average weight gain included one in the high burden area in Kenya carried out over 30 years ago, and one study from India in a low prevalence area where subsequent studies in the same area did not show an effect. This heterogeneity causes uncertainty in any meta-analysis (I 2 = 78%). Post-hoc analysis excluding trials published prior to 2000 gave an estimate of average difference in weight gain of 0.02 kg (95%CI from 0.04 kg loss to 0.08 gain, I 2 = 0%). Thus we conclude that we do not know if repeated doses of deworming drugs impact on average weight, with a fewer older studies showing large gains, and studies since 2000 showing little or no average gain.Regular treatment probably had little or no effect on the following parameters: average height (MD 0.02 cm higher, 95% CI 0.09 lower to 0.13 cm higher; 13,700 participants, 13 trials, moderate-certainty evidence); average haemoglobin (MD 0.01 g/dL lower; 95% CI 0.05 g/dL lower to 0.07 g/dL higher; 5498 participants, nine trials, moderate-certainty evidence); formal tests of cognition (35,394 participants, 8 trials, moderate-certainty evidence); school performance (34,967 participants, four trials, moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence assessing an effect on school attendance is inconsistent, and at risk of bias (mean attendance 2% higher, 95% CI 5% lower to 8% higher; 20,650 participants, three trials, very low-certainty evidence). No trials reported on physical fitness. No effect was shown on mortality (1,005,135 participants, three trials, low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Public health programmes to regularly treat all children with deworming drugs do not appear to improve height, haemoglobin, cognition, school performance, or mortality. We do not know if there is an effect on school attendance, since the evidence is inconsistent and at risk of bias, and there is insufficient data on physical fitness. Studies conducted in two settings over 20 years ago showed large effects on weight gain, but this is not a finding in more recent, larger studies. We would caution against selecting only the evidence from these older studies as a rationale for contemporary mass treatment programmes as this ignores the recent studies that have not shown benefit.The conclusions of the 2015 edition have not changed in this update.

### A review of the clinical presentation of dientamoebiasis [^cdd6901a]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

Among 750 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, Dientamoeba fragilis was detected at a prevalence of 5.2% and more common than Giardia intestinalis. Most infected patients presented with diarrhea and abdominal pain with symptoms greater than 2 weeks duration being common. Bacterial and viral causes of infection were excluded by routine microbiological techniques. Treatment of D. fragilis infection with either iodoquinol, paromomycin, or combination therapy resulted in the eradication of the parasite and complete resolution of symptoms. Treatment failure/relapses were associated only with the use of metronidazole. Nineteen patients were examined for pin worm, no Enterobius vermicularis, a proposed vector of transmission, were detected. Intermittent shedding of D. fragilis was found to be highly variable. These studies confirm the pathogenic nature of D. fragilis and we recommend laboratories routinely test for the organism.

### Peripheral eosinophilia found in pediatric enterobius vermicularis infections [^001e72c0]. Clinical Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Enterobius vermicularis, the common pinworm, is well known in North America as a parasitic infection, mainly affecting children. It is a very contagious organism, and it is responsible for a high number of infections in the United States each year. A rise in eosinophilia is linked to most parasitic infections. However, the correlation between eosinophilia and enterobiasis infections is not well documented in the literature. In this article, we present 3 cases involving patients seen for pediatric gastroenterology consultation with concern for inflammatory bowel disease. As part of their evaluation, each patient was found to have eosinophilia of unknown significance with an ultimate diagnosis of pinworm infections made by endoscopy. Their illness presentation did not include classic enterobiasis symptoms such as rectal pruritus or nighttime irritability. These cases support a link between eosinophilia and enterobiasis that may be instructive for pediatric providers seeing patients with eosinophilia for which there is no readily apparent underlying cause.

### Eosinophilia and potential antibody cross-reactivity between parasites in a child with pinworm and immune dysregulation: a case report [^fef8c014]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Enterobiasis or pinworm is caused by cecum infection by E vermicularis (Ev) and represents the most common and the least pathogenic of all intestinal parasitic infections in both adults and children. Transmission occurs via faeco-oral route and infected individuals can transmit Ev eggs to others through contaminated hands, bedding, clothing and other surfaces, so that the infection usually spreads among children attending daycare and all the members of the household.

Most children with enterobiasis are asymptomatic, but many report intense nocturnal perianal itching, insomnia, restlessness, irritability and urticaria. Vulvovaginitis, weight loss, diarrhoea, recurrent abdominal pain, and colitis with eosinophilia have also been reported. Ev localization in the appendix may mimick appendicitis.

### Antihelminthics in helminth-endemic areas: effects on HIV disease progression [^f0bdb58d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Quality of the evidence

We have presented the GRADE assessment of the quality of evidence in the included trials in the 'Summary of findings' tables (Table 1 ; Table 2 ; Table 3). The overall assessment of quality ranges from moderate (representing a moderate level of certainty in the result) to very low (where we are very uncertain of the result).

The primary reason for downgrading the quality of evidence was 'indirectness', where we had too few trials to make broad generalizations about the potential effects. This is a particular problem for trials that evaluate deworming in populations with unknown helminth infection status as helminth endemicity varies substantially across settings, undoubtedly influencing observed findings. Although we had more data from trials that evaluated deworming drugs in participants with documented helminth infections, the substantial heterogeneity in populations and deworming drugs used again decreased our confidence in making broad generalizations. The second most common reason for downgrading the quality of evidence was 'imprecision' in effect estimates. Many of the included trials were small, and had wide 95% CIs, which included the possibility of both clinically important effects and no effect.

Potential biases in the review process

Judd Walson is a co‐author of this Cochrane Review and was Primary Investigator on two of the included RCTs. However, he was not involved in conducting any of the 'Risk of bias' assessments or in data extraction for this Cochrane Review.

There were not enough trials available in the published literature to be able to assess for publication bias.

### Enterobius vermicularis-associated appendicitis: a 22-year case series and comprehensive review of the literature [^e9753a7d]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Enterobius vermicularis is known to be associated with appendicitis, however a causal relationship between Enterobius and appendicitis has not been established. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between appendiceal Enterobius and histologic appendicitis.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed of all pediatric appendectomies between 1997 and 2019. Patients with diagnosed with Enterobius were included for analysis. Patient demographics, operative findings, and pathologic reports were queried. Data were entered into an encrypted database and subsequently analyzed. A comprehensive review of the literature was also conducted.

Results

Thirty-eight cases of Enterobius-associated appendicitis were identified out of 3541 (1.07%). Grossly normal appendices at operation were seen in 27% of patients. Inflammatory infiltrate was noted on histopathology in 78.3%, and Enterobius was considered to be the cause of that inflammation in 68.4%. The comprehensive literature review revealed 19 articles (1.87% incidence) that noted 35% of patients with appendiceal Enterobius had appendicitis on either histopathology or gross evaluation.

Conclusion

The high rate of inflammation on pathology found among our patients with pinworm appendicitis suggests an association with presentation as acute appendicitis. Our comprehensive review revealed a higher proportion of Enterobius appendicitis. Treatment with antihelminthic therapy is recommended.

### Investigating the effectiveness of current and modified World Health Organization guidelines for the control of soil-transmitted helminth infections [^5dc141ff]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

As parasite elimination is approached, issues related to reaching the last few infected individuals come to the fore. This is an area of active research. Recent work on systematic noncompliance with MDA treatment indicates that the importance of this factor to effective control by MDA varies between helminth species, with the longer-lived species perhaps most affected. The importance of accurate coverage data in informing policy is well understood. However, surprisingly, few longitudinal studies on compliance of individuals with anthelmintic treatment have been conducted. Such studies require individuals to be followed up over successive rounds of treatment, over a number of years. This poses considerable logistical challenges. The need for good MDA coverage data has driven the inclusion of individual-level and longitudinal data collection in the DeWorm3 study. Though the 3 dominant STH species are treated collectively in terms of the drug used and the formulation of the WHO treatment guidelines, differences are evident in required action to meet the WHO prevalence goal. Though we mirror current WHO guidelines in producing recommendations that are applicable across STH diseases as a whole, ideally the guidelines would reflect the locally dominant species and provide species-specific recommendations, as well as differentiating by disease prevalence. In very low-prevalence areas (<10%), current guidelines may be sufficient. Less reliably, given the models’ mixed predictions, the goal may be achievable in areas largely free of hookworm with Ascaris or Trichuris prevalence up to 20%. In all other circumstances, we strongly recommend community-wide treatment at high coverage. Regional circumstances and availability of data on prevalence of the different diseases will determine whether treating STH collectively or tailored by disease and local prevalence is the best approach. Where granular data are not available, we recommend community-wide treatment. In addition, given the low drug efficacy of mebendazole (rather than albendazole), we would expect more aggressive, higher-coverage MDA to be necessary where mebendazole is used. In clearing Trichuris, a more specific set of guidelines may be needed given the higher efficacy of an albendazole + ivermectin drug coadministration regimen.

### Distal radius fractures: what is the evidence? [^65a944e7]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To discuss the evidence base behind treatment of pediatric distal radius fractures.

Methods

We identified randomized controlled trials addressing the treatment of children with torus fractures, minimally displaced fractures, and displaced fractures of the distal radius.

Results

Torus fractures and minimally displaced fracture is treated by removable splints instead of circumferential casts with improved secondary outcomes for the patient and family and with equal position at healing. Case immobilization versus immediate pinning was studied in 2 small randomized trials of displaced fractures. Long-term outcomes were equivalent, despite more loss of reduction in the cast groups and more pin complications in the pin groups.

Conclusions

Unbiased evalution of empirical patient outcomes using randomized trials has proven feasible for distal radius fractures and should continue to inform and guide our practice in the future.

### Pruritic vulvovaginitis in a young girl: a case of vulvovaginal enterobiasis [^c910f614]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal enterobiasis is underreported and an often-missed diagnosis in prepubertal girls presenting with isolated nocturnal vulvar pruritus. An 8-year-old-girl with intense nocturnal vulvar itching for 4months was diagnosed with enterobiasis after microscopy of a vaginal swab revealed Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm) ova. The child and her family were treated with two doses of oral albendazole, 2weeks apart, resulting in symptom resolution. This case highlights the importance of considering enterobiasis as a differential diagnosis for nocturnal vulvar pruritus to prevent delayed treatment.

### Clinical care of soil-transmitted helminths-CDC (...) [^6ca13dfb]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Soil-transmitted helminths, including ascariasis, whipworm, and hookworm, are treatable with medication.
- Treatment is highly effective and can last 1 – 3 days.
- Dosage guidelines are the same for adults and children. Treatment options Oral albendazole, oral mebendazole, oral ivermectin, and oral pyrantel pamoate are available for human use in the United States. The safety of ivermectin for children weighing less than 15 kg is unclear. The FDA has not approved albendazole as a treatment for ascariasis nor hookworm infection. The FDA has not approved albendazole nor ivermectin for treating whipworm infection. Condition Drug Dosage Ascariasis Albendazole 400 mg orally once. Take on an empty stomach. Mebendazole 100 mg orally twice daily for 3 days or 500 mg orally once. Ivermectin 150 – 200 mcg/kg orally once. Take with water on an empty stomach. Whipworm Albendazole 400 mg orally once daily for 3 days. Take on an empty stomach.

Mebendazole 100 mg orally twice a day for 3 days. Ivermectin 200 mcg/kg/day orally for 3 days. Take with water on an empty stomach. Hookworm. Albendazole 400 mg orally once. Take on an empty stomach. Mebendazole 100 mg orally twice daily for 3 days or 500 mg orally once. Pyrantel pamoate 11 mg/kg orally for three days. Not FDA-approved as a treatment for ascariasis or hookworm infection. *Not FDA-approved as a treatment for whipworm infection. Treatment in Pregnancy Pyrantel pamoate is pregnancy category C. Data on the use of ivermectin in pregnant women are limited. In mass treatment programs for which the World Health Organization has determined that the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks, WHO allows use of pyrantel pamoate in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy.

However, in a pregnant woman infected with a soil-transmitted helminth, balance the risks of treatment for the fetus with the risks of disease progression in the woman the absence of treatment.

### Albendazole: a broad spectrum anthelminthic for treatment of individuals and populations [^806fb61d]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

It is over 25 years ago since the original animal research was conducted into albendazole. This review highlights some important steps in fundamental research and the management of helminth disease that have occurred in the past year, appearing in the published literature.

Recent Findings

In recent years there have been several published studies on lymphatic filariasis and on the impact of albendazole treatment on growth and nutrition. Recent work consolidates some of these data and supplies substantive evidence of benefit especially in the area of hookworm anaemia. Why treatment of helminths actually produces these effects has not been understood, but investigations have begun to highlight the underlying mechanisms that relate to immunity. During the last year several reviews of diagnosis and management of helminth diseases have been published which provide much needed guidance on the effective use of albendazole, and its place in treatment overall. In common with many other parasitic diseases, the validity of using single agents is being challenged, and combination therapy is being investigated at the experimental level and in clinical practice to improve therapeutic responses and to reduce the risk of resistance to the limited range of drugs currently available.

Summary

Albendazole has changed from being a drug for individuals with worms to one to treat communities and provide benefit in public health terms. In systemic parasitic disease, however, albendazole remains a treatment for individuals. Nearly 20 years of research and of clinical use has refined the tool, but new investigations suggest that much additional study is required before we fully understand helminth parasites and the benefits of treating them.

### Eosinophilia and potential antibody cross-reactivity between parasites in a child with pinworm and immune dysregulation: a case report [^07db165c]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Intestinal parasitic infections are common in humans, especially among young children. These conditions are often asymptomatic and self-limiting, and diagnosis is mainly based on the search for ova and parasites in the stools since serology may be biased due to cross reactivity between parasites. Pinworm is common in children and is not usually associated with hypereosinophilia; adhesive-tape test is the gold standard testing for the microscopic detection of Enterobious vermicularis (Ev) eggs.

Case presentation

A 13-year-old boy was referred due to a self-resolving episode of vomiting and palpebral oedema after dinner, together with a history of chronic rhinitis, chronic cough, absolute IgA deficiency and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and hypereosinophilia (higher value = 3140/µl). On evaluation we detected only palpable thyroid and hypertrophic nasal turbinates. Food allergy was excluded, but skin prick tests showed sensitization to house dust mites and cat epithelium and spirometry showed a marked obstructive pattern with positive bronchodilation test prompting the diagnosis of asthma for which maintenance inhaled treatment was started. Chest x-ray and abdomen ultrasound were negative. Further blood testing showed positive IgG anti-Echinococcus spp. and Strongyloides stercoralis and positive IgE for Ascaris, while Ev were detected both by the adhesive tape test and stool examination, so that we made a final diagnosis of pinworm infection. Three months after adequate treatment with pyrantel pamoate the adhesive-tape test turned out negative and blood testing showed a normal eosinophil count. The child later developed also type 1 diabetes.

Conclusions

We suggest the need to investigate for enterobiasis in children with hypereosinophilia and to consider autoimmunity as a potential confounding factor when interpreting serology for helminths.

### Public health deworming programmes for soil-transmitted helminths in children living in endemic areas [^622202ca]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Review authors DTR, PG, NM, SD, and MR independently assessed the risk of bias (Higgins 2011c). We resolved any differences through discussion. We corresponded with trial investigators when methods were unclear.

For RCTs that randomized individuals, we addressed six components: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other biases. For cluster‐RCTs, we addressed additional components: recruitment bias; baseline imbalance; loss of clusters; incorrect analysis; compatibility with RCTs randomized by individual. For each component, we placed judgments of low, high, or unclear/unknown risk of bias as described in Appendix 1. We displayed the results in ‘Risk of bias' tables, a ‘Risk of bias' summary, and a ‘Risk of bias' graph.

Measures of treatment effect

We summarized continuous data (means and SDs) using the mean differences (MDs). We used the risk ratio to compare the treatment and control groups for dichotomous outcomes. All treatment effects were presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Unit of analysis issues

For a particular cluster‐RCT when the analyses had not been adjusted for clustering, we attempted to adjust the results for clustering by estimating the design effect calculated as 1+(m‐1)*ICC where m is the average cluster size and ICC is the intra‐cluster correlation coefficient. To make the adjustment, we estimated a treatment effect that did not adjust for clustering and then multiplied the standard errors of the estimate by the square root of the design effect. When the true ICC was unknown, we estimated it from other included cluster‐RCTs.

Dealing with missing data

We aimed to conduct a complete‐case analysis, such that all patients with a recorded outcome were included in the analysis.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We inspected the forest plots to detect overlapping CIs, applied the Chi² test with a P value of 0.10 used to indicate statistical significance, and also implemented the I² statistic with values of 30% to 60%, 59% to 90%, and 75% to 100% used to denote moderate, substantial, and considerable levels of heterogeneity, respectively.

Assessment of reporting biases

We plotted funnel plots for weight, and we examined these plots for asymmetry, which would indicate the presence of small‐study effects. If small‐study effects had been detected, we would have explored further the possible reasons for these small study‐effects, including publication bias.

### Peritoneal lesions caused bysuspected to be metastases of ovarian malignancy [^788e3b0e]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Enterobius vermicularis , also known as pinworm, is a helminth that commonly causes intestinal parasitic infestation. E. vermicularis can also cause extraintestinal infestations. We report a case of lower abdominal pain and intermittent vaginal bleeding in a 45-year-old woman who was referred to our gynaecology department. On investigation, a transvaginal ultrasound showed a multilocular cyst in the left ovary, along with elevated levels of cancer antigen 125. Consequently, a laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. A biopsy of atypical peritoneal lesions revealed remains of E. vermicularis Peritoneal lesions are a rare complication of enterobiasis, and the diagnosis of this complication is usually delayed by limitations in diagnostic options. Although extraintestinal enterobiasis does not require treatment because it is the last stage of the parasitic cycle, primary intestinal infestation requires treatment with mebendazole.

### Efficacy of recommended drugs against soil transmitted helminths: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^aec1d5a3]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

In a second stage, we stratified analysis for cure rates and egg reduction rates according to continent, place of the study, sensitivity of diagnostic method, quality of the study, length of follow-up, intensity of infection at baseline, and year of publication (see tables D-J in appendix 2). By letting the treatment interact in the mixed regression model separately with study size and year, we estimated cure rates and egg reduction rates for small (n=30) and large (n=300; table K in appendix 2) studies and for years 1995 and 2015 (table L in appendix 2), to examine publication bias and evaluate the potential trends of efficacy over time.

We assessed the consistency between estimated odd ratios from direct and indirect comparisons by adding indicator variables for the two respective parallel treatments to the mixed logistic regression models. The difference of their regression coefficients was exponentiated to obtain the ratio between the odds ratio from direct and the odds ratio from indirect comparison (referred to as ratio of odds ratios). The two variables were obtained as the product of the respective treatment indicator variable and the indicator variable for studies that compared both treatments directly. The ratio of odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) measuring inconsistency between direct and indirect estimates are shown in appendix 3 (fig C). All analyses were done with STATA version 14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).

### Anthelmintic drugs for treating ascariasis [^f2e71335]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Measures of treatment effect

We used the risk ratio (RR) to compare the treatment and control groups for dichotomous outcomes. We presented all treatment effects with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a fixed‐effect model if there was no moderate or substantial heterogeneity. If there was clinical heterogeneity or if we detected substantial statistical heterogeneity, we used a random‐effects model. We planned to summarize continuous data (means and SDs) using mean differences (MDs).

Unit of analysis issues

We did not include cluster‐RCTs. See Data extraction and management for our intended methods should we have found such studies.

Certainty of the evidence

We used the principles of the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the evidence associated with all main outcomes (Schünemann 2011). The GRADE approach appraises the certainty of a body of evidence considering within study risk of bias, the directness of the evidence, heterogeneity of the data, precision of effect estimates, and risk of publication bias. We constructed 'Summary of findings' tables using the GRADEpro software (GRADEpro).

Dealing with missing data

We assessed missing outcomes data and reported the proportion of participants lost to follow‐up for each study. We used the number of available participants at the time point at which the outcome was measured as the denominator.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We assessed heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plot for overlapping CIs and outlying data and we used the Chi² test with a P value of 0.1 to indicate statistic significantly heterogeneity, and the I² statistic. We used an I² statistic of 50% to denote moderate heterogeneity and 75% or greater to denote substantial heterogeneity. We intended to investigate possible causes of heterogeneity in subgroup analyses.

Assessment of reporting biases

We planned to construct funnel plots to assess publication bias, but did not as there was a limited number of trials in each analysis.

### Unmasking the role of constipation in treatment-refractory enterobiasis in Bangladeshi children [^76f7f266]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In routine pediatric and gastroenterology outpatient practice, enterobiasis (enterobius vermicularis infection) is a common condition. While typically mild, chronic and recurrent cases are not uncommon and can often be refractory to standard treatment protocols. In our study, we analyzed 114 cases of treatment-refractoryenterobiasis, and notably, 96% of these children had underlying constipation, which had been previously unaddressed or inadequately treated.The hallmark symptom of symptomatic enterobius vermicularis infection is perianal itching, particularly at night, caused by the nocturnal migration of gravid female worms to the perianal region. Consistent with this, 100% of children in our study presented with perianal itching and passage of worms during nighttime.Sleep disturbances, particularly crying at night, are also commonly associated with enterobius vermicularis infection. We observed this in 64% of our patients, indicating significant discomfort and sleep disruption. Other associated symptoms such as abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, increased frequency of micturition, and nocturnal enuresis were frequently reported. These symptoms are likely multifactorial, potentially arising from both constipation and pinworm infestation.In certain cases, E. vermicularis may mimic or coexist with other gastrointestinal disorders. It has been associated with abdominal pain resembling acute appendicitis, and may cause appendicitis. Additionally, enterobiasis can occasionally present with features overlapping chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In one patient in our study, colonoscopy was performed under suspicion of IBD, but E. vermicularis was identified instead (video 3).We also observed that symptoms such as encopresis, defecation immediately after meals, frequent defecation with small-volume stools, nocturnal enuresis and abdominal distension occurred in approximately 7–10% of patients. These clinical features are strongly suggestive of occult constipation. In female children, migration of adult worms to the vaginal or vulvar area can lead to vaginal irritation, inflammation, and mucoid discharge. We identified a few such cases in our cohort, where worms were removed from the vaginal region during nocturnal observation. It’s important to differentiate enterobiasis from other conditions that can mimic its presentation. For example, intestinal myiasis may be misdiagnosed as pinworm infestation, leading to ineffective treatment with antihelminthics. Similarly, in infants, cow’s milk allergy can be a significant cause of recurrent perianal pruritus. In our study, however, each case was diagnosed by direct visualization of adult worms in the perianal region, which helped rule out these differential diagnoses.Traditional treatments such as herbal and ayurvedicremedies are used in South Asian countries, including Bangladesh. In our study, 18% of children had received such traditional treatments like raw garlic and neem leaves,, including homeopathic and herbal medications before enrolled in this study, but none showed any clinical improvement.This use of traditional remedies reflects the strong influence of cultural practices on health-seeking behavior in the study population. Several effective antihelminthic agents are available for the treatment of enterobiasis, including mebendazole, albendazole, and pyrantelpamoate. These drugs are typically administered as a single-dose therapy, with a second dose repeated after two weeks to prevent auto-infection and ensure the elimination of newly developed adult worms. As enterobiasis often affects entire households, it is essential that all family members be treated simultaneously to prevent re-infection. In cases of recurrent infection, a “pulse regimen”—repeating doses at regular intervals over an extended period—is recommended. In our study, all included children had already undergone pulse regimen therapy with poor or no response prior to enrollment. Notably, there is a scarcity of data in the literature regarding treatment-refractory enterobiasis. One case report describes a child who continued to pass worms despite fortnightly albendazole for 6 months, with no definitive resolution. Our study found a significant association between treatment-refractory enterobius vermicularis infection and constipation. When constipation was identified and treated adequately, all cases showed complete symptom resolution. This highlights a critical and previously underexplored link. There is a lack of comparable studies evaluating how constipation may impact treatment outcomes in enterobiasis. In vivo studies have demonstrated that reduced gastrointestinal motility significantly impairs helminth clearance, whereas normal or enhanced motility is critical for effective parasite expulsion. One possible explanation is that sluggish bowel motility delays the expulsion of dead worms and eggs, allowing them to remain in the rectum and perianal region. This increases the chances of autoinfection and retroinfection.However, eight cases (four with constipation and four without) did not respond to treatment, raising the possibility of antihelminthic drug resistance or ectopic infections, especially vagina may have served as an ectopic reservoir for enterobius vermicularis [,–], although we were unable to confirm these hypotheses. We fully acknowledge the absence of a control group as a major limitation of our study. Another key limitation is the relatively small sample size and the fact that the study was conducted in a single geographic region, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. Symptom severity was not assessed and duration of follow up was short. Another point, our study did not perform routine vaginal sampling or gynecologic evaluation for genital tract infestation in female patients. We recommend conducting a well-designed study with an appropriate control group with longer follow-up to strengthen causal inference and clarify the role of constipation in treatment-refractory enterobiasis.

### Efficacy of recommended drugs against soil transmitted helminths: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^9fa7a82f]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Drug efficacy against hookworm

For estimating the drug efficacy against hookworm, we looked at data from 7178 individuals from 38 studies (table 1; table N in appendix 2) with an average Jadad score of 2.8. Pooled estimates included 12 studies with one treatment,21 studies with two treatments,and five studies with three treatments.

The cure rate was 15.2% (95% confidence interval 9.3% to 23.9%) for placebo (table 1). The rate with levamisole (10.3%, 2.4% to 35.2%) did not differ significantly from the placebo rate, but was significantly higher with albendazole (79.5%, 71.5% to 85.6%; P<0.001), mebendazole (32.5%, 20.8% to 46.9%; P=0.011), and pyrantel pamoate (49.8%, 29.5% to 70.1%; P=0.001). The one to one comparison of cure rates showed a strongly increased odds of cure after the administration of albendazole compared with mebendazole (P<0.001), levamisole (P<0.001), and pyrantel pamoate (P=0.005, fig 2). The odds for levamisole were significantly lower than the odds for pyrantel pamoate (P=0.016).

We used data from 34 studies(fig 3) to determine an egg reduction rate of 16.2% (95% confidence interval 5.3% to 27.1%) for placebo, which was significantly lower than the rates for all active treatments (table 1). Albendazole had the highest average rate of 89.6% (81.9% to 97.3%), followed by pyrantel pamoate (71.9%, 54.7% to 89.0%), levamisole (61.8%, 30.3% to 93.3%), and mebendazole (61.0%, 52.0% to 69.9%). The one to one comparison showed a significant difference between albendazole and mebendazole (P<0.001, fig 2).

### Investigating the effectiveness of current and modified World Health Organization guidelines for the control of soil-transmitted helminth infections [^a701b2b3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

Considerable efforts have been made to better understand the effectiveness of large-scale preventive chemotherapy therapy for the control of morbidity caused by infection with soil-transmitted helminths (STHs): Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and the 2 hookworm species, Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale. Current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for STH control include mass drug administration (MDA) programs based on prevalence measurements, aiming at reducing morbidity in pre–school-aged children (pre-SAC) and school-aged children (SAC) by lowering the prevalence of moderate- to heavy-intensity infections to <1%.

Methods

We project the likely impact of following the current WHO guidelines and assess whether the WHO morbidity goals will be achieved across a range of transmission settings. We also investigate modifications that could be made to the current WHO treatment guidelines, and project their potential impacts in achieving morbidity and transmission control.

Results

While the standard guidelines are sufficient at low transmission levels, community-wide treatment (ie, involving pre-SAC, SAC, and adults) is essential if WHO morbidity goals are to be met in moderate- to high-transmission settings. Moreover, removing the recommendation of decreasing the treatment frequency at midline (5–6 years after the start of MDA) further improves the likelihood of achieving morbidity control in SAC.

Conclusions

We meld analyses based on 2 mathematical models of parasite transmission and control by MDA for the dominant STH species, to generate a unified treatment approach applicable across all settings, regardless of which STH infection is most common. We recommend clearly defined changes to the current WHO guidelines.

### Survey design to monitor drug efficacy for the control of soil-transmitted helminthiasis and schistosomiasis [^49efe70d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Typically, egg count measurements are performed longitudinally, meaning that the same individuals are tested before and after drug administration. To save resources, it is common practice to exclude individuals with zero pretreatment egg counts from further testing, both in drug trials and field settings. This is considered especially relevant in settings with low infection levels where the majority of baseline samples will turn out egg-negative, and the perception is that retesting these individuals (who are likely to retest negative) is a waste of resources. For example, in a setting with 10% prevalence, one might consider screening 1000 individuals (per trial arm) at baseline, select the 100 egg-positive individuals, and treat and retest these 100, leading to a total of 1100 tests. This is considered more cost-effective than testing 550 individuals twice (before and after drug administration), of whom only 55 would be positive at baseline.

The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends that estimates of drug efficacy in endemic populations targeted by preventive chemotherapy be based on surveys that select individuals who are egg-positive at baseline. However, the practice of basing the efficacy estimate on the same counts that are used for selection should be expected to result in a type of statistical bias known as regression toward the mean. This occurs due to a systemic overestimation of the pretreatment egg count resulting from a combination of random variation in egg counts within individuals over time (due to natural temporal variation in egg density and imperfect diagnostics) and the practice of excluding counts that do not meet a threshold value. This becomes obvious if considering a theoretical second set of samples taken on the same day from the included individuals: this second set of samples may well include zero counts and would therefore be expected to have a lower mean (on average) than the counts that were used to select these individuals. This mechanism inflates estimates of drug efficacy but is not considered to be a problem in randomized controlled trials as randomization ensures that any bias is equivalent across trial arms and therefore cancels out in the comparison of trial arms. However, in field surveys, this bias hinders comparison of drug efficacy estimates to a fixed reference value. Despite its potential importance, this bias has not previously been studied in field settings. We present results from bespoke simulation software to demonstrate and quantify the potential magnitude of this bias. We further propose alternative yet simple designs for surveillance of drug efficacy that aim to eliminate the source of bias while optimizing the use of limited resources.

### Efficacy of recommended drugs against soil transmitted helminths: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^3cdaafc1]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

The diagnostic methods used in the reviewed studies ranged from lowest sensitivity methods, such as the direct smear, up to multiple Kato-Katz thick smears, which have a reasonable sensitivity. The sensitivity of diagnostic methods is associated with the infection intensity at baseline—for example, Kato-Katz has a reduced sensitivity for low egg counts.Both the diagnostic method and infection intensity at baseline directly influence cure rates and egg reduction rates.While the results stratified by infection intensities did not show a clear tendency for efficacy in this review, the sensitivity of the diagnostic method had an impact. Stratification of efficacy by low and moderate sensitivity of the diagnostic method significantly decreased cure rates of albendazole against A lumbricoides (P=0.044) and hookworm (P=0.023). We cannot, however, explain the increase in egg reduction rates with albendazole (P=0.024) against T trichiura (table E in appendix 2).

An additional limitation of the diagnostic methods (Kato-Katz, McMaster, etc) is their inability to distinguish between A duodenale and N americanus. Few included studies reported efficacies for specific hookworm species. The overall efficacies might differ according to the species. For example, while both hookworm species are somewhat susceptible to pyrantel pamoate, N americanus is reported to be less sensitive.The commonly higher abundance of N americanus in Africa than in Asiamight have led to the borderline significant difference (P=0.053) in cure rates of pyrantel pamoate in Asia (64%) and Africa (27%; table C in appendix 2).

The network meta-analysis for egg reduction rates was limited by the lack of precision estimates in most of the studies and by the different choices of the measure of central tendency (arithmetic or geometric mean). There is an ongoing debate about advantages and disadvantages of the two systematically different means, while WHO now recommends the arithmetic mean.A few, mainly older, studies did not even report which measure of central tendency they used. In the absence of standard errors and confidence intervals, we could not optimise the precision of meta-analytic estimates. Moreover, as arithmetic and geometric means are systematically different, we had to adjust analyses of egg reduction rates for the type of mean.

### The appropriate indicator should be used to assess treatment failure in STH infections [^13eae9d6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

Dear Sir:

We write to comment on the article by Humphries and othersrecently published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene : in our opinion, the study is well conducted, however, we respectfully disagree with the conclusions and in particular with the claim made by the authors about the failure of albendazole treatment of hookworms.

We summarize here the reasons of our disagreement:

Humphries and others base the claim for albendazole failure in treating hookworm infection on the analysis of cure rate (CR) results that they measured at 61%; however, in the case of infections caused by hookworm and other soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), the CR is not a good indicator of drug efficacy because it is influenced by the intensity of infection at baseline and by the sensitivity of the parasitological method used to recover eggs from stool.As a result, it is very difficult to compare CRs obtained in different settings and reach meaningful conclusions about differences in drug efficacy. Our opinion is that drug efficacy in STH infections should be assessed with a more apt indicator, namely the egg reduction rate (ERR).

The data presented by Humphries and others show an ERR of over 80% and this corresponds to the normal range of efficacy of albendazole against this parasite,as correctly reported by the authors.

We would also like to stress the fact that the main objective of preventive chemotherapy against hookworm and other STH infections (those by Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura) is not to achieve cure of infected individuals, but rather to significantly reduce the number of worms harbored by such individuals; this is because the average observed reduction (that can be measured by counting the number of eggs passed out in feces) is sufficient to cause the parallel decrease:
• of transmission (because of the reduced number of eggs contaminating the environment); and
• of morbidity (because the few surviving worms—that cannot replicate in the human host—cause less harm to the human host).

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^50336b23]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Infectious Causes

Vulvovaginal itching of acute onset is frequently attributed to infection with fungal, bacterial, or parasitic species. VVC results from an overgrowth of Candida species, predominantly Candida albicans, due to disruptions in the normal vaginal flora. The release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines stimulate nerve endings in the vaginal area, resulting in pruritus, edema, and erythema of the region. VVC is not typically acquired through contagion but rather from alterations in the environment that are favorable for fungal species, such as obliteration of the healthy vaginal microbiome defenses, moisture trapping in the inguinal region, and elevated skin surface pH, and states with lower immunological defenses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or higher glucose availability seen in pregnancy and diabetes. Yosipovitch et al. found that the skin surface pH in intertriginous areas, such as the inguinal region, is significantly higher in diabetic patients compared with healthy individuals, which may promote susceptibility to candidal infections. This elevated pH can create an environment conducive to Candida overgrowth and infection. Tinea cruris affects the inguinal creases and labia majora, presenting with a visible rash, unlike the discharge characteristic of candidiasis.

In bacterial vaginosis (BV), an imbalance in the vaginal microbiota, results in the elevated pH that is more favorable for pathogenic, anaerobic bacteria such as Gardnerella vaginalis, than protective bacteria, such as Lactobacilli. While BV does not typically cause inflammation, it can lead to discomfort and itching if it progresses to anaerobic vaginitis [,–]. The imbalance in the vaginal microbiome of patients with BV increases susceptibility to opportunistic or sexually transmitted infections. It can also contribute to itch by activating keratinocytes and peripheral nerve fibers, thus stimulating the release of alarmins and histamine. However, itch is not a sensitive or specific sign of bacterial vaginosis.

Group A β-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) infections, more common in prepubertal females, and other bacterial infections such as those caused by Staphylococcus aureus can also cause vulvovaginal symptoms, but often affect the vulvar skin. Parasitic infections such as trichomoniasis, pediculosis pubis (pubic lice), Enterobius vermicularis (pinworms), and scabies can cause genital itching. Viral infections such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), human papillomavirus (HPV), and molluscum contagiosum may also present with vaginal itch.

### Small bowel intussusception andinfestation in a 20-year-old woman [^9022d2ef]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 20-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain and MRI findings of intussusception of the distal small bowel with no identifiable lead point and no visualisation of the appendix. A diagnostic laparoscopy succeeded in manually reducing the intussusception but was unable to find any candidate lead point. Intraoperatively, hyperperistalsis was observed throughout the small bowel which seemed prone to transient intussusception. Incidental appendectomy revealed an uninflamed appendix with Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm) infestation, the most common parasite present in appendectomy specimens worldwide. Although intussusception in young adults is an uncommon occurrence, the unique nature of this case is amplified by the concurrent finding of E. vermicularis infection of the appendix in an adolescent in western Canada, a phenomenon normally observed in paediatric populations with higher incidence in tropical areas. Although the mechanism of intussusception in this patient remains unclear, it is hypothesised that E. vermicularis colonisation acted as an irritant stimulating intestinal hypercontractility with resulting intussusception. Successful medical eradication of the pinworm in this individual may prevent future recurrence.

### Antihelminthics in helminth-endemic areas: effects on HIV disease progression [^bd7f3fb1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Measures of treatment effect

We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CIs). We summarized continuous outcomes using mean differences with 95% CIs. For some studies we utilized only data from HIV‐positive participants and the trial authors provided the raw data accordingly.

HIV disease progression is associated with a decline in CD4+ cell counts and an increase in viral load. A favourable effect of deworming drugs on CD4+ cell count therefore refers to either a larger increase in CD4+ cell count or a smaller depletion in CD4+ cell count. A suppressive effect on viral load refers to either a reduction in viral load, or a smaller increase in viral load.

Unit of analysis issues

For trials with repeat outcome measurements over time, we utilized and reported the study's final outcome measure reflecting the whole follow‐up time for each individual participant. For studies with 2 x 2 factorial designs in which there were more than one treatment group we chose not to combine experimental intervention groups into a single group and risk loss of information regarding the effects of different antihelminthic treatments. Rather, we chose to present the interventions separately and divide the total number of participants in the control group to account for multiple comparisons in meta‐analyses. The means and standard deviations were left unchanged as recommended in Section 16.5.4 of the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins 2011). This method only partially overcomes the unit‐of‐analysis error (because the resulting comparisons remain correlated). However, an advantage of this approach is that it allows for investigations of heterogeneity across intervention arms.

Dealing with missing data

We contacted trial authors where there were missing or unclear data. We considered missing data resulting from losses to follow‐up to be missing at random unless there were indications otherwise.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We assessed heterogeneity amongst trials by inspecting the forest plots (to detect overlapping CIs) and the I² statistic with a level of 50% to denote moderate levels of heterogeneity, as well as by applying the Chi² test with a P value of 0.10 to indicate statistical significance, as described in Section 9.5.2 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).

Assessment of reporting biases

We could not perform an assessment of the likelihood of reporting bias due to an insufficient number of included trials.

### Investigating the effectiveness of current and modified World Health Organization guidelines for the control of soil-transmitted helminth infections [^f33fc62c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Figure 2 reveals that for both annual and biannual baseline treatment, the current WHO guidelines are more successful at achieving the morbidity goal if the midline (5–6 years after the start of MDA) medium-heavy prevalence is low. When hookworm and Trichuris midline prevalences are <10%, the current WHO guidelines almost always take the prevalence of moderate to heavy infections in SAC to <1%, according to both models. In contrast, both models identify that in scenarios in which prevalence is >50% at baseline and remains so at the midline, twice-yearly followed by thrice-yearly treatment is unable to control transmission for any of the STH species.

In contrast, both models predict a substantial improvement in morbidity outcomes with community-wide treatment, with the WHO morbidity goal being met in most settings (Figure 3). The primary exception is high-transmission hookworm settings, in which outcomes are more mixed. Model predictions differ on whether the goal will be achieved where baseline prevalence exceeds 50%. No villages in the EMC model remained above 50% infection prevalence at the midline evaluation; however, results from the ICL model suggest that those that do (representing areas particularly resilient to treatment) will fail to meet the morbidity target, despite the much broader community-wide coverage.

Figure 2 shows some differences in the predictions of the 2 models to treatment interventions. The descending rows, in each column, show results from villages of increasing prevalence at the midline decision point. Generally, for villages with a low transmission intensity (and so low prevalence at midline), the ICL model shows a lower endline prevalence than the EMC model. For villages with high transmission intensity, the EMC model generally shows the greater response to treatment. These differences reflect the different modeling approaches to impact of individual worm load on egg production. Given identical age-specific levels of infection, adults contribute more to transmission in the EMC model than in the ICL model because of different assumptions about age patterns in the practice of open defecation (see Supplementary Data). As such, the EMC model predicts a larger benefit of community-wide treatment (Figure 3 vs Figure 2) over targeted deworming of SAC compared to the ICL model.

### Predicting the risk and speed of drug resistance emerging in soil-transmitted helminths during preventive chemotherapy [^19a9ab51]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We performed sensitivity analyses for the impact of baseline allele frequencies in monogenic resistance, degree of heritability in polygenic resistance, drug efficacy against non-resistant worms, patterns in PC uptake, and the impact of a potential resistance-associated fitness loss. First, lower initial allele frequencies were associated with higher probabilities of elimination and a delayed decline in drug efficacy if elimination was not achieved (Fig. 3). If the initial resistant allele frequency was 1% (instead of 5%), it took longer for drug efficacy to drop below 85%. Depending on the inheritance mechanism, this delay was about 10 ten years (recessive) or as little as approximately 4 (co-dominant) or 2 years (dominant). Second, for polygenic resistance, higher assumed degrees of heritability led to faster declines in drug efficacy if elimination was not achieved, but only marginally affected the probability of elimination itself (Supplementary Information E, Supplementary Figs. E3–4). Third, lower drug efficacy (80%) against non-resistant worms (using monogenic resistance as an example) led to somewhat lower probability of elimination but also somewhat slower declines in drug efficacy if elimination was not achieved (Supplementary Information E, Supplementary Figs. E5 and 6). Fourth, higher PC coverage was associated with a higher probability of elimination (Supplementary Information E, Supplementary Figs. E7 and 8) but also a faster decline in drug efficacy if elimination was not achieved (Fig. 4). When individual uptake of PC was correlated over time (in contrast to random over time, as in the main analysis), systematically non-treated individuals served as a reservoir of unselected worms, postponing elimination (Supplementary Information E, Supplementary Fig. E8) and slowing down the declining trend in drug efficacy (Fig. 4). These effects were most pronounced for hookworms and settings with lower population coverage of PC. Fifth and last, a fitness loss in terms of lower female worm egg productivity (a 1/3 reduction for full resistance and a 1/6 reduction for partial resistance) resulted in slightly higher probability of elimination and a slower decline in drug efficacy when elimination was not achieved (Supplementary Information E, Supplementary Figs. E9 and 10).

Twenty‐three trials reported the ERRs (Table 5). Only five trials reported the impact of treatment stratified by infection intensity (mild, moderate, or heavy) (Albonico 1994 ; Albonico 2002 ; Albonico 2003 ; Rossignol 1983 ; Speich 2014).

Seventeen trials reported adverse events (Adams 2004 ; Adegnika 2014 ; Albonico 1994 ; Albonico 2002 ; Albonico 2003 ; Fox 2005 ; Jongsuksuntigul 1993 ; Knopp 2010 ; Legesse 2002 ; Ortiz 2002 ; Palmeirim 2018a ; Rossignol 1983 ; Silber 2017 ; Speich 2014 ; Steinmann 2011 ; Wen 2008 ; Wimmersberger 2018) (Table 6).

### The appropriate indicator should be used to assess treatment failure in STH infections [^7bebb776]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

As an additional comment, we would also like to express our concern about the method used by the authors to assess drug quality (i.e. in vitro anthelminthic activity), because this method has never been validated for albendazole that is insoluble in water; in addition, in our experience, the key factors in determining the quality of drugs used against STH are the tablet dissolution and disintegration times, and none of them was tested by the authors.

Finally, we strongly disagree with the authors' statement that “ mebendazole and pyrantel are not any longer recommended for the treatment of hookworm infection ”; again, the studies on which the authors formulate their conclusion are based on the evaluation of the cure rate,,and therefore, for the reasons mentioned previously, not conclusive. As a matter of fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) continues to include mebendazole and pyrantel in the list of recommended drugs for the treatment of STH infections.

The WHO is seriously concerned about unjustified claims of drug resistance made on the basis of incorrect interpretations of parasitological results and on the poor understanding of the STH biology and control strategies. These claims create uncertainty among the managers of control programs about the efficacy of the control measures to be implemented and undermine the scaling up of STH control activities.

As a consequence, a working group reporting to the WHO Strategic and Technical Advisory Group on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) was established with the aim of developing a Standard Operating Procedure to be implemented whenever a control manager suspects a reduction of the drug activity (report available at).

Although we hope that this much needed tool will be available before the end of the year, we take this opportunity to invite AJTMH and other scientific journals to carefully assess the grounds on which claims of drug failure are based should similar papers be submitted for publication.

### Empirical antibiotic therapy for difficult-to-treat Gram-negative infections: when, how, and how long? [^5d591833]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To discuss empirical therapy for severe infections due to Gram-negative bacteria with difficult-to-treat resistance (GNB-DTR) in current clinical practice, focusing in particular on the positioning of novel therapeutic agents and rapid diagnostic tests.

Recent Findings

The current era of novel agents active against GNB-DTR and showing differential activity against specific determinants of resistance is an unprecedented scenario, in which the clinical reasoning leading to the choice of the empirical therapy for treating severe GNB-DTR infections is becoming more complex, but it also allows for enhanced treatment precision.

Summary

Novel agents should be used in line with antimicrobial stewardship principles, aimed at reducing selective pressure for antimicrobial resistance. However, this does not mean that they should not be used. Indeed, excesses in restrictive uses may be unethical by precluding access to the most effective and less toxic treatments for patients with severe GNB-DTR infections. Given these premises (the 'how'), empirical treatment with novel agents should be considered in all patients with risk factors for GNB-DTR and severe clinical presentation of acute infection (the 'when'). Furthermore, empirical novel agents should preferably be continued only for a few hours, until de-escalation, modification, or confirmation (as targeted therapy) is made possible by the results of rapid diagnostic tests (the 'how long').

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF SPECIAL POPULATIONS (SP)

XXVI. Should children be managed differently from adults?

Recommendation.

47 There is no evidence that management of NCC in children should be different from adults with the same form of disease (strong, moderate). Dosing should be weight based.

Evidence summary.

The clinical spectrum of NCC is somewhat different in children from adults. Children are more likely to present with SEL and cysticercal encephalitis. Both albendazole and praziquantel have been used safely in millions of children aged more than 1 year. The pharmacokinetics of the drugs is similar to those seen in adults. Because of the incubation period between infection and onset of symptoms, it is rare for NCC to present in infants and there are limited data on drug safety, pharmacokinetics, or efficacy in this population.

### Safety of hookworm infection in individuals with measurable airway responsiveness: a randomized placebo-controlled feasibility study [^6b7e53da]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

Assessment of subject blinding

All participants were asked at their final study visit, before being unblinded, if they thought they knew whether they had received hookworm or placebo infection. Of the 14 individuals in the placebo group who completed the study, three correctly thought they had received placebo, five that they had received hookworm, and six did not know. Of the 13 with hookworm infection who completed the study, eight correctly thought that they had received hookworm, two thought they had received placebo, and three did not know.

Follow-up

All participants who received hookworm were provided with mebendazole at the end of the study to eradicate the infection. However, 11 of the 13 participants who completed the study chose not to take the treatment, citing either a perceived improvement in hayfever symptoms, or that they wished to see if they had a change in symptoms the following year. In accordance with our protocol, participants in the placebo group were offered hookworm infection at the end of the trial, of whom 11 chose to be infected.

### Clinical overview of pinworm infection (...) [^7de52dd5]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Mebendazole and albendazole are available for prescription to treat pinworm.
- Pyrantel pamoate is available without prescription.
- Consider safety precautions of medications in different populations. Treatment and recovery The medications used for the treatment of pinworm are either mebendazole, pyrantel pamoate, or albendazole. Pyrantel pamoate is available without prescription. Treatment involves two doses of medication with the second dose given two weeks after the first dose. The medications kill worms but cannot kill eggs. The second dose is important to prevent infection by newly hatched adult worms that were not killed by the first treatment because they were still eggs. Health practitioners and parents should weigh the health risks and benefits of these drugs for patients under two years of age.

Drug Dosage and duration Notes Mebendazole Adults and children: 100 mg orally; repeat in two weeks Pyrantel pamoate Adults and children: 11 mg/kg orally; repeat in two weeks Available in oral suspension, capsules, or chewable tablets. Albendazole Adults and children: 400 mg orally once; repeat in two weeks Take on an empty stomach. Oral mebendazole, oral pyrantel pamoate, and oral albendazole are all available for human use in the United States. The safety of drugs used to treat pinworm have not been studied for. Pyrantel Pamoate Treatment in Pregnancy Pyrantel pamoate is a pregnancy category C drug. Data on the use of ivermectin in pregnant women are limited. In mass drug administration campaigns for which the World Health Organization has determined that the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks, WHO allows use of pyrantel pamoate in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy.

However, in a pregnant woman infected with a soil-transmitted helminth, balance the risks of treatment for the fetus with the risks of disease progression in the woman the absence of treatment. Treatment in pediatric patients The safety of pyrantel pamoate in children is unclear. According to the WHO guidance on preventative chemotherapy, children aged one year and older may use pyrantel during MDA campaigns without diagnosis. The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children lists pyrantel pamoate as an intestinal anthelminthic medicine that can be use in children one year of age and older.

Results

Characteristics of included studies and bias assessment

We identified 301 potential studies of albendazole, mebendazole, levamisole, and pyrantel pamoate for treating soil transmitted helminth infections (fig 1). From these, we excluded 245: 82 were not randomised, 87 used a different dose regimen, 37 had follow-up longer than six weeks, 23 used only drug combinations, and data were not extractable from 16 (table B in appendix 2). From the 56 remaining studies, one included only egg reduction rates, while 10 did not report egg reduction rates. A total of 44 studies had data on cure rates against A lumbricoides, and 38 presented data on hookworm and T trichiura. For the analysis of egg reduction rates we included 34 studies for hookworm and 33 for A lumbricoides and T trichiura. Studies including treatments consisting of placebo and albendazole and albendazole and mebendazole were most common. The inconsistency plot showed considerable differences between odd ratios of cure from direct and indirect comparisons for some of the drug pairs (fig C in appendix 3), but none of these differences reached significance.

The percentages of studies in the lowest categories for risk of bias were 41.1% for random sequence generation, 30.4% for allocation concealment, and 51.8% for incomplete outcome data. The percentage of studies in the highest category for risk of bias was largest for blinding of participants and personnel (25.6%). The category of unclear risk was largest in all criteria other than “incomplete outcome data.” This was especially pronounced among studies published before the year 2000 (table M in appendix 2).

COVID-19 ivermectin harms—tolerability is noted, but the potential for serious adverse events cannot be excluded in hospitalized patients and ambulatory persons. In doses typically used for the treatment of parasitic infections, ivermectin is well tolerated. We are unable to exclude the potential for serious adverse events in hospitalized patients and ambulatory persons with COVID-19 treated with ivermectin rather than no ivermectin, (RR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.32, 3.34; moderate CoE and RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.51, 1.30; moderate CoE, respectively).

### Enterobius vermicularis infection of the liver in a patient with colorectal carcinoma with suspected liver metastasis [^4dbe0b81]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 68-year-old man diagnosed with cT3N2 adenocarcinoma of the rectum presented with a synchronous solitary liver metastasis on CT scan. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was started to downstage the primary tumour. Resection of the rectal tumour followed 3months after the last radiotherapy session and primary resection of the isolated liver lesion was performed in the intervening period. Histopathological assessment of the liver lesion, however, showed no malignancy, but did reveal a necrotic infection due to Enterobius vermicularis. This parasite is frequently found in the intestines, but only rarely infects the liver. The patient was subsequently treated with the anthelmintic drug mebendazole 100mg once a week for 2weeks. Histopathological assessment of the rectal specimen showed complete regression after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy without evidence of remaining E. vermicularis, suggesting pinworm eradication. The patient recovered promptly after both surgical procedures.

### Evidence of autochthonous human strongyloides stercoralis in South Carolina [^e29b27d2]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

Local providers’ general unfamiliarity with S. stercoralis is an ongoing barrier to greater detection and control of this parasite in the state. During the chart review analysis, S. stercoralis was sometimes confused with pinworm (Enterobius vermicularis), and the incorrect antiparasitic medication was prescribed. Although this confusion is comprehensible given the rarity of the parasite and providers’ limited experience with helminthic infections in general, a missed S. stercoralis case can result in severe patient consequences. Persons living with HIV, cancer, or other immunosuppressive conditions are particularly at risk for hyperinfection syndrome. Those at greatest risk are persons living with chronic infection that are newly initiating immunosuppressant medications; therefore, it is imperative that family medicine doctors, internists and oncologists consider STH panel testing for at-risk populations living in the southern states with historic transmission.Further, missed cases contribute to ongoing transmission; thus, identification of veritable cases not only benefits the immediate patient but also, their family (in the setting of expanded family testing) and those in the broader local community. Greater awareness and ongoing surveillance strategies are necessary to better detect and control S. stercoralis transmission in SC and nearby states.

There are a few study limitations worth discussion. First, the biobanked serosurvey used a convenience sampling design, which was not representative of SC’s population. The original study focused outreach on three marginalized communities (rural populations, lower socioeconomic populations, and populations of color), which are independent at-risk groups for infection that may have biased the seroprevalence results. Robust, representative samples to validate state seroprevalence estimates are warranted. Second, the follow-up prospective sampling and survey results may be biased because of low participation rates and overall low counts. These results should be interpreted with caution. Third, detailed exposure and travel histories were not available given the study designs used, which limits the ability to confirm infection origin. Lastly, none of the participants from the three studies had positive PCR results, which placed diagnostic reliance on serologies. Serologies are not perfect indicators of active infection, nor do they provide Strongyloides species confirmation. To compensate for this potential, the authors performed multiple rounds of serologic testing and used a conservative positive diagnostic test definition (2+ plate wells with a positive test result).

Drug efficacy against A lumbricoides

We evaluated 44 studies with an average Jadad score of 2.5 and a total of 7273 participants positive for A lumbricoides (table N in appendix 2 gives detailed numbers) to evaluate the effect of the four anthelmintic drugs against A lumbricoides (fig 1). Pooled estimates were based on 19 studies with only one treatment,22 studies with two treatments,and three studies with three eligible treatments.

The four anthelmintic drugs investigated showed highly significant superiority (all P<0.001) over placebo (the average cure rate with placebo was 12.7% (95% confidence interval 6.7% to 22.7%; table 1). Estimated average cure rates were 95.7% (93.2% to 97.3%) for albendazole, 96.2% (92.3% to 98.1%) for mebendazole, 97.3% (84.2% to 99.6%) for levamisole, and 92.6% (85.6% to 96.3%) for pyrantel pamoate. There were no significant differences among the four treatments in the one to one comparison (fig 2).

Thirty three studies reported egg reduction rates(fig 3). All treatment arms showed significantly higher rates (P<0.001) than placebo (20.7%, 95% confidence interval 14.7% to 26.7%; table 1), while there were no significant differences between the rates with the four treatments (fig 2). The highest estimated egg reduction rate (98.5%, 94.9% to 100.0%) was for albendazole, followed by 98.0% (94.0 to 100.0) for mebendazole, 96.4% (82.3 to 100.0) for levamisole, and 94.3% (88.3 to 100.0) for pyrantel pamoate.

Data extraction and management

Two review authors (ARM and PB) independently extracted data from the included trials using standardized data extraction forms for randomized trials, as detailed in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).

We extracted the following characteristics from each included trial.

Administrative details: identification; author(s); published or unpublished; year of publication; year in which study was conducted; funding source.
Details of study: study design; randomization method; duration; completeness of follow‐up; country and location of the study; setting (for example, urban or rural, hospital or clinic); method(s) of recruitment; number of participants by trial arm.
Characteristics of participants: age; gender; socioeconomic status; HIV clinical staging (if available); antiretroviral (ART) status.
Details of intervention: medication; dose; duration; number of treatments; control group.
Details of outcomes: primary outcome; unit of measurement; change in viral load; change in CD4+ count; change in rate of clinical HIV disease progression (changes in the WHO or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staging); nutritional indicators; adverse events; mortality.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two review authors (ARM and PB) independently evaluated the methodological quality of included clinical trials using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).

We followed the guidance to assess whether adequate steps were taken to reduce the risk of bias across five domains: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants and personnel; blinding of outcome assessors; and incomplete outcome data.

For sequence generation and allocation concealment, we reported the methods used. For blinding, we described who was blinded and the blinding method. For incomplete outcome data, we reported the percentage and proportion of participants lost to follow‐up. We categorized our 'Risk of bias' judgements as either 'low', 'high', or 'unclear'. Where risk of bias was unclear, we attempted to contact the trial authors for clarification and resolved any differences of opinion through discussion.

### Pinworm control and risk factors of pinworm infection among primary-school children in Taiwan [^0f366dd6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2001). Low credibility.

Longitudinal pinworm (Enterobius vermicularis) infection rates were estimated at a mass screening for first-grade children during 1991-1996; children were provided medication at the screening. This campaign was able to decrease the infection rates for the 1991 cohort from 16.3% to 0.6%. A case-control study was further conducted for the investigation of risk factors among fourth-graders. Cases comprised 429 children with at least one infection between September 1996 to June 1999, and controls were 280 randomly selected uninfected classmates. Parents were asked to complete a questionnaire survey to report students' personnel hygiene habits. The case-control study revealed that significant factors associated with the infection included playing on the floor (odds ratio [OR], 2.5), nail biting (OR, 2.1), failure to wash hands before meals (OR, 1.7) and living in nonapartment dwellings (OR, 1.6). Girls were at a higher, but not significant, risk (OR, 1.4), than boys. In conclusion, inadequate personal hygiene increases the risk for pinworm infection. The mass screening-medication campaign can be adapted to countries with a similar parasitic problem.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence—The grading framework includes categories such as “Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence” where “Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa” and “Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies,” with the implication that “Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.” For “Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence,” “Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects” and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that “The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient’s or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.” Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including “Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence,” where “Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available,” and “Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence,” where “Other alternatives may be equally reasonable” and “Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain.”

### Efficacy of recommended drugs against soil transmitted helminths: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^0278accc]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Moreover, after stratification by year, we found a significant decrease in cure rates for albendazole against T trichiura (P=0.039) and a remarkable reduction against hookworm (table I in appendix 2). These results were even more pronounced in the interaction analysis. The cure rates for albendazole against T trichiura remained significantly lower (P=0.027). Furthermore, egg reduction rates of albendazole (p=0.027) against hookworm and of albendazole (P=0.049) and mebendazole (P=0.014) against T trichiura (table K in appendix 2) significantly decreased over time, which might be attributable to drug resistance.Several studies correlated reduced efficacies of benzimidazoleswith emerging resistance. In 2015, more than a billion people infected with lymphatic filariasis and soil transmitted helminths were treated with albendazole,which is causing high drug pressure on parasites and might trigger drug resistance. In veterinary medicine, frequently repeated treatment with benzimidazoles has caused resistance in numerous nematode species.Resistance to anthelmintic drugs in humans, however, has not yet been shown. While the reduction in efficacy could be explained by emerging resistance, other factors, related to drug regimen, diagnostics, or host and parasite characteristics, might have contributed to the reduction.We evaluated the impact of some potential confounders but did not assess the influence of, for example, drug quality (original versus generic drugs), change in compliance over the years, or the day to day variation in egg excretion.Hence, future randomised controlled trials should follow a harmonised design to reduce confounders, as suggested by WHO,which will yield improved summary estimates of efficacy of anthelmintic drugs.
