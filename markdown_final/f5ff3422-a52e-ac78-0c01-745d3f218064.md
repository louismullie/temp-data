## Question

Can gardnerella cause a uti

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Gardnerella vaginalis can cause a urinary tract infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical definitions and thresholds that distinguish colonization from true infection. Then, I should verify Gardnerella's usual niche and whether it is ever a uropathogen. Next, I will examine mechanistic and epidemiologic evidence linking Gardnerella to UTI, including in special populations. After that, I need to check guideline positions and diagnostic pitfalls that could lead to misclassification. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and outline when treatment might be reasonable despite uncertainty.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: a UTI generally requires compatible symptoms plus pyuria and bacteriuria at meaningful concentrations, typically at least 10⁵ CFU/mL for a single organism in a clean-catch specimen, or 10²–10³ CFU/mL if obtained by catheterization, with culture guiding therapy. Otherwise, low-count or mixed growths are often contamination or asymptomatic bacteriuria, which should not be treated outside specific exceptions [^6b07763f] [^d430b8bf] [^fea7aa60].

> Now, I need to verify Gardnerella's usual niche and whether it belongs in the urinary tract at all. Gardnerella is a common vaginal colonizer and a hallmark of bacterial vaginosis. It is frequently detected in urine even in asymptomatic women, reflecting shared urogenital microbiota rather than frank infection, and it is often categorized as a contaminant when isolated in low numbers from voided specimens [^a2658411] [^6a1ee710] [^3b73fc49].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should check whether Gardnerella can ever behave as a uropathogen. Case reports document invasive disease attributable to Gardnerella, including bacteremia and abscesses, and even septic arthritis in immunocompromised hosts, indicating pathogenic potential under the right conditions, though these are rare events rather than typical community-acquired UTI presentations [^e6027a92] [^2a03e522] [^4d8a74bf].

> Next, I should review mechanistic and epidemiologic links to UTI. Transient urinary exposure to Gardnerella has been associated with emergence of Escherichia coli into the bladder, a phenomenon termed "covert pathogenesis", and women with Gardnerella in urine are more likely to have histories of recurrent UTI or pyelonephritis. Observational data in pregnancy also associate bacterial vaginosis with increased odds of UTI, though causality is complex and may reflect altered host defenses rather than direct invasion by Gardnerella itself [^10318cc0] [^279a2546].

> I need to ensure I weigh diagnostic pitfalls. Standard urine culture underdetects fastidious organisms and is prone to contamination from vulvovaginal flora, so low-count Gardnerella in a voided specimen is often a contaminant. Molecular methods and expanded quantitative urine culture can reveal Gardnerella in asymptomatic women, reinforcing that detection does not equal disease, and guidelines advise treating only when clinical criteria are met and contamination is reasonably excluded [^3b73fc49] [^6b07763f] [^a2658411].

> But wait, what if the patient is symptomatic and Gardnerella is the only organism identified at significant counts, or there is recurrent UTI with repeated Gardnerella presence? In select scenarios, particularly with compatible symptoms and exclusion of contamination, a trial of therapy may be reasonable, recognizing that evidence is limited and that Gardnerella is not a classic uropathogen. If pursued, agents with anaerobic coverage such as metronidazole or clindamycin are reasonable choices based on BV data, though urinary penetration and clinical response vary and decisions should be individualized [^ea53c8da].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis. Gardnerella is not a typical cause of acute uncomplicated UTI in immunocompetent patients, and its presence in urine most often reflects colonization or contamination. However, in special contexts — immunocompromise, instrumentation, pregnancy, or recurrent UTI phenotypes — Gardnerella may contribute to pathogenesis or serve as a marker of dysbiosis that facilitates true uropathogens, so I should avoid reflexively treating while remaining open to targeted therapy when clinical and microbiologic criteria align [^10318cc0] [^279a2546] [^3b73fc49].

> Final answer: Yes, Gardnerella vaginalis can rarely cause UTI, particularly in patients with impaired host defenses, instrumentation, or complex genitourinary disease, but in most cases its detection in urine represents colonization or contamination rather than true infection. Treatment should be reserved for symptomatic patients with supportive urinalysis and culture data after excluding contamination, and decisions should be individualized given the limited direct evidence base [^e6027a92] [^2a03e522] [^3b73fc49] [^a2658411].

Gardnerella vaginalis can cause **urinary tract infections (UTIs)** [^e6027a92], particularly in women with bacterial vaginosis or other risk factors, but it is **not a typical uropathogen** [^3b73fc49] and is often a contaminant in urine cultures [^3b73fc49]. UTIs due to Gardnerella are more likely in **immunocompromised patients** [^11bc8190], those with **indwelling catheters** [^11bc8190], or when there is **ascending infection from the vagina** [^10318cc0]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical correlation**, **pyuria**, and **significant bacteriuria** on culture or molecular testing [^d430b8bf]; treatment is with **metronidazole or clindamycin**, as Gardnerella is **susceptible to these agents** [^ea53c8da].

---

## Pathogenicity and virulence factors

Gardnerella vaginalis possesses several **virulence factors** that enable it to cause infection:

- **Biofilm formation**: Gardnerella forms biofilms on vaginal and urinary epithelium, facilitating persistence and resistance to host defenses [^f4c4a741].

- **Adhesion proteins**: These proteins enable attachment to uroepithelial cells, promoting colonization and infection [^b77886cb].

- **Enzymes**: Gardnerella produces enzymes such as sialidase and prolidase, which degrade host tissues and facilitate invasion [^5276f967].

---

## Clinical evidence of UTIs caused by Gardnerella

Several studies and case reports document **UTIs caused by Gardnerella vaginalis**:

- **Case reports**: Gardnerella has been isolated from patients with UTIs, including complicated cases such as pyelonephritis and bacteremia [^e6027a92] [^2a03e522].

- **Polymicrobial infections**: Gardnerella is often found in polymicrobial UTIs, particularly in patients with indwelling catheters or immunocompromised states [^138d7e42].

- **Association with bacterial vaginosis**: Women with bacterial vaginosis, characterized by an overgrowth of Gardnerella, have an increased risk of UTIs [^279a2546] [^10318cc0].

---

## Risk factors for Gardnerella-associated UTIs

Certain patient populations and conditions increase the risk of **UTIs caused by Gardnerella**:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Immunocompromised state | Immunocompromised patients, including transplant recipients and those with HIV/AIDS, are at increased risk [^11bc8190] [^4d8a74bf] |
| Indwelling urinary catheters | Catheters provide a pathway for bacterial ascent and biofilm formation [^674a86b6] |
| Bacterial vaginosis | Altered vaginal flora increases the risk of ascending infection [^10318cc0] |
| Pregnancy | Hormonal changes and altered urinary tract dynamics increase susceptibility [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic challenges

Diagnosing UTIs caused by Gardnerella presents several **challenges**:

- **Contamination**: Gardnerella is a common vaginal inhabitant, and its presence in urine samples may reflect contamination rather than true infection [^3b73fc49].

- **Culture limitations**: Standard urine culture methods may not reliably detect Gardnerella, leading to underdiagnosis [^a2658411].

- **Clinical correlation**: Diagnosis requires careful clinical correlation, including symptoms, pyuria, and significant bacteriuria [^d430b8bf].

---

## Treatment considerations

Treatment of UTIs caused by Gardnerella typically involves **antibiotics active against anaerobic bacteria**. Metronidazole and clindamycin are effective options [^8504ef0a]. Antibiotic selection should be guided by **culture and sensitivity results**, if available, and consideration of patient-specific factors such as allergies and pregnancy status [^d430b8bf].

---

## Conclusion

Gardnerella vaginalis can cause **UTIs**, particularly in patients with specific risk factors such as immunocompromise, indwelling catheters, or bacterial vaginosis [^e6027a92] [^10318cc0]. While not a typical uropathogen, Gardnerella possesses virulence factors that enable it to cause infection. Diagnosis requires careful clinical correlation and appropriate laboratory testing, and treatment should be guided by antibiotic susceptibility and patient-specific factors [^d430b8bf].

### The biofilm in bacterial vaginosis: implications for epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment [^f4c4a741]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent evidence supports the view that bacterial vaginosis presents as a polymicrobial biofilm infection. This has far-reaching implications for the pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.

Recent Findings

Gardnerella vaginalis is presumably the first species to adhere to the vaginal epithelium and then becomes the scaffolding to which other species adhere. Not all G. vaginalis strains do form biofilms: G. vaginalis can be present in the vagina in a planktonic or in a biofilm mode of growth. The presence of planktonic (dispersed) or biofilm-associated (cohesive) G. vaginalis can be reliably shown in urine sediments in both women and men, and there is an absolute concordance in the carriage of biofilm-associated (cohesive) G. vaginalis between women with bacterial vaginosis and their partners. In-vitro data suggest that selected probiotic lactobacilli might be an effective means to conquer the biofilm.

Summary

Future epidemiological research may benefit from biofilm-based urine diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis to a significant extent. The search for novel therapeutic agents can now be more directed towards the biofilm-breaking agents, but is at present hampered by the lack of a proper in-vitro model of the bacterial vaginosis biofilm.

### Is the microbiome influencing patient care in lower urinary tract dysfunction? Report from the ICI-RS 2017 [^36ffd195]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

This report sets out to consider the role of the microbiome within the bladder to provide clinicians with knowledge on this specific area of research and recommend potential topics for further studies.

Methods

This is a report from the Plenary 6: Is the microbiome influencing patient care in lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD)?

Results

There appear to be complex associations between microbial presence in the bladder and lower urinary tract symptoms. There appears to be a greater role of bacteria in the development of overactive bladder symptoms than previously thought with bacteria such as Gardnerella highlighted to be more prevalent in women with urgency urinary incontinence. Some species of Lactobacillus have also been found to play a protective role in both overactive bladder syndrome and bladder pain syndrome.

Conclusions

The bladder is a reservoir for bacterial colonization and what was previously thought to be a sterile environment now seems to be a complex interaction of both multiple protective and pathogenic bacterial species than can give rise to lower urinary tract symptoms. While most clinicians use antibacterial agents as part of treatment regimens, and evidence does suggest a role of antibacterial therapies in treatment of LUTS, this remains a far from an ideal solution.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^3b73fc49]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — urine culture contamination is common and clinically consequential. Standard urine culture is susceptible to contamination with an average contamination rate of 15% across institutions; contamination is likely when there is low bacterial growth and/or growth of several species typical of urethral and vaginal commensals such as Lactobacilli, Corynebacteria, Gardnerella, alpha-hemolytic Streptococci, and aerobes. Contamination often arises in the pre-analytic phase (urine collection, storage, and transport), and false positives can lead to suboptimal or unnecessary treatment and added healthcare costs.

Gardnerella vaginalis causing significant infection in men is rare. We report a case of sepsis in a previously well man, who developed a perinephric abscess and empyema. G. vaginalis was isolated after prolonged culture of samples from both sites. The microbiological features of the case are discussed.

### Understanding the bacterial flora of the female genital tract [^9f11b8b4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The microbiological flora of the lower female genital tract provides a dynamic, complex example of microbial colonization, the regulation of which is not fully understood. When an exogenous bacterial species, with its array of virulence factors, is introduced into the host, disease does not always occur. Conversely, under selected conditions, commensal endogenous bacteria-for example, Gardnerella vaginalis and group B streptococci-can participate in disease processes. Disease caused by both exogenous and endogenous bacteria correlates positively with a markedly increased level of bacterial replication. The key question is what determines the quantity of a given bacterium at any given time. For disease to occur, exogenous or endogenous bacteria that possess pathogenic prerequisites must attain replicative dominance. Their ability to do so is potentially governed by inhibitory or synergistic interrelationships with other microbes.

### Urinary cell-free DNA is a versatile analyte for monitoring infections of the urinary tract [^a77f2714]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

In only 60% of the examined samples (26/43 UTI cases) was the organism identified in culture the most prevalent organism in the sample as measured by cfDNA (Fig. 2b). Whereas bacterial culture is skewed toward species that are readily isolated on routine bacteriological media employed for urine culture, cfDNA sequence analyses permit the identification of a broader spectrum of bacterial species. To evaluate this concept further, we assayed two samples collected from one of the subjects included in the analysis above diagnosed with Haemophilus influenzae bacteruria. H. influenzae is a very uncommon uropathogen that does not routinely grow on media employed for conventional urine culture (tryptic soy agar with sheep blood and MacConkey agar). Repeated urine cultures for this patient were negative, but given a urinalysis suggestive of a UTI and given that the patient developed H. influenzae bacteremia, the original urine specimen collected at presentation was re-plated onto chocolate agar, upon which H. influenzae was isolated. In the sample taken at the time of presentation, which was cultured, and also a sample taken 4 days after presentation, we observed H. influenzae cfDNA (0.037 RGE and 0.41 RGE, respectively). This case supports the utility of urinary cfDNA to identify infections where conventional culture fails.

Profiling the urinary microbiome

The urinary tract was regarded as sterile but recent studies have revealed that it often harbors microbiota. We examined the composition of the urinary microbiome by urinary cfDNA profiling (absence of UTI, n = 43) or collected within the first 3 days post-transplant (n = 12) (Supplementary Fig. 2). We found that the species-level abundance and the species-level diversity of the bacteriome are a function of the transplant recipient gender but not the donor gender. On average, we observed two to three orders of magnitude more cfDNA from Gardnerella (6125×), Ureaplasma (1686×), and Lactobacillus (321×) across female transplant recipients who did not have a UTI at the time of sampling compared to male recipients who did not have UTI; these bacterial genera have been characterized as microbial components of the vaginal microbiome. We examined the relationship between urine collection methods and the abundance and diversity of the bacteriome and found a notably reduced bacterial load for samples collected by indwelling catheter (samples collected within 4 days after transplant) versus clean-catch urine samples. cfDNA may be an ideal tool to study the urinary microbiome, but future studies need to account for the effects of gender and sample collection approaches.

### The female urinary microbiome in urgency urinary incontinence [^6c0ac85c]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to characterize the urinary microbiota in women who are planning treatment for urgency urinary incontinence and to describe clinical associations with urinary symptoms, urinary tract infection, and treatment outcomes.

Study Design

Catheterized urine samples were collected from multisite randomized trial participants who had no clinical evidence of urinary tract infection; 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was used to dichotomize participants as either DNA sequence-positive or sequence-negative. Associations with demographics, urinary symptoms, urinary tract infection risk, and treatment outcomes were determined. In sequence-positive samples, microbiotas were characterized on the basis of their dominant microorganisms.

Results

More than one-half (51.1%; 93/182) of the participants' urine samples were sequence-positive. Sequence-positive participants were younger (55.8 vs 61.3 years old; P = 0.0007), had a higher body mass index (33.7 vs 30.1 kg/m²; P = 0.0009), had a higher mean baseline daily urgency urinary incontinence episodes (5.7 vs 4.2 episodes; P < .0001), responded better to treatment (decrease in urgency urinary incontinence episodes, -4.4 vs -3.3; P = 0.0013), and were less likely to experience urinary tract infection (9% vs 27%; P = 0.0011). In sequence-positive samples, 8 major bacterial clusters were identified; 7 clusters were dominated not only by a single genus, most commonly Lactobacillus (45%) or Gardnerella (17%), but also by other taxa (25%). The remaining cluster had no dominant genus (13%).

Conclusion

DNA sequencing confirmed urinary bacterial DNA in many women with urgency urinary incontinence who had no signs of infection. Sequence status was associated with baseline urgency urinary incontinence episodes, treatment response, and posttreatment urinary tract infection risk.

### Body mass index and benign prostatic hyperplasia correlate with urinary microbiome diversity and lower urinary tract symptoms in men [^04de2804]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The bladder and urinary tract have long been considered sterile in the absence of infection; however, several studies have found evidence of a resident microbiome in both males and females –. The urinary microbiome encompasses the bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses that inhabit the bladder and urinary tract, and these microbes may play a role in diseases and disorders affecting the urogenital system. The majority of urinary microbiome studies have examined the female urinary microbiome and found there are various healthy microbiome compositions commonly dominated by Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Escherichia. Urinary microbiome studies in men have revealed several of the same bacteria found in women, such as Escherichia, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus, but the male urinary microbiome can also be dominated by genera such as Prevotella and Enterococcus –.

Importantly, differences in the types of bacteria found in the bladders of women have been associated with recurrent urinary tract infections, as well as lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) such as urge incontinence (the sudden urge to urinate followed by leakage of urine). The composition of the female urinary microbiome has also been found to be predictive of response to urgency urinary incontinence treatment, with a positive treatment response observed in patients with a less diverse microbiome. These studies have identified specific associations between the urinary microbiome and urological diseases, and indicate more broadly that the urinary microbiome may play a role in human health and disease.

Despite the numerous studies undertaken in women, far less is known about the urinary microbiome in men. Similar to the female urinary microbiome, there are studies demonstrating that alterations in male urinary microbiome composition have been associated with diseases and disorders. A "male urinary microbiome" literature search in 2023 resulted in 22 primary research articles. Researchers have identified potential relationships between the male urinary microbiome and kidney stones, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), as well as bladder and prostate cancers –, among many other disorders. Nonetheless, the urinary microbiome studies undertaken in men have had small cohorts (n < 100) and few have directly investigated the potential link between body mass index (BMI), age, and the male urinary microbiome. These associations could impact future study design and analysis. Larger studies are needed to both study and evaluate the broad applicability of these findings in males.

### Association of substance use and vaginal infection with UTI in adolescent pregnant patients: a retrospective study [^f787c4dc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections in pregnant women, pose a global health concern, especially in adolescents due to their unique physiological changes. In Mexico, 18.5% of births occur in adolescent mothers, making it crucial to develop effective protocols for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Vaginal infections involving Gardnerella vaginalis and Candida albicans, create a pro-inflammatory environment conductive to the growth of Escherichia coli within the uroepithelium. Additionally, psychoactive substance use compromises the immune system, leading to infections acquisition.

Methods

One hundred forty-four adolescent patients were enrolled between 8 and 20 weeks of gestation at the Instituto Nacional de Perinatología in Mexico City. Urine cultures were performed to detect UTI caused by E. coli. Phylogroup classification, clinical evaluation, and statistical analysis were conducted to assess risk factors and maternal/neonatal complications.

Results

Statistical correlation was found between UTI and infections due to G. vaginalis andC. albicans. Additionally, psychoactive substance use incremented risk of maternal UTI.

Conclusion

This study highlights the strong association between some vaginal infection and UTI caused by E. coli. Furthermore, psychoactive substance use promotes the acquisition of infections. These findings emphasize the need for comprehensive healthcare for adolescent pregnant patients.

### Culturing of female bladder bacteria reveals an interconnected urogenital microbiota [^a2658411]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Contrary to medical dogma, urine is not sterile, even in asymptomatic individuals –. For over 60 years, the standard urine culture protocol has represented the primary tool for detecting bacteria in clinical microbiology laboratories. This aerobic protocol was designed to detect causative agents of pyelonephritisand is particularly effective at detecting abundant Escherichia coli (> 10⁵ colony-forming unit (CFU)/ml) but little else. Culture-independent analysis of urine obtained by suprapubic aspirate, which bypasses the vulva, vagina, and urethra, demonstrates the presence of bacteria in the bladders of women. The microbial profiles observed in aspirated urine are similar to those in urine obtained by transurethral catheter (TUC), indicating the avoidance of urethral contamination in catheterized samples. We note the difference between TUC, which is transient and not associated with catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), and indwelling catheters that are known to harbor biofilms and result in CAUTI. Analyzing urine sampled by TUC, we previously found that the majority of asymptomatic women contain bacterial genera typically not detected by standard urine culture. These genera, including Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Corynebacterium, tend to be in low abundance (between 10 and 10⁴ CFU/ml)and require growth conditions and carbon sources not available in standard urine culture. Therefore, we developed an expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) protocol that captures a broad range of bacterial taxa.

Previous studies, using EQUC in combination with 16S rRNA sequencing, suggest the bladder microbiota of asymptomatic women typically contains low bacterial diversity, with increases in diversity indicative of urgency urinary incontinence symptoms and a decreased response to anticholinergic medication. They also highlight bacterial species (e.g. Streptococcus anginosus and Gardnerella vaginalis) that are associated with urgency urinary incontinence symptoms and others (e.g. Lactobacillus crispatus) that are associated with the lack of lower urinary tract symptoms. Evidence also exists that women with communities dominated by specific Lactobacillus species are less likely to develop post-instrumentation and postoperative urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, owing to the lack of bladder-specific bacterial reference genomes, high-resolution taxonomic characterization to the bacterial strain level, functional analysis, and comparison to other microbiota communities remain to be performed.

### Prevalence, risk factors, and adverse outcomes of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women: a systematic review [^a672f75b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study aimed to review the factors associated with BV and adverse pregnancy outcomes to highlight the gravity of this issue among pregnant women. Studies on the BV prevalence, risks, and outcomes were systematically identified and reviewed to synthesise all relevant literature on the topic. Bacterial vaginosis has emerged as a global women's health issue due to its association with pelvic inflammatory infections, cervicitis, endometritis, urinary tract infections, postoperative infections, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, increased susceptibility to HIV, and abnormal Pap smears. One of the most prevalent lower genital tract infections among women of reproductive age is BV; however, its diagnosis can be problematic. Around 50% of women with no signs or symptoms of BV have been identified with Gardnerella. It is crucial to determine the prevalence, risk factors, and adverse impact of BV so that early screening, diagnosis, and effective management can be implemented among pregnant women.

GARDNERELLA HETEROGENEITY — BEYOND "JUST GENETICS"

The Gardnerella genus of Actinobacteria (which have a high G-C content), includes several thin-walled Gram-positive pleomorphic species, that until recently were collectively classified as G. vaginalis. The first Gardnerella isolate was isolated by Leopold in 1953 on modified blood agar from cervical swabs and urine samples. Within the following 2 years, two reports by Gardner and Duke described the same bacterium as a proposed agent of BV (nonspecific vaginitis). Initial efforts to differentiate pathogenic and nonpathogenic Gardnerella strains used biotyping based on biochemical tests. Eight Gardnerella biotypes were described based on hippurate hydrolysis, lipase activity, and beta-galactosidase activity. Additional Gardnerella biotypes were resolved through added biochemical characterization. Although certain biotypes (e.g. lipase-positive) appeared to be somewhat associated with BV, this was not consistent across studies. Additionally, no clear associations were identified between these biotypes and known bacterial virulence factors. The clinical relevance of these biotypes therefore remains unclear, and the use of this system for the study of Gardnerella isolates has mostly been supplanted by molecular methods.

The Associations Between the Urinary and Vaginal Microbiomes

Alterations and variations in the VMB may influence urinary tract health, playing a key role in the pathogenesis of acute and rUTIs. The VMB has been demonstrated to be altered not only in women with rUTIs but also at the time of acute UTI and after treatment of a single infection, even in women without a history of rUTI. – Reproductive-aged women with rUTI show VMB depleted of H₂O₂-producing lactobacilli and increased rates of colonization with E. coli. Among lactobacilli, vaginal colonization with L. crispatus or L. jensenii significantly inhibits colonization with E. coli compared with other Lactobacillus species.

Rates of UTI rise in postmenopausal women. Estrogen diminution decreases the relative amounts of lactobacilli in parallel to thinning of the urogenital epithelium due to hormonal-based atrophy (see part I). Postmenopausal women receiving systemic or topical vaginal hormone therapy retain vaginal lactobacilli and show a lower rate of rUTI.

Mechanistically, uropathogens, such as E. coli, can colonize the vaginal introitus and the periurethra. The E. coli UTI is characterized by a series of colonization events, starting in the gastrointestinal tract, followed by establishment at the vaginal introitus and urethral meatus, and eventually reaching the bladder with the potential risk of further extension to the kidneys and even sepsis. Longitudinal examinations and sampling have shown that introital and urethral colonization precedes UTI symptoms. In addition, rUTI can be triggered by transient exposure to vaginal bacteria, most notably G. vaginalis, which is not traditionally considered uropathogenic. This transient urinary tract exposure to vaginal bacteria has been defined as "covert pathogenesis", as the exposure to G. vaginalis seems to induce E. coli emergence into urine, increasing its pathogenicity. Conversely, exposure to L. crispatus or heat-killed G. vaginalis does not induce E. coli emergence. Considering these findings, G. vaginalis should be itself considered a potential cause of urinary tract pathology. Individuals from whom G. vaginalis is isolated in urine samples are more likely to have a history of rUTI or recurrent pyelonephritis.

### Association of substance use and vaginal infection with UTI in adolescent pregnant patients: a retrospective study [^e395762f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The adolescent pregnant population is a low-studied group with high vulnerability. They are considered a high-risk group due to the prevalence of morbidities and mortality rates among them. Owing to their transitional and in-development endocrine, reproductive and immune systems, they face an elevated risk of acquiring perinatal infections and subsequent complications.

There are several risk factors for women of reproductive age to contract a urinary tract infection due to Escherichia coli. In the present study, we found a strong association between vaginal infection and UTI in pregnant adolescent patients, especially due to Candida albicans and Gardnerella vaginalis. A study conducted in Nepal regarding the association between vaginal infections in nonpregnant women with UTI with E. coli, showed a significant association with C. albicans. The pathophysiology of this association is not fully understood; nevertheless, a study conducted in mice showed that the infection with E. coli also enhances the virulence of C. albicans by increasing the biofilm formation through upregulation of the ASL-3 gene, responsible for biofilm formation and the HWP-1 gene promoting initial uroepithelial attachment. These studies show a possible vicious circle, with C. albicans acting as a risk factor for UTI caused by E. coli, and this bacterium promoting the persistence of C. albicans vaginitis. However, further evidence is lacking in the published research regarding this relationship in human subjects (Fig. 3).

### EAU guidelines on urological infections [^5a8d9658]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for recurrent urinary tract infection in women, more specifically with respect to probiotics, EAU 2025 guidelines recommend to offer local or oral probiotics containing strains of proven efficacy for vaginal flora regeneration to prevent cystitis.

### Can vaginal Lactobacillus suppositories help reduce urinary tract infections? [^3db5ca39]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) are a burden to patients and the health care economy. By definition, UTIs are considered recurrent if there are more than two in a 6-month period or three in 1 year. Recurrent urinary tract infections not only impair quality of life for patients but they also have significant economic consequences. In 2003, the estimated health care cost of UTIs annually was US $1.6 billion, and the health care burden is certainly higher two decades later. The cost of an acute UTI workup ranges from US $390 to US $730, not including the price of antibiotic treatment.

Women are often given multiple rounds of antibiotics between primary care physicians and specialists to treat infections. Consequently, these patients often seek non-antibiotic alternatives, such as vaginal probiotics and supplements, as these have gained significant attention in mainstream media and the lay press. There is an increasing body of literature supporting the use of vaginal Lactobacillus suppositories to reduce candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis infections; however, the role of vaginal probiotics for the prevention of rUTI is less clear. There is increasing data that the vaginal microbiome varies between individuals that are susceptible to urinary infections. As such, it stands to reason that a vaginal probiotic would be more effective in preventing rUTI.

The objective of this study was to determine whether vaginal probiotics are an effective means of prophylaxis for women suffering from rUTI.

### Association of substance use and vaginal infection with UTI in adolescent pregnant patients: a retrospective study [^5b3b87e4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

One of the populations at higher risk of developing UTI, vaginal infections and psychoactive substance abuse are adolescents. In Mexico, adolescents aged 15 to 19 account for 7.3% of all urinary tract infection (UTI) cases in women and 15.9% of adolescents at middle and high school have used psychoactive drugs at least once, with marijuana being the most commonly consumed substance). In Mexico, 18.5% of births are from adolescent mothers, creating a maternal and child health problem that few entities address. There are many risk factors that impact the immune system, such as nutritional deficiencies, diabetes, hormonal changes, stress, age, among others, thus allowing the development of urinary tract infections. Therefore, in this research, we aim to analyze the association that exists between the presentation of vaginal infection, especially Candida albicans and Gardnerella vaginalis, and psychoactive substance abuse as a risk factor for UTI in adolescent pregnant patients that were attended at the "Instituto Nacional de Perinatología" in Mexico City, as well as its correlation with perinatal complications. Understanding the link between vaginal infections, psychoactive substance use, and urinary tract infections in pregnant adolescents may help reduce maternal and neonatal complications. Being a middle- income country with high incidence of psychoactive substance use and infection prevalence, especially among younger and immunologically vulnerable population, we hypothesize that E. coli urinary tract infection will be highly associated with vaginal infections and psychoactive substance use in adolescent pregnant patients.

### In-depth microbiological characterization of urine from subjects with type 2 diabetes [^a82558bc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Gender differences in the human microbiota are implicitly due to differences in anatomical structures and hormone levels. In particular, higher levels of Lactobacillus spp. have been observed in the urinary tract of aging women with T2D, confirming our finding of more lactobacilli in slightly younger females with T2D. The increase of lactobacilli could be mainly addressed to L. iners prevailing in T2D in our study; conversely, the prevalence of L. gasseri, a probiotic bacterium also inhabiting the vagina of some women, was drastically reduced in T2D. In previous studies, L. gasseri showed anti-obesity and anti-insulin resistance effects. Its reduction in the urinary tract in concomitance with T2D could be one of the factors leading to the increase of insulin resistance, typical of T2D.

Prevalences of F. hominis and N. succinicivorans were selectively reduced in males with T2D. A few cases of genitourinary and urinary tract–derived blood infections due to these 2 species have been reported in recent years, including pyelonephritis, balanoposthitis, and interstitial cystitis. Although their role in human health still needs to be explored, the lowering of such bacteria in T2D may thus correlate with a reduced risk of infection in males. In parallel, in females with T2D W. neuii was found to be less prevalent than in healthy women. Winkia neuii is a common colonizer of the skin and female urinary tract, and rarely can determine infections in humans. As for F. hominis and N. succinicivorans, the reduction of such a potential pathogen in T2D could represent a positive aspect but, at the same time, a symptom of alteration of the vaginal microflora. Conversely, B. ravenspurgense, G. vaginalis, and M. curtisii were more present in women with T2D than in healthy individuals. While little is known about the role of B. ravenspurgense in humans, G. vaginalis and M. curtisii have been much more investigated over the years. Gardnerella vaginalis is part of the vaginal microbiota but it can frequently cause bacterial vaginosis in concomitance with a local dysbiosis. Mobiluncus curtisii is also commonly associated with recurrent bacterial vaginoses and some reports indicated the species as causative agent of bacteriemia and sepsis in adults. Their increased prevalence in T2D should be regarded as a potentially alarming signal, due to their well-known pathogenic role in the female genitourinary tract.

### Culture-independent identification of pathogenic bacteria and polymicrobial infections in the genitourinary tract of renal transplant recipients [^138d7e42]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

Renal transplant recipients are predisposed to urinary tract infections caused by both common uropathogens and opportunistic bacteria resulting frequently in significant polymicrobial infections. In this study, a culture-independent 16S rRNA-based approach was established to identify unusual, fastidious, or anaerobic bacteria and to investigate bacterial diversity in urinary tract specimens. Similarly sized amplicons encompassing the V6 to V8 region of the 16S rRNA were analyzed with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) (WAVE System). Artificial mixtures of single amplicons from commonly encountered uropathogenic bacteria produced distinct peak profiles whose identities were confirmed by sequencing individually collected peak products. We evaluated the application of the method on 109 urinary tract specimens from renal transplant recipients; 100% correlation was found for culture-positive specimens, and DHPLC generated peak profiles. However, for culture-negative specimens, DHPLC facilitated the detection of novel peak profiles. DNA sequencing of these individual peaks was used to identify the bacteria involved. Thus, in PCR-positive but culture-negative samples the method allowed detection of previously known uropathogens such as Corynebacterium urealyticum and Gardnerella vaginalis, but also unusual agents including Anaerococcus lactolyticus, Bacteroides vulgatus, Dialister invisus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus iners, Leptotrichia amnionii, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella ruminicola, Rahnella aquatilis, and Streptococcus intermedius were detected as single pathogens or as constituents of polymicrobial infections. The method described is reproducible and rapidly and enables both DHPLC-based profiling and sequence-based investigation of microbial communities and polymicrobial infections. A detailed understanding of infections found in recipients of renal transplants will guide antibiotic therapy regimens and provide new perspectives for decreasing the risk of graft rejection.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^ed0ec4c3]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

THE CLINICAL LANDSCAPE OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS

An estimated 400 million urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur each year globally, with over 200,000 associated deaths, making UTIs one of the most common bacterial diseases and drivers of antimicrobial usage. UTIs disproportionately affect women, up to 60% of whom experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. This association is generally attributed to anatomy, although hormonal factors also play an increasingly recognized role, including in relation to the vaginal microbiome. Traditionally, a UTI is defined by clinical signs and symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, pelvic or lower abdominal pain, pyuria, or urinary incontinence — often in combination with identification of an offending pathogen via urine culture. This symptom-based approach to UTIs can lack sensitivity or specificity in certain populations, including the very young and elderly, or individuals who are chronically catheterized, with urologic or neurologic abnormalities. For these patients, signs and symptoms can be ambiguous.

### Urogenital cultures and preterm birth in women with cervical cerclage: a single center retrospective cohort study [^db4fa8c5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

At present, it remains unclear how women with cervical cerclage should be followed-up during pregnancy. The role of routine urogenital culture screening in asymptomatic women with a cerclage remains unproven, even more specifically it is unclear if the treatment of these cultures reduces the risk of sPTB. The primary aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the presence of microorganisms found in pre- or post-cerclage vaginal or urine cultures (i.e. positive cultures) and GA at delivery in women who underwent cervical cerclage depending on their cervical cerclage indication. In line with the leading hypothesis that ascending urogenital infections may lead to sPTB in women with cervical insufficiency, we hypothesized that positive urogenital cultures would negatively impact GA at delivery in women who underwent cervical cerclage. The secondary aim of this study was to investigate the effect of antibiotic treatment on GA at delivery in women with positive urogenital cultures depending on the cervical cerclage indication. We hypothesized that treatment of positive urogenital cultures would have positive impact on GA at delivery. Thirdly, we conducted an exploratory analysis on a range of other maternal and neonatal outcomes and their relationship with positive urogenital cultures and the effect of antibiotic treatment depending on the cervical cerclage indication. Finally, we added a narrative description of the cases with pre- or post-cerclage vaginal cultures positive for Gardnerella vaginalis (GV), given that a meta-analysis of 2013 has reported that BV doubles the risk of preterm birth. Ultimately, the results of this study may guide local and international recommendations for routine assessment of urogenital cultures in patients with cervical cerclage as was practiced at our institution.

### Characterization of the GU microbiome in women with self-perceived bladder health over the life course [^305bd1e0]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

The microbial diversity of the GU microbiome remains relatively stable in women with self‐perceived bladder health over 1 year. Age appears to play a role in the GU microbiome, with women older than 60 years demonstrating differences in microbial diversity compared to their younger counterparts. The primary genus that confer this difference in women > 60 years old were Gardnerella, Cupriavidus, and Dialister. Even in a population of women who self‐reported bladder health, those with more frequent urination/urgency demonstrated microbiome differences.

### Molecular-based testing for sexually transmitted infections using samples previously collected for vaginitis diagnosis [^d99ba955]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Vaginitis, which most often manifests clinically as abnormal discharge, dysuria, odor, or itching, is one of the most common causes of primary care office visits for women in the United States. Women seek care from a variety of provider types or clinical settings including obstetrician/gynecologists (OB/GYN), family planning, family practice, internal medicine, and sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics. For symptomatic women, diagnostic testing often depends on the clinic type, available diagnostic services, and provider assumptions about their clientele. These real-world factors could result in restricted diagnostic testing of some causes of vaginitis, to the exclusion of others. In addition, comprehensive diagnostic testing for women in primary care settings can be hampered by a reliance on clinical methods (eg, wet prep microscopy and visual assessment of discharge) that are subjective and/or require specialized equipment and training. In other cases, testing may carry stigma associated with sexually transmitted infections (STIs). As public funds continue to be withdrawn from STD-specific clinical services, primary care providers must take on the additional responsibility of providing these services for their clients. Making this type of testing both simple (eg, through use of a single sample) and normative (ie, it is provided for everyone with these symptoms) will both improve services for women and reduce the stigma associated with STI testing.

A distinction is often drawn by providers between vaginitis (which is generally not perceived as an STI) and STIs, which have a negative connotation associated with unsafe behavior. However, Gardnerella vaginalis, the predominate bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV), is considered by many to be associated with sexual activity, if not strictly an STI, and several studies have shown a correlation between sexual behaviors and risk for BV. In addition, Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) was initially considered to be transmitted by fomites, but is now known to be transmitted almost exclusively through sexual contact. TV is included in "vaginitis" guidelines because it is usually considered a vaginal infection and causes vaginal symptoms, whereas Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) cause cervical infection and cervicitis. Thus, many practitioners in non-STD clinical settings do not consider TV to be an STI, which largely restricts diagnostic coverage to vaginitis panels.

### Cervicitis: a review [^c09ef5fc]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Sexually transmitted infections impact significantly on global health. Whereas Chlamydia, Neisseria gonorrhoea and syphilis have been extensively examined, there remains a paucity of knowledge of nonchlamydial and nongonococcal cervicitis, an arguably more prevalent but poorly characterized condition with uncertain clinical implications. With increasing application of molecular diagnostic methods for the detection of sexually transmitted infections and a growing body of literature on cervicitis, a review is timely.

Recent Findings

The number of putative aetiological agents implicated in cervicitis is growing and includes Mycoplasma genitalium, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, bacterial vaginosis and Trichomonas. The potential role of cervicitis in HIV transmission has been highlighted. Increasing broad-spectrum antibiotic usage with associated emergence of antimicrobial resistance reinforces the need for targeted antibiotic therapies, including the management of cervicitis.

Summary

As our understanding of the aetiology and significance of cervicitis, particularly nonspecific cervicitis, improves, management will be refined. Advances in molecular diagnostic testing will facilitate this process, but urinary nucleic acid amplification testing should not replace clinical examination while cervicitis prevalence and significance is not yet established. A standardized approach to cervicitis research, particularly with consensus of case definition, may facilitate outcomes that can be more generally applied in clinical practice.

### Role of Gardnerella vaginalis in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis: a conceptual model [^b77886cb]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge and is associated with important public health complications such as preterm birth and acquisition or transmission of human immunodeficiency virus and sexually transmitted infections. Continued controversy concerning the pathogenesis of BV has led to a lack of progress in prevention and management of this infection.

Methods

Development of a conceptual model for the pathogenesis of BV based on review of past and current research.

Results

Our model suggests that BV is initiated by the sexual transmission of Gardnerella vaginalis, which has the appropriate virulence factors to adhere to host epithelium, create a biofilm community, and successfully compete with lactobacilli for dominance in the vaginal environment. The genetic diversity of G. vaginalis may result in virulent and avirulent strains. Symbiotic relationships with normally dormant vaginal anaerobes lead to increases in the latter which contribute to the symptoms of BV.

Conclusions

G. vaginalis is the pathogen responsible for the initiation of BV. Future research should focus on preventing its transmission and improved therapeutics for the biofilm infection that is caused by this pathogen and host anaerobes.

### The urinary microbiome: improving diagnostics and management of urinary tract infections in adult females [^1ff9b146]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

This article discusses the urinary microbiome in relation to urinary tract infection (UTI) in women. It makes biologic sense that the microbiota of different niches (bladder, vagina, and gut) interact with each other in health, as well as during a UTI event; however, these relationships remain poorly understood. Future research should close knowledge gaps regarding the interactions between the urinary microbiota and the host, amongst the microbiota of adjacent niches, and between the microbes within the same microbiota. The new knowledge should result in improved UTI treatment in the age of antibiotic stewardship.

### Characterization of the GU microbiome in women with self-perceived bladder health over the life course [^6858eafe]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Medium credibility.

As we recruited women who perceived themselves to have "healthy bladders", this study was not designed to show an association between the microbiome and GU conditions such as urinary incontinence, UTI, or vulvovaginitis. However, these disease processes increase in prevalence with increasing age. It is conceivable that age is potentially a confounding variable, and changes in the microbiome with increasing age are responsible for these GU symptoms. Additionally, changes in the GU microbiome have been identified in specific disease states. Our study evaluated self‐perceived "healthy" women and demonstrated a relatively stable GU microbiome. It is possible the stability of the GU microbiome influences or is associated with self‐perceived bladder health.

To date, most research in the fields of urology and urogynecology has focused on subjects with LUTS, which has resulted in the development of well validated questionnaires assessing bladder health and health related quality of life by self‐report. With a substantial proportion of the US population experiencing LUTS, especially those over the age of 60, prevention of LUTS is an attractive area of investigation. With a lack of validated questionnaires evaluating bladder health, we utilized 4 items of the CASUS questionnaires to designate self‐perceived bladder health. It is quite possible that self‐perceived bladder health is not simply the lack of bladder symptoms. The PLUS research consortium is currently evaluating self‐perceived bladder health in an attempt to better define bladder health and how best to determine absence of LUTS.

The microbiome, in particular the microbiome of the bladder, which was originally not studied as it was thought to be sterile, is a relatively new concept. Research into the clinical impact of microbiologic processes is in its infancy. Further research is needed to examine the relationship between the specific changes we found in women > 60 years old in Gardnerella, Cupriavidus, and Dialister and GU symptoms. A previous study demonstrated the predominance of Lactobacillus in women with mixed urinary incontinence did not differ to controls. Our findings offer alternative bacterial genera to investigate. Research is also needed to determine if the GU microbiome characteristics we found in women > 60 years of age with perceived bladder health are the same in women with impactful bladder symptoms. In prior research, age has been associated with LUTS, but it is not a modifiable risk factor. Studies are needed to determine if manipulations to the microbiome could impact clinical symptoms and whether these changes are sustainable over time as a potential avenue for symptom control.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^547ce991]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common infections seen by obstetrician/gynecologists and primary care providers. Recurrent urinary tract infections are difficult to treat and decrease quality of life. This article addresses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections, including pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. Most notably, increased interest in the urinary microbiome is leading to improved understanding of virulent and commensal bacteria in the genitourinary tract. Understanding the causative factors of recurrent urinary tract infections will lead to improved detection, treatment, and prevention.

### Bacterial colonization at caesarean section defects in women of secondary infertility: an observational study [^0b612416]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

More recent studies have indicated the presence of microorganisms in the uterine cavity. Colonization with potentially pathogenic organisms was found in one-quarter of the uterine cavity in a prospective study using hysterectomy samples. A more recent analysis of endometrial microbiota in intrauterine adhesion by high-throughput sequencing showed that the uterine cavity is not sterile and contains various bacteria. The 'sterile womb' hypothesis has also been challenged by recent studies using next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of the genomes of microorganisms, which overcomes two common limitations of traditional culture-based microbe characteristics, nonculturability and genomic diversity, opening a new research field in reproductive medicine. The balance of microecology in the female reproductive tract plays a key role in health. Evidence suggests that changes in the composition and distribution of the endometrial microbiota are related to endometrial diseases such as endometrial polyps, endometrial cancer, and infertility. Studies have shown that the numbers of Gardnerella, α- Streptococcus, Enterococci and Escherichia coli (E. coli) were significantly higher in endometrial samples from women with endometriosis than in those without endometriosis. The high prevalence of virulent and resistant uropathogenic E. coli strains in the upper vagina of infertile women with a history of urinary tract infections is suggestive of the important role of these pathogens in female infertility. Thus, microbial dysbiosis present in the uterine cavity may be one of the causative factors that leads to gynecological disorders, including infertility.

### Gardnerella species and their association with bacterial vaginosis [^2b1bb53b]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge in reproductive age women worldwide and is marked by high bacterial diversity, increased abundance of BV-associated anaerobic bacteria, and decreased abundance of lactobacilli in the vagina. BV has been associated with a wide range of negative health outcomes such as increased risk of preterm birth, acquisition of sexually transmitted infections and pelvic inflammatory disease. BV etiology remains incompletely understood and the heterogeneous, polymicrobial nature of this condition has made efforts to study BV challenging. Hypothetical models have been advanced to help explain the pathogenesis of BV.

Gardnerella has been implicated in the development of BV since the 1950s and was the first bacterium linked to nonspecific vaginitis, now known as BV. Previous studies have shown increased abundance of vaginal Gardnerella in women with BV and Gardnerella has been associated with adherent biofilms in BV. There is evidence that Gardnerella can be sexually transmitted, and it may be a keystone species in the development of BV. However, Gardnerella has also been detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in more than 50% of women without BV, calling into question its role in BV etiology. Formerly classified as Gardnerella vaginalis, the Gardnerella genus has been shown to consist of at least 13 unique genomospecies, 6 of which have been validly named: Gardnerella vaginalis, Gardnerella piotii, Gardnerella swidsinskii, Gardnerella leopoldii, Gardnerella pickettii, and Gardnerella greenwoodii. Vaginal colonization with multiple Gardnerella species has been demonstrated in prior studies and highlights the need to further understand the prevalence and role of each species within the Gardnerella genus. We hypothesized that a subset of Gardnerella species is more prevalent and abundant in women with BV, thereby contributing to the etiology of BV due to pathogenic characteristics of these species. In contrast, we expected women without BV to be colonized by other Gardnerella species, potentially explaining the high prevalence of Gardnerella commonly noted in women without BV.

### The epidemiology of urinary tract infection [^5a87030f]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections acquired in the community and in hospitals. In individuals without anatomical or functional abnormalities, UTIs are generally self limiting, but have a propensity to recur. Uropathogens have specialized characteristics, such as the production of adhesins, siderophores and toxins that enable them to colonize and invade the urinary tract, and are transmitted between individuals both through person-to-person contact and possibly via food or water. Although generally self limiting, treatment of UTIs with antibiotics leads to a more rapid resolution of symptoms and is more likely to clear bacteriuria, but also selects for resistant uropathogens and commensal bacteria and adversely affects the gut and vaginal microbiota. As uropathogens are increasingly becoming resistant to currently available antibiotics, it may be time to explore alternative strategies for managing UTI.

### Urine is not sterile: use of enhanced urine culture techniques to detect resident bacterial flora in the adult female bladder [^6a1ee710]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Our previous study showed that bacterial genomes can be identified using 16S rRNA sequencing in urine specimens of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients who are culture negative according to standard urine culture protocols. In the present study, we used a modified culture protocol that included plating larger volumes of urine, incubation under varied atmospheric conditions, and prolonged incubation times to demonstrate that many of the organisms identified in urine by 16S rRNA gene sequencing are, in fact, cultivable using an expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) protocol. Sixty-five urine specimens (from 41 patients with overactive bladder and 24 controls) were examined using both the standard and EQUC culture techniques. Fifty-two of the 65 urine samples (80%) grew bacterial species using EQUC, while the majority of these (48/52 [92%]) were reported as no growth at 10³ CFU/ml by the clinical microbiology laboratory using the standard urine culture protocol. Thirty-five different genera and 85 different species were identified by EQUC. The most prevalent genera isolated were Lactobacillus (15%), followed by Corynebacterium (14.2%), Streptococcus (11.9%), Actinomyces (6.9%), and Staphylococcus (6.9%). Other genera commonly isolated include Aerococcus, Gardnerella, Bifidobacterium, and Actinobaculum. Our current study demonstrates that urine contains communities of living bacteria that comprise a resident female urine microbiota.

### Association of substance use and vaginal infection with UTI in adolescent pregnant patients: a retrospective study [^fb57b300]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

There was a statistically significant association between vaginal candidiasis with Candida albicans (p < 0.001), bacterial vaginosis with Gardnerella vaginalis (p = 0.010), and the abuse of psychoactive substances (p = 0.032) with the presence of UTI in our study population. It is important to note that both infections (candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis) increased the risk of suffering UTI by 2.27 and 1.79 times, respectively (based on RR estimation). Additionally, the abuse of psychoactive substances was observed more frequently in patients with UTI, increasing the risk by 2 times (Fig. 1).

### The nature of immune responses to urinary tract infections [^de483def]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2015). Medium credibility.

The urinary tract is constantly exposed to microorganisms that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract, but generally the urinary tract resists infection by gut microorganisms. This resistance to infection is mainly ascribed to the versatility of the innate immune defences in the urinary tract, as the adaptive immune responses are limited particularly when only the lower urinary tract is infected. In recent years, as the strengths and weaknesses of the immune system of the urinary tract have emerged and as the virulence attributes of uropathogens are recognized, several potentially effective and unconventional strategies to contain or prevent urinary tract infections have emerged.

### Prevotella and Gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^016825a5]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Prevotella spp are also commonly detected in the cutaneous penile and male urethral microbiota, and prior studies conducted by our group and others have reported the relative abundance of specific Prevotella spp to be moderately to strongly correlated between the vaginal and male genital microbiota of couples. Therefore, an alternative hypothesis for our findings is that the high abundance of Prevotella spp pretreatment may also reflect women who are at increased risk of recurrence due to ongoing exposure to an untreated RSP. There is now substantial microbiological and epidemiological evidence that supports a role for sexual transmission in both the acquisition and recurrence of BV. Notably, a recent study demonstrated that detection of several BV-associated bacteria in the penile urethra (including Prevotella amnii and G vaginalis) was contingent upon prior penile–vaginal sex, and that these organisms could persist in the urethra > 60 days after exposure. In our study, women who reported sex with an untreated RSP during follow-up experienced BV recurrence more commonly compared to women with no RSP or women who had an RSP who received partner treatment. Of note, the proportion of women with a treated RSP who experienced recurrence (8%) was comparable to women with no RSP (7%). These findings suggest that combined oral and topical male partner treatment reduces BV recurrence at 1 month postenrollment to the level of a woman without an RSP. A multisite randomized controlled trial evaluating this intervention is ongoing (ACTRN12619000196145) and will provide the necessary data on its efficacy for preventing BV recurrence over a 3-month follow-up period.

### Symptoms of non-gonococcal urethritis in heterosexual men: a case control study [^671515d9]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine microbial and behavioural factors contributing to non-gonococcal urethral symptoms in men.

Methods

Case-control study of heterosexual men with non-gonococcal urethral symptoms (cases) and without urethral symptoms (controls) attending Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, Australia. Sexual behaviour and condom use were measured by questionnaire. First stream urine was tested for potential pathogens: Chlamydia trachomatis (ligase chain reaction), Mycoplasma genitalium (polymerase chain reaction, PCR), Ureaplasma urealyticum (culture and PCR), and Streptococcus spp, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Haemophilus species (culture). Urethral smears from cases were examined for polymorphonuclear leucocytes.

Results

80 cases and 79 controls were recruited over 4 months in 2002–3. 49 cases (61%) had urethritis by microscopic criteria, 17 (21%) had Chlamydia trachomatis (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 27 (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.4 to 222)), five (6%) had Mycoplasma genitalium (OR 6.1 (95% CI: 0.6 to 61)), and 11 (14%) had Gardnerella vaginalis (OR 9.0 (95% CI: 1.6 to 52)). Other organisms were not significantly associated with urethral symptoms. The presence of urethritis on urethral smear did not predict the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis (OR 1.7 (95% CI: 0.5 to 5.4)). Urethral symptoms were significantly associated with unprotected vaginal sex with more than one casual partner (OR 9.3 (95% CI: 1.3 to 65)) and unprotected anal sex with a regular partner in the past month (OR 3.5 (95% CI: 1.0 to 13)).

Conclusion

Gardnerella vaginalis and unprotected anal sex may cause symptoms of non-gonococcal urethritis. Microscopy of the urethral smear to diagnose urethritis in this population does not help to identify which men with urethral symptoms require treatment for chlamydia.

### Dysuria: evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults [^0ac166be]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Dysuria, a feeling of pain or discomfort during urination, is often caused by urinary tract infection but can also be due to sexually transmitted infection, bladder irritants, skin lesions, and some chronic pain conditions. History is most often useful for finding signs of sexually transmitted infection, complicated infections, lower urinary symptoms in males, and noninfectious causes. Most patients presenting with dysuria should have a urinalysis performed. Urine culture should be performed for infection to guide appropriate antibiotic use, especially for recurrent or suspected complicated urinary tract infection. Vaginal discharge decreases the likelihood of urinary tract infection, and other causes of dysuria, including cervicitis, should be investigated. If a patient has persistent urethritis or cervicitis with negative initial testing, Mycoplasma genitalium testing is recommended. Clinical decision rules may increase the accuracy of diagnosis with and without laboratory analysis. Evaluation and treatment of dysuria through a virtual encounter without laboratory testing may increase recurrent symptoms and antibiotic courses. Persistent symptoms after initial evaluation and treatment require further workup for infectious and noninfectious causes.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, recurrent infections that can be mild to life-threatening. The continued emergence of antibiotic resistance, together with our increasing understanding of the detrimental effects conferred by broad-spectrum antibiotic use on the health of the beneficial microbiota of the host, has underscored the weaknesses in our current treatment paradigm for UTIs. In this Review, we discuss how recent microbiological, structural, genetic and immunological studies have expanded our understanding of host-pathogen interactions during UTI pathogenesis. These basic scientific findings have the potential to shift the strategy for UTI treatment away from broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting conserved aspects of bacterial replication towards pathogen-specific antibiotic-sparing therapeutics that target core determinants of bacterial virulence at the host-pathogen interface.

### Gonococcal infections among adolescents and adults… [^61bdd978]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

N. gonorrhoeae infections occur each year, and gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported bacterial communicable disease. Urethral infections caused by N. gonorrhoeae can produce symptoms among men that cause them to seek curative treatment soon enough to prevent sequelae, but often not soon enough to prevent transmission to others. Among women, gonococcal infections are commonly asymptomatic or might not produce recognizable symptoms until complications have occurred. PID can result in tubal scarring that can lead to infertility or ectopic pregnancy. In cases of suspected or documented treatment failure, clinicians should perform both culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing because NAATs cannot provide antimicrobial susceptibility results. Because N.

gonorrhoeae has demanding nutritional and environmental growth requirements, optimal recovery rates are achieved when specimens are inoculated directly and when the growth medium is promptly incubated in an increased carbon dioxide environment. Nonnutritive swab transport systems are available that might maintain gonococcal viability for < 48 hours in ambient temperatures. Because of its high specificity and sensitivity, a Gram stain of urethral discharge or secretions that demonstrate polymorphonuclear leukocytes with intracellular gram-negative diplococci can be considered diagnostic for infection with. Antimicrobial-Resistant N. gonorrhoeae Gonorrhea treatment is complicated by the ability of. N. gonorrhoeae to develop resistance to antimicrobials.

In 1986, the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project, a national sentinel surveillance system, was established to monitor trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities of urethral N. gonorrhoeae strains in the United States. 883). However, monotherapy is not recommended because of concerns about the ease with which N. gonorrhoeae can develop resistance to macrolides, the high proportion of isolates with azithromycin decreased susceptibility, and documented azithromycin treatment failures. Strains of N. gonorrhoeae circulating in the United States are not adequately susceptible to penicillin, tetracycline, and older macrolides, and thus use of these antimicrobials cannot be recommended.

### Bacterial vaginosis diagnosed by analysis of first-void-urine specimens [^02a1ae29]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is traditionally diagnosed using vaginal samples. The aim of this study was to investigate whether BV can be diagnosed from first-void urine (FVU). Self-collected vaginal smears, vaginal swabs, and FVU were obtained from 176 women. BV was diagnosed by Nugent's criteria. The FVU and vaginal swabs were analyzed by quantitative PCRs (qPCRs) for selected vaginal bacteria (Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella spp. Gardnerella vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterium 2, Eggerthella-like bacterium, "Leptotrichia amnionii", Megasphaera type 1), and all had an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of > 85%, suggesting good prediction of BV according to the Nugent score. All seven bacteria in FVU were significantly associated with BV in univariate analysis. An accurate diagnosis of BV from urine was obtained in this population by a combination of qPCRs for Megasphaera type 1 and Prevotella spp. The same two bacteria remained significantly associated with BV in a multivariate model after adjusting for the other five species. There was no statistically significant difference between the sensitivities and specificities of BV diagnosis by molecular methods performed on swabs and FVU samples. A linear regression analysis showed good agreement between bacterial loads from swabs and FVU, but Prevotella spp. could be detected in high numbers in a few FVU samples without being present in swabs. This method will allow diagnosis of BV in studies where only urine has been collected and where detection of BV is considered relevant.

### Revisited: species heterogeneity, virulence factors, mucosal immune responses, and contributions to bacterial vaginosis [^140cf9e5]. Infection and Immunity (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Gardnerella species are associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) and have been investigated as etiological agents of the condition. Nonetheless, the isolation of this taxon from healthy individuals has raised important questions regarding its etiological role. Recently, using advanced molecular approaches, the Gardnerella genus was expanded to include several different species that exhibit differences in virulence potential. Understanding the significance of these different species with respect to mucosal immunity and the pathogenesis and complications of BV could be crucial to solving the BV enigma. Here, we review key findings regarding the unique genetic and phenotypic diversity within this genus, virulence factors, and effects on mucosal immunity as they stand. We also comment on the relevance of these findings to the proposed role of Gardnerella in BV pathogenesis and in reproductive health and identify key gaps in knowledge that should be explored in the future.

### A highly accurate nanopore-based sequencing workflow for culture and PCR-free microbial metagenomic profiling of urogenital samples [^248d46ff]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic microbiome profiles: vagina

Our sampling protocol captured vaginal swabs taken in parallel to each urinary test for 20 of our asymptomatic donors enabling us to co-profile asymptomatic vaginal biota (Fig. 3). Estimated cell values for each species identified at > 10,000 bacterial cells/swab are given for each sample and allow estimates of the total number of cells recovered per swab (range 64,000 to 240,000,000 cells/swab, median 14,600,000 cells/swab). As with the urine samples, the number of bacterial cells recovered for each vaginal swab varied considerably, some of this likely due to variation in individual donor swabbing technique. On average 10 discrete organisms (range 1–35, median 6) were identified per sample equating to alpha diversity measures of 0 to 2.4, median 0.8 (Fig. 3). A total of 64 different species were identified across the cohort, 50% of which were also observed in the urine samples. As in the urine samples, Lactobacillus crispatus was the most prevalent observed organism, found in 50% of the vaginal swab samples. Twenty-four species were unique to single donor samples.

Fig. 3
Comparison of vaginal swab profiles from 20 healthy control female donors. Values are given as predicted cells/swab/organism detected. Akin to urine samples (Fig. 2.) samples cluster into four major microbiomes dominated by Gardnerella spp. Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners or Lactobacillus jensenii

Evidence of discrete vaginal microbiomes dominated by the same species identified in the urine analysis; Gardnerella spp. Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus gasseri or Lactobacillus crispatus agree with previous community state type, CST, definitions and suggest a considerable overlap between the two microbiomes of the same individual (Figs. 2 and 3). Indeed, correlation analysis between samples collected from the same donor on the same day suggests that urinary and vaginal profiles share an average 65% of identified species per individual (Fig. 4 a) supporting the previously observed tight relationship between these microbial communities (Fig. 4 b).

### Detection of sexually transmitted infection agents in pregnant women using multiplex polymerase chain reaction method [^525add40]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a global health concern, affecting millions annually and causing severe complications such as infertility, pregnancy-related issues, and neonatal infections. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 376 million new STI cases occur globally each year. Factors such as socioeconomic disparities, limited healthcare access, low education levels, and inadequate preventive measures contribute to their prevalence. Additionally, risky sexual behaviors further amplify transmission rates.

During pregnancy, STIs can lead to complications such as preterm birth, low birth weight, and congenital infections. Agents primarily transmitted through sexual contact include Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Treponema pallidum, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Ureaplasma parvum/urealiticum, Haemophilus ducreyi, Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1, and HSV-2. According to the European STIs Guidelines, most cases of M. hominis and Ureaplasma species colonization occur through sexual contact and are correlated with the number of sexual partners. T. pallidum causes congenital infection, whereas HSV, N. gonorrhoeae, and C. trachomatis lead to perinatal infections. The primary risk associated with HSV, N. gonorrhoeae, and C. trachomatis is perinatal infection related to transmission during labor. Gardnerella vaginalis and Streptococcus agalactiae are microorganisms that are not primarily classified as sexually transmitted pathogens but can be part of the vaginal flora or act as opportunistic agents causing infections. G. vaginalis is associated with bacterial vaginosis, while S. agalactiae is linked to neonatal sepsis, meningitis, and maternal infections. Both bacteria can manifest in symptomatic and asymptomatic forms and have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Molecular diagnostic methods like multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provide rapid and accurate detection of STIs, surpassing traditional techniques such as serological tests and cultures. Multiplex PCR enables high-sensitivity detection of genital pathogens from various sample types, including swabs and urine samples, with the ability to detect multiple agents in a single test.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of 10 different bacterial, viral, and parasitic STI agents, along with G. vaginalis and S. agalactiae, in symptomatic and asymptomatic pregnant individuals in the third trimester using multiplex PCR. Additionally, we investigated their associations with demographic characteristics and risk factors.

Introduction

One of the key parameters of the third Sustainable Development Goal is to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age by 2030. The first 28 days of life is the most vulnerable period for a newborn. In 2020, approximately 2.4 million newborns died during this period, and nearly 47% of all under-5 deaths occurred in the first month. The leading causes of neonatal death include preterm birth, intra-partum-related complications, infections, and birth defects. Nine out of ten countries with the greatest number of neonatal deaths in 2020 were lower-middle-income countries (LMICs).

Reduction of the maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births has long been a global health priority and is a target in the Sustainable Development Goal 3 framework. Most maternal deaths are preventable through appropriate access to quality healthcare and timely management of perinatal complications. In 2020, 95% of all maternal deaths occurred in LMICs and nearly 800 women died from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth.

Newborn and maternal health are closely connected. For the newborn to develop and survive to the fullest potential, a healthy pregnancy and a safe delivery are essential. Promoting maternal health through access to quality antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal care is imperative for optimal neonatal outcomes.

Pregnancy-related infections in mothers can have serious consequences for both the mother and the fetus. Urinary tract infections, bacterial vaginosis, yeast infections, hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and sexually transmitted diseases (including syphilis, gonorrhoea, and chlamydia) are among the common infections that affect mothers, and are linked to adverse neonatal outcomes such as stillbirth, preterm birth, neonatal mortality, congenital anomalies, neonatal morbidity, and sepsis. Bacterial vaginosis, in particular, is a common reproductive tract illness in women of childbearing age globally, accounting for one-third of vaginal infections. It is essential to treat bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women to minimize the risk of complications during pregnancy and delivery. Bacterial vaginosis is often treated with antibiotics; however, caution needs to be exercised in the first trimester of pregnancy due to the risk of potential harm to the developing fetus.

### Bacterial vaginosis: a practical review [^167bd829]. JAAPA (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bacterial vaginosis:

- **Definition**: BV, previously referred to as Gardnerella vaginitis, is a disease resulting from overgrowth of normal vaginal bacterial flora.
- **Pathophysiology**: BV is idiopathic; however, sexual transmission has been implicated. It is associated with fluctuations in vaginal microbiota, with a relative increase in Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species, in addition, to a decrease in lactobacilli.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, about 7.4 million cases of BV occur yearly. In nonpregnant women with symptomatic vaginal discharge, the overall prevalence of BV is 24.4% based on Nugent's scoring system.
- **Disease course**: BV is characterized by milky and malodorous vaginal discharge, resulting in vulvovaginal discomfort and irritation. It has a strong association with preterm birth, first-trimester miscarriage in women undergoing IVF, chorioamnionitis, amniotic-fluid infection, endometritis after childbirth or abortion, and infections after hysterectomy.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: BV has a high recurrence rate of up to 50% within a year of treatment.

Key points
- A catheter-associated urinary tract infection occurs when germs enter the urinary tract through a urinary catheter and cause infection.
- CAUTIs are one of the most common types of healthcare-associated infections.
- They are preventable and treatable. Overview A catheter-associated urinary tract infection occurs when germs enter the urinary tract through a urinary catheter and cause infection. They are one of the most common types of HAIs but are preventable and treatable. Signs and symptoms
- Burning or pain below the stomach
- Fever
- Burning while peeing
- Peeing more frequently than usual Risk factors The most important risk factor for developing a CAUTI is prolonged use of a urinary catheter. Causes A CAUTI occurs when germs enter the body through a urinary catheter and cause infection. The infection can happen in any part of the urinary tract.

Types of catheters Indwelling urinary catheter. A drainage tube is inserted into the bladder through the urethra, left in place and connected to a closed collection system. Intermittent catheterization. Brief insertion of a catheter into the bladder through the urethra to drain urine followed by removal. External catheter. A urine containment device is attached to a urinary drainage bag that fits over or adheres to the genitalia. The most used external catheter is a soft flexible sheath that fits over the penis. Suprapubic catheter. Surgically inserted into the bladder through an incision in the lower abdomen. Treatment and recovery Most CAUTIs can be treated with antibiotics and/or removal or change of the catheter. The healthcare provider will determine the best treatment for each patient. What CDC is doing
- Tracking CAUTIs through the National Healthcare Safety Network.
- Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal.
- Working closely with health departments, other federal agencies, healthcare providers and patients to prevent infections caused by CAUTIs and slow the spread of resistant germs.

### Bacterial vaginosis and its association with infertility, endometritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease [^375dea5a]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and endometritis are infections of the genital tract that can lead to many adverse health outcomes, including infertility. Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by a lower prevalence of lactobacilli and a higher prevalence of anaerobic bacteria, including Gardnerella vaginalis, Megasphaera spp., and Atopobium vaginae. Endometritis and pelvic inflammatory disease are caused by the ascension of pathogenic bacteria to the uterus, although the mechanisms by which they do so are unclear. Bacterial vaginosis, chronic endometritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease have been linked to infertility in retrospective and prospective trials. Similarly, the causes of bacterial vaginosis and endometritis-related infertility are likely multifactorial and stem from inflammation, immune targeting of sperm antigens, the presence of bacterial toxins, and increased risk of sexually transmitted infections. Diagnosis and treatment of bacterial vaginosis, chronic endometritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease before attempting conception may be important components of preconceptional care for symptomatic women to improve outcomes of natural and assisted reproduction.

### Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia trigger distinct and overlapping phenotypes in a mouse model of bacterial vaginosis [^5276f967]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common imbalance of the vaginal microbiota characterized by overgrowth of diverse Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Gram-negative anaerobes. Women with BV are at increased risk of secondary reproductive tract infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, which specific bacteria cause clinical features of BV is unclear.

Methods

We previously demonstrated that Gardnerella vaginalis could elicit many BV features in mice. In this study, we established a BV model in which we coinfected mice with G. vaginalis and another species commonly found in women with BV: Prevotella bivia.

Results

This coinfection model recapitulates several aspects of human BV, including vaginal sialidase activity (a diagnostic BV feature independently associated with adverse outcomes), epithelial exfoliation, and ascending infection. It is notable that G. vaginalis facilitated uterine infection by P. bivia.

Conclusions

Taken together, our model provides a framework for advancing our understanding of the role of individual or combinations of BV-associated bacteria in BV pathogenesis.

Asymptomatic microbiome profiles: female urine

Next, we applied our technique to profile microbiomes in urine samples from self-reported asymptomatic control female donors (Fig. 2). Initially, we conducted single time-point analysis of samples taken from 23 adult female volunteers (average age 31, median 24, range 18–53). The total estimated biomass recovered for each urine sample varied considerably (range 13,000 to 15,000,000 cells/mL, median 1,400,000 cells/mL), and represented 10 × to 100 × greater values than those previously estimated using 16S rRNA methods. Microbiome alpha diversity (Shannon diversity index, H) varied from 0 to 2.5 (median 0.76) equating to between 1 and 39 (median 7) discrete organisms per sample (Fig. 2). No obvious correlation was found between the diversity of organisms detected and total sample biomass (data not shown). 76 different species were identified across the 23-sample cohort at levels > 1,000 cells/mL. Lactobacillus crispatus and Gardnerella vaginalis were the most prevalent organisms, being present in 52% and 49% of the samples respectively. 36 species were unique to single samples.

Fig. 2
Comparison of urinary profiles from 23 healthy control female donors. Values are given as predicted cells/mL urine/organism detected. Samples cluster into four major urobiomes dominated by Gardnerella spp. Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners or Lactobacillus jensenii

Our data confirm the existence of discrete urotypes paralleling previously reported vaginal community state types, CST's, predominated by; Lactobacillus crispatus (CST:I), Lactobacillus gasseri (CST:II), Lactobacillus iners (CST:III), Gardnerella spp. (CST:IV) or Lactobacillus jensenii (CST:V) (Fig. 2). No obviously common pattern was seen in the remaining samples.

Donor 51 provided a sample with the highest diversity microbiome (H = 2.47) dominated by high titres of Bifidobacterium breve (1,200,000 cells/mL, Fig. 2). 20/37 species identified across the cohort were unique to this sample including emerging uropathogens Oligella urethralis and Alloscardovia omnicolens, each present at > 100,000 cells/mL. Of interest, this observation matches previously reports of Bifidobacterium breve defining a low frequency CST subtype as well as being a causative agent in urinary tract infections, UTI.

### A highly accurate nanopore-based sequencing workflow for culture and PCR-free microbial metagenomic profiling of urogenital samples [^3244ffa1]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition the quantitative nature of our method allows us to demonstrate that average female urobiomes have two orders of magnitude more biomass/mL than males and that, of the 27 species identified to be common to urobiomes from both sexes, most were present at comparable cells/ml titres. Given the marked difference in total biomass between the sexes this highlights the majority contribution made by a subset of species that are heavily enriched or unique to female urogenital microbiomes including Gardnerella spp. Fanyhessea vaginae and six species of the genus Lactobacillus. In comparison, Lactobacillus species were almost completely absent in male urine samples that, in agreement with previous observations, are populated by low biomass of Streptococci; S. gwangjuense, S. mitis, S. pneumonia and S. pseudopneumoniae and members of the Serratia genus; S. urielytica, S. marcescens and S. nematodiphila. In line with previous reports, half of our input asymptomatic male urine samples returned no detectable organisms other than those compatible with contribution from the process kit-ome. Hence, they may be considered practically sterile as assayed by our technique. The high frequency of this finding in our male samples raises the possibility that, in stark contrast to females, this may represent the normal status of asymptomatic male urine. It also displays the dynamic range of our method that is able to report across 6 log units between the highest (1.3 × 10⁸ cells/swab, Lactobacillus iners, Female vaginal swab 54, Fig. 3) and lowest (1 × 10² cells/mL, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Male sample 14, Fig. 7) recorded individual values.

Evidence to support sexual 'transmission' of the BV syndrome

There is long standing evidence to support the contribution of sexual transmission to the pathogenesis of BV. In the 1950s, Gardner and Dukes first characterised BV and hypothesised that "… husbands must be treated simultaneously if recurrences by reinfection are to be prevented". When vaginal discharge was transferred from women with BV to those without, 11/15 women developed clinical signs and microbiological features of BV, indicating the BV syndrome was infectious. Initially, Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated from women with BV and hypothesised to be a new STI responsible for the syndrome; however, when 13 'healthy' women were inoculated with pure cultures of G. vaginalis (incubated for 24h prior to inoculation and in the stationary phase of growth), only one developed BV. In a subsequent study, which also used fresh cultures of G. vaginalis but incubated them for 12h prior to inoculation and in the late logarithmic phase of growth, 5/9 women developed the BV syndrome. This finding suggests that phase of growth and environmental signals may control expression of bacterial virulence factors which confer a greater pathogenic potential to G. vaginalis, a finding supported by more recent evidence. In support of the initial hypothesis that G. vaginalis is the etiologic agent responsible for BV, it was isolated from the urethra of 91/101 husbands of women with BV, but only 1/38 male medical students. Successive studies also isolated G. vaginalis from the urethra of male partners of women with BV, and from a larger population of heterosexual men. The high rates of BV recurrence post-treatment and evidence of male carriage of G. vaginalis led to six male-partner treatment trials of women with BV in the 1980s and 1990s (Table 1). Only one trial found a statistically significant reduction in BV recurrence, and the failure of the other trials was then interpreted as evidence against sexual transmission; thus, partner treatment is not currently recommended in guidelines. Lessons learned from these past trials and their limitations are discussed later in this review.

Yet others present with mixed infections and multiple simultaneous underlying causes, ensuring that diagnosis will always be a challenge. The proposed instrument offers a reasonable logical solution to replacing a vanishing skill without resorting to next generation sequencing and concepts beyond the understanding of clinicians.

Gardnerella Species: Sensitivity and Specificity for BV

Gardnerella 16S rRNA gene detection at baseline had 99.0% sensitivity, 25.3% specificity, and a risk ratio (RR) of 18.4 (95% CI, 3.6–104.3; P < .001) for symptomatic BV. Gardnerella species group detection using cpn60 assays at baseline had the following sensitivities, specificities, and RR for symptomatic BV, respectively: G. vaginalis (98.0%, 49.3%, 21.5, P < .001), G. piotii/pickettii (91.1%, 56.0%, 6.0, P < .001), G. swidsinskii/greenwoodii (82.2%, 57.3%, 3.3, P < .001), and G. leopoldii (64.4%, 74.7%, 2.6, P < .001). Detection of 3 or more Gardnerella species groups at baseline had 91.1% sensitivity, 68.0% specificity, and a RR of 8.1 (95% CI, 4.4–15.4; P < .001) for symptomatic BV. Detection above the median concentration of positive samples for each Gardnerella species group improved specificity for symptomatic BV but decreased sensitivity (Table 2). Similar results were found when using Nugent score for BV diagnosis (Supplementary Table 4).

### Managing recurrent bacterial vaginosis [^df535381]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2004). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most frequently found condition of the female genital tract. It increases a woman's risk of acquiring HIV, is associated with increased complications in pregnancy, and may be involved in the pathogenesis of pelvic inflammatory disease. Yet there are many unanswered questions about its aetiology, making management of recurrent infection difficult and often idiosyncratic. This paper discusses the current knowledge and possible management of recurrent BV.

IMMUNE RESPONSES TO GARDNERELLA SPECIES — FINDINGS FROM IN VITRO AND ANIMAL STUDIES

The relationship between BV and mucosal immunity is incompletely understood. Clinically, BV is not characterized by leukocyte infiltration, hence the name "vaginosis" and not "vaginitis". This shouldn't be surprising given that BV is recognized as a biofilm condition and the nature of bacterial biofilms to promote a more quiescent response. Nonetheless, BV is associated with subclinical inflammation characterized by generally high proinflammatory cytokine responses and decreased levels of some chemokines. Given its predominance in BV biofilms, Gardnerella -mediated alternations in mucosal immunity could help explain BV persistence and how BV increases the risk for STI and pregnancy complications. This section focuses on findings from in vitro and murine studies utilizing single Gardnerella isolates to examine how Gardnerella species contribute to cytokine production and cell viability (Table S1).

### The study of microbiome of the female genital area in relation to pelvic floor dysfunction: a systematic review [^551d4e98]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

The aim of this article is to present a systematic literature review focused on microbiome diversity in women experiencing pelvic floor dysfunction.

Methods

Utilizing PubMed/MedLine and Scopus, 25 pertinent studies were meticulously selected for this review.

Results

A key theme identified is the potential of microbiomes as diagnostic tools. The findings consistently highlight Lactobacillus as recurrent microbiota. Additionally, Gardnerella, Streptococcus, Prevotella, Aerococcus, Staphylococcus, Proteus, and Bifidobacterium species were frequently observed. This suggests the influential role of these microorganisms in shaping female urological and reproductive health. A deeper understanding of these predominant bacterial genera could offer invaluable insights into healthy physiological states and various disorders. The complex relationship between microbial compositions and diverse health conditions paves the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. As we further explore the complexities of microbiomes, their role becomes increasingly crucial in transforming women's health care.

Conclusions

These findings emphasize the need for personalized care, integrating the microbiome into a comprehensive health assessment and treatment framework. This review lays the groundwork for future medical strategies where the microbiome is a pivotal element in both preventive and therapeutic care.

The use of biochemical profiles and new molecular microbiologic methodologies is transforming our understanding of BV. Most important is the recognition of different subgroups of women who have BV who are at variable risk of certain obstetric and gynecologic complications. New diagnostic tests may soon be available that will allow women to test self-obtained specimens. Treatment of BV has lagged, although innovative methods appear to be helpful in managing recurrent diseases.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis [^279a2546]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Our purpose was to investigate the risk of urinary tract infections in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis.

Study Design

In a cross-sectional study, 503 pregnant women were examined for bacterial vaginosis and urinary tract infections from July 1999 through April 2000.

Results

Nineteen (13.6%) of 140 women who had bacterial vaginosis had urinary tract infections compared with 24 (6.6%) of 363 women without it. Bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy was associated with an increased risk for urinary tract infections (odds ratio 2.21, 95% CI 1.16–4.18).

Conclusion

Pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis are more likely to have urinary tract infections.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^fa65f85c]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

An example of a UTI LDT, which has been described in several publications, is the Guidance UTI test by Pathnostics; this assay also recently received approval by the Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program of the New York State Department of Health (an additional state-specific LDT requirement in New York). The Guidance UTI test entails real-time PCR targeting bacterial genomic DNA from numerous organism classes (30 total), reported in cells/mL-units that emulate semi-quantitative culture results. These organisms cover both classically recognized uropathogens, as well as various members of the urobiome discussed above, which have been described as both occasional emerging uropathogens, as well physiologic commensals, potentially on a patient-by-patient basis. The latter include A. schaalii, A. omnicolens, G. vaginalis, C. urealyticum, coagulase-negative staphylococci, viridans streptococci, and various Candida species. The Guidance UTI assay likewise includes the PCR detection of various genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance, in a source-independent manner, along with the aforementioned process of pooled AST. In general, the clinician-reportable results from such LDTs can include an analytic summary of the data generated by that test — in however manner it was internally validated — but it remains at the discretion of the provider to interpret their significance and decide what to treat, which may be challenging for organisms where clinical guidelines do not exist. Some reference laboratories that offer such tests attempt to improve interpretation through test reporting, which may include suggestions on antimicrobials that may cover the detected organisms, although these recommendations are disclaimed as not patient specific. Data used as part of marketing for the Guidance UTI includes evaluation of only 69 patients, and include claims for reduced rates of outpatient emergency room visit, hospital admissions, and a projected reduction in cost per patient. These findings have not been corroborated by independent studies.

Finally, at least in the United States, it also critical to comment on the general landscape of LDTs, which are in a time of significant potential change. Just this year, the FDA announced plans to begin phasing in more direct oversight of LDTs performed by individual clinical laboratories. While this dynamic is still actively evolving, it is expected that many assays — in particular diagnostics that are not internal to a particular healthcare system — will soon be subject to greater review. How this shift impacts the future availability and reporting of molecular LDTs for uropathogens remains an unresolved question.

### Prediction and prevention of spontaneous preterm birth: ACOG practice bulletin, number 234 [^d51fbc2a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous preterm birth — infectious, genitourinary, and periodontal contributors show that vaginal bleeding, urinary tract infections (UTIs), genital tract infections, and periodontal disease have been associated with increased risk. Bacterial vaginosis is associated with a twofold increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth, yet antibiotic treatment has not been consistently shown to reduce risk. Regarding UTIs, a Cochrane review of 10 trials failed to find an association between treatment of symptomatic urinary infections and preterm birth. For periodontal disease, two meta-analyses of randomized trials found no evidence that treatment in pregnancy reduced the rate of preterm birth, suggesting risk may reflect associated factors.

### Host-vaginal microbiota interactions in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis [^9a660a08]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The cause of bacterial vaginosis, the most common cause of vaginal discharge in women, remains controversial. We recently published an updated conceptual model on bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis, focusing on the roles of Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia as early colonizers and Atopobium vaginae and other bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria (BVAB) as secondary colonizers in this infection. In this article, we extend the description of our model to include a discussion on the role of host-vaginal microbiota interactions in bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis.

Recent Findings

Although G. vaginalis and P. bivia are highly abundant in women with bacterial vaginosis, neither induce a robust inflammatory response from vaginal epithelial cells. These early colonizers may be evading the immune system while establishing the bacterial vaginosis biofilm. Secondary colonizers, including A. vaginae, Sneathia spp., and potentially other BVAB are more potent stimulators of the host-immune response to bacterial vaginosis and likely contribute to its signs and symptoms as well as its adverse outcomes.

Summary

Elucidating the cause of bacterial vaginosis has important implications for diagnosis and treatment. Our current bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis model provides a framework for key elements that should be considered when designing and testing novel bacterial vaginosis diagnostics and therapeutics.

Co-profiled urine and vaginal microbiomes: temporal series

In-depth analysis of weekly urine and vaginal samples from three volunteers produced a temporal series spanning a full menstrual cycle (Fig. 5 a-c). High levels of concordance are apparent between urinary and vaginal microbiomes of the same individual across the majority of this testing period. However, transitory changes were observed in vaginal and urinary microbiome composition of some individuals. Of interest, the nature of these changes seem specific to each location; the Lactobacillus crispatus: Lactobacillus iners ratio is transiently inverted in donor 23 & 24 urine samples whilst in the vagina in the same donors the Gardnerella vaginalis & Gardnerella swidsinskii: Lactobacillus crispatus ratios display a similar phenomenon over the same time frame. These findings are compatible with previous studies describing similar phenomena in both urinary and vaginal microbiomes.

### Prevotella and Gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^ea53c8da]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal condition that affects approximately 30% of reproductive-aged women globally. While the etiology of BV has not been established, the vaginal microbiota of women with BV is typically deficient in optimal Lactobacillus spp (eg, Lactobacillus crispatus), with high diversity and high abundance of anaerobes. Recommended treatment for BV involves antibiotic therapy with metronidazole or clindamycin, both of which provide broad coverage of anaerobes. One-month cure posttreatment is approximately 70%–85%; however, up to 50% of women experience BV recurrence within 12 weeks following antibiotics. BV recurrences are distressing for women and result in repeat presentations to clinical services and repeated antibiotic use. Furthermore, the sequelae associated with BV carry significant implications for a woman's reproductive and sexual health and impose a large economic burden.

There has been little progress made toward improving long-term BV cure, partly because the mechanisms driving BV recurrence are multifactorial and incompletely understood. Prior studies exploring the association between microbial signatures of the vaginal microbiota (ie, diversity metrics, community types, and individual taxa) and BV treatment outcomes have produced mixed results regarding the contribution of bacterial diversity to treatment failure. Interestingly, a number of studies have reported a positive association between BV recurrence and high relative and absolute abundance of Gardnerella (or individual Gardnerella spp) pretreatment. Furthermore, treatment success has been associated with significant reductions in Gardnerella spp posttreatment. Together these data highlight the importance of Gardnerella spp to BV pathogenesis. However, prior studies have been limited by small numbers, and few have adjusted microbiota findings for confounding factors that may influence an individual's likelihood of recurrence, such as posttreatment sexual practices.

To overcome limitations of past studies and to provide insight into the microbial drivers of BV recurrence, we aimed to determine if the vaginal microbiota composition immediately before or immediately after treatment was associated with BV recurrence within 1 month of recommended treatment, after adjustment for confounding factors.

METHODS

Study Population and Sample Collection

From October 2012 to August 2015, vaginal swabs were collected from 251 nonpregnant study participants with (n = 101) and without (n = 150) BV attending the Public Health Seattle and King County Sexual Health Clinic. The overall study population included individuals assigned female sex at birth in Seattle, Washington, and individuals with and without risk factors for BV to include previous history of BV, identifying as black and/or Hispanic, or high number of sexual partners. The study was approved by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center institutional review board (protocol No. 7683) and all study participants provided informed consent. Vaginal swabs were collected by clinicians at baseline and subsequent follow-up clinic visits. Participants were considered BV positive when at least 3 of 4 Amsel clinical criteria were met (symptomatic BV). Vaginal smears of all clinic samples were prepared on glass slides for Gram stain and assessment of BV by Nugent scoring. Participants with symptomatic BV were treated with metronidazole at each clinic visit following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Most study participants did not remain enrolled beyond 100 days, and this was used as a cutoff for analysis of BV development. A subset of 42 participants provided at least 10 additional weekly self-collected vaginal swabs for up to 12 weeks from baseline and these samples were used for longitudinal analysis. Behavioral data were collected via questionnaires at clinic visits and via daily diaries. A more detailed description of the study population and sample collection can be found in the Supplementary Methods.

### Effects of probiotics on the recurrence of bacterial vaginosis: a review [^db88c0ce]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common cause of genital discomfort in women in reproductive ages, which causes many complications. Bacterial vaginosis is usually treated by metronidazole and clindamycin. However, this protocol does not prevent its recurrence, which is a main complaint of the patients. The number of lactobacilli in the vagina of women with BV is significantly lower than that in healthy women. Hence, efforts have been made to normalize vaginal flora by oral or vaginal administration of lactobacilli. The objective of the present study was to review clinical evidences available regarding the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of BV.

Materials and Methods

Published randomized controlled trials were searched in PubMed, Science Direct, and the Cochrane Database between 1990 and 2011. Search terms included bacterial vaginosis, urinary tract infection, lactobacillus, and probiotics.

Results

Orally consumed probiotics are believed to ascend to the vaginal tract after they are excreted from the rectum; vaginal administration allows for direct replacement of the probiotics for unhealthy vaginal microbiota and occupation of specific adhesion sites at the epithelial surface of the urinary tract, which consequently results in maintenance of a low pH and production of antimicrobial substances like acids and hydrogen peroxide. Receiving Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1, and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14 at a dose of at least 10 CFU/day for 2 months has been shown to present the patients with better results.

Conclusions

Although the results of different studies are controversial, most studies have been in favor of the probiotics in the prevention or treatment of BV, and no adverse effects have been reported. Therefore, it may be helpful to recommend daily consumption of probiotic products to improve public health among women.

### Gardnerella vaginalis bacteremia in a premature neonate [^8504ef0a]. Journal of Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

Gardnerella vaginalis is a normal component of the human vaginal flora and commonly associated with bacterial vaginosis. Invasive infection in obstetrical patients due to G. vaginalis has also been reported. In the pediatric age range, infection due to G. vaginalis is extremely rare and limited to neonates. We describe a 23-week premature infant with G. vaginalis bacteremia and review the characteristics of neonatal G. vaginalis infection reported in the literature. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of G. vaginalis isolates has shown that penicillin, ampicillin, erthromycin, clindamycin, and vancomycin are effective in vitro.
