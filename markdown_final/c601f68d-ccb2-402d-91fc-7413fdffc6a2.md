## Question

when you should screen for prostate cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to screen for prostate cancer, seeking a synthesis of prostate cancer screening recommendations that reconciles guideline differences and operationalizes age/risk thresholds, intervals, and biopsy triggers into a coherent pathway. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overall evidence base and why guidelines disagree. Then, I should confirm the core screening modality and adjuncts. Next, I will define age ranges for average-risk men, then identify high-risk groups and earlier starts. After that, I must determine when to discontinue screening based on life expectancy. I will then emphasize shared decision-making, specify screening intervals and triggers, outline post-negative-biopsy management, and synthesize a practical clinical pathway with quantified benefits and harms, ensuring each claim is supported and verifying against current high-credibility guidelines throughout [^112V81V9] [^1117UMji] [^111tWCUc].

> Let me first confirm the reason this topic is controversial so I don't jump to conclusions too quickly: the randomized trial evidence is discordant, with ERSPC demonstrating a modest reduction in prostate cancer mortality while PLCO did not, and meta-analytic syntheses have emphasized small absolute benefits versus meaningful harms from overdiagnosis and overtreatment; this heterogeneity underlies differences in recommendations across organizations and must be kept in view when advising patients [^1157nbPN] [^112V81V9] [^1175tqXq].

> I will now examine the core screening modality to ensure the foundation is correct before discussing age and risk: all contemporary guidelines anchor early detection on serum PSA as the first-line test; DRE can be considered adjunctively to refine risk, but MRI is not recommended as an initial population screening tool, though it has a role downstream for biopsy targeting after an elevated PSA, so I should be careful to distinguish screening from diagnostic work-up [^117HXCk7] [^111Qs6wD] [^115LMqXD].

> Next, I should review age ranges for average-risk men and confirm areas of guideline convergence and divergence: USPSTF recommends individualized screening for ages 55–69 via shared decision-making given a small potential mortality benefit, while recommending against screening at age ≥ 70; AUA suggests regular screening every 2–4 years for men 50–69 with shared decision-making; EAU promotes a risk-adapted approach rather than blanket population screening; ESMO cautions against population-based screening in 55–69 due to overdiagnosis, which I need to keep in mind when counseling [^111rsE6o] [^1113ymgE] [^111tWCUc] [^113UNGM1].

> Hold on, I should verify the recommendations for high-risk men because these often start earlier: AUA, ESMO, and EAU agree that men with strong family history, Black/African ancestry, or pathogenic germline variants warrant earlier initiation, typically at 40–45 years depending on the specific risk factor, with BRCA2 carriers often starting at 40; I need to ensure I emphasize earlier shared decision-making and baseline PSA in these groups [^114i8Ms4] [^111Hd5nN] [^116YZumg].

> Let me consider when to discontinue screening and make sure I couch it in life expectancy, not age alone: USPSTF recommends not screening at age ≥ 70; EAU is distinctive in allowing screening beyond 70 when life expectancy is at least 15 years, whereas many U.S. sources favor discontinuation when life expectancy falls below roughly 10–15 years; I should confirm that this is framed as individualized decision-making recognizing diminishing benefit with shorter life expectancy [^113SgBTe] [^115AjTto] [^111tWCUc].

> I need to emphasize shared decision-making as the central principle, and I should double-check that counseling precedes testing: across USPSTF, AUA, and EAU, a documented discussion of potential small benefits and non-trivial harms is mandatory, with an explicit recommendation not to PSA-test men who do not express a preference to be screened after counseling; this must incorporate patient values, comorbidities, and risk tolerance, and I should verify that EAU explicitly advises counseling before PSA is obtained [^111rsE6o] [^1117UMji] [^116rV2ru].

> Next, I should review operational details: screening intervals are generally every 2–4 years for those who choose screening; if PSA is newly elevated, repeating the PSA before moving to biomarkers, imaging, or biopsy is recommended; PSA velocity should not be used as the sole reason to escalate to biopsy; and validated risk calculators can refine biopsy decisions, which can reduce unnecessary procedures and overdiagnosis, so I need to ensure these points are clearly operationalized [^1113ymgE] [^114CjTvN] [^1166p5fS] [^115tzmnU].

> Wait, let me verify thresholds and reflex steps so I don't misstate practice: no single universal PSA cutoff is endorsed; for PSA in the 3–10 ng/mL range with normal DRE, repeating PSA prior to further work-up is recommended; after confirmation of elevation, secondary biomarkers, risk calculators, and MRI-targeted pathways can help select for biopsy and reduce detection of indolent disease, aligning with modern risk-adapted strategies [^115Gjfpu] [^1167Ti8A] [^116TQ29s].

> I will now examine management after a negative biopsy to ensure continuity is appropriate: guidelines advise not discontinuing screening solely because of a negative biopsy; instead, re-evaluate within the usual 2–4 year interval or sooner based on updated risk and life expectancy if both clinician and patient prefer to continue screening, which fits a personalized re-screening cadence [^115Uj9Eq] [^112pQTTb].

> But wait, what about quantifying benefit and harm for informed consent so patients can weigh trade-offs? USPSTF modeling and trial syntheses estimate that in men 55–69, organized PSA screening may prevent about 1.3 prostate cancer deaths and about 3 metastatic cases per 1,000 men screened over roughly 13 years, while exposing many to false positives, biopsies, and potential overtreatment with risks of incontinence and erectile dysfunction; I should present these numbers clearly during counseling [^112V81V9] [^1157nbPN].

> Let me synthesize this into a practical, risk-adapted clinical pathway while I double-check each step against guidelines: at age 40, identify high-risk men and offer early shared decision-making with consideration of baseline PSA; between 45 and 50, consider a baseline PSA to stratify future risk in average-risk men, while initiating regular screening in higher-risk men; from 55–69, engage in shared decision-making with those who value potential benefits and screen every 2–4 years, using risk calculators and, after confirmed PSA elevation, MRI to guide targeted biopsy; at age ≥ 70, generally discontinue screening, except consider continuation in exceptionally healthy men with ≥ 15-year life expectancy under a risk-adapted approach; across all ages, repeat a newly elevated PSA before escalation and personalize re-screening intervals based on prior PSA, risk, and preferences [^114guQhz] [^111rsE6o] [^1113ymgE] [^116TQ29s] [^115AjTto].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of baseline PSA and interval tailoring because this often changes testing burden: EAU endorses risk-adapted follow-up based on initial PSA, for example spacing intervals up to 8 years for very low baseline PSA and shortening to 2 years when initial risk is higher, which can reduce unnecessary testing while maintaining vigilance for clinically significant disease, and this aligns with the general AUA emphasis on personalized re-screening [^113vp2r3] [^117SkRr6].

> Let me reconsider MRI's position one more time to avoid inadvertently suggesting it for primary screening: MRI is not an initial screening tool, but after a confirmed PSA elevation, MRI can reduce overdiagnosis by focusing biopsies on suspicious lesions, a strategy increasingly embedded in risk-adapted pathways to improve the harm–benefit balance; I should explicitly separate first-line screening from downstream diagnostic selection [^115LMqXD] [^113kUB9u].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise and balanced: in sum, the most defensible approach today is risk-adapted, age-stratified, and anchored in shared decision-making, with the strongest evidence to offer PSA screening as an informed choice to men 55–69, to start earlier in well-defined high-risk groups, and to discontinue when life expectancy is limited, recognizing small absolute mortality benefits and meaningful harms that require alignment with patient values [^1117UMji] [^111rsE6o] [^111tWCUc].

Screen for prostate cancer in **men aged 50–69 years** [^1113ymgE] after shared decision-making about benefits and harms [^1117UMji] [^111rsE6o]. For higher-risk men (Black ancestry, strong family history, or BRCA1/2 mutations) [^114i8Ms4], **start at 40–45 years** [^111Hd5nN] [^116YZumg]. Do not screen men with **life expectancy < 10–15 years** [^112hqno3] or those ≥ 70 years [^113SgBTe] unless they are healthy with ≥ 15 years expected survival [^111tWCUc] [^115AjTto]. Use PSA as the primary test [^117HXCk7], consider DRE [^111Qs6wD], and repeat PSA before further tests if PSA is 3–10 ng/mL with a normal DRE [^115Gjfpu] [^114CjTvN] [^1167Ti8A]. Individualize re-screening intervals (2–4 years) [^112pQTTb] based on risk, age, and preferences [^117SkRr6].

---

## General population screening recommendations

- **Age 50–69 years**: Regular screening every 2–4 years [^1113ymgE] is recommended, with shared decision-making to weigh benefits and harms [^1117UMji] [^112V81V9].

- **Age < 50 years**: Consider a baseline PSA at 45–50 years [^114guQhz], especially if risk factors are present [^113vp2r3].

- **Age ≥ 70 years**: Do not screen routinely [^113SgBTe]; consider only if healthy with ≥ 15-year life expectancy [^111tWCUc].

---

## High-risk populations

Start earlier and consider more frequent screening for **high-risk groups**:

| **Risk factor** | **Recommended screening age** |
|-|-|
| Black ancestry | 40–45 years [^114i8Ms4] [^116YZumg] |
| Strong family history | 40–45 years [^114i8Ms4] [^116YZumg] |
| BRCA1/2 mutations | 40–45 years [^114i8Ms4] [^111Hd5nN] [^116YZumg] |

---

## Screening methods

Use **PSA testing** as the primary screening test [^117HXCk7]; if PSA is 3–10 ng/mL with a normal DRE, repeat the PSA before further evaluation [^115Gjfpu] [^114CjTvN] [^1167Ti8A]. A **DRE** may be considered alongside PSA to assess the risk of clinically significant cancer [^111Qs6wD].

---

## Individualized screening intervals

Re-screening intervals should be **personalized** based on risk, age, PSA levels, and patient preferences [^117SkRr6], with typical intervals of 2–4 years [^112pQTTb].

---

## When to discontinue screening

Discontinue screening when **life expectancy < 10–15 years**, as benefits are unlikely [^112hqno3] [^115AjTto]. For **age ≥ 70 years**, generally stop screening [^113SgBTe] unless the patient is healthy with a ≥ 15-year life expectancy [^111tWCUc].

---

Screening for prostate cancer should be **individualized** based on age, risk factors, and patient preferences, with shared decision-making to balance benefits and harms.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prostate cancer, particularly concerning the indications for screening in high-risk populations, the AUA/SUO 2023 guidelines recommend beginning prostate cancer screening at ages 40–45 for males at increased risk of developing prostate cancer. Increased risk is based on the following factors:

- **Strong family history of prostate cancer**: A family history of this disease significantly raises the risk.
- **Black ancestry**: This demographic is statistically at higher risk for prostate cancer.
- **Germline mutations**: Specific genetic predispositions can increase the likelihood of developing prostate cancer.

### Screening for prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116HUxaw]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

- **Prostate cancer diagnosis**: Five trials contributed information on the diagnosis of prostate cancer in 340,800 randomized participants. The Quebec study did not report on disease stages in the control arm. There were 10,328 men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer among the 159,372 men enrolled in the screening group compared with 7,968 in the 181,428 controls, resulting in a relative risk of 1.46 (1.21 to 1.77; P < 0.001; fig 3) in favor of screening. There was a high degree of heterogeneity in these trials (I² = 97%, χ² = 126.69; P < 0.001).

- **Subgroup analysis**: The subgroup analysis for stage I prostate cancer was based on 3,789 men with a diagnosis of stage I prostate cancer among the 155,317 men in the screening group compared with 1,971 in the 177,426 control group, resulting in a relative risk of 1.95 (1.22 to 3.13; P = 0.005) in favor of screening (fig 4). There was a high degree of heterogeneity (I² = 96%, χ² = 79.32; P < 0.001).

	- **Stage II prostate cancer**: Stage II prostate cancer was diagnosed in 5,114 of the 155,317 men in the screening group and 4,035 of the 177,426 controls, resulting in a relative risk of 1.39 (0.99 to 1.95; P = 0.05; fig 4). In this analysis, there was significant heterogeneity (I² = 97%, χ² = 114.38; P < 0.001).

	- **Stages III and IV prostate cancer**: Data on the detection of stages III and IV prostate cancer were based on 332,743 randomized participants. Stages III and IV cancer were diagnosed in 701 of 155,317 men enrolled in the screening group and 975 of 177,426 controls, resulting in a relative risk of 0.94.

### Screening for prostate cancer: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117NQaqY]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

Data extraction and quality assessment

A standardized form was created, piloted, and then used to abstract the available data for the predefined outcomes of interest. These included all-cause mortality and death from prostate cancer, diagnosis of prostate cancer, the effect of screening on stage at diagnosis, false positive and false negative results, harms of screening, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. We used the 2010 American Joint Committee on Cancer system for prostate cancer staging. Two authors independently extracted data, with disagreements resolved by discussion, consensus, and arbitration by a third author.

Data were extracted on the methodological domains relevant to minimizing bias and random error in the analysis of trials, using Cochrane methods for assessing risk of bias and GRADE methods. Specifically, we assessed study limitations by evaluating the method of randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, analysis by intention to screen, contamination of the control arm, and completeness of follow-up. As per GRADE, we further assessed the quality of evidence regarding inconsistency (heterogeneity), indirectness, imprecision, and other potential sources of bias, such as publication and reporting bias. GRADE criteria were then applied to downgrade the quality of evidence when indicated on an outcome-specific basis. The quality of evidence for an individual outcome was ultimately rated as high, moderate, low, or very low. The review protocol is available from the authors upon request.

### WHO and when should we screen for prostate cancer? Interviews with key opinion leaders [^116T6Ba4]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

We asked authors, generally perceived as skeptical about prostate cancer screening, what they think policy for prostate cancer screening should be. We then asked some follow-up questions regarding their views.

- **Peter C. Albertsen**: Peter C. Albertsen is the Chief of Urology and Residency Program Director at the University of Connecticut Health Center in Farmington, CT. His research interests focus on understanding the natural history of prostate cancer and the impact of treatment on health-related quality of life. He has published widely in the field of outcomes research in prostate cancer, including the impact of screening for prostate cancer. He is a past trustee of the American Board of Urology and has served as President of several national urological societies.

- **Dragan Ilic**: Dragan Ilic is an Associate Professor of Evidence-Based Clinical Practice at the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Australia. He is a member of the Cochrane Urology review group and a co-author of the Cochrane systematic review 'Screening for Prostate Cancer'.
A. Vickers and S. Carlsson: You have generally been perceived as an individual who is skeptical about prostate cancer screening. What do you think policy should be? Should there be no screening ever? That is, should PSA be avoided entirely in asymptomatic men, or should screening be restricted to certain subgroups? If so, whom?

### Viewpoint: Expanding prostate cancer screening [^115HeSfD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer screening is controversial, with major professional associations offering differing screening guidelines. The authors address three key issues about prostate cancer screening:

- **Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) criteria**: They discuss the criteria for recommending a prostate biopsy, advocating for lowering the PSA threshold to 2.5 ng/mL for all men.
- **Age to start screening**: They recommend beginning risk assessment screening for average-risk men at age 40.
- **Age to stop screening**: The recommendation is to screen selected healthy men older than age 70.

Based on evidence published since 2000, the authors argue that data supporting the efficacy of PSA screening is convincing.

### Shared decision making emphasized for prostate screening [^115yssCo]. Cancer Discovery (2018). High credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) now recommends that men aged 55 to 69 individually decide, in consultation with their physician, whether to undergo PSA screening for prostate cancer. The guidelines represent a change from 2012, when the USPSTF recommended against screening for all men.

### Screening for prostate cancer: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114diw8h]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer among men worldwide and, after lung cancer, is the second leading cause of deaths from cancer in men in the United States. Screening has been advocated as a means of detecting prostate cancer in the early stages, which are amenable to local interventions with curative intent to decrease overall and disease-specific mortality. The benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening, however, have become the topic of controversy, as reflected by numerous recent editorials, position statements, and guidance documents.

Population-based recommendations for cancer screening should ideally be based on high-quality evidence derived from systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials that document a positive impact of screening on outcomes most important to patients. In 2006, a systematic review published in the Cochrane Library concluded that there was insufficient evidence to either support or refute the routine use of mass, selective, or opportunistic screening compared with no screening. This Cochrane systematic review was based on two randomised controlled trials that enrolled 55,512 participants overall but was limited by substantial methodological weaknesses in the design, conduct, and analysis of the included studies. The evidence drawn from this systematic review did not show that screening improved outcomes. By 2010, four additional trials enrolling 351,531 participants had been published, thereby providing a strong impetus for an updated synthesis of research evidence.

We performed a systematic review.

### The new US Preventive Services Task Force "C" draft recommendation for prostate cancer screening [^116ds3gH]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

The US Preventive Services Task Force has issued a new draft guideline with a "C" recommendation that men aged 55–69 years should be informed about the benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer and offered prostate-specific antigen testing if they choose it. For men aged 70 years and older, the recommendation remains "D", or "do not screen". This draft represents substantial progress toward offering men a fair opportunity to discuss the risks and benefits of screening with their primary care providers. However, the evidence review underlying the draft remains fundamentally inadequate, leading to biased presentations of both the benefits and harms of screening. The final guideline and future revisions should reflect formal engagement with subject matter experts to optimize the advice given to men and their physicians.

### Screening for prostate cancer: U.S. preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116kZYMu]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The update of the 2002 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement discusses the approach for screening for prostate cancer.

- **Methods**: The USPSTF evaluated randomized controlled trials to understand the benefits of prostate cancer screening. It also reviewed cohort and cross-sectional studies concerning the psychological harms of false-positive prostate-specific antigen test results. Additionally, evidence regarding the natural history of prostate-specific antigen-detected prostate cancer was assessed to address previously identified evidence gaps in the 2002 USPSTF recommendation.

- **Recommendations**: Evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer in men younger than age 75 years (I statement). The recommendation is not to screen for prostate cancer in men age 75 years or older (Grade D recommendation).

### Physician attitudes and self-reported practices toward prostate cancer screening in Black and White men [^1121zpy8]. Family Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Updated 2018 prostate cancer screening guidelines recommend informed decision-making discussions, which should include education on prostate cancer's disproportionate impact on Black men. It is unknown whether academic family physicians follow these guidelines.

- **Methods**: Family physicians were surveyed as part of the 2020 Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance (CERA) survey. We used χ2 to compare physicians' knowledge and screening practices stratified by physician age, gender, and percentage of Black patients in the patient panel. We calculated logistic regressions predicting shared decision-making conversations, barriers to shared decision-making, inclusion of race in the prostate cancer screening approach, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing adjusted for physician age, gender, and percentage of Black patients.

- **Results**: Physicians reported engaging in shared decision-making for prostate cancer screening in half of eligible men. Only 29.2% of physicians reported routinely informing Black men of their increased prostate cancer risk. In logistic regressions, physician gender (female) and fewer Black patients in the panel (< 25%) were associated with lower frequency of shared decision-making with Black patients. Physician age (< 40 years) was associated with not discussing race during screening discussions (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.55–3.23).

- **Conclusions**: Most academic family physicians do not appropriately inform Black men of increased prostate cancer risk, with younger physicians less likely to discuss race than older physicians.

### PSA-based screening for prostate cancer: How does it compare with other cancer screening tests [^115JVk8j]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Despite the substantive societal impact of prostate cancer, the medical community remains divided on the balance between the benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer using prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

To examine whether PSA-based screening for prostate cancer meets guidelines on efficacy and effectiveness for screening, and how it compares with other currently implemented cancer screening methods, a literature search was conducted. Reviews and individual studies that examined the performance of screening for colorectal, cervical, breast, and prostate cancer were included. Each screening method was assessed using the United Kingdom National Screening Committee guidelines. Data on screening test performance (sensitivity, specificity, etc) were extracted from these articles for comparison.

In common with other cancers for which screening is conducted, prostate cancer represents a significant morbidity and mortality burden. The PSA test can be considered "simple" and "safe" within appropriate boundaries. The sensitivity and specificity profile of PSA is not optimal but has clinical validity; cases missed at screening and detected as interval cases do not have a poor outcome. Early prostate cancer intervention can be beneficial for long-term outcomes, although the benefits need to be weighed against the adverse effects of intervention. Early evidence from screening studies also suggests positive stage and grade shifts, although Level 1 mortality data are still awaited. Robust cost-effectiveness data are still required.

### Benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen screening for prostate cancer: An evidence update for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^111x46EA]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most common nonskin cancer in men in the United States, and prostate cancer screening has increased in recent years. In 2002, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that evidence was insufficient to recommend for, or against screening for prostate cancer with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing.

- **Purpose**: To examine new evidence on benefits and harms of screening asymptomatic men for prostate cancer with PSA.

- **Data sources**: English-language articles identified in PubMed and the Cochrane Library (search dates, January 2002 to July 2007), reference lists of retrieved articles, and expert suggestions.

- **Study selection**: Randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses of PSA screening and cross-sectional and cohort studies of screening harms and of the natural history of screening-detected cancer were selected to answer the following questions: Does screening for prostate cancer with PSA, as a single-threshold test or as a function of multiple tests over time, decrease morbidity or mortality? What are the magnitude and nature of harms associated with prostate cancer screening, other than overtreatment? What is the natural history of PSA-detected, nonpalpable, localized prostate cancer?

- **Data extraction**: Studies were reviewed, abstracted, and rated for quality by using predefined U.S. Preventive Services Task Force criteria.

- **Data synthesis**: No good-quality randomized, controlled trials of screening for prostate cancer have been completed. In one cross-sectional and two prospective cohort studies of fair to good quality, false-positive results were identified.

### The Lancet commission on prostate cancer: Planning for the surge in cases [^112NNXcV]. The Lancet (2024). Low credibility.

Concerns about overdiagnosis and overtreatment continue to dominate the debate surrounding PSA-based screening in high-income countries (HICs). In 2017, the US Preventive Services Task Force issued an updated recommendation that men aged 55–69 years should be counseled about the benefits and harms of PSA screening because testing might be associated with a small survival benefit, which is a grade C recommendation. However, because advanced age is such a strong risk factor, voluntary screening programs, which are common in HICs, can result in over-testing in men aged 70 years or older and under-testing in men aged 50–70 years. Such under-testing is especially likely in younger men from ethnic minorities or deprived backgrounds — precisely the groups at highest risk of presentation with advanced disease and with the most life years to lose. Substantial regional variations linked with patient-requested screening have also been noted; for example, the proportion of patients with advanced disease at presentation in the UK varies from 12.5% in London to 30% in Scotland.

An individualized risk-adapted early-detection strategy is now recommended in international prostate cancer guidelines. In the European Association of Urology's PRAISE-U project, EU member states are comparing their different approaches to prostate cancer screening. All guidelines recognize the risk of overdiagnosis and the need to break the link between diagnosis and overtreatment without compromising the benefits that early detection could have for men with clinically significant prostate cancer.

### Screening for prostate cancer: Evidence, ongoing trials, policies and knowledge gaps [^116TQ29s]. BMJ Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Long-term screening with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and systematic prostate biopsies can reduce prostate cancer mortality but leads to unacceptable overdiagnosis. Over the past decade, diagnostic methods have improved, and the indolent nature of low-grade prostate cancer has been established. These advances now enable more selective detection of potentially lethal prostate cancer.

This non-systematic review summarizes relevant diagnostic advances, previous and ongoing screening trials, healthcare policies, and important remaining knowledge gaps. Evidence synthesis and the strong association between low serum PSA values and minimal long-term risk of prostate cancer death allow for adjusting screening intervals. The use of risk calculators, biomarkers, and MRI to select men with a raised PSA value for biopsy and lesion-targeting rather than systematic prostate biopsies reduce the detection of low-grade cancer and thereby overdiagnosis.

These improvements have recently led the European Union to recommend its member states evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of organized screening programs for prostate cancer. Nonetheless, important knowledge gaps remain, such as the performance of modern diagnostic methods in long-term screening programs and their impact on mortality. These knowledge gaps are currently being addressed in three large randomized screening trials. Population-based pilot programs will contribute critical practical experience.

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA guideline [^112b8sAe]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

The guideline purpose is to provide the urologist with a framework for the early detection of prostate cancer in asymptomatic average-risk men.

- **Materials and methods**: A systematic review was conducted and summarized evidence derived from over 300 studies that addressed the predefined outcomes of interest, which included prostate cancer incidence/mortality, quality of life, diagnostic accuracy, and harms of testing. In addition to the quality of evidence, the panel considered values and preferences expressed in a clinical setting (patient-physician dyad) rather than having a public health perspective. Guideline statements were organized by age group in years (age < 40; 40 to 54; 55 to 69; ≥ 70).

- **Results**: Except for prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based prostate cancer screening, there was minimal evidence to assess the outcomes of interest for other tests. The quality of evidence for the benefits of screening was moderate, and evidence for harm was high for men aged 55 to 69 years. For men outside this age range, evidence was lacking for benefit, but the harms of screening, including overdiagnosis and overtreatment, remained. Modeled data suggested that a screening interval of two years or more may be preferred to reduce the harms of screening.

- **Conclusions**: The panel recommended shared decision-making for men aged 55 to 69 years considering PSA-based screening, a target age group for whom benefits may outweigh harms. Outside this age range, PSA-based screening as a routine could not be recommended based on the available evidence.

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA/SUO guideline part I: Prostate cancer screening [^114guQhz]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prostate cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening in the general population under 54 years of age, the AUA/SUO 2023 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of prostate cancer screening and obtaining a baseline PSA test in males aged 45–50 years.

### Prostate-specific antigen-based screening: Controversy and guidelines [^1177mDjo]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Although prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening has improved the detection of prostate cancer, allowing for stage migration to less advanced disease, the precise mortality benefit of early detection is unclear. This is in part due to a discrepancy between the two large randomized controlled trials comparing PSA screening to usual care. The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) found a survival benefit to screening, while the United States Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial did not.

Furthermore, the benefit of immediate surgical intervention for screen-detected prostate cancer is unclear, as the results superficially differ between the two large randomized controlled trials comparing prostatectomy to observation. The Prostate Cancer Intervention Versus Observation Trial (PIVOT) found no survival benefit for prostatectomy in PSA screened U.S. men, while the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group Study Number Four (SPCG-4) found a survival benefit for prostatectomy in clinically diagnosed prostate cancer.

As a result of the controversy surrounding PSA screening and subsequent prostate cancer treatment, guidelines vary widely by organization.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112V81V9]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

In the United States, the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer is approximately 13%, and the lifetime risk of dying from prostate cancer is 2.5%. The median age of death from prostate cancer is 80 years. Many men with prostate cancer never experience symptoms and, without screening, would never know they have the disease. African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer have an increased risk of prostate cancer compared to other men.

The purpose of this update is to provide the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening for prostate cancer.

- **Evidence review**: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer and the subsequent treatment of screen-detected prostate cancer. Additionally, they commissioned a review of existing decision analysis models and the overdiagnosis rate of PSA-based screening. The reviews also examined the benefits and harms of PSA-based screening in patient subpopulations at higher risk, including older men, African American men, and men with a family history of prostate cancer.

- **Findings**: Adequate evidence from randomized clinical trials shows that PSA-based screening programs in men aged 55 to 69 years may prevent approximately 1.3 deaths from prostate cancer over approximately 13 years per 1,000 men screened. Screening programs may also prevent approximately 3 cases of metastatic prostate cancer per 1,000 men screened. Potential harms of screening include frequent false-positive results.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: A clinical practice guideline [^113VVTup]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Guidelines on PSA testing vary in their recommendations. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommends against PSA screening for men aged 55 to 69 years. However, the US Preventive Services Task Force recently changed its guidance to say that "the decision about whether to be screened for prostate cancer should be an individual one" without clearly suggesting for, or against screening — previously, it recommended against screening in that group. The National Cancer Center Network (NCCN) guidelines, which represent cancer centers in the United States, recommend initiating PSA screening at age 45 years. Additionally, guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) and European Association of Urology (EAU) recommend a discussion about PSA screening with patients.

- **Uptake of PSA testing**: The incidence of prostate cancer has dramatically increased over the last quarter-century. This rise has been associated with the widespread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, which detects early-stage prostate cancers. There is wide variation in the adoption of prostate cancer screening. In the UK, about 39% of men aged 45–69 years have undergone PSA testing in the past 10 years. In Sweden, 23% of men aged 50–69 had a PSA test in the previous 12 months, and 58% in the previous 10 years. Although the rates of screening have declined during the past decade in the US, up to half of US men aged 60–74 undergo screening each year. Additionally, as many as 33% of elderly US men with competing medical comorbidities have participated in screening.

### Discussing uncertainty and risk in primary care: Recommendations of a multi-disciplinary panel regarding communication around prostate cancer screening [^11728te3]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

How can screening for life-threatening diseases be harmful?

While many screening tests have improved the quantity and quality of a person's life through early detection of life-threatening or life-altering diseases, others have failed to deliver. These tests may fail to deliver because they are inaccurate, poorly performing, have unavailable treatments, high costs, treatment complications, or because healthcare providers are unaware of the screening controversies. Prostate cancer screening with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test epitomizes this controversy. Prostate cancer accounts for about 29,000 cancer deaths annually in the US, yet millions of men may have undetected prostate cancer — the vast majority of whom will remain asymptomatic throughout their life. At the population level, prostate cancer treatment has only a marginal mortality benefit. PSA as a screening test has reasonable sensitivity to detect aggressive prostate cancers (91%) but cannot distinguish between low- and high-risk prostate cancers. This results in substantial overdiagnosis, with attendant treatment complications such as impotence, incontinence, and surgical mortality, of men who would have remained asymptomatic.

For controversial conditions such as prostate cancer screening (PrCS), the medical encounter needs to focus on discussion and education to help patients reach value-concordant decisions. Value-concordant decision-making can be enhanced using shared decision-making techniques to clarify issues. In shared decision-making, medical knowledge, including risks, harms, and benefits of diagnosis and treatment, is utilized.

### Screening for prostate cancer [^113LUgXN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Any form of screening aims to reduce disease-specific and overall mortality, and to improve a person's future quality of life. Screening for prostate cancer has generated considerable debate within the medical and broader community, as demonstrated by the varying recommendations made by medical organizations and governed by national policies. To better inform individual patient decision-making and health policy decisions, we need to consider the entire body of data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on prostate cancer screening summarized in a systematic review. In 2006, our Cochrane review identified insufficient evidence to either support or refute the use of routine mass, selective, or opportunistic screening for prostate cancer. An update of the review in 2010 included three additional trials. Meta-analysis of the five studies included in the 2010 review concluded that screening did not significantly reduce prostate cancer-specific mortality. In the past two years, several updates to studies included in the 2010 review have been published, thereby providing the rationale for this update of the 2010 systematic review.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether screening for prostate cancer reduces prostate cancer-specific mortality or all-cause mortality and to assess its impact on quality of life and adverse events.

- **Search methods**: An updated search of electronic databases (PROSTATE register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CANCERLIT, and the NHS EED) was performed, in addition to handsearching of specific journals.

### Viewpoint: Limiting prostate cancer screening [^114UBZ33]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer screening is controversial, and major professional associations offer differing screening guidelines. The author addresses three key issues about prostate cancer screening: 1) the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) criteria to recommend a prostate biopsy, 2) the appropriate age to start screening, and 3) the appropriate age to stop screening.

The author argues, based on evidence published since 2000, that data supporting the efficacy of PSA screening remain unconvincing. The author recommends that screening should not be expanded to include average-risk men younger than age 50 years or older than age 75 years, and that a PSA threshold below 4.0 ng/mL should not be used to trigger biopsy referral.

### The effect of the USPSTF PSA screening recommendation on prostate cancer incidence patterns in the United States [^1177pw2c]. Nature Reviews Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Guidelines regarding recommendations for PSA screening for early detection of prostate cancer are conflicting. In 2012, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) assigned a grade of D (recommending against screening) for men aged ≥ 75 years in 2008 and for men of all ages in 2012. Understanding temporal trends in rates of screening before and after the 2012 recommendation in terms of usage patterns in PSA screening, changes in prostate cancer incidence and biopsy patterns, and how the recommendation has influenced physicians' and men's attitudes about PSA screening and subsequent ordering of other screening tests is essential within the scope of prostate cancer screening policy.

Since the 2012 recommendation, rates of PSA screening decreased by 3–10% in all age groups and across most geographical regions of the United States. Rates of prostate biopsy and prostate cancer incidence have declined in unison, with a shift towards tumors being of higher grade and stage upon detection. Despite the recommendation, some physicians report ongoing willingness to screen appropriately selected men, and many men report intending to continue to ask for the PSA test from their physician. In the coming years, we expect to have an improved understanding of whether these decreased rates of screening will affect prostate cancer metastasis and mortality.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prostate cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening and high-risk populations, the EANM/EAU/ESTRO/ESUR/ISUP/SIOG 2025 guidelines recommend offering a risk-adapted strategy based on initial PSA levels. This includes levels of less than 1 ng/mL at 40 years of age and less than 2 ng/mL at 60 years of age. Follow-up intervals should be set at 2 years for patients initially at risk. For those not at risk, it is advised to postpone follow-up to 8 years.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^116yxJLe]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

PSA testing has increased the number of men diagnosed with and treated for prostate cancer, but many of these men would never have experienced any symptoms or death from prostate cancer. This guideline makes a weak recommendation against offering systematic PSA screening based on an updated systematic review. The recommendation is weak because there may be a small, though uncertain, benefit of screening on prostate cancer mortality.

Men who place more value on avoiding complications from biopsies and cancer treatment are likely to decline screening. In contrast, men who put more value in even a small reduction of prostate cancer mortality, such as men at high baseline risk due to family history or African descent, or those concerned about ruling out the diagnosis, may opt for screening. Shared decision-making is needed for men considering screening to make a decision consistent with their individual values and preferences. However, clinicians need not feel obligated to systematically raise the issue of PSA screening with their patients.

- **What is the role of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in prostate cancer?** An expert panel produced these recommendations based on a linked systematic review. The review was triggered by a large-scale, cluster-randomised trial on PSA screening in men without a previous diagnosis of prostate cancer published in 2018. It found no difference between one-time PSA screening and standard practice in prostate cancer mortality but found an increase in the detection of low-risk prostate cancer following a median follow-up.

### Lifetime benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen-based risk-stratified screening for prostate cancer [^115Uy1Dj]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2020). Low credibility.

Although using two models that simultaneously approximate high-dimensional empirical data from two sources creates some robustness around the main result, it also leaves the primary scientific question partially unanswered. The models concur that a key effect of stratifying screening by PSA level is a large reduction in testing burden. The models also agree about the effects of lengthening screening intervals for men with low PSA. They predict quantitatively different effects of early cessation for men with low PSA at age 60 years and older. Nevertheless, the models agree qualitatively across all settings that PSA-stratified strategies will lead to modest reductions in both overdiagnoses and lives saved, and therefore these strategies are ready to be evaluated in a clinical setting.

- **Limitations of the study**: These include the necessary simplification of biology represented by disease models and the difficulty in quantifying uncertainty around model projections. Discrepancies between the empirical and model-predicted probabilities of prostate cancer diagnosis may be due, at least in part, to the unknown proportion of men who received screening tests in the later years in Sweden. This likely increased the probability of diagnosis in the observed data. Additionally, the low number of men with baseline PSA greater than 1.5 ng/mL led to uncertainty in the predicted probability of diagnosis for men with PSA levels in this range. Several assumptions were made to simplify comparisons across strategies, including the assumption that 100% of men received a biopsy following a positive PSA test.

### Effect of the USPSTF grade D recommendation against screening for prostate cancer on incident prostate cancer diagnoses in the United States [^111fqjRt]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Low credibility.

In October 2011, the USPSTF (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force) issued a draft guideline discouraging prostate-specific antigen-based screening for prostate cancer (grade D recommendation). We evaluated the effect of the USPSTF guideline on the number and distribution of new prostate cancer diagnoses in the United States.

We identified incident cancers diagnosed between January 2010 and December 2012 in the NCDB (National Cancer Database). We performed an interrupted time series to evaluate the trend of new prostate cancers diagnosed each month before and after the draft guideline, with colon cancer as a comparator.

Incident monthly prostate cancer diagnoses decreased by 1,363 cases (12.2%, p < 0.01) in the month after the USPSTF draft guideline and continued to decrease by 164 cases per month relative to baseline (1.8%, p < 0.01). In contrast, monthly colon cancer diagnoses remained stable. Diagnoses of low, intermediate, and high-risk prostate cancers decreased significantly, but new diagnoses of nonlocalized disease did not change. Subgroups of age, comorbidity, race, income, and insurance showed comparable decreases in incident prostate cancer following the draft guideline.

There was a 28% decrease in incident diagnoses of prostate cancer in the year after the USPSTF draft recommendation against prostate-specific antigen screening. This study helps quantify the potential benefits (reduced harms of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of low-risk disease and disease found in elderly men) and potential harms (missed opportunities).

### Screening for prostate cancer: A guidance statement from the Clinical Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians [^113yDtR1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is an important health problem in men. It rarely causes death in men younger than 50 years; most deaths associated with it occur in men older than 75 years. The benefits of screening with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test are outweighed by the harms for most men. Prostate cancer never becomes clinically significant in a patient's lifetime in a considerable proportion of men with prostate cancer detected with the PSA test. They will receive no benefit and are subject to substantial harms from the treatment of prostate cancer.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guidance statement for clinicians by assessing prostate cancer screening guidelines developed by other organizations. ACP believes that it is more valuable to provide clinicians with a rigorous review of available guidelines rather than develop a new guideline on the same topic when several guidelines are available or when existing guidelines conflict. The purpose of this guidance statement is to critically review available guidelines to help guide internists and other clinicians in making decisions about screening for prostate cancer. The target patient population for this guidance statement is all adult men.

Methods: This guidance statement is derived from an appraisal of available guidelines on screening for prostate cancer. Authors searched the National Guideline Clearinghouse to identify prostate cancer screening guidelines in the United States and selected four developed by the American College of Preventive Medicine and the American Cancer Society.

### Discussing uncertainty and risk in primary care: Recommendations of a multi-disciplinary panel regarding communication around prostate cancer screening [^113CLpo6]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Balanced discussions between clinicians and patients about disease screening remain problematic. Objective disease screening discussions are influenced by over 50 years of public health efforts that convey "do not delay" messages for cancer screening. Overall, the public has an enthusiasm for health screening. This enthusiasm for cancer screening persists even when they understand the risks of false-positive results — identifying "abnormalities" that have a dubious impact on health but may result in a cascade of costly and often aggressive medical interventions. At the same time, physicians often worry about liability issues that might arise from missed diagnosis resulting from a decision not to screen. Primary care physicians have limited time for complex medical discussions, limited training in effective shared decision-making techniques, and may not be updated at the time of writing on the latest evidence. Additionally, tension exists between specialists who see patients with advanced disease (and therefore push for aggressive screening) and primary care/population health groups who see the myriad of complications from over-diagnosis.

As such, public and private agencies are seeking methods to help patients make complex medical decisions that go beyond providing written material or engaging in brief discussions. Typically, health messages fail for a variety of reasons: the type of message delivered, method of delivery, lack of message reinforcement, lack of access to recommended care, non-acceptance on the part of the individual, and inappropriate education level. Similarly, expert consensus groups have…

### Screening for prostate cancer with the prostate-specific antigen test: A review of current evidence [^113Qqr27]. JAMA (2014). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer screening using the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test remains controversial. This review examines evidence from randomized trials and related modeling studies to assess the impact of PSA screening versus no screening on prostate cancer-specific mortality. The aim is to propose an approach that balances potential benefits and harms.

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2010, to April 3, 2013, for PSA screening trials to update a previous systematic review. Additionally, searches in EMBASE and MEDLINE were conducted to identify modeling studies that extend the results of two large randomized trials. The American Heart Association Evidence-Based Scoring System was utilized to evaluate the level of evidence.

Two major trials, the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) screening trial, and the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC), are pivotal in evaluating PSA screening efficacy. The PLCO trial observed an increase in cancer incidence in the screening group (relative risk [RR], 1.12; 95% CI, 1.07–1.17) but found no cancer-specific mortality benefit following a 13-year follow-up (RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.87–1.36). Conversely, the ERSPC documented an increase in cancer incidence with screening (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.57–1.69) and a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer-specific death after 11 years (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.68–0.91). Furthermore, the ERSPC indicated that 37 additional men needed a diagnosis through screening to prevent one prostate cancer death.

The screening and diagnosis guidelines for prostate cancer, particularly regarding screening indications, emphasize general considerations. The EANM/EAU/ESTRO/ESUR/ISUP/SIOG 2025 guidelines recommend discontinuing early diagnosis of prostate cancer based on life expectancy and performance status. They highlight that individuals with a life expectancy of less than 15 years are unlikely to benefit from early screening.

### The case for tailored prostate cancer screening: An NCCN perspective [^112c5bk8]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2015). Low credibility.

A preponderance of clinical evidence supports a significant public health benefit for screening and early detection of prostate cancer in selected men. The challenge lies in maximizing early diagnosis of potentially aggressive but curable disease while minimizing diagnosis and treatment of indolent disease. A tailored approach to population screening in appropriately counseled men, using an evidence-based strategy with judicious prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, will reduce prostate-cancer mortality yet limit overdetection of clinically insignificant disease.

Use of newer biomarkers that increase specificity for prostate cancer detection, including percentage of free PSA, 4Kscore, prostate health index, prostate cancer antigen 3, and multiparametric MRI, may be considered under certain circumstances.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: A clinical practice guideline [^113TBkoF]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

The Rapid Recommendations executive felt this new study — taken together with extended follow-up data from existing trials — required a new appraisal of the body of evidence for patients and clinicians.

Although the results of this study suggest screening is not worthwhile, several guidelines advocate offering screening in some cases. The study was much larger than previous studies, and existing trials had published more extended follow-up results, and the BMJ Rapid Recommendations team felt these merited a new appraisal of the body of evidence. This guideline aims to promptly and transparently translate potentially practice-changing evidence to usable recommendations for clinicians and patients, based on the GRADE framework and following standards for trustworthy guidelines.

- **Recommendation**: The panel suggests against systematic PSA screening (weak recommendation). The panel members judged that most men will decline screening because the benefit is small and uncertain and there are clear harms. However, there is likely considerable variation in values and preferences. Men with a family history of prostate cancer, African descent, or of lower socioeconomic status, having higher baseline risk of prostate cancer death, may be more likely to choose PSA screening. Shared decision-making is needed for men considering screening.

### Public knowledge of benefits of breast and prostate cancer screening in Europe [^114bUr6Q]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2009). Low credibility.

Women and men in countries with modern health systems face the question of whether to participate in screening for breast cancer and prostate cancer. Screening can lead to harms such as overtreatment, so it is crucial for individuals to understand the potential benefits of these screening programs before making informed decisions about participation. Ideally, physicians, health pamphlets, and other information sources should assist in clarifying the actual size of benefits.

Screening for breast cancer with mammography is widely encouraged by governmental programs in both the European Union (EU) and the United States, under the assumption that these programs save lives. An analysis of randomized trials involving approximately 247,000 women aged 40–74 years showed that for every 1,000 women who participated in screening, 3.9 diagnosed with breast cancer died, compared to 5.0 among those who did not participate. The follow-up time ranged between 5.8 and 20.2 years. Thus, the absolute risk reduction was on the order of one in 1,000. The authors of a recent review of six trials involving half a million women estimated the absolute risk reduction to be approximately one in 2,000. Note that this benefit relates to fewer breast cancer deaths; no reduction in mortality from all cancers or other causes was found. Whether the potential of screening to reduce breast cancer mortality outweighs the harms of overdiagnosis and overtreatment is still under discussion.

### Lifetime benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen-based risk-stratified screening for prostate cancer [^112mNkxS]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2020). Low credibility.

We utilized calibrated models to simulate cohorts of men in the United States, beginning at ages 45 or 50 in 2017, and followed them until age 85. The implemented screening strategies included:

- **Screening intervals**: Screening up to age 69 years at 2-year intervals.
- **Adjusting screening intervals**: Lengthening the screening to 8 years for baseline PSA levels of less than 1.0 ng/mL. If PSA levels increased to over 1.0 ng/mL at a later screening, intervals were reduced to 2 years.
- **Age-specific screening cessation**: Stopping screening if PSA is below 1.0 ng/mL at age 60 years and older.
- **Combined strategies**: Implementing a combination of the last two strategies.
- **Screening cessation**: For reference, stopping screening for all men at age 60 years.

In every strategy, a PSA threshold of 4.0 ng/mL was employed. To evaluate the optimal strategy, we specified a 100% attendance rate for each screening, with positive screens followed by a biopsy compliance and sensitivity of 100%. For each screening policy, projections included the number of tests conducted, cancers diagnosed (both screen-detected and clinically detected), overdiagnoses, lives saved, and life-years gained.

### WHO and when should we screen for prostate cancer? Interviews with key opinion leaders [^111wR7FR]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Screening for prostate cancer with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is controversial. Screening is currently transitioning from being an all-or-nothing question to finding new ways of individualized testing. However, consensus remains to be reached within guideline groups and worldwide experts regarding who — and when — to screen, if at all. In this Q&A, we invite seven of the world's key opinion leaders in the field, both proponents and skeptics, to elaborate on what they believe the screening policy should be. The authors have all published widely on PSA and comprise a wide variety of experience in areas such as urology, epidemiology, evidence-based medicine, and medical decision-making.

Currently, only one guideline group, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), recommends against screening for all men. Most other guideline groups recommend shared decision-making, involving a discussion of the pros and cons of screening. To aid in decision-making, some propose using a risk-stratified approach that takes into account multiple factors along with a PSA measurement. However, the specifics of such an approach are a subject of debate; for instance, the appropriate age limits of screening remain to be defined. Randomized screening trials, including the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and the Göteborg trial, have provided evidence that regular PSA screening can reduce prostate cancer mortality by 21–44% at 13–14 years of follow-up; the age groups studied in these trials were 55–69 and 50–64 years, respectively.

### Prostate cancer: To screen, or not to screen, is that the question [^112xK4Q9]. BMC Urology (2008). Low credibility.

After the introduction of serum PSA over 20 years ago as a tumor marker for prostate cancer, controversy regarding PSA and prostate cancer screening still abounds. First, who should be screened? Second, does screening affect mortality? Third, serum PSA used for screening has a low specificity (approximately 30%), resulting in many patients undergoing costly and invasive procedures to diagnose prostate cancer. Fourth, does screening lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment? These are just a few of the controversial issues surrounding PSA and prostate cancer screening.

It is clear that over the past decade, the utility of serum PSA in diagnosing prostate cancer has declined. Although still an important screening tool for prostate cancer, we have noticed a 'PSA migration' — where heavily screened populations are presenting with lower serum PSA levels today compared to 10–20 years ago. Though serum PSA may not be the ideal screening tool, it is the centerpiece of two large prospective randomized clinical trials: the Prostate, Lung, Colon, and Ovary (PLCO) Screening Trial in the US and the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) in Europe. Despite lacking level I evidence demonstrating the benefit of screening, we are engulfed in a sea of circumstantial evidence associated with prostate cancer screening. In two large European studies, prostate cancer survival improved in men who underwent prostate cancer screening and treatment compared to those who did not undergo screening and/or treatment.

### Prostate-specific antigen-based screening for prostate cancer: Evidence report and systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force [^1157nbPN]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among US men. This study aims to systematically review evidence on prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based prostate cancer screening, treatments for localized prostate cancer, and prebiopsy risk calculators to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Searches were conducted through PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Registries and Databases from July 1, 2011, through July 15, 2017, with a surveillance search on February 1, 2018. The study includes English-language reports of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of screening; cohort studies reporting harms; RCTs and cohort studies of active localized cancer treatments versus conservative approaches (e.g. active surveillance, watchful waiting); and external validations of prebiopsy risk calculators to identify aggressive cancers.

Data extraction and synthesis involved one investigator abstracting data and a second checking accuracy. Two investigators independently rated study quality.

The main outcomes and measures were prostate cancer and all-cause mortality; false-positive screening results; biopsy complications; overdiagnosis; and adverse effects of active treatments. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for treatment harms.

The results included 63 studies in 104 publications (N = 1,904,950). Randomization to PSA screening was not associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer mortality in either a US trial with substantial control group contamination (n = 76,683) or a UK trial with low adherence to a single PSA screen (n = 408,825) but was associated with significantly different outcomes.

The NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer Early Detection provide recommendations for men choosing to participate in an early detection program for prostate cancer. These NCCN Guidelines Insights highlight notable recent updates. Overall, the 2014 update represents a more streamlined and concise set of recommendations. The panel stratified the age ranges at which initiating testing for prostate cancer should be considered. Indications for biopsy include both a cutpoint and the use of multiple risk variables in combination. In addition to other biomarkers of specificity, the Prostate Health Index has been included to aid biopsy decisions in certain men, given recent FDA approvals.

### Screening for prostate cancer: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1175tqXq]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

In summary, existing evidence from randomised controlled trials does not support the routine use of screening for prostate cancer, though screening probably aids in earlier diagnosis and helps to detect prostate cancer at an earlier stage. This early detection, which has not been shown to have a significant impact on mortality, comes at the price of additional testing, the risk of overtreatment and downstream adverse effects, and impaired quality of life that currently cannot be precisely quantified. Patients need to be informed about the existing uncertainties; individual patients' values and preferences are key factors in deciding whether to offer screening. At the individual level, it is conceivable that some patients would value early detection, while others might want to avoid the risk of overdiagnosis. Until further evidence accumulates, this systematic review should serve as a basis for the development of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines by relevant stakeholder organizations and prompt an update of such guidelines that continue to actively promote routine prostate cancer screening even in the absence of reliable evidence, as reflected by our study findings.

### Prostate specific antigen best practice statement: 2009 update [^115DeKkw]. The Journal of Urology (2009). High credibility.

We provide information on the use of PSA testing for the evaluation of men at risk for prostate cancer, along with the risks and benefits of early detection.

- **Purpose**: The report is a summary of the American Urological Association PSA Best Practice Policy 2009. The summary statement is based on a review of the professional literature, clinical experience, and the expert opinions of a multispecialty panel. It is intended to serve as a resource for physicians, other health care professionals, and patients. It does not establish a fixed set of guidelines, define the legal standard of care, or pre-empt physician judgment in individual cases.

- **Results**: There are two notable differences in the policy. First, the age for obtaining a baseline PSA has been lowered to 40 years. Secondly, the policy no longer recommends a single threshold value of PSA which should prompt prostate biopsy. Rather, the decision to proceed to prostate biopsy should be based primarily on PSA and DRE results but should take into account multiple factors, including free and total PSA, patient age, PSA velocity, PSA density, family history, ethnicity, prior biopsy history, and comorbidities.

- **Conclusions**: Although recently published trials show different results regarding the impact of prostate cancer screening on mortality, both suggest that prostate cancer screening leads to overdetection and overtreatment of some patients. Therefore, men should be informed of the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening before biopsy and the option of active surveillance.

### What's new in screening in 2015 [^1163djmB]. Current Opinion in Urology (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this review was to highlight important articles in the field of prostate cancer screening published during 2015 and early 2016. Four major areas were identified: screening strategies, post-United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2011–2012, screening trends/patterns, and shared decision-making.

Several studies provided further evidence that screening reduces the risk of metastasis and death from prostate cancer. Multiplex screening strategies have proven beneficial; however, genetics and MRI require further evaluation. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening rates declined in men over the age of 50, as did the overall prostate cancer incidence following the USPSTF 2011–2012 recommendation against PSA. The consequences of declining screening rates will become apparent in the next few years. Further research is required to determine the most optimal approach to implement effective shared decision-making in clinical practice.

Data emerging in 2015 provided evidence on how best to screen for prostate cancer, offering more progress towards 'next-generation prostate cancer screening'. Screening is an ongoing process for all men, irrespective of their potential benefit from early detection and treatment. Following the USPSTF 2011–2012 recommendation, the rates of PSA testing have declined; however, this reduction is observed across all men, not just those unlikely to benefit from screening. The long-term effect of this recommendation may not align with initial expectations.

### Early detection of prostate cancer in 2020 and beyond: Facts and recommendations for the European Union and the European Commission [^115f2nEX]. European Urology (2021). Low credibility.

The burden of prostate cancer is increasing. Therefore, a contemporary, organized, risk-stratified program for early detection is essential. Such a program aims to reduce both the harm from the disease and potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment, while avoiding underdiagnosis to considerably improve the harm-to-benefit ratio.

### Ethnicity and prostate cancer: The way to solve the screening problem [^115YGDcP]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

We believe this approach does not adequately address the conundrum. We should focus on risk-stratifying men based on the best harm-to-benefit ratio. Screening should only be actively offered if the harm-to-benefit ratio strongly favors the benefits and should be requested by the individual and discussed in case of an ambivalent harm-to-benefit ratio, and avoided in men with no benefit but mostly harms.

Several methods for achieving this better-than-average harm-to-benefit ratio were studied. Based on modeling data from the ERSPC, limiting screening to specific age groups — such as two to three screens between the ages of 55 and 59 years — was shown to maximize the harm-to-benefit ratio. Others suggested starting screening at an even earlier age, stratifying men based on a baseline PSA value, and only actively offering screening to men within the highest 10% risk of prostate cancer death. In fact, this strategy was shown to produce a better risk-to-benefit ratio compared to stratifying men based on race or family history of prostate cancer. Once screening starts, optimizing the harm-to-benefit ratio could be achieved by stratifying men for further, potentially harmful, or burdensome testing (e.g. biopsy or MRI). This has been shown possible by using developed and validated risk calculators and is recommended in guidelines, such as those of the European Association of Urology.

### Randomized trial results did not resolve controversies surrounding prostate cancer screening [^117Dyxn1]. Current Opinion in Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer screening remains controversial. This review addresses the recently published results from randomized controlled screening trials as well as practice guidelines.

The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial found that screening did not decrease prostate cancer mortality after seven years of follow-up. High screening rates in the control group, a low number of deaths from prostate cancer, and the relatively short follow-up duration contributed to the negative results. The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer found that screening reduced prostate cancer mortality by 20% during a median of nine years of follow-up. However, the absolute benefit (0.7/1000 reduction) was small and was associated with a 70% increase in prostate cancer diagnosis.

Subsequently, the American Urological Association recommended beginning screening at the age of 40 and not relying on a specific prostate-specific antigen cutoff for biopsy referral. The United States Preventive Services Task Force and American Cancer Society have yet to issue updated guidelines.

The randomized trials suggest that screening, at best, will have a small survival benefit but substantial potential risk for overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Patients need to understand these trade-offs to make informed decisions about screening.

### Changes in prostate-specific antigen testing relative to the revised US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation on prostate cancer screening [^111mYi62]. JAMA Oncology (2022). High credibility.

In April 2017, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) published a draft guideline that reversed its 2012 guidance advising against prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening for prostate cancer in all men (grade D). Instead, it endorsed individual decision-making for men aged 55 to 69 years (grade C).

- **Objective**: To evaluate changes in rates of PSA testing after revisions in the USPSTF guideline on prostate cancer screening.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This retrospective cohort study used deidentified claims data from Blue Cross Blue Shield beneficiaries aged 40 to 89 years from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2019.

- **Exposures**: Publication of the USPSTF's draft (April 2017) and final (May 2018) recommendation on prostate cancer screening.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Age-adjusted rates of PSA testing in bimonthly periods were calculated. PSA testing rates from calendar years before (January 1 to December 31, 2016) and after (January 1 to December 31, 2019) the guideline change were compared. Interrupted time series analyses were used to evaluate the association of the draft (April 2017) and published (May 2018) USPSTF guideline with rates of PSA testing. Changes in rates of PSA testing were further evaluated among beneficiaries within the age categories reflected in the guideline: 40 to 54 years, 55 to 69 years, and 70 to 89 years.

- **Results**: The median number of eligible beneficiaries for each bimonthly period was 8,087,565 (range, 6,407,602–8,747,308), and the median age of all included eligible beneficiaries was 53 years (IQR, 47–59).

### Screening for prostate cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^111rsE6o]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prostate cancer, particularly with respect to indications for screening in the general population aged 55–69 years, the USPSTF 2018 guidelines recommend individualizing the decision to obtain screening. This should involve a discussion of the potential benefits and harms based on family history, race/ethnicity, comorbid medical conditions, patient values regarding the benefits and harms of screening, treatment-specific outcomes, and other health needs. It is important to recognize that screening offers a small potential benefit of reducing the chance of death from prostate cancer in some males within this age group. However, many men may experience potential harms of screening, including false-positive results requiring additional testing and possible prostate biopsy, overdiagnosis and overtreatment, and treatment complications such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Screening should not be conducted in individuals who do not express a preference for it.

### Screening for prostate cancer [^1128MRcj]. Lancet (2003). Low credibility.

Epidemiologically, screening is justified by the importance of the disease and the lack of prospects for primary prevention, but evidence from natural history is unhelpful since men are more likely to die with, rather than from, prostate cancer. The available screening tests do not always detect men whose lesions could result in future morbidity or mortality. Evidence is limited for the benefits of treatment for localized cancers detected through screening, whereas the evidence for harm is clear. Observational evidence for the effect of population screening programs is mixed, with no clear association between the intensity of screening and reduced prostate cancer mortality. Screening for prostate cancer cannot be justified in low-risk populations, but the balance of benefit and harm will be more favorable after risk stratification. Prostate cancer screening can be justified only in research programs designed to assess its effectiveness and help identify the groups who may benefit.

### Screening for prostate cancer: Evidence, ongoing trials, policies and knowledge gaps [^113kUB9u]. BMJ Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Long-term screening with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and systematic prostate biopsies can reduce prostate cancer mortality but leads to unacceptable overdiagnosis. Over the past decade, diagnostic methods have improved, and the indolent nature of low-grade prostate cancer has been established. These advances now enable more selective detection of potentially lethal prostate cancer. This non-systematic review summarizes relevant diagnostic advances, previous and ongoing screening trials, healthcare policies, and important remaining knowledge gaps.

- **Evidence synthesis**: The strong association between low serum PSA values and minimal long-term risk of prostate cancer death allows for adjusting screening intervals. The use of risk calculators, biomarkers, and MRI to select men with a raised PSA value for biopsy and lesion-targeting, rather than systematic prostate biopsies, reduces the detection of low-grade cancer and thereby overdiagnosis. These improvements recently led the European Union to recommend its member states to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of organized screening programmes for prostate cancer.

Nonetheless, important knowledge gaps remain, such as the performance of modern diagnostic methods in long-term screening programmes and their impact on mortality. These knowledge gaps are currently being addressed in three large randomized screening trials. Population-based pilot programmes will contribute critical practical experience.

### Screening for prostate cancer [^113Z4Xa3]. CA (2009). Low credibility.

In the United States, prostate cancer will affect 1 man in 6 during his lifetime. Since the mid-1980s, screening with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test has more than doubled the risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis. A decrease in prostate cancer death rates has been observed since that time, but the relative contribution of PSA testing, as opposed to other factors such as improved treatment, has been uncertain. The recent release of two large randomized trials suggests that if there is a benefit of screening, it is, at best, small. Methods to assess a man's risk of prostate cancer, including those tools that integrate multiple risk factors, are now available and should be used in risk assessment. Men undergoing screening for prostate cancer may reduce their risk of prostate cancer with finasteride.

### Reconciling primary care and specialist perspectives on prostate cancer screening [^111ZKczb]. Annals of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

When specialists propose screening guidelines for primary care clinicians to implement, differences in perspectives between the two groups can create conflicts. Two recent specialty organization guidelines illustrate this issue. The American Urological Association guideline panel and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend that average-risk men first be counseled about the risks and benefits of prostate-specific antigen screening for prostate cancer at age 40, rather than at the previously recommended age of 50 years. There is no direct evidence, however, that this recommendation has any impact on prostate cancer-specific mortality. To avoid distracting primary care clinicians from providing services with proven benefit and value for patients, professional organizations should follow appropriate standards for developing guidelines. Primary care societies and healthcare systems should also be encouraged to evaluate the evidence and decide whether implementing the recommendations is feasible and appropriate.
