## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to perform a RECIST evaluation, with explicit step-by-step logic and self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about baseline setup and measurable disease definition. Then, I should select and document target versus non-target lesions. Next, I will establish baseline measurements and timing. After that, I will reassess on-treatment using RECIST 1.1 thresholds, with contingency plans for immunotherapy and special populations. Finally, I should review documentation, adjudication, limitations, and when to use alternatives like iRECIST, mRECIST, Choi, or PERCIST, while considering ctDNA and real-world considerations.

> Let me first confirm the baseline setup. RECIST 1.1 requires that the baseline scan be obtained within 4 weeks before treatment initiation, with standardized imaging protocols across timepoints and sites to reduce variability. Modality and technique should be consistent throughout, and image quality should be optimized because artifacts and suboptimal acquisition can misclassify lesions at baseline and bias follow-up comparisons [^notfound] [^116cjFuF].

> I need to define measurable versus non-measurable disease. Measurable lesions are generally non-nodal lesions with longest diameter ≥ 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with short axis ≥ 15 mm; non-measurable disease includes lesions < 10 mm, nodes 10– < 15 mm short axis, purely osteoblastic bone lesions, cystic or necrotic lesions, leptomeningeal disease, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, and other non-quantifiable sites, so I should document which lesions fall into each category before proceeding [^112535VH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about which lesions to pick. I should select up to five target lesions, no more than two per organ, that are measurable, representative of disease distribution, and most reproducible to measure; lymph nodes must be measured on the short axis, and I should avoid selecting cavitating lesions as targets when possible, documenting the rationale if I must include them [^112535VH]. Wait, let me verify the impact of baseline selection variability: inter-reader differences in choosing equivocal lesions can drive discrepancies in response and progression, especially when few targets exist, so I should be conservative and transparent in ambiguous cases and align with trial-specific reading rules or adjudication pathways [^112moqo1] [^113c7Da5] [^116cjFuF].

> Next, I should review non-target lesions. All remaining measurable and non-measurable lesions are designated non-targets. I will record their presence and status qualitatively, because unequivocal progression of non-targets contributes to overall progression, and I need to ensure I do not overcall subtle changes that could reflect measurement noise or pseudo-progression [^112535VH] [^116cjFuF].

> I will now examine baseline measurements. For each target lesion, I should measure the longest diameter on axial imaging when feasible, using consistent windowing and planes, and for nodes use the short axis; I will double-check that the same measurement methodology is used at follow-up to minimize variability, and I will document the sum of diameters as the baseline tumor burden reference [^112535VH]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to measure on coronal or sagittal planes for convenience, but I should correct that to axial whenever possible to align with RECIST conventions and improve reproducibility across readers and timepoints [^112535VH].

> Let me consider timing and consistency for reassessment. Follow-up scans should follow the trial or institutional schedule, typically every 6–12 weeks, using the same modality, contrast protocol, and reconstruction parameters; if I must switch modality, I should document justification and anticipate potential measurement discordance that could confound response assignment [^notfound].

> Now, I will apply RECIST 1.1 response thresholds. Complete response is the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of nodes to < 10 mm short axis. Partial response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of target diameters from baseline. Progressive disease is at least a 20% increase and ≥ 5 mm absolute increase from nadir or the appearance of new lesions. Stable disease is neither PR nor PD, and I should confirm that I am using nadir, not baseline, for PD calculations to avoid misclassification [^112535VH]. I should double-check that any new lesion is unequivocally new and not a previously unmeasured or resolving lesion to prevent false progression calls [^116cjFuF].

> But wait, what if this is immunotherapy where pseudoprogression can occur. I need to check whether iRECIST is specified in the protocol. If so, I should label an initial progression as unconfirmed progressive disease, confirm on a subsequent scan 4–8 weeks later, and only call it confirmed progressive disease if progression persists or new lesions appear, while allowing that apparent progression may later convert to response as immune control emerges [^111FKuCy] [^116DpH2U]. Hold on, I should verify that clinical status is integrated; deterioration in performance status should temper a decision to attribute apparent growth to pseudoprogression, and I should document that judgment explicitly [^111FKuCy].

> I will now examine special populations and disease-specific criteria. For hepatocellular carcinoma treated with locoregional or systemic therapy, mRECIST measuring arterial enhancement changes is recommended as a secondary assessment alongside RECIST 1.1. For GIST on imatinib, Choi criteria incorporating size and density outperform size alone. For lymphoma, Lugano classification with PET-CT is preferred. And for pediatric disease, I should recognize that strict RECIST may underestimate burden and consider adapted approaches where appropriate [^116bX2Cb] [^115oc2XY] [^112BAhLh] [^11568fgx]. Let me reconsider bone-only disease as well; purely blastic bone lesions are non-measurable by RECIST, so I should document them as non-targets and consider alternative criteria or clinical correlation for progression [^112535VH].

> Next, I should review documentation and quality assurance. I need to record lesion selection rationale, measurement values, and response category with clear justification, and in trials with blinded independent central review, I should anticipate double reads with adjudication for discordance; I should also track discrepancy rates and provide feedback to readers to reduce variability over time [^116cjFuF] [^113c7Da5]. Hold on, I should verify that my reports include the exact planes, window settings, and any deviations from protocol so that follow-up assessments remain comparable and auditable [^112535VH].

> I need to ensure I communicate limitations and alternatives. RECIST 1.1 is a size-based surrogate that may not capture early molecular or functional responses; volumetric methods, metabolic imaging with PERCIST, and especially early ctDNA kinetics may detect treatment effects weeks before size changes, but these require standardized assays and prospective validation before routine adoption or regulatory integration [^111mkYtq] [^114Q5TM6] [^117Si1Gu]. Let me double-check that any exploratory biomarkers are collected alongside RECIST rather than replacing it, to preserve comparability and enable correlation analyses [^1121mA4Q].

> Finally, I should review real-world applicability. Real-world RECIST assessments are feasible but often hampered by inconsistent imaging schedules, missing priors, and nonstandardized reports. Physician-recorded responses tend to overestimate complete responses compared with centrally adjudicated RECIST, so I should preferentially extract measurements from reports or images when possible and align follow-up cadence with trial norms to improve validity [^113ucH8g] [^1115XuGW] [^1115dPBE]. Hold on, I should verify that my local practice documents the same modality and planes over time and that multidisciplinary review is available for ambiguous cases to mitigate bias and improve clinical decision-making [^116LgtF4].

A RECIST evaluation is a standardized, imaging-based method to assess tumor response in solid tumors, using unidimensional measurements and defined thresholds for **complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD)** [^112535VH]. It requires baseline identification of up to five **measurable target lesions (≤ 2 per organ)** and serial imaging at consistent intervals, with response confirmed on repeat scans. RECIST 1.1 is widely used in clinical trials and practice, but has limitations with **immunotherapy (pseudoprogression)** [^111FKuCy], targeted agents, and non-measurable disease; iRECIST and disease-specific criteria (mRECIST, Choi) are used when appropriate [^115oc2XY] [^116bX2Cb]. Inter-reader variability and baseline lesion selection can affect outcomes, so standardized protocols and expert review are essential [^116cjFuF] [^112moqo1].

## Historical development and evolution

- **WHO criteria (1979)**: Bidimensional measurements; limitations in consistency and reproducibility [^112b8Z66].
- **RECIST 1.0 (2000)**: Unidimensional measurements; standardized lesion selection and response categories [^115fhn3Z].
- **RECIST 1.1 (2009)**: Reduced target lesions to five (≤ 2 per organ); clarified lymph node assessment; added absolute size change for PD [^1156UPBQ].

---

## Core principles and methodology

### Baseline assessment

During baseline assessment, **target lesions** are the up to five measurable lesions (≤ 2 per organ) with a longest diameter ≥ 10 mm (lymph nodes ≥ 15 mm short axis) [^112535VH]. Non-target lesions are all other lesions, including non-measurable disease (e.g. bone, leptomeningeal, cystic) [^112535VH].

---

### Response categories

| **Response category** | **Definition** |
|-|-|
| Complete response (CR) | Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; lymph nodes < 10 mm short axis |
| Partial response (PR) | ≥ 30% decrease in sum of target lesion diameters from baseline |
| Stable disease (SD) | Neither PR nor PD criteria met |
| Progressive disease (PD) | ≥ 20% increase in sum of target diameters from nadir (≥ 5 mm absolute) or new lesions |

---

### Confirmation of response

Confirmation of response requires that **PR/CR be confirmed on repeat imaging ≥ 4 weeks after initial assessment** to ensure durability [^112qP6o6].

---

## Clinical applications

- **Clinical trials**: Standard endpoint for efficacy; enables cross-trial comparisons [^116h4Tth].
- **Clinical practice**: Guides treatment decisions and monitoring [^116LgtF4].
- **Regulatory approval**: Supports drug approvals and labeling [^115gCF8N].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Immunotherapy**: Pseudoprogression can misclassify early progression; iRECIST addresses this [^116DpH2U].
- **Targeted therapies**: Size may not reflect efficacy; mRECIST and Choi criteria are alternatives [^115oc2XY] [^111dmcPm].
- **Non-measurable disease**: Bone, brain, and cystic lesions limit applicability [^112535VH] [^113jkfcx] [^116rGZ8r].
- **Inter-reader variability**: Baseline selection and measurement differences affect outcomes [^116cjFuF] [^112moqo1].

---

## Modifications and alternative criteria

- **iRECIST**: Immune-specific criteria with unconfirmed/progressed PD and confirmation of progression [^111dmcPm] [^116DpH2U].
- **mRECIST**: For HCC, uses arterial enhancement changes [^111dmcPm].
- **Choi criteria**: For GIST, combines size and density changes [^111dmcPm].
- **PERCIST**: PET-based metabolic response assessment [^111mkYtq].

---

## Recent advances and future directions

Recent advances include **integration of functional imaging (PET, MRI) to capture metabolic/vascular changes** [^111mkYtq] [^113AcFmp] and exploration of **ctDNA for early, noninvasive response assessment** [^117Si1Gu] [^114Q5TM6]. Efforts also focus on **reducing inter-reader variability and standardizing imaging protocols** [^116cjFuF] [^112535VH].

RECIST is a cornerstone of oncologic response assessment, providing a standardized framework for clinical trials and practice. Its limitations with modern therapies and non-measurable disease are addressed by iRECIST, mRECIST, Choi, and PERCIST, and ongoing advances in functional imaging and ctDNA are shaping the future of response evaluation.

### Liquid biopsy response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (LB-RECIST) [^114V5Dsy]. Annals of Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Current evaluation of treatment response in solid tumors depends on dynamic changes in tumor diameters as measured by imaging. However, these changes can only be detected when there are enough macroscopic changes in tumor volume, which limits the usability of radiological response criteria in evaluating earlier stages of disease response and necessitates much time to lapse for gross changes to be notable. One promising approach is to incorporate dynamic changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), which occur early in the course of therapy and can predict tumor responses weeks before gross size changes manifest. However, several issues need to be addressed before recommending the implementation of ctDNA response criteria in daily clinical practice such as clinical, biological, and regulatory challenges and, most importantly, the need to standardize/harmonize detection methods and ways to define ctDNA response and/or progression for precision oncology. Herein, we review the use of liquid biopsy (LB) to evaluate response in solid tumors and propose a plan toward standardization of LB-RECIST.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for non-small cell lung cancer, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response (non-genotype-driven therapy), ESMO 2023 guidelines recommend to use the RECIST formally in case of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Consider using immune-related RECIST, immunotherapy RECIST 11, and immune-mRECIST in the overall assessment of therapy, recognizing that they have not been validated.

Recap on baseline variability as a risk factor in clinical trials

Baseline selection variability

The RECIST guidelines allow some measure of freedom in the selection of targets.

In addition to equivocal lesions as shown in Fig. 1 for a given disease presentation, there exists a wide variety of lesion selection patterns, all complying with RECIST recommendations (Fig. 2).

Fig. 1

We illustrate 3 different types of baseline lesion selection that can be considered as errors and that deviate from RECIST guidance: a if no NTL have been selected; b if the smallest Target Lesions have been selected instead of the largest; c if only 1 TL has been selected while 2 were measurable. We illustrate 3 different lesion poolings that can be considered as variations from the ideal selection without deviating from the RECIST guidelines: d if NTL lesions are grouped inside an organ; e if different TL are chosen within the largest lesions; f if fewer NTL are selected considering the evaluation as categorial and qualitative even though, preferably, they should all be recorded but practically it is not always possible.

### RECIST 1.1 and lesion selection: how to deal with ambiguity at baseline? [^114dz96o]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Baseline oncologic evaluations are critical procedures as target selection determines the quality of the overall review. The RECIST workgroup published a method and recommendations for the selection of targets and non-targets in order to obtain accurate, reproducible and representative information regarding disease extension. However, this selection and categorization process varies from one reader to another, one reason for this variability being the equivocal status of some lesions.

In oncologic follow-up, equivocal lesions can be defined as lesions for which the radiologist is unsure whether they effectively correspond to the designated malignant disease.

Indeed, a given radiologic semiology is not specific to a single malignant etiology and some abnormalities may be artifactual or linked to transient nonmalignant disease (e.g. adverse effect, inflammation). In addition, ground truth (i.e. biopsy) is often unavailable for such images.

In practice, radiologists might, or might not, include equivocal lesions in their initial RECIST pool of lesions. In this study, we define these two approaches used by radiologists as non-conservative and conservative, respectively. This mode of decision-making is therefore subjective.

The goal of this paper is to provide insights for radiologists faced with equivocal baseline abnormalities and to raise awareness of the potential risks arising from such situations regarding the outcome of clinical trials using the RECIST evaluation technique.

In short, we aim to answer the following question: "When radiologists are confronted with a tumor which they cannot identify with certainty as a malignancy, should they register it in any case in order to avoid omitting a lesion when evaluating the initial disease?".

In the specific context of clinical research, we will first recapitulate the problem raised by the variability of baseline assessments. Second, we will document the notion of equivocal lesions and discuss the factors contributing to their ambiguity. Third, we will analyze the risks resulting from the inclusion of non-malignant lesions in the pool of targets relative to RECIST longitudinal assessment. Lastly, we will suggest recommendations for baseline target selection in the context of clinical trials.

### RECIST 1.1 assessments variability: a systematic pictorial review of blinded double reads [^112wcwYH]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

RECIST variability in initial disease evaluation

The literature suggests that a large contribution to the response discrepancies is due to a difference in the definition of the disease at the baseline.

We illustrate hereafter the 3 causes of this baseline-derived variability.

Ill-defined tumor selection criteria (Fig. 1)

Whereas RECIST gives clear selection rules for analyzing the disease at baseline, the cancer presentation however may be multi-metastatic so the choice of TL/NTLs, number, and distribution may vary between radiologists without infringing these rules. Consequently, the "insufficient" whole disease representativity of the selection leads to response variability.

Fig. 1
Acceptable reader variability of baseline selection considering RECIST 1.1 guidelines. The purpose of the baseline selection guideline is to standardize a fashion to best represent the disease by selecting the maximum and largest lesions (a). However, for practical use, the RECIST 1.1 criteria include room for variability in baseline assessment by limiting the number of target lesions (in red) to 2 per organ and 5 in total. Then, for patients with multiple lesions, there is a compliant inter-reader variability in the assessment (b, f, g). Besides the maximum number of lesions a justifiable reason such as equivocality of the finding, robustness of the measurement, or information about previously irradiated lesion must explain the variability but at the same time challenge the representativity goal of the selection task (c, d, e)

Reader non-compliance with criteria (Fig. 2)

A non-compliance to the criteria's rules of selection or measurability may be explained by a poor knowledge of the guidelines (Fig. 1), or occasionally by a flawed selection due to a lack of expertise in cancer imaging (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Baseline discrepancy caused by a lack of training. The lack of knowledge is not a frequent provider of variability between readers however often it results in errors of guidance when the reader does not master the criteria and selects bone blastic lesions as measurable lesions (a) or cavitary lesions while some more robust lesions for measurement is available (b). Rarely, the selection wrongly includes an unequivocally benign lesion due to a radiologist's lack of knowledge such as the adrenal myelolipoma containing fat (c)

### Response criteria for intraocular retinoblastoma: RB-RECIST [^114WDPg5]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Standardized guidelines for assessing tumor response to therapy are essential for designing and conducting clinical trials. The Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) provide radiological standards for assessment of solid tumors. However, no such guidelines exist for the evaluation of intraocular cancer, and ocular oncology clinical trials have largely relied on indirect measures of therapeutic response-such as progression-free survival-to evaluate the efficacy of treatment agents. Herein, we propose specific criteria for evaluating treatment response of retinoblastoma, the most common pediatric intraocular cancer, and emphasize a multimodal imaging approach for comprehensive assessment of retinoblastoma tumors in clinical trials.

### Tumour growth kinetics assessment: added value to RECIST in cancer patients treated with molecularly targeted agents [^112oFkG9]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Cytotoxic agents used in the metastatic setting aim at prolonging survival and/or improving the quality of life of cancer patients. In these situations, patients are usually treated until disease progression. Tumour shrinkage has classically been considered to reflect the efficacy of cytotoxic agents early, given their direct action on the cell division machinery. End points based on the size of target lesions, such as the WHO criteria and RECIST, have been developed in order to standardise the evaluation of anticancer agents. Patients with advanced disease who fail standard therapy often have rapid disease progression leading to death. However, the velocity of tumour progression might be quite heterogeneous not only across tumour types but also across patients suffering from the same tumour type, owing to different tumoural biological characteristics.

As opposed to cytotoxic agents, molecularly targeted agents (MTAs) do not always induce tumour shrinkage, but sometimes only tumour stabilisation, which has led to the use alternate end points such as clinical benefit (defined as the addition of objective response and tumour stabilisation) or progression-free survival (PFS). However, criteria such as RECIST reduce the information by classifying treatment effect into only four categories (complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease). In addition, these criteria are defined irrespective of tumour growth kinetics before treatment, and might therefore not be relevant in slow-growing diseases and for the agents that induce only tumour stabilisation.

New designs have been proposed to circumvent this caveat, including the randomised discontinuation trial or the use of PFS ratio. Although these latter designs take tumour growth kinetics on- and off-treatment into account for assessing efficacy, they are still based on RECIST that classify treatment effect into the only four categories described above.

We sought to evaluate whether the evaluation of tumour growth kinetics before and during treatment would add value to RECIST in patients treated with MTAs in order to determine whether some patients, in the absence of therapeutic alternative, have discontinued therapy early because of disease progression although tumour growth kinetics had been slown down.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) consensus definitions for resistance to combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy [^112ZDZ1L]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Primary resistance is considered a lack of benefit with initial treatment and the consensus was that any progression within 6 months of initiating therapy should be included, irrespective of the initial response. It was acknowledged that a complete response (CR) followed by recurrence within the first 6 months of therapy likely would not represent primary resistance, however this scenario is expected to be very rare. The definitions of resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy required documented progressive disease, stable disease, partial response and CR assessed as described in the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors v1.1 (RECIST v1.1). There was hesitation in anchoring the definitions to formal evaluation by RECIST for the definitions of resistance, especially for patients who were initially treated with ICI–chemotherapy combinations in the standard-of-care setting where RECIST is not expected to be a component of routine clinical documentation. Acknowledging the tension between evaluating homogenous patient populations in clinical trials and establishing insurmountably stringent enrollment criteria, there was consensus that documented progression by RECIST is preferred for the definitions of resistance. There was also consensus that the definitions should include patients who experience clinical deterioration without evidence of radiographic progression. Given the relative rarity of pseudoprogression with cytotoxic therapy and a desire to avoid unnecessarily burdensome enrollment criteria in future clinical trials, confirmatory scans were deemed to be not required to define primary resistance.

Currently, there was consensus that it is not possible to identify the contribution of components to primary resistance based on this clinical definition alone. Even in cases where one of the drugs is exchanged for an agent of a different class and response occurs, it is not possible to rule out lingering effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy nor delayed effects of ICIsnor antagonism between the agents when administered concurrently. There was also acknowledgment that the 6-month cut-off may not be appropriate for slow-growing malignancies. Finally, given that these definitions are not intended to be used as guidelines for clinical management, there was acknowledgment that there may be patients that obtain clinical benefit when treatment is continued beyond progression in cases that would be captured under this definition of primary resistance.

### Evaluation of the response to treatment of solid tumours-a consensus statement of the international cancer imaging society [^113pAMF1]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

The RECIST criteria aim to replace bidimensional assessment of one or more target lesions with summation of unidimensional assessments of many lesions: up to five in a single organ; up to 10 in total. These measurements aim simply to reflect categories of treatment response as defined in the WHO criteria. The application of serial arithmetic assessment of the RECIST criteria corresponds well with those of WHO within the category of partial response. However, comparison of the unidimensional method (RECIST) and the bidimensional method (WHO) is discrepant for progressive disease. The RECIST criterion of 20% increase in length to indicate progressive disease (PD) does not equate to the 25% increase as judged by the WHO criteria. Indeed a 20% increase in a unidimensional measurement using the RECIST criterion equates to a 44% increase in bidimensional measurement. This discrepancy is partially discussed within the new guidelines, as a concern related to the difficulty of measuring lesions that increase by 12% unidimensionally (mathematically corresponding to the original bidimensional WHO 25%). However, the difficulty or impact of the change in response assessment for disease progression was not proven or justified in the guidelines. Clearly, such a discrepancy will arguably result in longer periods of progression-free disease and specifically in changes in time to progression between new trials using the RECIST criteria and those using WHO criteria.

### Comparison of solid tumor treatment response observed in clinical practice with response reported in clinical trials [^113ucH8g]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Real-world data provides an opportunity to gain valuable insight into the clinical effectiveness and safety associated with oncology drugs in a broader patient population than that enrolled in clinical trials, under the less structured and stringent real-world circumstances of clinical practice. Interest in real-world data to generate efficacy data associated with oncology drugs has increased significantly in recent years as real-world evidence is increasingly accepted as a complement to randomized clinical trials in supporting regulatory approval for new drug indications. As a result, there is increasing interest in determining the validity and practicality of estimating traditional efficacy end points for oncology drugs in routine clinical settings. This is a critical need, as less than 5% of adult patients with cancer in the United States participate in clinical trials, and the patients that do are younger, healthier, and less diverse.

In clinical trials supporting the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of oncology drugs, the most common primary end point over the past few years has been response rate, followed by progression-free survival. To estimate solid tumor response, or progression of disease, the predominant standard used in oncology clinical trials is Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). These guidelines require serial imaging: a baseline or pretreatment assessment and interval posttreatment assessments for response or progression, with protocol-specified frequency and radiologic modality. Such a rigid structure can be challenging to replicate with real-world data, for which imaging is performed at variable frequencies, using a variety of different diagnostic modalities, at differing sites of care, and interpreted by different radiologists.

Owing to these complexities, some studies using real-world data rely on the treating physician's assessment of tumor response, as recorded in the narrative of the patients' electronic health records (EHRs), using manual or technology-enabled (eg, natural language processing) EHR abstraction, as the measure of clinical outcomes. Alternatively, some real-world data researchers elect to evaluate more easily obtained surrogate end points, such as time to treatment failure or time to treatment discontinuation (ie, the length of time from treatment initiation to treatment discontinuation for any reason). These options have significant limitations, as physicians' estimates of tumor response may be subject to bias and surrogate end points may not be directly comparable to clinical trial end points.

### Objective assessment of tumour response to therapy based on tumour growth kinetics [^111q6ySG]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Assessment of tumour response (TR) to therapy is necessary for evaluation of the efficacy of novel anticancer drugs in clinical trials. Furthermore, response evaluation with high individual precision may facilitate individualised therapy rather than standardised treatment regimen in daily clinical practice.

Tumour shrinkage has been traditionally used as a measure of treatment efficacy. For example, the response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) is currently adopted by academic and industrial groups, where response to therapy is categorised as follows: complete response (CR), the disappearance of all target lesions; partial response (PR), at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of all target lesions; progressive disease (PD), at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of all target lesions or the appearance of one or more new lesions; and stable disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. Appropriateness of RECIST criteria, for example, whether the change in tumour size is a proper end point for response assessment, has been widely discussed. The specific criteria have been developed for different types of cancers, for example, prostate cancer and malignant lymphoma. However, this study was focused only on quantification of TR to therapy, regardless of the type of tumour and clinical measures other than tumour response.

### RECIST 1.1 and lesion selection: how to deal with ambiguity at baseline? [^113rkFss]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Quantification of the impact

A mathematical simulation was performed to quantify the impact of an inappropriate selection of NMTL within the selected target pool at baseline. We hypothesized that at least one unequivocal target lesion was also selected.

Our simulation relied on the Eq. 1 below (details are provided in the annex).whereis the percentage of change between baseline and a given follow up time-point, is the proportion of NMTL in the total SoD at baseline, is the required percentage change of malignant TL proportion to reachat the given follow up time-point.

Figure 3 a shows that RECIST guidelines mitigate the risk of selecting NMTL when they do not constitute more than 20% of the total SoD. If the targets are approximately the same size, then including one equivocal lesion out of the 5 targets, as recommended by RECIST 1.1, will not have a major impact. Indeed, the remaining target threshold for Progressive Disease (PD) or Partial Response (PR) is not extremely different, i.e. respectively + 25% (vs 20%) and − 37% (vs-30%). However, as the NMTL forms part of the target pool, a complete response will be prevented from occurring.

Fig. 3
Mathematical simulation of the proportional change of real malignant target lesions (TL) to trigger progression or response according to RECIST 1.1 thresholds in accordance with the proportion of non-malignant inactive lesions within the tumor burden. a For the Sum of Diameter thresholds corresponding to a progressive disease + 20% (red) and to a partial response − 30% (blue), we plotted the proportional change of the malignant part of the tumor burden at a given time point with respect to the proportion of inactive tumors in the tumor burden at baseline. We noted that the curve steepens from a proportion of about 50% of inactive lesions while the impact is limited to 20% of NMTL pooled in the tumor burden. b For the Sum of Diameter thresholds corresponding to a progressive disease, we simulated the needed change of malignant target to trigger a progression from baseline (red) (similar to a) and nadir20 (dark red) after a 20% PR. This scenario decreases even more the sensitivity of the RECIST assessment to capture progression

### ESR essentials: response assessment criteria in oncologic imaging-practice recommendations by the European society of oncologic imaging [^115oc2XY]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Key recommendations

Response evaluation criteria should be used in pharmaceutical clinical trials testing new drugs or treatment strategies. They may, however, also be used in clinical practice as a framework guiding image interpretation to provide consistent evaluations of tumor response across readers.
RECIST 1.1 criteria should be used for solid tumors treated by systemic therapies and remain the reference standard in pharmaceutical clinical trials (level of evidence Ib).
Specific criteria should be used for some tumors/therapies. iRECIST are exploratory criteria that should be collected in addition to RECIST 1.1 in clinical trials evaluating immune-based therapies (level of evidence Ib). mRECIST should be used to evaluate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated by focal or targeted therapies (level of evidence IV). Choi criteria should be used on CT to evaluate the response of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) to imatinib exclusively (level of evidence II).

### ESR essentials: response assessment criteria in oncologic imaging-practice recommendations by the European society of oncologic imaging [^111dmcPm]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Assessing the response to oncological treatments is paramount for determining the prognosis and defining the best treatment for each patient. Several biomarkers, including imaging, can be used, but standardization is fundamental for consistency and reliability. Tumor response evaluation criteria have been defined by international groups for application in pharmaceutical clinical trials evaluating new drugs or therapeutic strategies. RECIST 1.1 criteria are exclusively based on unidimensional lesion measurements; changes in tumor size are used as surrogate imaging biomarkers to correlate with patient outcomes. However, increased tumor size does not always reflect tumor progression. The introduction of immunotherapy has led to the development of new criteria (iRECIST, Level of Evidence (LoE) Ib) that consider the possibility that an increase in disease burden is secondary to the immune response instead of progression, with the new concept of Unconfirmed Progressive Disease (a first progression event which must be confirmed on follow-up). Specific criteria were devised for HCC (mRECIST, LoE IV), which measure only enhancing HCC portions to account for changes after local therapy. For GIST treated with imatinib, criteria were developed to account for the possible increase in size reflecting a response rather than a progression by assessing both tumor size and density on CT (Choi, LoE II). This article provides concise and relevant practice recommendations aimed at general radiologists to help choose and apply the most appropriate criteria for assessing response to treatment in different oncologic scenarios. Though these criteria were developed for clinical trials, they may be applied in clinical practice as a guide for day-to-day interpretation. KEY POINTS: Response evaluation criteria, designed for use in clinical trials, might serve as a surrogate biomarker for overall survival. RECIST 1.1 defines measurable and non-measurable disease among which target lesions and non-target lesions are selected at baseline as reference for follow-ups. Some therapies and/or cancers require the use of different criteria, such as iRECIST, mRECIST, and Choi criteria.

### A European society of oncologic imaging (ESOI) survey on the radiological assessment of response to oncologic treatments in clinical practice [^113jEDS9]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Most radiologists measure lesions and lymph nodes on the axial plane, as recommended by RECIST 1.1. As for RECIST 1.1, most responders suggest measuring only the main lesions within each organ (63.6% of the cases) and a maximum of two lesions per organ (64.7%), following the selection criteria of target lesions, and to qualitatively evaluate diminutive and non-measurable findings, following the rules for non-target lesions.

According to RECIST 1.1 criteria, the baseline examination must be used as a comparator to define a stable, partial, or complete response to treatment and the nadir should be the reference to evaluate disease progression. Interestingly, in this survey, when deciding which of the previous studies should be considered as the comparator, responders expressed different opinions, some of which were controversial. Almost one third of responders affirmed that comparison should be performed only with the previous examination. In this regard, it must be noted that Weber et al. developed a structured reporting concept for general follow-up assessment of cancer patients in clinical routine, based on RECIST 1.1 principles, but including only the prior tumor measurements, a limitation that the authors considered in their paper. It is the opinion of the authors that even in daily routine, a proper tumor response evaluation should require a careful comparison not only between the current and prior examination but also with older examinations, to avoid evaluation errors, as in the case of slowly growing lesions. One of the reasons why RECIST 1.1 response rules are difficult to apply in routine practice is that patient history is not always readily available and collecting clinical and imaging data is a hard and time-consuming process, especially when health electronic records are not readily accessible. Collaboration between radiologists and referring oncologists in this context is mandatory, and we recommend that controversial cases be discussed within a multidisciplinary framework.

### Towards evidence-based response criteria for cancer immunotherapy [^114Q5TM6]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

However, imaging does not have to be the only way to determine tumor response. In this respect circulating tumor DNA has drawn a lot of attention. A systematic review, in which 18 trials were included, was performed to study changes in circulating tumor DNA and outcomes in solid tumors treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. It was concluded that in advanced solid tumors, a reduction in circulating tumor DNA levels in response to immune checkpoint inhibitors is associated with substantial improvements in outcome. Circulating tumor DNA change is an early response biomarker that may allow for a reduced frequency of cross-sectional imaging in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors.

The RECIST working group has held international, multidisciplinary meetings to further evaluate the potential role of radiomics and circulating tumor DNA in the evaluation of response, and not only in the case of immunotherapy, as a surrogate endpoint (Fig. 1). Currently, specific manuscripts to address the challenges and describe the potential pathway to implement them within RECIST response evaluation are underway (Fig. 1). One of the main strengths of RECIST is its broad applicability and scalability through different tumor types, across clinical trials, and across centers in clinical trials. However, tumor types where standard response criteria have limitations, have tumor-specific response criteria, such as the inclusion of bone scansfor prostate cancer with often bone disease. Even if not broadly incorporated, one could envision the addition of emerging technologies in a subset of patients or in situations where RECIST has limitations. Once again, for these or other new technologies to be incorporated into response criteria in a validated manner, encouraging data sharing is important.

### Evaluation of the response to treatment of solid tumours-a consensus statement of the international cancer imaging society [^112Rj1DF]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

New guidelines to evaluate the response to treatment in solid tumours were published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in February 2000. These new criteria were developed by a task force set up by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the United States and the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group in an attempt to address areas of conflict and inconsistency between different methods of assessing response used in clinical research throughout the world. It was hoped that these new criteria and guidelines for their use would provide a standardised practical approach, which could be adopted uniformly on a wide scale. In defining the new Response Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST), the group have recognised the pivotal role of imaging in response assessment. They have acknowledged the need for continuous appraisal of rapidly advancing imaging technology and are aware of the need to develop functional imaging to provide surrogate end points for 'novel' therapies. We applaud the reappraisal of guidelines for therapy response assessment, especially in the light of the rapid advances in medical imaging technology and oncologic therapies. We are also grateful for the attempt to standardise techniques in imaging included in RECIST; however, these new criteria and guidelines have major limitations as well as important implications for diagnostic radiological workload. In this communication, we address our concerns regarding the use of the RECIST criteria.

### RECIST 1.1 for response evaluation apply not only to chemotherapy-treated patients but also to targeted cancer agents: a pooled database analysis [^114eBp5N]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The mode of action of targeted cancer agents (TCAs) differs from classic chemotherapy, which leads to concerns about the role of RECIST in evaluating tumor response in trials with TCAs. We investigated the performance of RECIST using a pooled database from 50 clinical trials with at least one TCA.

Methods

We examined the impact of the number of target lesions (TLs) on within-patient variability of tumor response. The prognostic effect of TL response (at 12 weeks or on study on the basis of a maximum five TLs) on survival was studied through landmark and time-dependent Cox models adjusted for baseline tumor load, occurrence of new lesions, or unequivocal progression of nontarget disease.

Results

Data were obtained from 23,259 patients with cancer (36% lung, 28% colorectal, 11% breast, and 25% other); 15,620 received TCAs, predominantly transduction or angiogenesis inhibitors, as a single agent (37%), combined with other TCAs (7%), or as chemotherapy (56%); 28% received chemotherapy only; and 5% received best supportive care or placebo. A total of 17,222 patients contributed to the analyses. Within-patient variability decreased with increasing number of TLs, similarly for TCAs (with/without chemotherapy) and chemotherapy only. Mixed responses occurred proportionally in all treatment classes. Landmark analyses showed an ordinal relationship between percentage change from baseline to 12 weeks and overall survival, and demonstrated a clear distinction between tumor shrinkage and progressive disease according to RECIST. Time-dependent analysis showed no marked improvement in the ability to predict survival on the basis of TL tumor growth compared with nontarget progression or new lesion occurrence, regardless of treatment. Similar results were seen for major tumor types and different classes of TCAs.

Conclusion

This work reinforces that RECIST version 1.1 perform well for response assessment of TCAs.

### RECIST 1.1 assessments variability: a systematic pictorial review of blinded double reads [^116cjFuF]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Reader variability is intrinsic to radiologic oncology assessments, necessitating measures to enhance consistency and accuracy. RECIST 1.1 criteria play a crucial role in mitigating this variability by standardizing evaluations, aiming to establish an accepted "truth" confirmed by histology or patient survival. Clinical trials utilize Blind Independent Centralized Review (BICR) techniques to manage variability, employing double reads and adjudicators to address inter-observer discordance effectively. It is essential to dissect the root causes of variability in response assessments, with a specific focus on the factors influencing RECIST evaluations. We propose proactive measures for radiologists to address variability sources such as radiologist expertise, image quality, and accessibility of contextual information, which significantly impact interpretation and assessment precision. Adherence to standardization and RECIST guidelines is pivotal in diminishing variability and ensuring uniform results across studies. Variability factors, including lesion selection, new lesion appearance, and confirmation bias, can have profound implications on assessment accuracy and interpretation, underscoring the importance of identifying and addressing these factors. Delving into the causes of variability aids in enhancing the accuracy and consistency of response assessments in oncology, underscoring the role of standardized evaluation protocols and mitigating risk factors that contribute to variability. Access to contextual information is crucial. CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: By understanding the causes of diagnosis variability, we can enhance the accuracy and consistency of response assessments in oncology, ultimately improving patient care and clinical outcomes. KEY POINTS: Baseline lesion selection and detection of new lesions play a major role in the occurrence of discordance. Image interpretation is influenced by contextual information, the lack of which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Radiologists must be trained in RECIST criteria to reduce errors and variability.

### Tumor response assessment for precision cancer therapy: response evaluation criteria in solid tumors and beyond… [^112JCGzA]. ASCO (2018). Low credibility.

Evaluation of tumor response to therapy and incorporation of the results in the practice of clinical oncology provide the basis for advances in cancer treatment. 1Imaging plays a critical role for objectively characterizing tumor response to therapy and defining trial endpoints for novel agents. 2RECIST, introduced in 2000 and revised in 2009, has been widely used as a standardized method for tumor response assessment in the past two decades and has provided the basis for regulatory approvals for novel cancer therapy. 3, 4. Current Method of Tumor Response Evaluation Using RECIST RECIST version

1. 1 is the current version and is used as tumor response criteria in most trials of solid tumors in general. RECIST1. 1 uses unidimensional diameters of target lesions and the sum of measurements of all target lesions as a quantitative measure of tumor burden.

RECIST simply relies on unidimensional tumor size measurements for quantification of tumor burden, assuming that three-dimensional tumor volume burden is related to a planar measurement. However, in real life, tumors are heterogeneous in terms of growth rates and patterns within the same lesion, or among different lesions in one patient, where some lesions increase whereas others remain unchanged or decrease during therapy. 20, 21The Choi criteria are widely recognized and often used as a secondary guideline to evaluate tumor response and progression in the specific settings of antiangiogenic activity. 50The key features of irRC include requirement of confirmation of PD on two consecutive scans obtained at least 4 weeks apart and inclusion of new lesion measurements in the entire tumor burden, rather than defining PD at the appearance of new lesions.

50Subsequently, the studies by Nishino and colleagues showed that RECIST-based unidimensional measurements, as opposed to bidimensional measurements used in irRC, can characterize immune-related tumor responses with better reproducibility, while keeping the important features of irRC in terms of progression confirmation and new lesion assessment. Conclusion and Future Directions RECIST has been a simple and practical method for tumor response evaluations in the past decades and has provided a basis for the regulatory approvals of novel anticancer agents as the most widely accepted and standardized measure to objectively describe treatment results. Limitations of RECIST, both in general and in the specific settings of precision cancer therapy, should be recognized to address the pitfalls and apply alternate methods to overcome these limitations.

### Alternative response criteria (choi, European Association for the Study of the Liver, and modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors [RECIST]) versus RECIST 1.1 in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with sorafenib [^115179yK]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), may underestimate activity and does not predict survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with sorafenib. This study assessed the value of alternative radiological criteria to evaluate response in HCC patients treated with sorafenib.

Patients and Methods

A retrospective blinded central analysis was performed of computed tomography (CT) scans from baseline and the first tumor evaluation in consecutive patients treated with sorafenib over a 2-year period in a single institution. Four different evaluation criteria were used: Choi, European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), modified RECIST (mRECIST), and RECIST 1.1.

Results

Among 82 HCC patients, 64 with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B-C were evaluable with a median follow-up of 22 months. Median duration of sorafenib treatment was 5.7 months, and median overall survival was 12.8 months. At the time of the first CT scan, performed after a median of 2.1 months, Choi, EASL, mRECIST, and RECIST 1.1 identified 51%, 28%, 28%, and 3% objective responses, respectively. Responders by all criteria showed consistent overall survival > 20 months. Among patients with stable disease according to RECIST 1.1, those identified as responders by Choi had significantly better overall survival than Choi nonresponders (22.4 vs. 10.6 months; hazard ratio: 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.15–0.86, p = .0097).

Conclusion

Choi, EASL, and mRECIST criteria appear more appropriate than RECIST 1.1 to identify responders with long survival among advanced HCC patients benefiting from sorafenib.

### Change in tumor size by RECIST correlates linearly with overall survival in phase I oncology studies [^1129GyZZ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

RECIST is used to quantify tumor changes during exposure to anticancer agents. Responses are categorized as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD). Clinical trials dictate a patient's management options based on the category into which his or her response falls. However, the association between response and survival is not well studied in the early trial setting.

Patients and Methods

To study the correlation between response as quantified by RECIST and overall survival (OS, the gold-standard survival outcome), we analyzed 570 participants of 24 phase I trials conducted between October 2004 and May 2009, of whom 468 had quantifiable changes in tumor size. Analyses of Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS by response and null Martingale residuals of Cox models were the primary outcome measures. All analyses are landmark analyses.

Results

Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed strong associations between change in tumor size by RECIST and survival (P = 4.5 × 10⁻⁶ to < 1 × 10⁻⁸). The relationship was found to be near-linear (R² = 0.75 to 0.92) and confirmed by the residual analyses. No clear inflection points were found to exist in the relationship between tumor size changes and survival.

Conclusion

RECIST quantification of response correlates with survival, validating RECIST's use in phase I trials. However, the lack of apparent boundary values in the relationship between change in tumor size and OS demonstrates the arbitrary nature of the CR/PR/SD/PD categories and questions emphasis placed on this categorization scheme. Describing tumor responses as a continuous variable may be more informative than reporting categoric responses when evaluating novel anticancer therapies.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^116LgtF4]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Breast cancer — monitoring metastatic disease: Monitoring the treatment of metastatic breast cancer involves integrating several different forms of information to decide on treatment effectiveness and toxicity, including direct observations and patient-reported symptoms, performance status, change in weight, physical examination, laboratory tests (alkaline phosphatase, liver function, blood counts, calcium), radiographic and functional imaging, and tumor biomarkers; results are generally classified as response, continued response to treatment, stable disease, uncertainty regarding disease status, or progression of disease, and clinical judgment with patient input is critical. The NCCN Panel recommends using widely accepted criteria such as the RECIST criteria and the WHO criteria and recommends using the same method of response assessment over time; for example, an abnormality initially found on diagnostic CT scan of the chest should be monitored with repeat diagnostic CT scans of the chest. The optimal frequency of testing is uncertain and primarily based on monitoring strategies used in breast cancer clinical trials, and the Principles of Monitoring Metastatic Disease table outlines general recommendations for baseline assessments before new therapy, for monitoring cytotoxic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, and for assessment when there is evidence of progression.

### ESR essentials: response assessment criteria in oncologic imaging-practice recommendations by the European society of oncologic imaging [^114NqJYX]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Assessing treatment response represents an essential crossroad in oncology patient management as it establishes whether a specific treatment has been effective. In oncological trials, the most important and accurate indicator of treatment effectiveness is patient overall survival (OS). Unfortunately, identifying statistically significant differences in survival is costly as it requires extended follow-up. Additionally, patients will often undergo more lines of treatment, so it is important to assess the impact of the different lines of treatment. Various biomarkers are used as surrogate measures of OS, including imaging biomarkers. However, imaging response to a specific treatment and subsequent change in overall tumor burden can serve as surrogate endpoints only if based on standardized, widely accepted, and easily applicable evaluation criteria. The World Health Organization (WHO) published the first radiological response evaluation criteria in 1981 based on measuring tumor diameters. Since then, several criteria have been developed and adapted for specific tumor types and anticancer treatments. Imaging plays an integral part in oncological clinical trial design, and it is up to radiologists to be able to apply appropriate response criteria effectively during imaging interpretation (Fig. 1).

### Personalized tumor response assessment in the era of molecular medicine: cancer-specific and therapy-specific response criteria to complement pitfalls of RECIST [^1121YR1j]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to review cancer- and therapy-specific tumor response assessment criteria used in clinical trials and in practice, with illustrative case examples, and to discuss future directions toward "personalized" tumor response assessment.

Conclusion

Although Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors will remain as the primary generalized criteria for response assessment, newer cancer- and therapy-specific criteria will play an important role in providing state-of-the-art response assessment of tumor following molecular targeted therapy and will contribute to personalized cancer care in the era of molecular medicine.

### The clinical viewpoint: definitions, limitations of RECIST, practical considerations of measurement [^111Yzf3A]. Clinical Cancer Research (2013). Low credibility.

In selecting an endpoint in clinical trial design, it is important to consider that the endpoint is both reliably measured and clinically meaningful. As such, overall survival (OS) has traditionally been considered the most clinically relevant and convincing endpoint in clinical trial design as long as it is accompanied by preservation in quality of life. However, progression-free survival (PFS) is increasingly more prominent in clinical trial design because of feasibility issues (smaller sample sizes and shorter follow-up). PFS has the advantage of taking into account not only responsive disease, but stable disease as well, an issue of particular importance in the relapsed and refractory setting in which therapies are often associated with a minimal to nil response but may still confer a survival advantage. Finally, PFS has a significant advantage in molecularly selected populations, in whom OS advantages are difficult to detect due to the effects of crossover. With an understanding of the limitations and biases that are introduced with PFS as a primary endpoint, we believe that PFS is not only a viable but also a necessary alternative to OS in assessing the efficacy of selected novel-targeted therapies in molecularly defined cancer populations. Ultimately, the selection of a clinical trial endpoint should not be based on a one-size-fits all approach; rather, it should be based on the specifics of the therapeutic strategy being tested and the population under study.

FAQs on surrogate endpoints in oncology

How are various surrogate endpoints used in oncology trials defined?

Many surrogate endpoints have been used in oncology clinical trials and they can be classified in several ways- for example, surrogate endpoints in curative setting (neo-adjuvant and adjuvant), and those in advanced/metastatic settings (Table 1). For advanced settings, they can be sub-divided into tumor response endpoints and time-to-event endpoints. Table 1 gives the general definitions of some common surrogate endpoints used in oncology.

Table 1
Definitions of various surrogate endpoints used in oncology.

In advanced setting, overall response rates (ORR)–also referred to as objective response rates in the literature- and progression-free survival (PFS) are the most commonly used endpoints, and their definitions are derived from the RECIST criteria.RECIST defines complete response as the complete disappearance of all target lesions, partial response as shrinkage of the sum of maximum tumor diameters by at least 30%, and disease progression (PD) as increase in the sum of maximum tumor diameters by at least 20%, appearance of new lesions, or death. Change in tumor size that does not meet the criteria for PR or PD is classified as stable disease (SD). Percentage of patients who achieve a complete response is referred to as complete response rate (CR) and those that achieve a partial response is referred to as partial response rate (PR). ORR is the percentage of patients who have achieved complete or partial responses (ORR = CR + PR), and duration of response (DOR) is the median time until which the response is sustained (i.e. the tumor does not start to grow again or metastasize after initially responding). PFS is the time from randomization until disease progression (PD) as defined above. One commonly reported, but in our opinion meaningless and even potentially misleading surrogate measure, is the clinical benefit rate (CBR) defined as the sum of ORR and SD rate, based on the false premise that anything short of PD is a therapeutic benefit.

RECISTListen to pronunciationA standard way to measure how well a cancer patient responds to treatment. It is based on whether tumors shrink, stay the same, or get bigger. To use RECIST, there must be at least one tumor that can be measured on x-rays, CT scans, or MRI scans. The types of response a patient can have are a complete response, a partial response, progressive disease, and stable disease. Also called Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors.

### RECIST progression: patterns among target, non-target, non-measurable and new lesions progression [^116EbaBf]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study investigates whether different types of RECIST-defined tumor progression reflect distinct biological processes or variations of the same progression.

Materials and Methods

We collected retrospective data from N = 223 patients (mean age 67 ± 16 years; 151 men) undergoing immunotherapy per standard-of-care, whose treatment decisions did not follow RECIST. Imaging data were gathered for up to two years post-baseline, continuously evaluating RECIST-defined progression types. We analyzed co-occurrence patterns using odds ratios of progression events and assessed prognostic impacts with time-varying Cox regression models.

Results

Of 223 patients, 115 (52%) experienced at least one type of progression. Most patients (57%) experienced multiple types of progression. Most patients with only one type of progression did not have follow-up scans to determine if other types of progression would have occurred later. In general, all progression types are likely to co-occur, supported by significant positive odds ratios. New lesions were more frequent early in treatment, while other types showed no clear temporal trends. Non-measurable progression had the strongest association with worse survival (HR, 2.33; CI: 1.45–3.74; p < 0.001), followed by new lesions (HR, 1.73; CI: 1.05–2.86; p = 0.03) and target lesion progression (HR, 1.66; CI: 1.07–2.58; p = 0.02). Non-target lesion progression was rare (9%) and not prognostic.

Conclusion

RECIST-defined progression types often co-occur, suggesting they represent variations of a shared treatment failure process rather than independent events. Future developments should focus on quantitative metrics for progression.

### IRECIST: guidelines for response criteria for use in trials testing immunotherapeutics [^111FKuCy]. The Lancet: Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Tumours respond differently to immunotherapies compared with chemotherapeutic drugs, raising questions about the assessment of changes in tumour burden-a mainstay of evaluation of cancer therapeutics that provides key information about objective response and disease progression. A consensus guideline-iRECIST-was developed by the RECIST working group for the use of modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST version 1.1) in cancer immunotherapy trials, to ensure consistent design and data collection, facilitate the ongoing collection of trial data, and ultimate validation of the guideline. This guideline describes a standard approach to solid tumour measurements and definitions for objective change in tumour size for use in trials in which an immunotherapy is used. Additionally, it defines the minimum datapoints required from future trials and those currently in development to facilitate the compilation of a data warehouse to use to later validate iRECIST. An unprecedented number of trials have been done, initiated, or are planned to test new immune modulators for cancer therapy using a variety of modified response criteria. This guideline will allow consistent conduct, interpretation, and analysis of trials of immunotherapies.

### RECIST revised: implications for the radiologist. A review article on the modified RECIST guideline [^1156UPBQ]. European Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review article is to familiarize radiologists with the recently revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST), used in many anticancer drug trials to assess response and progression rate. The most important modifications are: a reduction in the maximum number of target lesions from ten to five, with a maximum of two per organ, with a longest diameter of at least 10 mm; in lymph nodes (LNs) the short axis rather than the long axis should be measured, with normal LN measuring < 10 mm, non-target LN ≥ 10 mm but < 15 mm and target LN ≥ 15 mm; osteolytic lesions with a soft tissue component and cystic tumours may serve as target lesions; an additional requirement for progressive disease (PD) of target lesions is not only a ≥ 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) from the nadir but also a ≥ 5 mm absolute increase in the SLD (the other response categories of target lesion are unchanged); PD of non-target lesions can only be applied if the increase in non-target lesions is representative of change in overall tumour burden; detailed imaging guidelines. Alternative response criteria in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumours are discussed.

### RECIST 1.1 and lesion selection: how to deal with ambiguity at baseline? [^111S3EXv]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Fewer targets, higher risk

In most studies, the measurability of the tumor features in the inclusion criteria to enable a quantified assessment. However, it is not uncommon for patients to have a single measurable lesion at baseline examination. In this case, as previously demonstrated, the fewer the lesions available, the higher the impact of including an ambiguous lesion.

Technically speaking, in extreme cases, if a single lesion is chosen and is found to be a NMTL, a single reading paradigm will technically simulate a stable disease (SD) response. In this case, the double-reading paradigm usually challenges this SD status versus a Non-Disease status (if the single lesion is not selected) or a Non-Measurable disease status (if the single lesion is classified as NTL by the second radiologist).

In addition, it is important, for example, to highlight that some adjuvant trials might include patients with only non-measurable disease or no disease at all (after surgery or radiation). In this case, the simulation described above applies only to NTL and not to TL.

Adaptive strategy according to the assessment endpoint

Awareness of the impact resulting from inclusion of a non-malignant lesion will help the radiologist to make selections in a more informed manner, especially in clinical trial assessments.

Two types of surrogate endpoints are derived from the oncologic assessment, i.e. tumor shrinkage and tumor progression. Usually, they are defined according to the primary outcome of the study and differ between phase 2 (response-related endpoints) and phase 3 (progression-related endpoints) trials.

Once the primary outcome has been defined, the radiologist's can choose at baseline between a conservative versus a non-conservative approach regarding lesion management (Table 3).

### ESR essentials: response assessment criteria in oncologic imaging-practice recommendations by the European society of oncologic imaging [^116xvmpG]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Future developments

RECIST 1.1 has been validated in a large data warehouse and is a recognized surrogate of clinical endpoints. These criteria, however, do not account for shape changes of treated lesions nor for heterogeneity in the response of different lesions in the same patient. Incorporating other parameters into the criteria, such as functional information from PET, DCE-MRI, and DWI, has been suggested. Volumetric measurements have also been suggested, but their added value has not yet been demonstrated.

RECIST 1.1 and the other criteria were devised for use in clinical trials, not in routine clinical practice. However, their principles can also be applied when reporting outside clinical trials and are useful for radiologists who do not report for clinical trials.

### Circulating tumor DNA to monitor treatment response in solid tumors and advance precision oncology [^1159k9yd]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The therapeutic landscape for cancer has transformed significantly over the past two decades with the advent of precision oncology. This paradigm shift underscores the critical importance of aligning patients with the appropriate molecular therapies at the right time, aiming to improve clinical outcomes while minimizing the use of ineffective and potentially toxic treatments. However, the methodologies for monitoring treatment response have not evolved at the same pace, still relying heavily on imaging and biomarkers that often lack specificity. These approaches, while useful, have significant limitations, including a lack of sensitivity and an inability to provide detailed molecular insights that are crucial for clinical decision-making in the era of targeted therapies.

One of the critical challenges in oncology is the dynamic stratification of patients for appropriate treatments. Real-time stratification is essential to ensure that therapeutic interventions are timely and effective. Traditional tissue biopsies, although informative, are often not feasible for repeated use due to their invasive nature. They also fail to capture the full extent of tumor heterogeneity and dissemination, particularly in metastatic settings.

Imaging techniques, such as those adhering to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), remain the gold standard for monitoring treatment response. The RECIST are a set of standardized criteria developed to provide a consistent method for assessing tumor response to treatment. These criteria are commonly used in clinical practice and in clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of chemotherapy and targeted therapy and are recognized by regulatory bodies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA). An updated version was recently introduced for evaluating responses in patients treated with immunotherapy, called iRECIST. RECIST and iRECIST primarily rely on imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to measure changes in tumor size. However, the focus on macroscopic anatomical changes in tumor size do not always correlate with molecular or cellular changes that are critical for understanding the effectiveness of targeted therapies and immunotherapies, and in particular, does not detect microscopic disease such as in minimal residual disease (MRD), which may lead to relapse. There is also a lack in sensitivity in detecting early treatment responses, particularly in cases where tumors do not shrink significantly but undergo necrosis or other changes.

### Radiologic measurements of tumor response to treatment: practical approaches and limitations [^116h4Tth]. Radiographics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective response assessment is important to describe the treatment effect of anticancer drugs. Standardization by using a "common language" is also important for comparison of results from different trials. In contrast to clinical results, which can be subjective, diagnostic imaging provides a greater opportunity for objectivity and standardization. It was generally accepted that a decrease in tumor size correlated with treatment effect; as a result, imaging was adopted for lesion measurement in the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria in 1979. However, because of some limitations of the WHO criteria, the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) were introduced in 2000. In RECIST, imaging was recognized as indispensable for response evaluation of solid tumors. Nevertheless, the widespread use of multidetector computed tomography and other imaging innovations have made RECIST outdated, with a concomitant need for modifications. Meanwhile, newer anticancer agents with targeted mechanisms of action have demonstrated an inherent limitation and unsuitability of anatomic tumor evaluation that assesses only lesion size. In addition, the effect of these new drugs changes the paradigm according to which tumor response or response rate is measured. Complete and partial responses cannot be the end points in all clinical trials; in some cases, disease control or progression-free survival may be the more relevant end point.

### Revised RECIST guideline version 1.1: what oncologists want to know and what radiologists need to know [^1111HCGk]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The objectives of this article are to review the new Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline, version 1.1, highlighting the major changes in the new version compared with the original RECIST guideline (version 1.0), and to present case examples with representative imaging.

Conclusion

Familiarity with the revised RECIST is essential in day-to-day oncologic imaging practice to provide up-to-date service to oncologists and their patients. Some of the changes in the revised RECIST affect how radiologists select, measure, and report target lesions.

### RECIST 1.1 and lesion selection: how to deal with ambiguity at baseline? [^114nRZqJ]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

To target or not to target, that is the question…

Given that the status of some equivocal lesions at baseline cannot be determined, our aim was to analyze the risk of strategizing a non-conservative versus a conservative approach to target selection.

The intuitive argument for choosing a non-conservative approach is that recording as many visible lesions as possible at baseline will increase the accuracy of the measurements of disease evolution. Additionally, one could assume that the intrinsic variability of the RECIST guidelines mitigates the risk of misclassification, even if some non-malignant lesions are selected at baseline.

Conversely, a cautious conservative attitude would avoid selecting questionable malignant lesions and would lead to a failure to identify certain malignant lesions at follow-up.

The impacts of each strategy are summarized in Table 3.

Table 3
Impacts of non-malignant lesion selection within TL or NTL group according to the primary endpoint captured by the assessment

*The second reader would assess a baseline status of Non-Disease raising an eligibility issue if the measurability of the disease is an inclusion criterion

Equivocal lesions recorded as target lesions

The risk in including a non-malignant Target Lesion (TL) at baseline is that some lesions will remain stable and will not contribute to modifying (increase or decrease) the total burden.

Indeed, we hypothesize that all lesions related to the same disease will shrink or progress relatively homogenously. Both paradoxical response and unstable equivocal lesions will be discussed below.

Based on these assumptions, the impact of equivocal lesions within the baseline target selection will depend on the percentage of Non-Malignant Target Lesions (NMTL) compared to the rest of the lesions contributing to the Sum of Diameters (SoD).

Indeed, this selection bias will result in changes in the threshold of response and progression for the initial unequivocal targeted lesions.

### Follow-up after radiological intervention in oncology: ECIO-ESOI evidence and consensus-based recommendations for clinical practice [^114upAc4]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This paper presents recommendations based on expert opinion and evidence on follow-up after interventional radiological treatment for liver cancer, renal cancer, and lung cancer. Only limited evidence is available from small studies. The main aims of follow-up are identifying residual tumor/assessment of response, detecting recurrence and new tumors or metastases. CT, MRI, and (FDG-)PET-CT are the main modalities useful for follow-up. One of the main issues is that after oncological interventions standard RECIST 1.1 response assessment is not reliable and other response criteria should be used. Additionally, efforts should be made to evaluate new imaging techniques to further improve response assessment (e.g. exploration of DWI, DCE-MRI, perfusion CT).

All experts agreed that for all cancers discussed in this paper, follow-up at 1 month should be performed after the intervention to identify complications and possible residual tumor. After 1 month, the subsequent follow-up schedule is most strict for liver cancer compared to lung and renal cancer. For liver cancer, a follow-up schedule with imaging at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months and 6 monthly thereafter was proposed. Contrast-enhanced CT is mostly used in liver cancer in clinical practice but is not recommended by the panel as the primary modality. Even though CT is widely available, it can be performed quickly and is the modality that radiologists have most expertise with, MRI is the modality of choice for local evaluation in the liver mainly because its superiority to detect smaller lesions than CT. Furthermore, MRI does not require radiation or iodine contrast and in the specific issue of HCC, MRI is superior to ceCT when Lipiodol is used. When MRI is not easily available or there is a strong preference for CT in clinical practice, CT can be considered as well. In case of extrahepatic metastases that require monitoring with CT (e, g. for RECIST 1.1. evaluation), CT will be the modality of choice instead of MRI. During follow-up, it is not recommended to change modality as this can hamper comparability between two exams. For CT, texture analyses are currently under study and in due time this might be used in daily practice. PET-CT can be considered in CRLM, but not for HCC. PET-CT is recommended as a problem solver and provides the advantage of high accuracy to detect extrahepatic metastases. In the liver, hematoma and post-intervention changes can lead to false-positive DWI signal and FDG uptake in and around the treated area, and radiologists should be aware of these pitfalls when performing follow-up. For this reason, PET-CT is not recommended for the first 4–6 months after ablation for CRLM (unless it is performed within 48 h, but this is not available in most centers). After TARE, little evidence is available for follow-up, but PET-CT seems the most accurate early (4 weeks) modality for response evaluation for CRLM, as MRI can be false-positive due to inflammation early after TARE. DWI seems to be the best modality to identify local tumor progression. CT is the second recommended modality. RECIST 1.1 is not accurate for response assessment. Based on expert opinion the panel recommended Choi criteria as an alternative method for response assessment after TARE over RECIST 1.1, when using CT for follow-up. Even though, this still is suboptimal response assessment criteria (primarily developed for gastro-intestinal stromal tumor and low reproducibility), the panel did consider the Choi criteria superior to RECIST 1.1.

Evaluation and management of treatment response

Imaging

As with cytotoxic therapy, recommended evaluation of tumor response to immunotherapy should be performed with a CT scan or MRI. The WHO criteriaand the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelinesdefine standard measurement methods for converting radiology image observations into quantitative and statistically tractable frameworks for measuring changes in tumor size associated with therapy. However, the unique patterns of responses observed with immunotherapy have led to the development of several modified criteria for reporting responses in solid tumors (described below). According to some analyses, conventional response criteria may underestimate ORR for immunotherapy-treated patients by as much as 15%. Additionally, due to the inability to differentiate metabolically active cancer cells from activated ICs and inflammation, standard positron emission tomography (PET) imaging may present challenges in assessing tumor response for patients with breast cancer on immunotherapy.

The mechanism of action of ICIs can cause unusual response patterns on imaging when compared with traditional responses to cytotoxic chemotherapy. While many patients still may have an initial reduction in tumor burden, other patients may experience non-traditional responses like initial tumor growth followed by tumor reduction (termed pseudoprogression), a period of rapid tumor growth (termed hyperprogression), or a period of prolonged stability followed by an eventual decrease in tumor growth. Although pseudoprogression, an apparent increase in tumor burden or appearance of new lesions on therapy, has been described in up to roughly 10% of patients with melanoma treated with checkpoint inhibitors, the phenomenon seems to be tumor-dependent with much lower rates of pseudoprogression (< 5%) noted in breast cancer studies. Potential mechanisms behind the appearance of enlarged lesions in solid tumors on imaging include infiltration of activated T cells, an inflammatory response due to cytokine release, or may simply reflect the time needed for the immune system to mount an appropriate response for tumor control.

### Are radiologists ready to evaluate true response to immunotherapy? [^116bDo5b]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

There are multiple dissimilarities between conventional response criteria and immune response criteria (Table 2). The first criteria described by WHO in 1979 introduced a bidimensional measurement method of tumor lesions and calculated the sum of the products (SPD) as tumor burden. According to the WHO criteria, treatment efficacy was categorized build on measurement changes compared to images obtained before therapy initiation. The four major responses were determined as follows, complete response (CR), defined as the extinction of all malignant lesions; partial response (PR), defined as ≥ 50% reduction in the SPD; PD, defined as a ≥ 25% enlargement in the dimension of 1 or more lesions, or the emergence of novel tumoral lesions; and stable disease (SD), defined when no more than ≥ 50% decrease in SPD observed or more than ≥ 25% increase in at least one lesion size. However, it was observed that the WHO criteria could not answer some of the critical questions identified as they started to be used. The measurable and nonmeasurable lesions were not classified, and the minimum dimension and the maximum number of lesions taken into account were not clear. U.S. National Cancer Institute, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, and WHO revised the WHO criteria and published new guidelines, namely the RECIST, in 2000. With the introduction of RECIST criteria, the unanswered questions became addressed. In the response assessment, the minimum dimension of measurable lesions was 10 mm, and the highest number of target lesions was 10. Sum of the longest diameters (unidimensional) of target lesions replaced SPD. CR was defined as extinction of all lesions, PR was defined as a ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions, and PD as a ≥ 20% increase in the SLD or detection of one or more new lesions or evident growth of non-target lesions. SD was reserved for patients without CR, PR, or PD. A new version of RECIST, RECIST 1.1, was published in 2009. It added the revised evaluation of new lesions, cystic and necrotic lesions and lymph nodes, bone lesions. Categories based on percentage changes were the same as the previous version. Tumor response was based on the measurement of five lesions (instead of ten). Measurements included the maximum diameter in the longitudinal axis for non-nodal lesions and the maximum diameter in the short axis for nodal lesions. Lymph nodes with a short-axis diameter of at least 10 mm but smaller than 15 mm are considered non-target lesions, and lymph nodes with a short-axis diameter of 15 mm or larger are considered target lesions.

### RECIST-learning from the past to build the future [^114nsQJg]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) remain an integral part of the assessment of tumour burden in many clinical trials in oncology; these criteria are used to evaluate the activity and efficacy of new cancer therapeutics in solid tumours. We aim to define the purpose of RECIST, and reflect on the level of documentation needed to enable changes for these criteria to develop a new RECIST. Maintaining the applicability of RECIST as a standard evaluation approach is associated with many challenges, in particular with maintaining a balance between the specificity and generalizability, continued validation and innovation, and use of RECIST in early phase versus late-phase drug development, as well as its relevance in clinical trials versus clinical practice. Key questions relate to different modes of actions of new classes of treatments and new imaging modalities; thus, the RECIST Working Group remains committed to maintain RECIST as a standard for the oncology community.

### Response criteria for intratumoral immunotherapy in solid tumors: itRECIST [^115n6xJv]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

As with any criteria modification, we anticipate that itRECIST will likely face issues of understanding and acceptance. The complexity of itRECIST may limit real-world clinical use. Ensuring that recommendations can be adapted into current practice was therefore a focus during development. Effective implementation of itRECIST in clinical trials will depend on ease of use and understanding among investigators, which could be facilitated by software developed to aid response calculations. The criteria were developed by expert consensus and will require empiric validation using historical and newly collected data to correlate itRECIST assessments with clinical outcomes. Consideration should be given to building the correlation between itRECIST and outcomes into clinical trial design. Within the proposed criteria, recommendations were not attempted for decisions lacking broad consensus. Thus, the decision about when to stop therapy in the face of enlarging or new lesions is based on clinical assessment by the treating physician. Although these guidelines were created for IT immunotherapy, similar principles may be applied to response assessment for other focal and IT treatments combined with systemic immunotherapies.

itRECIST represents an important first step toward a standardized method of response assessment for this promising and evolving therapeutic modality. Implementation and validation of itRECIST will allow the standardized evaluation of response to IT therapies while providing data for comparison across clinical trials and correlation with clinical outcomes. The proposed guidelines have been modified from RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST to be easily adopted in trial protocols and routine clinical practice without the need for complex additional assessments by treating physicians, thereby minimizing the burden on clinicians and investigators.

### Imaging endpoints for clinical trial use: a RECIST perspective [^1121mA4Q]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

The RECIST way forward

The concepts and rules explained in Sargent et al remain applicable. As they apply to bring changes to RECIST, the ruleset sets a high bar. In what follows, we will discuss variations in how RECIST could be refined or improved.

First, we need to recognize that today's application of RECIST covers a wide range of settings, and it is possible (although undesirable because causing divergence) that changes are applied depending on the purpose of use. Indeed, whereas initially intended for use in phase II clinical trials with response to treatment as the primary endpoint, today RECIST is used in early Phase trials as a treatment activity indicator, in comparative trials with response endpoint, and in comparative trials with progression endpoint (progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression, other time to event endpoints using RECIST progression as a component).

As a way to go about the future of RECIST, potential changes to the RECIST construct could be categorized as follows. RECIST could be updated by adding new techniques or methodology to what RECIST currently is. Modern imaging techniques such as PET-CT with different tracers could be incorporated provided measurement error can be controlled via standardized protocols as mentioned previously. New technology such as those based on changes in ctDNA could be included as an early tool to monitor response to treatment. Initiatives such as the ctDNA to Monitor Treatment Response (ctMoniTR) project by the Friends of Cancer Research could pave the way for a validation that could lead to integration in RECIST.

RECIST can be evaluated for use in other settings than the ones considered today, as already illustrated by the analyses on targeted agents and the attempts to validate iRECIST for assessing response to immunotherapeutic agents. Today, another area of research for the Working Group is the role of RECIST to assess response to treatment in patients with brain metastases. For this project, the Working Group has joined forces with the RANO Brain metastases group to centralize data from a large number of clinical trials of brain metastases.

### Response to treatment series: part 2, tumor response assessment – using new and conventional criteria [^112kPrQF]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Conventional anatomic imaging biomarkers, including World Health Organization (WHO) criteria and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), although effective, have limitations. This article will discuss the conventional and newer morphologic imaging biomarkers for the assessment of tumor response to therapy.

Conclusion

Applying established methods of assessing tumor response to therapy allows consistency in image interpretation and facilitates communication with oncologists. Because of the new methods of treatment, assessment of necrosis and volumetric information will need to be incorporated into size-based criteria.

### Pitfalls in RECIST data extraction for clinical trials: beyond the basics [^115kZHpB]. Academic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) is a standardized methodology for determining therapeutic response to anticancer therapy using changes in lesion appearance on imaging studies. Many radiologists are now using RECIST in their routine clinical workflow, as part of consultative arrangements, or within dedicated imaging core laboratories. Although basic RECIST methodology is well described in published articles and online resources, inexperienced readers may encounter difficulties with certain nuances and subtleties of RECIST. This article illustrates a set of pitfalls in RECIST assessment considered to be "beyond the basics". These pitfalls were uncovered during a quality improvement review of a recently established cancer imaging core laboratory staffed by radiologists with limited prior RECIST experience. Pitfalls are presented in four categories: (1) baseline selection of lesions, (2) reassessment of target lesions, (3) reassessment of nontarget lesions, and (4) identification of new lesions. Educational and operational strategies for addressing these pitfalls are suggested. Attention to these pitfalls and strategies may improve the overall quality of RECIST assessments performed by radiologists.

### When progressive disease does not mean treatment failure: reconsidering the criteria for progression [^113hgNDU]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2012). Low credibility.

Although progression-based endpoints, such as progression-free survival, are often key clinical trial endpoints for anticancer agents, the clinical meaning of "objective progression" is much less certain. As scrutiny of progression-based endpoints in clinical trials increases, it should be remembered that the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) progression criteria were not developed as a surrogate for survival. Now that progression-free survival has come to be an increasingly important trial endpoint, the criteria that define progression deserve critical evaluation to determine whether alternate definitions of progression might facilitate the development of stronger surrogate endpoints and more meaningful trial results. In this commentary, we review the genesis of the criteria for progression, highlight recent data that question their value as a marker of treatment failure, and advocate for several research strategies that could lay the groundwork for a clinically validated definition of disease progression in solid tumor oncology.

### Are radiologists ready to evaluate true response to immunotherapy? [^112qP6o6]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Comparison of RECIST 1.0, RECIST 1.1, irRC, irRECIST, and iRECIST

RECIST, response evaluation criteria in solid tumors; irRC, immune-related response criteria; irRECIST, immune-related RECIST; iRECIST, immune RECIST; CR, complete response; PR, partial response; SD, stable disease; PD, progressive disease; iUPD, immune unconfirmed progressive disease; iCPD, immune confirmed progressive disease

Up to now, our text was about the criteria used when evaluating cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment. However, the variety of apparitions of successful treatment response after immune therapy is different. Five significant distinctions in tumor burden response to immunotherapeutic agents compared to cytotoxic agents are discussed by expert panelists in 2004 and 2005. These conversations resulted in these five outcomes (I) time needed to pass to occur the anti-tumoral effectiveness may be longer for immunotherapeutic agents compared to cytotoxic agents; (II) good responses to immunotherapeutic agents can be verified even after PD; (III) to interrupt using immunotherapeutic agents cannot be relevant for some patients, unless PD is confirmed; (IV) toleration for "clinically negligible" PD (for instance, appearing small new lesions with of reduction in other lesions) is advised; and (V) continued stable disease (SD) might mean the being of anti-tumoral effect. The expert panel the results of the Phase II clinical trial of 227 patients with advanced melanoma treated with CTLA-4 inhibitor (Ipilimumab) agent and defined a new response assessment criteria, the irRC that they developed from WHO criteria. Like WHO criteria, the four major response evaluations were determined as follows, CR, defined as the extinction of all malignant lesions; PR, defined as ≥ 50% reduction in the SPD; PD, defined as a ≥ 25% increase in SPD; and SD, when no more than ≥ 50% decrease in SPD can be observed or more than ≥ 25% increase in at least one lesion size. SD is a response pattern that does not demonstrate major differences when applied to all immune-response criteria (Fig. 4). CR, PR, and PD need to be confirmed at four weeks. As a result of the studies, it was determined that the new lesions were not evaluated in favor of progression, as in the RECIST criteria, and the definition of "clinically insignificant" new lesions developed with irRC. New lesions are added to the total tumor burden, and the number of lesions to assess was increased compared to RECIST 1.1 (up to 5 per organ, up to 10 visceral in WHO vs. 2 per organ, 5 in total in RECIST 1.1). Bidimensional measurements on the long and short axes were performed. Despite its rational approach regarding the new lesions, irRC was widely criticized. First, two-dimensional evaluation is more challenging to apply than one-dimensional evaluation; a higher number of target lesions causes more time to be spent in daily work; third, lymph nodes evaluation is not determinedly explained. Nishino and Coll developed new immune-related criteria named irRECIST in 2013, combining RECIST 1.1 with the newly determined rules of irRC; they aimed to create a faster and more user-friendly reporting system. The minimum longest diameter must be at least 10 mm for visceral target lesions and 15 mm for target lymph node in the short axis. Unidimensional measurements were performed. Similar to RECIST 1.1 criteria, the four major response groups were defined as CR (evanescence of all malignant lesions with lymph nodes reduced to less than 10 mm in short-axis), PR, (≥ 30% reduction in the sum of diameters (SOD) compared to baseline, without new lesions), PD (a ≥ 20% growth in SOD or ≥ 5 mm absolute growth in SOD), and SD (when PR or PD can not be confirmed). Images of a patient with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer under treatment with nivolumab show no lesions higher than > 10 mm in all regions in the control images performed eight weeks after the initiation of treatment and assessed as CR with all immune response criteria (Fig. 5). The number of target lesions to evaluate has been determined as 5 in total, with no more than two lesions per organ. Significant differences between RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST are in evaluating new lesions. Measurable new lesions are added in SOD in the irRECIST while accepted as PD with RECIST criteria. Unmeasurable new lesions like bone and leptomeningeal metastases; malignant free fluid in the abdominal cavity inflammatory breast cancer; pleural and pericardial effusions; lesions with cystic nature; dermal lesions and lymphangitic carcinomatosis were recorded separately. Verification of CR, PR, and PD by a sectional radiological method minimum four weeks later is another difference from RECIST 1.1.

### Critical issues in response evaluation on computed tomography: lessons from the gastrointestinal stromal tumor model [^112BAhLh]. Current Oncology Reports (2005). Low credibility.

Imaging technology plays a major role in treatment response assessment in solid tumors and in surveillance for recurrence or progression. Currently available response evaluation criteria, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), are based on unidimensional tumor size. Recently, however, these strictly size-based criteria for evaluating responses have been criticized because they do not reflect the biologic changes of solid tumors induced by targeted therapies and thus may be misleading. This problem is evident in response evaluation in advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) treated with a new molecularly targeted agent, imatinib. GISTs can increase in size despite good response to imatinib, and focal progression within a responding GIST can be overlooked with current size-based imaging criteria. Modified objective criteria using a combination of tumor size and density on CT are promising in early response evaluation and in predicting long-term prognosis in patients with advanced GIST treated with imatinib. These criteria may have broad applicability as additional targeted therapies become available to treat solid tumors.

### RECIST 1.1 and lesion selection: how to deal with ambiguity at baseline? [^116d6THE]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

In addition, we simulated a frequent type of response pattern when a response is observed followed by progression. Figure 3 b shows the relative percentage of NMTL after a partial response. As can be seen, this type of response pattern increases the induced NMTL selection bias within the baseline TL pool. Using the example quoted above, even if only 20% of the burden corresponded to NMTL at baseline, this percentage increases to + 28% after a first PR.

These mathematical simulations serve as real incentives to avoid risk-taking when selecting an equivocal lesion as a target lesion, especially when it is larger than the unequivocal targets or if there are few targets in all. Moreover, the sensitivity for capturing progression is even more impacted after a first response.

Specific case of single target lesions

In this case, we cannot use the mathematical simulation to quantify the impact. However, in the overall assessment, the situation differs according to the primary endpoint evaluated.
Concerning the progression-related endpoint, if the single target is non-malignant, no impact should occur. The size of this NMTL should remain stable during the longitudinal analysis. The progression status is triggered either by the non-target lesion category progression or the appearance of a new lesion. In this case, having a conservative or non-conservative strategy at baseline does not impact the date of progression.
In contrast, concerning the response-related endpoint, a NMTL lesion will inevitably prevent a complete response, as above.

Equivocal lesions recorded as non-target lesions

Instead of recording an equivocal lesion as a TL, one strategy could be to gather all equivocal lesions within the non-target lesions (NTL) category. This would not bias the objective quantification but still maximize the chance of capturing disease evolution by recording all suspect lesions.

Indeed, the overall assessment of NTL for PR allows more flexibility as RECIST states that an unequivocal increase of these lesions should always be taken into account in conjunction with the TL response.
For this reason, a slight increase cannot trigger an overall PD. If the primary endpoint of the evaluation is detecting progression, the non-conservative strategy will minimize the risk of missing the PD.
However, when the primary endpoint of the study is the Best Overall Response, promoting the non-conservative strategy might prevent an overall CR status and increase the discrepancy based on PR/CR assessment between readers in a study with a double-reading paradigm.

### Comparison of solid tumor treatment response observed in clinical practice with response reported in clinical trials [^1115XuGW]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

In clinical trials supporting the regulatory approval of oncology drugs, solid tumor response is assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Calculation of RECIST-based responses requires sequential, timed imaging data, which presents challenges to the method's application in real-world evidence research.

Objective

To evaluate the feasibility and validity of a novel real-world RECIST method in assessing tumor burden associated with therapy for a large heterogeneous patient population undergoing treatment in routine clinical practice.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used physician-abstracted data pooled from retrospective, multisite electronic health record (EHR) review studies of patients treated with anticancer drugs at US oncology practices from 2014 through 2017. Included patients were receiving first-line treatment for thyroid cancer, breast cancer, or metastatic melanoma. Data were analyzed from March through August 2020.

Exposures

Undergoing treatment with immunotherapy or targeted therapy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Tumor response was classified according to RECIST guidelines (ie, change in sum diameter of target lesions) post hoc with measurements derived from imaging scans and reports.

Results

Among 1308 completed electronic case report forms, 956 forms (73.1%) had adequate data to classify real-world RECIST response. The greatest difference between physician-recorded responses and real-world RECIST-based responses was found in the proportion of complete responses: 118 responses (12.3%) vs 46 responses (4.8%) (P < .001). Among 609 patients in the metastatic melanoma population, complete responses were reported in 112 physician-recorded responses (18.4%) vs 44 real-world RECIST-based responses (7.2%) (P < .001), compared with 11 of 247 responses (4.5%) to 31 of 192 responses (16.1%) across pivotal trials of the same melanoma therapies.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that comparing tumor lesion sizes and categorizing treatment response according to RECIST guidelines may be feasible using real-world data. This study found that physician-recorded assessments were associated with overestimation of treatment response, with the largest overestimation among complete responses. Real-world RECIST-based assessments were associated with better approximations of tumor response reported in clinical trials compared with those reported in EHRs.

### ESR essentials: response assessment criteria in oncologic imaging-practice recommendations by the European society of oncologic imaging [^116DpH2U]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

iRECIST is mainly based on RECIST 1.1 criteria; however, there are some important differences:
Terminology: prefix "i" in all response evaluation nomenclature: complete response (iCR), partial response (iPR), unconfirmed progressive disease (iUPD), confirmed progressive disease (iCPD), and stable disease (iSD)
Introduction of iUPD, aimed at overcoming the risk of misclassifying as progressive disease the increase in diameter of lesions caused by the intrinsic immune-related mechanism of action. Overall, the first progression is defined as per RECIST 1.1 criteria, but it must be confirmed and will be labeled as iUPD and must be confirmed. Three patterns of evolution may then occur: (1) In case of an increase in the number or size of any lesion and/or clinical deterioration, the progression will be confirmed (iCPD); (2) If there is no change in tumor number or size, the response remains iUPD; (3) If lesion shrinkage occurs, the iUPD will be canceled and the patient will be assessed as iSD, iPR, or iCR, and this event is known as "pseudoprogression". Therefore, it is possible to remain at iUPD for several time points, and if there is a decrease in iSD/iPR and then progression is observed again, it would become iUPD again. This, a confirmation of progressive disease (iCPD) must follow an iUPD.

Moreover, the response after iUPD is driven by target lesions, meaning that it is possible to have a subsequent iSD or iPR based on the sum of TL diameters even if the new lesion seen at the time of iUPD is still present or unequivocal progression in non-target lesions at the time of iUPD has not improved. Overall, the iRECIST criteria include clinical status, so in case of deteriorating performance status, one could not classify the disease as pseudoprogressive. Finally, it must be noted that "pseudoprogression" is extremely rare in the real-world setting, with an estimated frequency of around 3–5% of patients, considering that the vast majority of cancer treated with immunotherapy have a radiological response similar to that to conventional chemotherapy (Fig. 4). In addition, new findings have suggested that the duration of response to treatment is usually shorter than the typical response, while overall survival is superior.

### Comparison of solid tumor treatment response observed in clinical practice with response reported in clinical trials [^1115dPBE]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this cohort study suggest that a real-world RECIST approach may be feasible. The differences between local physician-recorded tumor responses and central review RECIST–based responses were similar to that previously reported in the clinical trial setting. Additionally, when real-world RECIST outcomes in a specific indication (ie, metastatic melanoma) were compared with RECIST outcomes from pivotal clinical trials of agents approved for that indication, results were similar, suggesting the validity of our method, despite variability in the timing of imaging. In sum, a real-world RECIST method may provide a clinically meaningful measure of tumor response in the real-world setting that may approximate the measure used in clinical trials.

### ESR essentials: response assessment criteria in oncologic imaging-practice recommendations by the European society of oncologic imaging [^1138g9Ao]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Assessing the response to oncological treatments is paramount for determining the prognosis and defining the best treatment for each patient. Several biomarkers, including imaging, can be used, but standardization is fundamental for consistency and reliability. Tumor response evaluation criteria have been defined by international groups for application in pharmaceutical clinical trials evaluating new drugs or therapeutic strategies. RECIST 1.1 criteria are exclusively based on unidimensional lesion measurements; changes in tumor size are used as surrogate imaging biomarkers to correlate with patient outcomes. However, increased tumor size does not always reflect tumor progression. The introduction of immunotherapy has led to the development of new criteria (iRECIST, Level of Evidence (LoE) Ib) that consider the possibility that an increase in disease burden is secondary to the immune response instead of progression, with the new concept of Unconfirmed Progressive Disease (a first progression event which must be confirmed on follow-up). Specific criteria were devised for HCC (mRECIST, LoE IV), which measure only enhancing HCC portions to account for changes after local therapy. For GIST treated with imatinib, criteria were developed to account for the possible increase in size reflecting a response rather than a progression by assessing both tumor size and density on CT (Choi, LoE II). This article provides concise and relevant practice recommendations aimed at general radiologists to help choose and apply the most appropriate criteria for assessing response to treatment in different oncologic scenarios. Though these criteria were developed for clinical trials, they may be applied in clinical practice as a guide for day-to-day interpretation.

Key Points

Response evaluation criteria, designed for use in clinical trials, might serve as a surrogate biomarker for overall survival.
RECIST 1.1 defines measurable and non-measurable disease among which target lesions and non-target lesions are selected at baseline as reference for follow-ups.
Some therapies and/or cancers require the use of different criteria, such as iRECIST, mRECIST, and Choi criteria.

### A radiologist's guide to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors [^115stuEi]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), including version 1.0 and 1.1, has been universally accepted as the standard response assessment criteria for conventional chemotherapies. Increasing use of immunotherapy led to the need and development of immune-related RECIST. Imaging plays a crucial role in response assessment for solid tumors in guiding patient management as well as in clinical trials. Familiarity to different response criteria will help radiologists to optimally identify, select, and measure tumor lesions per the criteria and assess response to therapy. This article provides a comprehensive review of published RECIST criteria.

### Plasma ctDNA as a treatment response biomarker in metastatic cancers: evaluation by the RECIST working group [^117Si1Gu]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Early indicators of metastatic cancer response to therapy are important for evaluating new drugs and stopping ineffective treatment. The RECIST guidelines based on repeat cancer imaging are widely adopted in clinical trials, are used to identify active regimens that may change practice, and contribute to regulatory approvals. However, these criteria do not provide insight before 6 to 12 weeks of treatment and typically require that patients have measurable disease. Recent data suggest that measuring on-treatment changes in the amount or proportion of ctDNA in peripheral blood plasma may accurately identify responding and nonresponding cancers at earlier time points. Over the past year, the RECIST working group has evaluated current evidence for plasma ctDNA kinetics as a treatment response biomarker in metastatic cancers and early endpoint in clinical trials to identify areas of focus for future research and validation. Here, we outline the requirement for large standardized trial datasets, greater scrutiny of optimal ctDNA collection time points and assay thresholds, and consideration of regulatory body guidelines and patient opinions. In particular, clinically meaningful changes in plasma ctDNA abundance are likely to differ by cancer type and therapy class and must be assessed before ctDNA can be considered a potential pan-cancer response evaluation biomarker. Despite the need for additional data, minimally invasive on-treatment ctDNA measurements hold promise to build upon existing response assessments such as RECIST and offer opportunities for developing novel early endpoints for modern clinical trials.

### Comparison of solid tumor treatment response observed in clinical practice with response reported in clinical trials [^115RephY]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

The validity of real-world end points depends on the accuracy, measurability, and reproducibility of the underlying real-world data and the methods used to derive the real-world evidence. In this study, we present a novel real-world method for calculating tumor response using lesion measurement data abstracted into an electronic case report form from imaging reports (or made directly from the images themselves) post hoc by a physician who treated the patient. Using these measurements of target lesions, a real-world RECIST response can be calculated using the RECIST version 1.1 guidelines on the extent of lesion size changes and the development of new lesions. The objective of our study was to compare real-world RECIST response with physician-recorded response in a large, heterogenous population of patients undergoing treatment with anticancer drugs for several different solid tumor indications. To internally validate our findings, a separate analysis was performed in a subset of this population limited to patients treated for a single indication (ie, metastatic melanoma), comparing results with responses in health records and with the results of clinical trials for melanoma agents.

### Response criteria for intratumoral immunotherapy in solid tumors: itRECIST [^116V12ee]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Intratumoral (IT) immunotherapy is approved for stage IIIB to IV melanoma - and under evaluation in other malignancies with novel immune-stimulatory products. - Standardized efficacy evaluation is essential for drug development. Current oncology response criteria, such as Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) and guidelines for immunotherapeutic trials (iRECIST), were designed only to assess response to systemic therapy. -

RECIST is an evolving standardized framework for evaluating changes in tumor size, that is used in clinical trials to define treatment responses and disease progression.RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST are unsuitable for IT immunotherapy trials for several reasons. Because they were designed for systemic therapy, focal intervention renders treated lesions nonevaluable. RECIST 1.1 does not allow separate response assessment in injected and noninjected lesions, which is critical for IT immunotherapy trials. Moreover, there is no consensus on injected lesion assessment when lesions chosen for injection may change during treatment because of regression, loss of accessibility, or growth of other lesions. iRECIST has limited usefulness because the purpose of assessment after initial progression is solely to exclude pseudoprogression; it does not consider that the lesions selected for injection may change at progression.

Nevertheless, the experience of developing iRECIST by revising RECIST 1.1 for immunotherapyprovides valuable guidance. Before the consensus effort of the RECIST Working Group, stakeholders devised divergent approaches to RECIST modification for immunotherapy, resulting in confusion and incomparability among trials. Without standardization, these issues may recur for IT therapy.

The goal of IT RECIST (itRECIST) is to create guidelines for capturing data and assessing response in IT immunotherapy trials. As with iRECIST, the standardized data collection and initial suggestions for response assessment of itRECIST will be refined based on collected data. We anticipate itRECIST will initially be used for exploratory analyses, with primary and secondary end points based on RECIST 1.1, until evidence indicates that itRECIST improves efficacy assessment.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^111gKR6r]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Invasive Breast Cancer — principles of monitoring metastatic disease emphasize that the most accurate assessments of disease activity typically occur when previously abnormal studies are repeated on a serial and regular basis, and that generally, the same method of assessment should be used over time (eg, an abnormality found on chest CT should generally be monitored with repeat chest CT). Use of objective and widely accepted criteria for response, stability, and progression of disease are encouraged, with systems including the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines and the WHO criteria. Functional imaging studies such as radionuclide bone scans and PET imaging are particularly challenging for response assessment; with bone scans, responding disease may result in a flare or increased activity on the scan that may be misinterpreted as disease progression, especially on the first follow-up bone scan after initiating a new therapy, and PET imaging is challenging because of the absence of a reproducible, validated, and widely accepted set of standards for disease activity assessment. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### RECIST 1.1 in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors: comparison with RECIST 1.0 [^114tofuY]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 has been rapidly accepted in clinical trials as a standard measure to assess tumor response to therapy and is expected to improve response assessment, especially in genomically defined patients. The impact of RECIST 1.1 was compared with RECIST 1.0 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with sensitizing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Materials and Methods

Seventy patients with advanced NSCLC harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations treated with a first-line EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor were retrospectively studied. Tumor measurements and response assessment were performed using RECIST 1.0 and RECIST 1.1. The number of target lesions, the percentage change at the initial follow-up, best response, and time to progression were compared between RECIST 1.1 and RECIST 1.0.

Results

The number of target lesions identified using RECIST 1.1 was significantly lower compared with that using RECIST 1.0 (mean, 2.7 and 2.0, respectively; p < 0.0001; paired Student t test), with a decrease in 31 patients (44%). The initial proportional changes of the target lesion measurements had high correlation between the two criteria (R² = 0.8070), with concordant response assessment in 66 patients (94%). The best response showed almost perfect agreement (κw = 0.970). Time to progression (TTP) did not differ between the two criteria in 52 patients (74%), was longer by RECIST 1.1 in 15 patients (21%), and was shorter by RECIST 1.1 in three patients (4%).

Conclusion

RECIST 1.1 provided highly concordant response assessment with a decreased number of target lesions compared with RECIST 1.0 in advanced NSCLC patients harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations treated with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. RECIST 1.1 altered TTP in 25% of patients compared with RECIST 1.0.

### Are radiologists ready to evaluate true response to immunotherapy? [^111JyjpP]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

The imaging question and criteria for evaluating tumor response and different measurement details with illustrative images

Standardized response criteria for evaluating patients' radiological imaging have an essential role in oncological management. Many criteria have been described since 1979 include WHO (World Health Organization), RECIST 1.0 (Response Valuation Criteria in Solid Tumors), RECIST 1.1, irRC, irRECIST, iRECIST. The criteria for evaluating control images vary depending on whether the patient's treatment is chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Although the use of RECIST 1.1 criteria has been accepted widely in evaluating patients receiving chemotherapy, there is no consensus in the literature for assessing patients receiving immunotherapy. Many questions are raised regarding how we currently manage the response. Which response criteria correlate better with patient prognosis? How to assess newly detected lesions? Should we compare the total tumor burden with the previous control or before the start of treatment? This article reviews the literature to understand the most useful response evaluation criteria for optimal management for patients under immunotherapy treatment.

### Measures of response: RECIST, WHO, and new alternatives… [^111DHt8N]. ASCO (2006). Low credibility.

Abstract RECIST is a widely employed method introduced in 2000 to assess change in tumor size in response to therapy. The simplicity of the technique, however, contrasts sharply with the increasing sophistication of imaging instrumentation. Anatomically based imaging measurement, although supportive of drug development and key to some accelerated drug approvals, is being pressed to improve its methodologic robustness, particularly in the light of more functionally-based imaging that is sensitive to tissue molecular response such as fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Introduction RECIST 1and its predecessors, primarily the WHO method, 2, 3defined standard measurement methods for converting visual image observations into a quantitative and statistically tractable framework for measuring tumor size response to therapy.

Although the WHO method was first developed for film x-ray and early computed tomography technology in the late 1970s, it was modified in the RECIST publication in 2000 to make measurement practices procedurally more consistent across multiple trials and accommodate improvements in CT and magnetic resonance imaging scanners. WHO defines its tumor measurement by summing a group of individual masses, each lesion of which is assessed by the cross product of its greatest diameter and largest perpendicular diameter. RECIST guidelines arose from an international task force convened in the mid-1990s. It reviewed existing response evaluation criteria to make them more consistent across studies and addressed matters not fully contained in WHO criteria.

By somewhat arbitrary decision making, RECIST defined PR as a more than 30% linear decrease of the linear sums of the target lesions and PD as a more than 20% increase; this contrasted with WHO criteria, in which those boundaries were set volumetrically at 65% and 40%, respectively. Despite recognized limitations, studies continue to be directed toward refining the RECIST paradigm by minor, incremental modification. To its credit, RECIST recommends an unspecified number of independent readers and has a requirement for a second temporal assessment to confirm initial tumor response. A recent study however presents data declaring that requirement unnecessary. 28But, as is often the case with empirically based methods, there is always the suspicion that any such conclusion may have limited generality and may be applicable to only a unique disease or specific study.

### Evaluation of the response to treatment of solid tumours-a consensus statement of the international cancer imaging society [^1126QMuQ]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

We propose that a working party of the ICIS enters a dialogue with the authors of the New Guidelines to Evaluate Response of Solid Tumours (RECIST) in order to modify and update the guidelines in accordance with current opinion as outlined above. We propose that such dialogue should be ongoing so that new information from existing and new technology can be introduced into the guidelines in the future in a timely and appropriate manner. For example, there is clearly a growing need to introduce a multimodality approach to monitoring tumour response, thereby integrating morphological and functional tumour measurements. The rapidly growing application of positron emission tomography (PET), PET/CT and MRI to monitoring tumour response provides this opportunity and opens the way to a new and exciting era in cancer imaging.

### RECIST 1.1 assessments variability: a systematic pictorial review of blinded double reads [^112t8gdy]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Considering how RECIST has been designed around three lesion categories, i.e. quantified target lesions (TLs), qualified non-target lesions (NTLs), and new lesions (NL), it is possible to break down its general causes of discordance related to the dimension of quantification and qualification.

Target lesions are all measured and their measured summed. The change of their measured sum is compared to the corresponding baseline and depending on a threshold of change, patients are diagnosed as stable, partially or completely responding, or progressing. The variability in TL selection at baseline or their measurements all along the process impacts the patient evaluation into the categories. Furthermore, the near-complete disappearance of lesions is subject to qualitative variability in evaluating the persistence of residual tumors or tissue considered scarred.

Non-target lesions are evaluated qualitatively. As for TL, their initial selection will impact the subsequent response and the evaluation of their complete disappearance is subject to divergent opinions, when display may correspond to scar tissue. In addition, lymph node sites that never disappear must be subjectively qualified as "non-pathological" to allow for a complete response. Regarding progression, in the absence of a formal quantified threshold, the subjective nature of the evaluation also leads to greater variability in the "significance" of progression.

New lesions are prone to observers' variability in terms of detection and characterization due to their occasionally equivocal display.

Even if the oncological evaluation criteria are said to "quantify" the response, they remain subjective from several standpoints that impact the three main categories determining the overall response.

To summarize, we can consider three main criteria-derived factors of discordance between two radiologists which are: The initial lesions selection, the measurement of TLs, the qualitative evaluation of NTLs, and the detection of NLs (Table 1).

### A template for generic asssessment of tumor response… [^115CvUqt]. ASCO (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract e14149 Background: Oncologists often need an objective, quantitative assessment of a patient's response to therapy. Lacking a standardized format, the oncologist may request a RECIST analysis. RECIST, however, was developed to provide standardized assessment in the context of randomized clinical trials. RECIST is based on the prospective analysis of a limited sample of tumor lesions or lymph nodes, whereas the clinician naturally makes clinical decisions retrospectively. Furthermore, RECIST has definitions, rules, and criteria for classifying responses that may not apply in the clinical setting, and it does not include consistent rules for merging or splitting lymph nodes, mixed tumor responses, lesions that may cavitate, and a wide range of individualistic responses encountered in clinical practice. Methods: To address these issues, we have modified our working Excel-based template for RECIST 1.

1 assessment to include a "myRECIST" feature, so that the radiologist can enter data and examine a range of pre-defined or customizable scenarios, including RECIST1. 1, iRECIST, Lugano, volumetric and other parametric protocols. With a few interactions, this template can produce exportable tables and graphs of tumor responses that can guide therapy, as shown in the attached image. Definitions are standardized and linked to RADLEX ontology for specificity and subsequent analysis. Results: This template has been developed for clinical use and is available for downloading from our institutional web-site. Conclusions: We have developed, for public use, a free, easy-to-use, down-loadable Excel template for evaluating prospective or retrospective scenarios of tumor response to therapy that avoids the restrictions of the RECIST methodology. This template may prove useful to oncologists both in and out of the context of randomized clinical trials. We call this "myRECIST".

### A European society of oncologic imaging (ESOI) survey on the radiological assessment of response to oncologic treatments in clinical practice [^115fhn3Z]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Response evaluation criteria are crucial in the assessment of the efficacy of cancer drugs in clinical trials. Four decades ago, at the dawn of cross-sectional imaging, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the first imaging criteria for the assessment of tumor burden, based on the sum of the products of diameters of the target lesions. In 2000, the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumor (RECIST) working group published new guidelines, the RECIST version 1.0, introducing new rules to better objectify the evaluation of the tumor burden, as the definitions of minimum size and the number of measurable lesions per organ. The new criteria also introduced unidimensional measurements bringing a simplification with respect to the WHO criteria. A revised version, RECIST 1.1, that incorporates major changes such as a reduction in the number of lesions to assess, a new categorization of lymph nodes based on short axis, new recommendations for the assessment of progressive disease, and so on, was introduced in 2009. RECIST 1.1 criteria are based upon imaging modalities that are globally available and easily interpretable and are therefore widely used in clinical trials.

Though intended for use in the clinical trial setting, oncologists increasingly rely on RECIST 1.1-based measurements for clinical management of patients also in daily clinical practice. The main justifications are as follows: (1) the opportunity for a more standardized and structured approach to response assessment and (2) the increased clarity of the radiological report. Indeed, terms such as measurable disease, tumor burden, target lesions, and response categories are now part of the radiologist's lexicon. However, in clinical practice, reporting strategies are mostly left to the local radiologist and oncologist, who may issue their own set of rules.

The need for a standardized approach, and of universally applicable rules for the assessment of response in daily routine, should be considered an important priority for the oncology and oncologic imaging community. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the opinions and preferences of radiologists, with a dominant interest in oncologic imaging, on treatment response evaluation in clinical practice to gather information for the development of reporting models and recommendations.

### Comparison of iRECIST versus RECIST V.1.1 in patients treated with an anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody: pooled FDA analysis [^111kYC4h]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The use of immune-based tumor response criteria as the primary assessment of tumor measurement-based endpoints has been hampered in part by the multiple response criteria that have been proposed and variations therein, complexity of individual criteria, differential application in randomized trials where immune-based response criteria are applied only to the experimental arm (immunotherapy) and not the control arm (eg, a chemotherapeutic regimen), and increasing reliance on single-arm trials to identify clinically meaningful treatment effects on ORR and DOR. Employing novel response criteria is particularly challenging for single-arm trials as the assessment of treatment effects relies on historic controls with cross-study comparisons confounded by use of disparate response criteria. While adoption of iRECIST in immunotherapeutic trials may address some of the limitations of RECIST V.1.1 with respect to patient management — limitations that are often overcome on a case-by-case basis in current protocols — the question remains whether the additional burden in data collection (eg, measurements of new lesions, assessment of non-target growth from the previous assessment, and confirmation of progression) and data evaluation (eg, programming patient response post initial RECIST V.1.1 progression and a more complicated algorithm regarding what constitutes a confirmation of progression) is outweighed by any impact that prospective use of iRECIST will have on the interpretation of tumor measurement-based endpoints such as ORR and PFS. While the magnitudes of treatment effects on ORR and PFS, as well as associations of PFS with OS, as calculated by iRECIST or RECIST V.1.1 appear similar, the substantial proportion of missing data following RECIST V.1.1 progression in this retrospective analysis limits firm conclusions of the utility of iRECIST for evaluation of immunotherapeutics in trials intended to support marketing authorization.

In prospective trials proposing the use of an immune-based tumor response criteria such as iRECIST for the determination of the primary endpoint, the trial design, trial conduct, and analysis plan would need to minimize and address potential bias introduced with the use of such criteria. Given its widespread acceptance, iRECIST has the potential to unify how data are collected and evaluated across both single-arm and randomized trials, providing a new standard for tumor response assessment across trials.

### RECIST 1.1 and lesion selection: how to deal with ambiguity at baseline? [^112nuaDo]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although no studies have investigated the frequency of inclusion of equivocal lesions at baseline when applying RECIST, from radiologists' experience, such inclusions are not uncommon. Despite preventive strategies designed to limit such situations, in some lesions, the distinction between malignant and non-malignant is difficult to make.

Making an inappropriate decision on this type of baseline equivocal lesion is mitigated by adjudication via a double-reading centralized review. However, centralized reviews intrinsically give rise to equivocal situations, particularly if the transfer of clinical information is not carefully managed.

In practical terms, the general conclusion of our simulations tends to show that selecting an equivocal lesion during the baseline selection for the RECIST evaluation most often impacts the Response-Related Endpoint (best overall response, overall response rate, duration of response, response rate).

Regarding progression-related endpoints, inclusion of a non-malignant lesion in the targets is risky, especially when there are few targets of the same size. One should bear in mind that the impact is maximized by the percentage of NMTL/sum but also by the first response before a PD. However, selecting a single NMTL would not impact the date of progression otherwise triggered by the occurrence of a new lesion or the progression of NTL.

For these reasons, in the context of a phase II trial, we would recommend strategizing a strictly conservative approach when analyzing the baseline (not recording any equivocal lesion). In contrast, in a phase III trial setting, recording an equivocal lesion as NTL is a winning strategy which will maximize the chances of detecting disease progression and avoid bias.

### RECISTv1.1 progression in oncology: shades of gray [^113PRnbt]. Cancer Cell (2023). Medium credibility.

The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)-based outcomes, such as objective response rate (ORR) or progression free survival (PFS), are standard outcomes for early oncology trials. These indices provide a black-and-white interpretation of response to therapy. We propose that lesion-level analysis and mechanism-based pharmacodynamic endpoints may provide a more informative index of response to therapy. Accounting for "shades of gray" in lesion-level response assessments may reduce bias in go/no-go decisions and biomarker analyses for novel oncology compounds and discontinuation decisions for individual patients.

### Patients with melanoma treated with an anti-PD-1 antibody beyond RECIST progression: a US food and drug administration pooled analysis [^115LT6Gq]. The Lancet: Oncology (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients who receive immunotherapeutic drugs might develop an atypical response pattern, wherein they initially meet conventional response criteria for progressive disease but later have decreases in tumour burden. Such responses warrant further investigation into the potential benefits and risks for patients who continue immunotherapy beyond disease progression defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.

Methods

For this pooled analysis, we included all submissions of trial reports and data to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in support of marketing applications for anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) antibodies (alone or in combination) for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma that allowed for continuation of the antibody beyond RECIST-defined progression in the anti-PD-1 group and were approved by FDA before Jan 1, 2017. To investigate the effect of treatment beyond progression in patients with metastatic melanoma and to better characterise which of these patients would benefit from extended treatment, we pooled individual patient data from patients who received at least one dose of an anti-PD-1 antibody in the included trials. We included any patient receiving the anti-PD-1 antibody after their RECIST-defined progression date in the treatment beyond progression cohort and analysed them descriptively at baseline and at time of progression versus the cohort not receiving treatment beyond progression. We analysed the target lesion response after progression in patients in the treatment beyond progression cohort relative to progressive disease and baseline target lesion burden. We defined a treatment beyond progression response as a decrease in target lesion tumour burden (sum of the reference diameters) of at least 30% from the burden at the time of RECIST-defined progression that did not require confirmation at a subsequent assessment. We also compared individual timepoint responses, overall survival, and adverse events in the treatment beyond progression versus no treatment beyond progression cohorts.

Findings

Among the eight multicentre clinical trials meeting this study's inclusion criteria, we pooled the data from 2624 patients receiving immunotherapy. 1361 (52%) had progressive disease, of whom 692 (51%) received continued anti-PD-1 antibody treatment beyond RECIST-defined progression and 669 (49%) did not. 95 (19%) of 500 patients in the treatment beyond progresssion cohort with evaluable assessments had a 30% or more decrease in tumour burden, when considering burden at RECIST-defined progression as the reference point, representing 14% of the 692 patients treated beyond progression and 4% of all 2624 patients treated with immunotherapy. Median overall survival in patients with RECIST-defined progressive disease given anti-PD-1 antibody was longer in the treatment beyond progression cohort (24.4 months, 95% CI 21.2–26.3) than in the cohort of patients who did not receive treatment beyond progression (11.2 months, 10.1–12.9). 362 (54%) of 669 patients in the no treatment beyond progression cohort had a serious adverse event up to 90 days after treatment discontinuation compared with 295 (43%) of 692 patients in the treatment beyond progression cohort. Immune-related adverse events that occurred up to 90 days from discontinuation were similar between the treatment beyond progression cohort (78 [11%] of 692 patients) and the no treatment beyond progression cohort (106 [16%] of 669).

Interpretation

Continuation of treatment beyond progression in the product labelling of these immunotherapies has not been recommended because the clinical benefit remains to be proven. Treatment beyond progression with anti-PD-1 antibody therapy might be appropriate for selected patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, identified by specific criteria at the time of progression, based on the potential for late responses in the setting of the known toxicity profile.

### ESR essentials: response assessment criteria in oncologic imaging-practice recommendations by the European society of oncologic imaging [^112535VH]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

RECIST 1.1 criteria

Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.0, developed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), replaced WHO criteria in 2000, followed by the upgraded RECIST version 1.1 in 2009, which are now widely used to evaluate the efficacy of treatment in patients with solid tumors enrolled in pharmaceutical clinical trials evaluating systemic therapies and used less consistently in daily clinical practice of oncologic institutions. RECIST 1.1 criteria are exclusively based on unidimensional lesion measurements, and changes in tumor size are used as surrogate imaging biomarkers to correlate with patient outcomes.

Measurable/non-measurable and target/non-target lesions at baseline

An initial assessment (baseline) must be performed within the 4 weeks prior to treatment initiation. At baseline, tumor burden is divided into:
Measurable lesions: lesions with longest diameter ≥ 10 mm, pathological lymph nodes with short axis ≥ 15 mm, and osteolytic/mixed lesions only if associated with solid tissue ≥ 10 mm;
Non-measurable lesions: lesions with longest diameter of < 10 mm, pathological lymph nodes with short axis ≥ 10 mm and < 15 mm, osteoblastic lesions, and every tumor site that is objectively difficult to measure (e.g. ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, leptomeningeal disease, lymphangitic involvement of the lung or skin, diffuse infiltrative type gastric cancer). Subsequently, target lesions (TL) and non-target lesions (NTL) must be chosen. Radiologists must select from the measurable lesions a maximum of five TL (up to two per organ), which must be representative of all affected organs and easily reproducible across time points. The longest diameter of each lesion is measured, preferably on the axial plane. For lymph nodes, the short axis is measured. Cystic metastases may be included among the TL (non-cystic metastases are preferred if present), while cavitating lesions should not be considered TL. The sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of the selected TLs signifies the starting point for evaluating response to treatment. The remaining measurable and all non-measurable lesions represent NTL and are only recorded and not measured.

### From RECIST to PERCIST: evolving considerations for PET response criteria in solid tumors [^111mkYtq]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The purpose of this article is to review the status and limitations of anatomic tumor response metrics including the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), and RECIST 1.1. This article also reviews qualitative and quantitative approaches to metabolic tumor response assessment with (18)F-FDG PET and proposes a draft framework for PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST), version 1.0.

Methods

PubMed searches, including searches for the terms RECIST, positron, WHO, FDG, cancer (including specific types), treatment response, region of interest, and derivative references, were performed. Abstracts and articles judged most relevant to the goals of this report were reviewed with emphasis on limitations and strengths of the anatomic and PET approaches to treatment response assessment. On the basis of these data and the authors' experience, draft criteria were formulated for PET tumor response to treatment.

Results

Approximately 3,000 potentially relevant references were screened. Anatomic imaging alone using standard WHO, RECIST, and RECIST 1.1 criteria is widely applied but still has limitations in response assessments. For example, despite effective treatment, changes in tumor size can be minimal in tumors such as lymphomas, sarcoma, hepatomas, mesothelioma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor. CT tumor density, contrast enhancement, or MRI characteristics appear more informative than size but are not yet routinely applied. RECIST criteria may show progression of tumor more slowly than WHO criteria. RECIST 1.1 criteria (assessing a maximum of 5 tumor foci, vs. 10 in RECIST) result in a higher complete response rate than the original RECIST criteria, at least in lymph nodes. Variability appears greater in assessing progression than in assessing response. Qualitative and quantitative approaches to (18)F-FDG PET response assessment have been applied and require a consistent PET methodology to allow quantitative assessments. Statistically significant changes in tumor standardized uptake value (SUV) occur in careful test-retest studies of high-SUV tumors, with a change of 20% in SUV of a region 1 cm or larger in diameter; however, medically relevant beneficial changes are often associated with a 30% or greater decline. The more extensive the therapy, the greater the decline in SUV with most effective treatments. Important components of the proposed PERCIST criteria include assessing normal reference tissue values in a 3-cm-diameter region of interest in the liver, using a consistent PET protocol, using a fixed small region of interest about 1 cm(3) in volume (1.2-cm diameter) in the most active region of metabolically active tumors to minimize statistical variability, assessing tumor size, treating SUV lean measurements in the 1 (up to 5 optional) most metabolically active tumor focus as a continuous variable, requiring a 30% decline in SUV for "response", and deferring to RECIST 1.1 in cases that do not have (18)F-FDG avidity or are technically unsuitable. Criteria to define progression of tumor-absent new lesions are uncertain but are proposed.

Conclusion

Anatomic imaging alone using standard WHO, RECIST, and RECIST 1.1 criteria have limitations, particularly in assessing the activity of newer cancer therapies that stabilize disease, whereas (18)F-FDG PET appears particularly valuable in such cases. The proposed PERCIST 1.0 criteria should serve as a starting point for use in clinical trials and in structured quantitative clinical reporting. Undoubtedly, subsequent revisions and enhancements will be required as validation studies are undertaken in varying diseases and treatments.

### The beginning of the end for conventional RECIST-novel therapies require novel imaging approaches [^113AcFmp]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Owing to improvements in our understanding of the biological principles of tumour initiation and progression, a wide variety of novel targeted therapies have been developed. Developments in biomedical imaging, however, have not kept pace with these improvements and are still mainly designed to determine lesion size alone, which is reflected in the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Imaging approaches currently used for the evaluation of treatment responses in patients with solid tumours, therefore, often fail to detect successful responses to novel targeted agents and might even falsely suggest disease progression, a scenario known as pseudoprogression. The ability to differentiate between responders and nonresponders early in the course of treatment is essential to allowing the early adjustment of treatment regimens. Various imaging approaches targeting a single dedicated tumour feature, as described in the hallmarks of cancer, have been successful in preclinical investigations, and some have been evaluated in pilot clinical trials. However, these approaches have largely not been implemented in clinical practice. In this Review, we describe current biomedical imaging approaches used to monitor responses to treatment in patients receiving novel targeted therapies, including a summary of the most promising future approaches and how these might improve clinical practice.

### RECIST 1.1 assessments variability: a systematic pictorial review of blinded double reads [^114cRAaT]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

RECIST variability in the assessment of the not-measured disease (Fig. 11)

First, the evaluation of the NTL is subjective as it concerns the truly non-measurable diseases such as blastic bone metastasis and the not-measured baseline residual disease after TL selection. Also, NTLs are sometimes grouped together to ease the follow-up record of diffuse disease (Fig. 1).

Fig. 11
Paradoxical response of non-targeted disease. The measured disease is stable (double arrowhead) while the non-targeted disease (circle) increases unequivocally. A small new lesion can also be identified (arrow)

Dissociated response is defined as the coexistence of responding and non-responding lesions within the same patient. It is particularly observed with immunotherapy where such a paradoxical response between TL and NTL (Fig. 11) can be a difficulty. Unlike TL, the regular workflow that consists of comparing lesions to their Nadir is not well suited for monitoring NTLs as it is tricky to identify the Nadir of NTL without plotting a quantified measure of their changes. Therefore, in practice, NTL evaluations are compared to the last available examination.

Second, the evaluation of each NTL is aggregated subjectively into an NTL category response and RECIST states that NTL assessment is a function of the overall disease and therefore should consider the evolution of TLs and the presence of NLs.

Because of these above different factors, there is inter-observer variability in the evaluation of NTL categories responsible for discordance in the overall response. As explained, this occurs even more when the TL/NTL response is dissociated.

Previously mentioned difficulties in assessing complete response versus non-complete response for small remaining lesions versus scars also concern the NTL category (Fig. 11). However, even larger lesions are concerned for non-measurable bone lesions when a lytic lesion heals as a blastic lesion (bone flare) or blastic lesions persists throughout the evaluation with no increase (Figs. 2 a and 5d). in such case, the assessment of complete response versus remaining bone metastasis is subjective. The same difficulty in distinguishing CR versus non-CR for cystic or cavitary lesions after treatments (Fig. 2b).

### Comparison of iRECIST versus RECIST V.1.1 in patients treated with an anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody: pooled FDA analysis [^115gCF8N]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has considered large durable treatment effects on tumor burden and large effects on progression-free survival (PFS) in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to predict effects on overall survival (OS), a direct measure of clinical benefit. Because these endpoints can be evaluated earlier than OS to characterize a drug's efficacy, and these endpoints are not confounded by crossover, clinical trials routinely assess treatment effects on PFS and objective response rate (ORR). Identifying the optimal algorithm to detect changes in tumor burden that correlate best with OS is particularly important in the regulatory setting to ensure that new, safe, and effective therapies are accessible to patients as soon as possible.

The criteria to characterize treatment effects on tumor have evolved to maintain or improve accuracy while limiting administrative costs and other burdens. The first generally accepted bidimensional criteria, the WHO response criteria (1981), was replaced by unidimensional Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) (2000); the current standard is RECIST V.1.1, a widely used, standardized algorithm for characterizing tumor response and tumor progression in clinical trials. Investigators, the pharmaceutical industry, and regulatory agencies accept ORR, duration of response (DOR), and PFS as assessed by conventional response criteria (eg, RECIST V.1.1) as valid measures of clinically meaningful changes in tumor burden, describing treatment effects supporting some of the new drug approvals.

However, RECIST V.1.1 does not capture the atypical patterns of tumor response described with ipilimumab and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies. These atypical responses include initial increase in tumor size followed by a clinically important reduction in tumor burden ('tumor flare'/pseudoprogression) or initial reduction in tumor size with appearance of new lesions that subsequently regress. To account for atypical tumor responses, several modified response criteria have been proposed, including the immune-related response criteria, immune-related RECIST, immune-modified RECIST, and immune RECIST. These criteria differ in their consideration of new lesions (ie, whether new lesions indicate progression and/or incorporation of new lesions in the measurement of tumor burden), requirements for confirmation of progression, and use of bidimensional or unidimensional measurements of tumor lesions (online supplementary table 1).

### Evaluation of the response to treatment of solid tumours-a consensus statement of the international cancer imaging society [^113nfyJq]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

The International Cancer Imaging Society (ICIS) was founded in 1999 in order to promote education in cancer imaging and its role in the multidisciplinary management of malignant disease. This rapidly growing society currently has over 200 members worldwide and holds an annual scientific meeting and postgraduate teaching course. The vast majority of the associate members are radiologists who have an interest in cancer radiology and the 38 full members are all specialist oncological radiologists who are international leaders in the field.

At the second annual course of ICIS, which was held in London in October 2001, a symposium entitled 'Monitoring Response to Treatment' provided the forum for a discussion of the difficulties encountered in monitoring tumour response with imaging and, in particular, the practical challenges of adopting the new RECIST criteria. The discussion stimulated this review. We applaud the standardisation of response assessment criteria and in particular numerous features of RECIST, which address specific imaging guidelines in clinical trials and considerations of other modalities and techniques for response assessment. Many of the general problems of monitoring tumour response with imaging have been addressed in the literature previously. However, we would like to share our views regarding the strengths and weaknesses of using the RECIST criteria, and what other issues should potentially be added to a response criterion with a wider audience in the hope that we may be able to open discussion between ICIS and the Task Force of the EORTC, the NCI and the NCI (Canada). Our ultimate objective is to offer constructive suggestions on the guidance for implementation of the RECIST criteria.
We recognise three important purposes for evaluation of treatment response for reporting the outcome of clinical trials, that is, tumour response as a prospective end point in early clinical trials, tumour response as a prospective end point in more definitive clinical trials designed to provide an estimate of benefit for a specific cohort of patients and tumour response as a guide for the clinician and patient or study subject in decisions about continuation of current therapy. We also acknowledge the need to assess tumour response in daily clinical practice. Although the protocols for imaging to assess response for clinical trials are likely to differ considerably from those required to assess individual clinical response in routine practice, the key to accurate, reproducible assessment, for both types of practice, is the involvement of a radiologist experienced in oncological imaging. The assessment of response not only requires an approximate estimate of tumour size, or more precise measurement, but also requires an in-depth understanding of the complications of cancer therapies and a detailed knowledge of the disease-specific patterns of tumour recurrence. The difference between imaging in clinical care and imaging for clinical trials is subtle, especially for the non-radiologist, but of paramount importance to obtain results that are reproducible and consistent across centres. In some manner, the difference in radiologic assessment is similar to differences in practice for the chemotherapist practising in clinical care versus enrolling and caring for a patient on a clinical trial.
The new RECIST criteria do not allow for the comparison of historical trials using WHO and current trials using RECIST. The data from the eight clinical trials used in the RECIST documentation were not referenced in the published criteria and guidelines. It is uncertain what modality was used in these trials, what methodology was used to calculate the measurements and how many tumours or metastases were actually measured. Subsequent data have demonstrated some concordance between RECIST and WHO for best overall response but limited or no concordance between RECIST and WHO for time to progression. This criterion is increasingly being used as a surrogate end point and the lack of correlation between RECIST and WHO is of concern. Thus there is potential for inappropriate application of noncomparable standards, which could potentially result in imaging being viewed as a poor method for quantitatively judging response. Furthermore, new drugs and therapies may not be approved for clinical use or may not reach the stage of full evaluation because of the application of differing standards and the comparison to historical controls and clinical trials. However, when appropriately applied, imaging represents one of the best methods available for objective and quantifiable response assessment.

### RECIST 1.1 and lesion selection: how to deal with ambiguity at baseline? [^112moqo1]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) is still the predominant criteria base for assessing tumor burden in oncology clinical trials. Despite several improvements that followed its first publication, RECIST continues to allow readers a lot of freedom in their evaluations. Notably in the selection of tumors at baseline. This subjectivity is the source of many suboptimal evaluations. When starting a baseline analysis, radiologists cannot always identify tumor malignancy with any certainty. Also, with RECIST, some findings can be deemed equivocal by radiologists with no confirmatory ground truth to rely on. In the specific case of Blinded Independent Central Review clinical trials with double reads using RECIST, the selection of equivocal tumors can have two major consequences: inter-reader variability and modified sensitivity of the therapeutic response. Apart from the main causes leading to the selection of an equivocal lesion, due to the uncertainty of the radiological characteristics or due to the censoring of on-site evaluations, several other situations can be described more precisely. These latter involve cases where an equivocal is selected as target or non-target lesions, the management of equivocal lymph nodes and the case of few target lesions. In all cases, awareness of the impact of selecting a non-malignant lesion will lead radiologists to make selections in the most rational way. Also, in clinical trials where the primary endpoint differs between phase 2 (response-related) and phase 3 (progression-related) trials, our impact analysis will help them to devise strategies for the management of equivocal lesions.

### Evaluation of overall response rate and progression-free survival as potential surrogate endpoints for overall survival in immunotherapy trials [^113gPxfX]. Clinical Cancer Research (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose: With the approval of immunotherapies for a variety of indications, methods to assess treatment benefit addressing the response patterns observed are important. We evaluated RECIST criteria-based overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) as potential surrogate endpoints of overall survival (OS), and explored a modified definition of PFS by altering the threshold percentage determining disease progression to assess the association with survival benefit in immunotherapy trials. Experimental Design: Thirteen randomized, multicenter, active-control trials containing immunotherapeutic agents submitted to the FDA were analyzed. Associations between treatment effects of ORR, PFS, modified PFS, and OS were evaluated at individual and trial levels. Patient-level responder analysis was performed for PFS and OS. Results: The coefficient of determination (R²) measured the strength of associations, where values near 1 imply surrogacy and values close to 0 suggest no association. At the trial level, the association between hazard ratios (HR) of PFS and OS was R² = 0.1303, and between the odds ratio (OR) of ORR and HR of OS was R² = 0.1277. At the individual level, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between PFS and OS was 0.61. Trial-level associations between modified PFS and OS ranged between 0.07 and 0.1, and individual-level correlations were approximately 0.6. HRs of PFS and OS for responders versus nonresponders were 0.129 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.11–0.15] and 0.118 (95% CI, 0.11–0.13), respectively. Conclusions: Although responders exhibited longer survival and PFS than nonresponders, the trial-level and individual-level associations were weak between PFS/ORR and OS. Modifications to PFS did not improve associations. Clin Cancer Res; 24(10); 2268–75. ©2018 AACR See related commentary by Korn and Freidlin, p. 2239.

### Radiologic assessment of response to therapy: comparison of RECIST versions 1.1 and 1.0 [^1145TPXx]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

Improvements in radiologic imaging technology and therapeutic options available for management of tumors have necessitated the revision of guidelines for the imaging-based assessment of tumor response to therapy. The purpose of this article is to familiarize radiologists with the modifications to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) that have been incorporated in the latest version of the guidelines, RECIST 1.1. The most important differences between this version and the previous one, RECIST 1.0, include reductions in the maximum number of lesions per patient and per organ that may be targeted for measurement, augmentation of the criteria defining progressive disease, additional guidelines for reporting findings of lesions that are too small to measure and for measuring lesions that appear to have fragmented or coalesced at follow-up imaging, new criteria for characterizing lymphadenopathy, new criteria for selecting bone lesions and cystic lesions as targets for measurement, and the inclusion of findings at positron emission tomography among the indicators of disease response.

### How does target lesion selection affect RECIST? A computer simulation study [^111YmCTj]. Investigative Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) is grounded on the assumption that target lesion selection is objective and representative of the change in total tumor burden (TTB) during therapy. A computer simulation model was designed to challenge this assumption, focusing on a particular aspect of subjectivity: target lesion selection.

Materials and Methods

Disagreement among readers and the disagreement between individual reader measurements and TTB were analyzed as a function of the total number of lesions, affected organs, and lesion growth.

Results

Disagreement rises when the number of lesions increases, when lesions are concentrated on a few organs, and when lesion growth borders the thresholds of progressive disease and partial response. There is an intrinsic methodological error in the estimation of TTB via RECIST 1.1, which depends on the number of lesions and their distributions. For example, for a fixed number of lesions at 5 and 15, distributed over a maximum of 4 organs, the error rates are observed to be 7.8% and 17.3%, respectively.

Conclusions

Our results demonstrate that RECIST can deliver an accurate estimate of TTB in localized disease, but fails in cases of distal metastases and multiple organ involvement. This is worsened by the "selection of the largest lesions", which introduces a bias that makes it hardly possible to perform an accurate estimate of the TTB. Including more (if not all) lesions in the quantitative analysis of tumor burden is desirable.

### Reviewing RECIST in the era of prolonged and targeted therapy [^113jkfcx]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Accurate assessment of disease response is the foundation of therapeutic trails, which is why the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) serve as an international standard that investigators can utilize when examining patient outcomes. Nine years after the initial RECIST criteria were released, an update, RECIST 1.1, was published to improve on the initial criteria and address technologic advancements in imaging. Since then, advancements in both standard clinical and trial practices, combined with improvements in our understanding of cancer biology, have resulted in the identification of a number of limitations of the current RECIST 1.1, either in lack of clear guidance with regard to its best application or in potential benefit of capturing imaging-related data beyond standard categorical response details. As several of these situations reflect the consequences of prolonged control of metastatic disease by using targeted therapies, thoracic oncology has generated many of the key scenarios requiring elucidation and/or improvements. This article specifically examines current controversies in the interpretation and/or optimal utilization of RECIST 1.1, focusing on examples from thoracic oncology, and makes proposals, where possible, on how best to address these issues. These situations include addressing central nervous system versus extra-central nervous system response and progression, depth of response, oligoprogression versus polyprogression, continuation of systemic therapy after use of a local ablative therapy, and the impact of fluctuations in measurements bridging partial response and stable disease categories during prolonged therapy.

### Evaluation of the optimal number of lesions needed for tumor evaluation using the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors: a north central cancer treatment group investigation [^117F9r7X]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

PURPOSE In February 2000, the criteria for measuring tumor shrinkage as an indicator of antitumor activity were redefined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). This resulted in simplifying bidimensional to unidimensional measurement of lesions. Under RECIST, all lesions, up to 10, must be measured. Scanning and measuring multiple lesions is costly, time-consuming, and a disincentive to participation in clinical trials. We investigated whether fewer than 10 lesions can be measured without compromising the accuracy of assessing a regimen's activity. PATIENTS AND METHODS Thirty-two North Central Cancer Treatment Group trials including 2,374 patients were analyzed. Twelve studies were conducted before RECIST; 20 were conducted post-RECIST. Agreement between objective status by cycle, confirmed response, overall response rate, and time to progression (TTP) was evaluated based on all 10 versus the largest one through five lesions. Results The median number of lesions reported on RECIST trials did not differ from pre-RECIST trials (median = 2.0). One lesion at baseline was reported in 49% of patients, two lesions in 28% of patients, three lesions in 12% of patients, four lesions in 6% of patients, and five lesions in 5% of patients in post-RECIST trials. Utilizing the largest two lesions produced excellent concordance with that using all lesions for all end points. In no trial did the overall response rate differ by more than 3% when two versus all lesions were considered. Evaluating more than two lesions did not significantly improve agreement. CONCLUSION Based on these trials, the assessment of more than two lesions did not alter the conclusions regarding a treatment's efficacy as judged by response rate or TTP.

### Are radiologists ready to evaluate true response to immunotherapy? [^114Haqnw]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Standardized response criteria for evaluating patients radiological imaging have an essential role in oncological management. Immunotherapy, using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including drugs targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 and programmed cell death protein 1 or its ligand, promise a new role that has demonstrated improvement management in cancers resistant to chemotherapy. This article reviews the literature to understand the most useful response evaluation criteria for optimal patient management under immunotherapy treatment. Areas that warrant further research are described.

Conclusion

In conclusion, ICIs have become more widely accepted and used by medical oncologists. Radiologists face challenges in assessing tumor response and becoming more involved in the management of treatment. The latest published immune-RECIST criteria can be used in response assessment, but further prospective evaluation is needed with registration clinical trials to be definitively validated.

### RECIST 1.1 assessments variability: a systematic pictorial review of blinded double reads [^111s3Ujv]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Response evaluation criteria and RECIST 1.1 variability factors

In oncology, response evaluation criteria supply standardized reading rules to capture the evolution of cancer disease. These criteria have been shown to correlate with the gold standard of cancer treatment efficacy, which is ultimately "overall survival". Because Overall Survival is often a costly gold standard to refer to, in terms of patient benefits and trial resources, surrogate endpoints are accepted by drug approval agencies as primary endpoints in clinical trials. The aim of Phase 2 studies is to evaluate treatment efficacy through a response objective, i.e. the "overall response rate", hypothesizing that a decrease in tumor size theoretically correlated with a benefit on survival. Phase 3 trials confirm the benefit of a large population through a progression-free survival objective. A response evaluation criterion is designed to support those clinical trial aims. Commonly, response criteria define an initial baseline status which is then compared at fixed intervals over time. The definition of the reference disease is quantified for one part and qualified for the other part. The semi-quantitative nature of baseline assessment lies in the fact that part of the disease may not be reliably measured, or measurement is too demanding. During follow-up, evaluations must be consistent with the baseline-defined disease and additionally, the appearance of new tumor lesions is scrutinized.

### A European society of oncologic imaging (ESOI) survey on the radiological assessment of response to oncologic treatments in clinical practice [^111ScxB7]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

To overcome the lack of rules, responders suggest either to use RECIST or personal criteria, usually a combination of unidimensional and bidimensional measurements of the most significant target lesions. Differently from RECIST, many responders suggest comparing the last time-point with the previous study, instead of baseline and nadir. A major concern of responders is that structured reporting is more time-consuming than a narrative report; this can be overcome by using specialized software. In conclusion, based on this survey, we believe it is important to define rules for the assessment of tumor response in clinical practice. The broader oncology community should take charge of their implementation.

### Evaluation of the response to treatment of solid tumours-a consensus statement of the international cancer imaging society [^116rGZ8r]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

There are several challenges regarding tumour measurements. The RECIST criteria of adoption of a single measurement (long axis) state that measurement is to be made only in the axial plane for CT. With MR and multislice CT, longitudinal or oblique measurements as well as axial measurements can now be made readily. Three-dimensional (3D) assessment and measurement of solid tumours is now available in many institutions. Its widespread use will clearly depend upon penetration of the acquisition devices needed for these data as well as the advanced computer workstations needed to perform accurate 3D quantification. Three-dimensional measurement is not addressed within the new criteria but may be important in the future, particularly with the advent of highly sophisticated volumetric scanning techniques (including multichannel CT and volumetric MRI) capable of acquiring isotropic imaging data. The use of 3D volume measurement has already been substantiated in several studies. Lymph node involvement by tumour is different from other common soft tissue tumour sites. It is well recognised, especially in the radiology literature, that lymph nodes should be measured in the short axis dimension as this is the best predictor of the presence of metastatic disease (Figure 1 Figure 1 Patient with non-small cell lung cancer on chemotherapy. Evidence of enlarged subcarinal lymph node measuring 3.4 × 2.9 cm at baseline (A), which has decreased in size to 3.4 × 2.0 cm at subsequent follow-up (B).). Furthermore, in complete remission after treatment, lymph nodes return to normal size yet the nodes may remain visible. However, complete remission cannot be designated to such nodes because the normal size of the nodes on an individual basis is not known. Specialised criteria have already been created to address this issue in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Similar difficulties apply to designating complete remission in other structures, for example, the adrenal glands, the vaginal vault, bladder wall, etc. Most tumours within the body (except lung metastases) grow irregularly and also regress in an irregular manner. It is true, and has been well documented that at baseline or any one time point, there is good correlation between the maximal tumour diameter, bidimensional measurement and tumour volume. However, tumours do not necessarily grow or shrink in a rounded fashion. In fact, lymph nodes frequently grow to a greater extent in the short axis. Therefore, measurement of the longest diameter on sequential scans may not represent the true response. Issues surrounding cystic tumours are problematic. The RECIST states that cystic lesions should be regarded as nonmeasurable. Many lesions have cystic/necrotic centres that may change on treatment and indeed metastases in the liver may be cystic de novo (e.g. non-seminomatous germ cell tumours, ovarian cancer). While it is recognised that certain 'cystic tumours' increase in size on effective treatment (e.g. non-seminomatous germ cell tumour metastases;), the statement that all cystic lesions should be regarded as nonmeasurable is, in our view, too wide. Although tumours with cystic/necrotic centres should be avoided as targets if possible, tumours with cystic/necrotic centres may also be included in the assessment but a comment should be made documenting changes in tumour composition. In those tumour types where the phenomenon of 'cystic enlargement' is well recognised, for example, non-seminomatous germ cell tumours, appropriate note should be made. The criteria completely ignore other changes in lesion consistency such as calcification, necrosis or haemorrhage. These phenomena, which may develop only on treatment, may influence changes in tumour size. While such phenomena have no clear prognostic implications, it is only by documentation of such findings that progress in assessing response with morphological assessment will be made. Another potential pitfall in simple tumour measurements in response assessment is the issue of lesion calcification. Calcification in response assessment may be seen in metastases to the lymph nodes, liver or peritoneum. Response assessment is not well assessed by simple measurement in these cases (Figure 2 Figure 2 Partially calcified liver metastases from colorectal cancer imaged at baseline (A) and at a 6-week interval follow-up (B). The soft tissue masses surrounding the calcification have decreased in size – the overall mass including the calcification has either stayed stable or increased.). Other types of lesions are also difficult to measure unidimensionally or for that matter bidimensionally. For instance, en-plaque lesions frequently diminish in the short axis plane rather than in their long axis. Furthermore, the measurement of en-plaque lesion length can be particularly difficult as the plane of imaging is frequently in the same plane as the long axis of tumour growth. For the first time, the RECIST criteria have provided imaging guidelines for both spiral and conventional CT, which is commendable and a great achievement, as it has standardised imaging protocols across sites performing these studies. The rapid advancement of imaging technology over the last few years has, however, rendered the protocols detailed in Appendix I outdated in many radiology departments undertaking clinical trials. These protocols require updating for multidetector CT. Such protocols should be reviewed on a regular basis. It would be preferable for criteria such as RECIST to provide a guideline for the selection of imaging modalities and technologies and standard mechanisms for creating disease- and modality-specific imaging protocols. In this manner, the precise clinical trial protocols could be defined based upon these guidelines and the more general RECIST criteria would still be relevant. For example, as outlined in RECIST, the specific concept of slice thickness relative to spiral CT data acquisition is already obsolete, but a general mechanism of defining slice thickness relative to lesion size would still be relevant. In the RECIST criteria, the authors state that it is not acceptable to switch between windows when measuring lesions, but 'in the lung it does not really matter whether lung or soft tissue windows are used for intraparenchymal lesions'. We do not agree with this statement, which may be misleading to the uninitiated. It is possible to see substantial differences in size and texture of lung lesions by viewing them on lung and soft tissue windows. It is our recommendation that the window settings must be optimised to best visualise the lesion, and lesions should be viewed on multiple window settings but consistent windowing must be used for subsequent assessments. We believe that the lung window settings are the optimal ones for obtaining measurements of all parenchymal lesions. There are new, novel methods of assessing disease response in areas, such as bone, that are difficult to assess, and have been considered nonmeasureable according to RECIST. For instance, there is now evidence that MR imaging may be a useful method of assessing response to therapy both in breast cancer and in other tumours. Other tumour types including prostate are not amenable to assessment by RECIST since the burden of disease in many patients is in the bone. Although the sum of all lesions measured provides an indication of total tumour burden, such arithmetic sums may disguise differential tumour response. Such discrepancy of response has not been addressed with the new RECIST criteria. A guideline concerning the number of lesions to include in measurement is helpful and an advantage of RECIST over the WHO criteria, which provided no directives in this regard. In fact, cooperative groups have adopted a specific number of lesions by appending the RECIST criteria. However, to our knowledge, there is no evidence provided for the scientific basis of the need to measure multiple lesions (up to 10 lesions). Interestingly, Cheson in a report of an international workshop to standardise response criteria for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas noted a paucity of data for the number of lesions to measure and included an arbitrary number in their criteria, but left open to further discussion. The critical issue is in fact the number of lesions that are needed to be measured to have a consistent response assessment — either by the same observer or another observer, that is, to decrease variability in response assessment based upon choosing a different set of lesions. Preliminary data and experience would suggest that for certain tumours it is not necessary to measure as many as 10 lesions.

### Measures of response: RECIST, WHO, and new alternatives [^113qTaDp]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) is a widely employed method introduced in 2000 to assess change in tumor size in response to therapy. The simplicity of the technique, however, contrasts sharply with the increasing sophistication of imaging instrumentation. Anatomically based imaging measurement, although supportive of drug development and key to some accelerated drug approvals, is being pressed to improve its methodologic robustness, particularly in the light of more functionally-based imaging that is sensitive to tissue molecular response such as fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Nevertheless ready availability of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging machines largely assures anatomically based imaging a continuing role in clinical trials for the foreseeable future. Recent advances in image processing enabled by the computational power of modern clinical scanners open a considerable opportunity to characterize tumor response to therapy as a complement to image acquisition. Various alternative quantitative volumetric approaches have been proposed but have yet to gain wide acceptance by clinical and regulatory communities, nor have these more complex techniques shown incontrovertible evidence of greater reproducibility or predictive value of clinical events and outcome. Unless plans are created for clinical trials that incorporate the design needed to prove the added value and unique clinical utility of these novel approaches, any theoretical benefit of these more elaborate methods could remain unfulfilled.

### Automatic tool of response evaluation in solid tumors | FDA… [^1165Lr3s]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

- **Authors**:

- **Center**: Abstract Introduction Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors is a set of guidelines used to evaluate the response of anti-cancer drugs. The response is necessary to determine the effectiveness of the tumor treatment. A complete response is the disappearance of all tumors. A partial response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions, taking the baseline sum LD as reference. A stable disease is neither sufficient shrinkage nor increase to qualify for either PR or PD. A progressive disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of the target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of LD recorded since treatment started. Objective Generating an in-house R program to apply the guidelines of RECIST 1.

1. The program needs to generate consistent and accurate results.

Method Tumor data containing the sizes and conditions of tumors as well as the sponsor's assigned response were used for analysis. An R program was coded in-house to analyze tumor response according to RECIST criteria. Analysis results regarding CR, PR, SD, PD were compared with those generated from the sponsor. Results We found that the RECIST response categories produced by the in-house R program were approximately 90% accurate to those provided by the independent sponsors. The inconsistency with the sponsor's defined categories is likely due to the fact that the sponsor used the old guidelines of RECIST 1. 0, while the in-house R program used the new guidelines of RECIST 1.

1. Conclusion The existing in-house R program can be used to generate tumor response categories according to RECIST 1.

However, modification is required because the 10% inconsistency with the sponsor's results needs to be addressed before we can use it for decision-making.

### Quantitative evaluation of lesion response heterogeneity for superior prognostication of clinical outcome [^116bfjza]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Due to the high prevalence of intra-patient response heterogeneity across many types of metastatic cancer, measurement of treatment response in all individual disease sites across the body is imperative. Positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) are commonly used to monitor response to therapy in metastatic cancer patients, as they provide a non-invasive method of measuring anatomic and functional changes across the whole body. Measuring response in all disease sites, particularly with whole body PET/CT images, is labor-intensive. Thus, a limited subset of lesions selected based on size or PET uptake is used for the sake of feasibility. As a result, treatment response heterogeneity is often difficult to appreciate as the treating provider only has access to semi-quantitative or descriptive reports interpreted from a subset of lesions present.

Several guidelines to standardize treatment response reporting, particularly in context of clinical trials, where improvements in the "mean" has been used to determine which treatment option was better, have been developed. These include the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), World Health Organization (WHO) Criteria, Positron Emission tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) and Deauville Score. The RECIST and WHO criteria were initially developed in the era of cytotoxic chemotherapy and therefore used changes in tumor size as an endpoint for clinical trials, assuming that a higher proportion of tumor shrinkage would reflect improvement in overall survival. RECIST and WHO guidelines stated that "mixed response" was uncommon, thus the assessment of a limited number of lesions was adequate to prioritize agents and choose dosing regimens for late-phase clinical trials. Based on that, RECIST 1.1 later changed the number of assessed lesions from 10 to 5, and preserved the unidimensional measurement (WHO used 2 dimensional measurement) as a way to simplify yet provide "sufficient" standardization for clinical trials. PERCIST was developed for [18 F]Fluoro-2-deoxy-2-D-glucose (FDG) PET with a similar goal of standardizing response and allowing comparison between trials. PERCIST is predominantly based on change in the lesions with the highest FDG uptake. Limitations include change in non-target and new lesions, which defers to clinical judgement or a subjective determination of whether it meets "unequivocal" progression. Nevertheless, all these criteria rely on the "sum of change" in target lesions, thus ignoring the impact of each individual lesion in the evaluation of treatment response heterogeneity.

### Evaluation of the response to treatment of solid tumours-a consensus statement of the international cancer imaging society [^113gUqBS]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

New guidelines to evaluate the response to treatment in solid tumors using imaging techniques have major limitations and important implications for radiological workload. This consensus statement from the International Cancer Imaging Society (ICIS) reviews the RECIST criteria and addresses several challenges regarding tumour measurement. Recommendations are made regarding tumour measurement and other issues are raised. The growing need to introduce a multimodality approach to monitoring response is recognized. ICIS welcomes a dialogue with the authors of RECIST to address issues raised in this review.

### ESR essentials: response assessment criteria in oncologic imaging-practice recommendations by the European society of oncologic imaging [^111gpkvR]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient summary

Imaging plays a fundamental role in assessing the response to treatment in oncological patients because it provides essential information related to prognosis and survival. Specific criteria have been developed to evaluate CT and MRI in patients enrolled in clinical trials, and radiologists should be aware of them. The principles of these criteria can also be applied to reporting exams in patients not enrolled in clinical trials.

### Response criteria in oncologic imaging: review of traditional and new criteria [^112b8Z66]. Radiographics (2013). Low credibility.

There has been a proliferation and divergence of imaging-based tumor-specific response criteria over the past 3 decades whose purpose is to achieve objective assessment of treatment response in oncologic clinical trials. The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, published in 1981, were the first response criteria and made use of bidimensional measurements of tumors. The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) were created in 2000 and revised in 2009. The RECIST criteria made use of unidimensional measurements and addressed several pitfalls and limitations of the original WHO criteria. Both the WHO and RECIST criteria were developed during the era of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents and are still widely used. However, treatment strategies changed over the past decade, and the limitations of using tumor size alone in patients undergoing targeted therapy (including arbitrarily determined cutoff values to categorize tumor response and progression, lack of information about changes in tumor attenuation, inability to help distinguish viable tumor from nonviable components, and inconsistency of size measurements) necessitated revision of these criteria. More recent criteria that are used for targeted therapies include the Choi response criteria for gastrointestinal stromal tumor, modified RECIST criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma, and Immune-related Response Criteria for melanoma. The Cheson criteria and Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors make use of positron emission tomography to provide functional information and thereby help determine tumor viability. As newer therapeutic agents and approaches become available, it may be necessary to further modify existing anatomy-based response-assessment methodologies, verify promising functional imaging methods in large prospective trials, and investigate new quantitative imaging technologies.

### RECIST 1.1 and lesion selection: how to deal with ambiguity at baseline? [^112Ce9PB]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Risk and mitigations

RECIST guidelines provide detailed recommendations on managing an equivocal progression based on ambiguous new lesions or NTL. In a previous edition of RECIST, it is suggested that this situation should be clarified using another later assessment. Unfortunately, management of equivocal baseline lesions is not described in the initial RECIST guidelines whereas the baseline selection of TL and NTL appears to be essential.

Preventive strategies

As previously mentioned, equivocal lesions may be revealed at the initial baseline RECIST evaluation and these lesions have diverse causal factors (Table 2). Actionable strategies to prevent their occurrence are linked to image acquisition and to study design:
Before the images are submitted to the radiologist, the technicians play an important role in achieving quality control by ensuring the absence of artefacts and compliance with the acquisition protocol.
The acquisition protocol, comprising both non-contrast and multiphasic acquisition at baseline, should be the rule in order to facilitate differentiation between liquid/solid and malignant/benign enhancement profiles (e.g. liver angioma). This recommendation applies to all types of cancer especially when the trial does not include access to previous exams. According to the protocol, scintigraphy or multiparametric MR modality could be performed for baseline examination to improve characterization of possible bone, brain, liver anomalies. Off-protocol images performed on-site, e.g. additional MR examination to clear up small equivocal lesions, should also be collected and provided to the central review.
When the RECIST evaluation is blinded or performed during a centralized review, the ability to assess a previous scan before baseline would help clarify certain potentially equivocal lesions. Previous radiation therapy information and the results of any biopsy should also be provided accurately to the radiologist to help him/her select the target more confidently at baseline. Some flexibility regarding the blinding will be needed to accommodate inevitable feasibility constraints.

### Limitations with the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) guidance in disseminated pediatric malignancy [^11568fgx]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) guidelines were published in 2000 to evaluate response to treatment in solid tumors. These have sought to unify response assessment, and the new guidelines extend beyond lesion assessment to address modern imaging strategies. The RECIST guidelines, however, become complex and problematic when used to evaluate metastatic disease.

Methods

Ten consecutive oncology cases representative of tumors common to our pediatric practice were selected. All cases were evaluated at initial presentation and follow-up. The RECIST criteria were retrospectively applied in each case. A standardized evaluation form was used.

Results

The age range of the patients included in the study was 1 month to 16 years, with a mean age of 3.9 years. A range of tumor responses was identified: partial response (n = 6), stable disease (n = 2), and progressive disease (n = 2). Two of these responses were likely incorrect. Tumor bulk was underestimated in the axial plane, many lesions were either calcified and unmeasurable, or despite being well-defined were too small to be measurable under the strict RECIST guidance.

Conclusion

In highlighting specific problems with disseminated pediatric tumors, we emphasize the pressing need for debate regarding the application of RECIST in pediatric oncology and encourage the development of a pediatric radiology oncology group to collaborate in future modifications of the RECIST guidance.

### Oncogene-addicted metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer: ESMO clinical practice guideline for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^115tvbXp]. Annals of Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for non-small cell lung cancer, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response (genotype-driven therapy), ESMO 2023 guidelines recommend to follow the RECIST for measurements and response assessment.
Recognize that the clinical relevance of the RECIST in evaluating the response remains debatable as patients can derive benefit from continuing the same TKIs after RECIST v1.1 progression.

### RECIST 1.1 and lesion selection: how to deal with ambiguity at baseline? [^113c7Da5]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

RECIST advocates choosing lesions at all disease sites and a maximum of 2 target lesions (TL) per organ. Although conforming with the guidelines, some radiologists would probably consider it more relevant to select a larger number of TL, while others would select fewer TLs and advance sound reasons for their choice.

In addition, the measurability criteria stipulated by RECIST for selecting TL include not only size (≥ 10 mm for non-nodal lesions) but also measurement reliability and reproducibility. These last two items are subjective and leave room for individual readers to select their own targets. Moreover, reproducibility is an unforeseeable feature of TLs since it can only be confirmed once the longitudinal analysis is complete.

The factors responsible for the variability of baseline selection patterns are listed in Table 1.

Factors of inter-reader variability for selecting lesion at baseline following RECIST 1.1 guidance

RECIST endpoints aligned with clinical trials outcomes

The RECIST endpoints are used in drug development as surrogate imaging biomarkers.

In clinical trials, and depending on the phase of development, radiographic assessment is performed to generate an endpoint related to progression of the disease and/or response to therapy. Moreover, this surrogate endpoint is critical to the study outcome if it is taken as the primary endpoint. To ensure correct assessments, the FDA recommends procedural and methodological standards, including imaging-related recommendations. The main objective of these recommendations is to reduce evaluation bias and guarantee comparable evaluation standards.

A blinded Independent Centralized Review (BICR) is the recommended option. The procedure for reading might involve two radiologists. For these double reviews, an adjudicator is needed if the readers generate discordant assessments. The discrepancy rate is a key indicator for monitoring ongoing clinical trials using radiology.

Baseline target selection is a critical process in quality assessment as differences in baseline target selection are known to be major causes of discrepancy.

For this reason, the absence of a strategy designed to reduce equivocal situations at baseline or the lack of clear reading rules when encountering such situations entails two risks for clinical trials.
First, during a double reading paradigm, the selection of equivocal lesions at baseline contributes to inter-reader variability and thus increases the discrepancy rate. Subsequently, it increases the cost of the trial due to more frequent recourse to the adjudicator.
Second, if the equivocal lesion turns out to be non-malignant, it will directly impact the study endpoint by reducing its sensitivity to the drug response.

In the sections below, we will describe measures aimed to prevent and cope with equivocal lesions during RECIST baseline evaluation.
