## Question

strong urine odor

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage strong urine odor. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the odor is new, persistent, or accompanied by symptoms. Then, I should verify the most common benign causes versus red flags. Next, I will review medication and dietary contributors, followed by infectious and metabolic etiologies. After that, I need to check the diagnostic approach, including when to order urinalysis and culture. Finally, I will consider management strategies and when to refer, making sure I align with stewardship and guideline-based care.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because timing and associated symptoms drive the workup. A new, persistent, or recurrent strong odor warrants attention, whereas a transient change after dietary intake is usually benign. I should ask about dysuria, frequency, urgency, fever, flank pain, hematuria, altered mental status, and gastrointestinal or neurologic symptoms, and I should confirm hydration status and urine concentration, since concentrated urine can smell stronger without indicating disease [^117XeZs7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about infection just because the urine smells strong. I need to check whether the odor is accompanied by localizing urinary symptoms or systemic signs; otherwise, I risk overdiagnosing asymptomatic bacteriuria. In older adults, foul-smelling urine alone is a weak predictor of UTI, and in children, parental reports of smelly urine do not correlate with culture-confirmed UTI, so I should avoid anchoring on odor alone [^114WvDzQ] [^112Zc92t].

> Next, I should review medications and diet, because these are common, reversible drivers of odor. Let me consider asparagus, which causes a characteristic odor in a large proportion of people due to olfactory receptor variation; I should also ask about thiol-containing agents like alpha-lipoic acid, which commonly causes urine odor, and methenamine hippurate, which can irritate the bladder and alter smell. I need to remember that isopropanol ingestion produces acetone and a sweet or fruity odor, and that cresol or phenol exposures can impart a carbolic smell and signal toxicity [^114XtCVW] [^1114NCxx] [^113F91hT] [^111jo1ZN] [^112WVvWQ].

> I will now examine infectious etiologies, but I should confirm that I am not overcalling bacteriuria. Uncomplicated cystitis can present with malodorous urine alongside dysuria, frequency, or urgency, and bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis can produce a fishy odor that patients may perceive as urinary. In men, chronic bacterial prostatitis can be associated with foul-smelling urine, but again, I should correlate with symptoms and objective findings before treating [^117XeZs7] [^113wk5oq] [^114Gj5f3] [^114j6A3u].

> But wait, what if the odor reflects a metabolic disorder rather than infection. I need to check for maple syrup urine disease in infants with a sweet, burnt sugar odor and neurologic compromise, and trimethylaminuria in patients with a persistent fishy odor to sweat, breath, and urine due to FMO3 deficiency. I should also remember that phenylketonuria can cause a musty body odor, though the urine odor is less specific, and that medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency management with carnitine can worsen body odor in some patients [^116owhD2] [^115bXwWt] [^114YqvDD] [^115u3hwX].

> Let me think about the diagnostic approach. First, I should confirm whether there are compatible urinary symptoms; if none are present, I should avoid testing and reassure. If symptoms are present, I should obtain a urinalysis with microscopy and, if positive for pyuria or nitrites or if symptoms persist, a urine culture. I should double-check collection technique and ensure a midstream clean-catch specimen when feasible, and I should avoid culturing from a catheter bag unless there is no alternative, given contamination risk and low yield [^117XeZs7] [^1168RwuQ] [^116aGNZ8].

> Hold on, I should verify stewardship principles so I do not over-treat. I must not treat asymptomatic bacteriuria except in specific indications like pregnancy or before urologic procedures, and I should avoid reflex antibiotics for cloudy or malodorous urine without localizing symptoms. In recurrent UTI care, guidelines advise against surveillance testing or treating malodorous urine in the absence of acute lower urinary tract symptoms, so I need to document symptoms clearly before prescribing [^1168RwuQ] [^115cGfid].

> Next, I should review management by cause. For benign dietary or medication-related odors, I will counsel on triggers and consider alternatives if bothersome. For suspected UTI, I should tailor antibiotics to local resistance patterns and patient factors, and consider delayed prescribing strategies to reduce unnecessary use. For suspected metabolic disease, I should refer urgently to genetics or endocrinology for confirmatory testing and dietary management. For toxic exposures such as cresol or salicylates, I should initiate supportive care and consult toxicology promptly [^116WfkPT] [^116owhD2] [^112WVvWQ] [^1135chJ3].

> I should double-check special populations. In older adults, I need to ensure that new confusion or falls are not reflexively attributed to UTI without compatible urinary symptoms, given the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and the limited diagnostic value of odor alone. In children, I should avoid relying on parental reports of smell to diagnose UTI and instead base decisions on urinalysis and culture when clinically indicated [^114WvDzQ] [^112Zc92t].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. Strong urine odor is a nonspecific finding that requires correlation with symptoms and objective testing; most cases are benign or medication- and diet-related, but persistent or unexplained odors warrant a focused evaluation for infection, metabolic disease, or toxicity. Adhering to diagnostic stewardship and guideline-based care prevents overdiagnosis and overtreatment while ensuring we do not miss serious disease [^1168RwuQ] [^115cGfid].

Strong urine odor is most often due to **dehydration** or **diet** (asparagus, coffee, garlic, brussels sprouts) [^117XeZs7] and is not concerning if it resolves with hydration or dietary change. Persistent or unusually strong odors can signal **medical issues** such as UTI, diabetes, liver disease, or metabolic disorders (e.g. maple syrup urine disease, trimethylaminuria) [^116owhD2] [^115bXwWt]. Red flags include fever, pain, blood, or neurologic symptoms; these warrant **urgent evaluation**. Initial workup should include urinalysis, glucose, and liver enzymes; further testing (culture, metabolic panel, imaging) is guided by results and symptoms [^117XeZs7]. Management targets the cause: antibiotics for UTI, dietary restriction for metabolic disease, and hydration for concentrated urine [^116WfkPT] [^116owhD2].

---

## Common benign causes

Several **benign factors** commonly cause strong urine odor:

- **Dehydration**: Concentrated urine has a stronger odor; resolving with hydration [^117XeZs7].
- **Diet**: Asparagus, coffee, garlic, onions, and brussels sprouts can impart distinct odors [^111JFs6c].
- **Medications/supplements**: Antibiotics (e.g. amoxicillin), B vitamins, and alpha-lipoic acid can alter urine odor [^1114NCxx].

## Medical conditions associated with strong urine odor

Persistent or unusually strong urine odor may indicate **underlying medical conditions**:

| **Medical condition** | **Associated odor description** | **Additional symptoms** |
|-|-|-|
| Urinary tract infection (UTI) | Foul, ammonia-like | - Dysuria <br/> - Frequency <br/> - Urgency <br/> - Fever [^117XeZs7] |
| Diabetes mellitus (uncontrolled) | Sweet, fruity | - Polyuria <br/> - Polydipsia <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - Fatigue [^113PehAx] |
| Diabetic ketoacidosis | Fruity, acetone-like | - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Abdominal pain <br/> - Confusion [^113PehAx] |
| Liver disease (hepatic encephalopathy) | Musty, mousy | - Jaundice <br/> - Confusion <br/> - Fatigue <br/> - Dark urine [^notfound] |
| Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) | Sweet, maple syrup-like | - Poor feeding <br/> - Lethargy <br/> - Seizures <br/> - Developmental delay [^116owhD2] |
| Trimethylaminuria (fish odor syndrome) | Fishy | - No other organic signs <br/> - Psychosocial distress [^115bXwWt] |
| Phenylketonuria (PKU) | Musty, mousy | - Intellectual disability <br/> - Seizures <br/> - Hypopigmentation <br/> - Eczema [^114YqvDD] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When strong urine odor persists or is accompanied by concerning symptoms, a **structured diagnostic approach** is recommended:

- **History and physical examination**: Assess hydration, diet, medications, and associated symptoms (fever, dysuria, abdominal pain, neurologic symptoms) [^117XeZs7].
- **Urinalysis**: Evaluate for infection, glucose, ketones, protein, and specific gravity [^117XeZs7].
- **Urine culture**: Identify causative organisms in suspected UTI [^117XeZs7].
- **Blood tests**: Glucose, liver function tests, renal function tests, and metabolic panels as indicated [^notfound].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound or CT scan if structural abnormalities are suspected (e.g. obstruction, stones) [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Hydration**: Increase fluid intake for dehydration-related odor [^117XeZs7].
- **Dietary modifications**: Avoid odor-causing foods if problematic [^notfound].
- **Antibiotics**: Treat confirmed UTIs [^116WfkPT].
- **Glycemic control**: Optimize diabetes management [^notfound].
- **Dietary restrictions**: For metabolic disorders (e.g. MSUD, PKU, trimethylaminuria) [^116owhD2] [^115bXwWt].
- **Medication adjustments**: Discontinue or change offending drugs when feasible [^notfound].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Medical evaluation is indicated if strong urine odor is accompanied by any of the following:

- Fever, chills, or flank pain (possible UTI or pyelonephritis) [^117XeZs7].
- Dysuria, frequency, or urgency (possible UTI) [^117XeZs7].
- Unexplained weight loss, fatigue, or thirst (possible diabetes or metabolic disorder) [^113PehAx].
- Neurologic symptoms, seizures, or developmental delay (possible metabolic disorder) [^116owhD2].
- Persistent odor despite hydration and dietary changes [^notfound].

---

Strong urine odor is **usually benign** and related to hydration or diet, but persistent or unusually strong odors can signal medical conditions. A focused history, urinalysis, and targeted testing guide diagnosis and management, which should address the underlying cause to resolve the odor.

### Urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^117XeZs7]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A complete urinalysis includes physical, chemical, and microscopic examinations. Midstream clean collection is acceptable in most situations, but the specimen should be examined within two hours of collection. Cloudy urine often is a result of precipitated phosphate crystals in alkaline urine, but pyuria also can be the cause. A strong odor may be the result of a concentrated specimen rather than a urinary tract infection. Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false-positive and false-negative results can occur. Specific gravity provides a reliable assessment of the patient's hydration status. Microhematuria has a range of causes, from benign to life threatening. Glomerular, renal, and urologic causes of microhematuria often can be differentiated by other elements of the urinalysis. Although transient proteinuria typically is a benign condition, persistent proteinuria requires further work-up. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections diagnosed by positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests can be treated without culture.

### A case of black urine and dark skin-cresol poisoning [^112WVvWQ]. Clinical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cresol is a phenol derivative used as a disinfectant worldwide. Acute cresol poisoning is potentially fatal as it may cause multiple organ failure. We present a case of acute cresol intoxication in a male patient to illustrate the effects of cresol poisoning.

Case

A 42-year-old male presented with black urine, painless brownish dermal burns, and a strong carbolic acid odor. The patient was immediately resuscitated with adequate oxygenation and aggressive fluid resuscitation. He was subsequently admitted to the intensive care unit, where his treatment course was complicated by pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic dysfunction, and acute renal failure. After receiving supportive intensive care, the patient recovered and was discharged with no sequelae.

Conclusion

The distinctive clinical features of this case may be useful in diagnosis, because laboratory analytical methods for cresols are not routinely available at most hospitals.

### Principles of diagnostic stewardship: a practical guide from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America diagnostic stewardship task force [^1168RwuQ]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic stewardship — urine cultures — Avoid testing in nonspecific clinical syndromes (eg, leukocytosis, isolated fever, fatigue, and fall), do not order based on odor or smell, and educate on prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and lack of treatment benefit. For collection, do not collect from catheter bag and only culture urine if pyuria present on urinalysis. For reporting, use selective and cascade reporting to help tailor antibiotic choices and add comments to nudge toward only using antibiotics with true symptoms of UTI.

8 THE ROLE OF CHOLINE IN MALODOR

Gut microbiota specifically processes choline, PC, carnitine, and other dietary nutrients to produce trimethylamine (TMA). TMA is absorbed in the gut and converted in the liver to TMA N‐oxide (TMAO) by hepatic flavin‐containing monooxygenases (eg, FMO3). Autosomal recessive variants in FMO3 (MIM #602079) were shown to underlie trimethylaminuria or fish odor syndrome. 37 Affected individuals suffer from a strong, fishy body odor as the excess TMA is released in the person's sweat, urine, reproductive fluids, and breath. There are no other organic signs, but from a psychosocial perspective the condition can be devastating for affected individuals, attempted suicides have been reported. 38, 39

Results

Of 1413 websites identified, 1082 were excluded, and 331 were included in analyses (Table 1). Almost all (322 [97%]) websites mentioned at least 1 accurate UTI symptom (Table 2). However, most (264 [80%]) included at least 1 inaccurate UTI symptom. The most commonly mentioned inaccurate symptom was change in urine color (244 [74%]). Many websites (227 [69%]) also incorrectly included strong-smelling urine as a symptom. Few websites (31 [9%]) mentioned the term asymptomatic bacteriuria. Even fewer (9 [3%]) mentioned that symptoms need to be present to diagnose a true UTI. A minority (70 [21%]) of websites mentioned the possibility of antibiotic resistance on an individual level. Even fewer (29 [9%]) mentioned the possibility of global antibiotic resistance, or information about adverse reactions of antibiotics (28 [8%]). A full list of symptoms, diagnosis methods, treatment, and consequences of antibiotics overuse described on websites can be found in Table 2.

### Sniffing out significant "Pee values": genome wide association study of asparagus anosmia [^111JFs6c]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Outstanding questions on this topic remain; first and foremost perhaps is why a delicacy such as asparagus results in such a strong odor? Why does genetic variation across the olfactory receptor genes exist that leads to susceptibility to asparagus anosmia? What selective pressures — one way or the other — would drive different populations of people to have the ability to smell the metabolites of asparagus and others to not? And, will scientists take the results of our study and apply gene editing techniques to convert smellers to non-smellers?

This holiday season, try Apicius's asparagus recipe and generate a provocative discussion with your loved ones about the "filthy and disagreeable smell in the urine". Asparagus is not all contentious: make sure to serve the leaves as well to protect the liver against toxic insultsso that you can enjoy your holiday nightsand potentially alleviate that hangover the next day.

### Urine: waste product or biologically active tissue? [^112qKV3Z]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Historically, urine has been viewed primarily as a waste product with little biological role in the overall health of an individual. Increasingly, data suggest that urine plays a role in human health beyond waste excretion. For example, urine might act as an irritant and contribute to symptoms through interaction with-and potential compromise of-the urothelium.

Methods

To explore the concept that urine may be a vehicle for agents with potential or occult bioactivity and to discuss existing evidence and novel research questions that may yield insight into such a role, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease invited experts in the fields of comparative evolutionary physiology, basic science, nephrology, urology, pediatrics, metabolomics, and proteomics (among others) to a Urinology Think Tank meeting on February 9, 2015.

Results

This report reflects ideas that evolved from this meeting and current literature, including the concept of urine quality, the biological, chemical, and physical characteristics of urine, including the microbiota, cells, exosomes, pH, metabolites, proteins, and specific gravity (among others). Additionally, the manuscript presents speculative, and hopefully testable, ideas about the functional roles of urine constituents in health and disease.

Conclusion

Moving forward, there are several questions that need further understanding and pursuit. There were suggestions to consider actively using various animal models and their biological specimens to elaborate on basic mechanistic information regarding human bladder dysfunction.

### Anterior cingulate cortex and its input to the basolateral amygdala control innate fear response [^111UHxsT]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Next, we examined whether ACC-BLA projection controls fear response to other predator odors. For this purpose, we tested the effect of optogenetic inactivation of the ACC-BLA projection on freezing response to other predator urines. We first tested the freezing response to cat urine (Fig. 8a). The eNpHR3.0 was expressed in the bilateral ACC, and ACC-BLA projection was inhibited by the 560-nm light illumination in the BLA as before. In the presence of cat urine (10 mL of 100% wild cat urine (PeteRikards)), mice exhibited no significant change in freezing response with the photoinhibition (Fig. 8b–d). However, when coyote urine (10 mL of 100% coyote urine (Leg Up Enterprise)) was adopted as another predator odor to cause innate fear response (Fig. 8e), mice displayed a significant increase in freezing response with photoinhibition of ACC-BLA projection compared to eGFP control group (Fig. 8f–h). According to previous reports, cat urine may induce no or very weak fear response including freezing in rodents. Thus, it is likely that our optogenetic manipulation affected freezing elicited by coyote but not cat urine because cat urine does not provoke fear strongly. Nevertheless, because both cat and coyote urine provoked similar level of freezing at around 15–20%, our results do not exclude the possibility that ACC-BLA projection does not control innate freezing response to cat urine. Together, these results support that ACC-BLA projection has a general control function for the freezing response to the predator odor, but not specific to fox urine.

### Neonate with intrauterine xylazine exposure: a case report [^111PTZyF]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Fentanyl is a rising cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, affecting neonates exposed in utero. Xylazine, an alpha-2 receptor agonist, is a non-narcotic sedative that is becoming an increasingly common adulterant. There are case reports describing the clinical manifestations of xylazine exposure and toxicity in adult populations; however, cases involving neonatal populations are not described in the literature. Limitations of toxicology analyses for neonates cause delays in the identification and treatment of affected patients.

Case Summary

We present the case of a term neonate who presented to the neonatal intensive care unit with a strong foul-smelling odor, diffuse rash, hypertonicity, irritability, and inconsolability. This case describes additional symptoms that presented over the subsequent 120 hours of life, including sustained bradycardia, significant peripheral vasoconstriction, and focalization of odor to breath, urine, feces, and umbilical stump. Mass spectroscopy toxicology of the neonate's serum confirmed the presence of methamphetamine, fentanyl, multiple fentanyl metabolites, and xylazine. Management strategies are discussed, including the role of alpha-2 receptor agonists in treating withdrawal.

Clinical Significance

This case report presents clinical manifestations of xylazine toxicity and withdrawal in neonatal populations and highlights the need for additional attention on the effects of adulterants to improve management strategies. There is a need for improved toxicology testing to identify affected populations in a timely manner.

### Pianp deficiency links GABAreceptor signaling and hippocampal and cerebellar neuronal cell composition to autism-like behavior [^117HMjK4]. Molecular Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Cognition in Pianp -deficient mice

In the novel object recognition test (ORT) PianpKO and control mice both showed higher preference ratios for the novel object while exploration times did not significantly differ (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 10B). Although total exploration times were higher for PianpKO mice in both comparisons, in the object relocation test (OLT), however, only control mice showed a preference for the relocated object, while PianpKO mice did not show this preference (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 10C). Contextual and cued fear conditioning was performed successfully in PianpKO and control mice. Cue presentation resulted in similar freezing times. In context recall, however, PianpKO showed significantly lower freezing times (Fig. 4f). Taken together, PianpKO mice showed a specific deficit in spatial, but not nonspatial memory.

Abnormal social behavior in Pianp -deficient mice

As similar cerebellar anomalies as found in PianpKO mice were also described in human patients with ASD and murine models of the disease, social and repetitive autism-like behaviors were tested. In the social interaction test (SIT) control mice but not PianpKO mice showed a significantly different exploration time and preference for the social partner compared with the empty cage. Therefore, in contrast to control mice, PianpKO mice did not exhibit a normal preference for the chamber with a social partner. In comparing a known social partner (SP1) with a novel social partner (SP2) both PianpKO and control mice showed a preference for the novel social partner. However, the exploration times at SP1 and SP2 differed significantly only in control mice, indicating reduced interest of PianpKO mice in novel social interaction (Fig. 5a). In the odor discrimination test a general deficit in the discrimination of nonsocial odors could not be detected. The difference detected in the very first solvent control can likely be attributed to the increased stress response of PianpKO mice in novel settings. In the discrimination of social odors, PianpKO mice showed a significantly lower time sniffing at female urine, one of the strongest social cues, while sniffing time at water controls as well as at male urine did not significantly differ from control mice (Fig. 5b). Together, these results imply strong social impairment which in synopsis with the other results, i.e. repetitive behavior and enhanced anxiety, can be interpreted as autism-like behavior.

### Maple syrup urine disease diagnosed in a resource-limited setting in an infant in Nepal: a case report [^113MvXpY]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The biochemical parameters showed decreased random glucose (3.1 mmol/L) suggesting mild hypoglycemia, urea (1.6 mmol/L), creatinine (11µmol/L), sodium (131 mEq/L), potassium (5.2 mEq/L) and total calcium (2.4 mmol/L) under normal limits except for magnesium (0.7 mg/dl) which was low. Liver function tests were within normal limits. Blood and CSF cultures were sterile. IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE levels were normal. Venous blood gas showed respiratory alkalosis (pH:7.51; pCO₂:15.9 mmHg; HCO₃⁻:12.5 mEq/L) with metabolic compensation and normal lactate level (1.3 mmol/L). The child was extubated after 12 days and shifted to pediatric ward after partial clinical and radiological resolution of pneumonia. During the hospital stay, he developed multiple subtle seizures consisting of uprolling of eyes, vacant stares, and had slow improvement in terms of activity and feeding with loss of body weight upto 3.2 kg from an initial 4 kg at presentation. He also constantly exuded a peculiar body odor. Hence, a strong suspicion of metabolic disorder was made, and a urine sample was sent to the biochemistry laboratory.

### Increased dopamine after mating impairs olfaction and prevents odor interference with pregnancy [^115PyuGa]. Nature Neuroscience (2008). Medium credibility.

In rodents, social odor sensing influences female reproductive status by affecting neuroendocrine cascades. The odor of male mouse urine can induce ovulation or block pregnancy within 3 d post coitus. Females avoid the action of such olfactory stimuli after embryonic implantation. The mechanisms underlying these changes are unknown. Here we report that shortly after mating, a surge in dopamine in the mouse main olfactory bulb impairs the perception of social odors contained in male urine. Treatment of females at 6.5 d post coitus with a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist restores social odor sensing and favors disruption of pregnancy by inhibition of prolactin release, when administered in the presence of alien male urine odors. These results show that an active sensory barrier blocks social olfactory cues detrimental to pregnancy, consistent with the main olfactory bulb being a major relay through which social odor modulates reproductive status.

### Sniffing out significant "Pee values": genome wide association study of asparagus anosmia [^114XtCVW]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the inherited factors associated with the ability to smell asparagus metabolites in urine.

Design

Genome wide association study.

Setting

Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study cohorts.

Participants

6909 men and women of European-American descent with available genetic data from genome wide association studies.

Main Outcome Measure

Participants were characterized as asparagus smellers if they strongly agreed with the prompt "after eating asparagus, you notice a strong characteristic odor in your urine", and anosmic if otherwise. We calculated per-allele estimates of asparagus anosmia for about nine million single nucleotide polymorphisms using logistic regression. P values < 5×10⁻⁸ were considered as genome wide significant.

Results

58.0% of men (n = 1449/2500) and 61.5% of women (n = 2712/4409) had anosmia. 871 single nucleotide polymorphisms reached genome wide significance for asparagus anosmia, all in a region on chromosome 1 (1q44: 248139851–248595299) containing multiple genes in the olfactory receptor 2 (OR2) family. Conditional analyses revealed three independent markers associated with asparagus anosmia: rs13373863, rs71538191, and rs6689553.

Conclusion

A large proportion of people have asparagus anosmia. Genetic variation near multiple olfactory receptor genes is associated with the ability of an individual to smell the metabolites of asparagus in urine. Future replication studies are necessary before considering targeted therapies to help anosmic people discover what they are missing.

### Non-redundant coding of aversive odours in the main olfactory pathway [^116XAP9s]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Many species are critically dependent on olfaction for survival. In the main olfactory system of mammals, odours are detected by sensory neurons that express a large repertoire of canonical odorant receptors and a much smaller repertoire of trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs). Odours are encoded in a combinatorial fashion across glomeruli in the main olfactory bulb, with each glomerulus corresponding to a specific receptor. The degree to which individual receptor genes contribute to odour perception is unclear. Here we show that genetic deletion of the olfactory Taar gene family, or even a single Taar gene (Taar4), eliminates the aversion that mice display to low concentrations of volatile amines and to the odour of predator urine. Our findings identify a role for the TAARs in olfaction, namely, in the high-sensitivity detection of innately aversive odours. In addition, our data reveal that aversive amines are represented in a non-redundant fashion, and that individual main olfactory receptor genes can contribute substantially to odour perception.

### Severe salicylate poisoning due to teaberry flavoring ingestion: a case report [^1135chJ3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There are currently many commercial uses for methyl salicylate, including fragrances, flavoring, topical pain relief, and polymer restoration. Most recorded cases of human toxicity due to methyl salicylate are the result of topical or accidental exposures. However, this is a previously unreported case of an adult patient who intentionally ingested teaberry flavoring, causing life-threatening salicylism.

Case Report

A 22-year-old man presented to the emergency department with the chief symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Triage nursing noted the patient's vomit smelled strongly of wintergreen. Further history indicated the patient had ingested approximately 40 mL of teaberry oil while using it to make ice cream. The initial serum salicylate concentration was 111 mg/dL. The medical toxicology team was consulted, and the patient was given a singular dose of activated charcoal by mouth. He was also administered both an intravenous sodium bicarbonate bolus and sodium bicarbonate infusion. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and the nephrology service was consulted to initiate emergent hemodialysis. After the single hemodialysis treatment with concomitant serum and urine alkalization, the patient had progressive improvement of salicylate concentrations. He was discharged on hospital day 3 in normal condition. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians should be aware of novel etiologies of life-threatening salicylate poisoning.

### Maple syrup urine disease diagnosed in a resource-limited setting in an infant in Nepal: a case report [^116LGbPi]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) is a rare inherited disorder of metabolism, which manifests early in life in classical forms. Recurrent illness and exertion aggravate neurotoxicity. This case highlights MSUD diagnosed in association with COVID-19 complications from Nepal.

Case presentation

We present a case of a 4-month-old child with a biochemical diagnosis of flared-up MSUD. Initially presenting with chief complaints of fever, noisy breathing, chest retraction, cough along with lethargy and poor feeding since the first week of life, the child also had developmental delay with feeble neck holding and absent social smile. The child was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and admitted in the Intensive Care Unit, requiring mechanical ventilation for 12 days. Despite the clinical resolution of pneumonia, the child had multiple episodes of generalized seizures and was sickly and frail. An incessant peculiar odor emanating from the child led to strong suspicion of metabolic disorder. Qualitative screening for amino acids (FeCl₃ and 2,4-dinitrophenylhdrazine/DNPH) in urine and further gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed increased branched-chain amino acids(valine, leucine, and isoleucine). With dietary restrictions, the child was doing well. However, unfortunately, after 10 days of discharge, the child succumbed to death.

Conclusions

This case highlights the outpouring of hidden metabolic disorders with the onset of new diseases. It could have been detected and managed earlier with expedited neonatal screening and proper intervention.

### Community awareness about risk factors, presentation and prevention and obstetric fistula in nabitovu village, iganga district, Uganda [^111jLF9s]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

" My sister was (abandoned and) left in misery by the husband without any support for herself and the children, and her husband ended up marrying another wife because he could not tolerate putting up in the same bed (with my sister) because of the stench" (Participant from the older women's focus group).

"Some of the victims also give up on their small businesses, for example, a friend of mine used to attend to a food joint but because of the odor, which could come out of her, her customers started reducing in number up to when a time reached when no one could come around to buy her food,… so she decided to close up the business and was left with no source of income, apart from begging". (Participant from the young women's focus group).

Women with obstetric fistula were always depressed or in low moods due to the isolation and stigma. They had low self-esteem and had nobody to go to for help, since most of the community members isolate them.

" Obstetric fistula victims feel lonely because of the odor and sometime they attempt to committee suicide because they reach an extent when their minds tell them that they do not have any reason to live and they are worthless" (participant from the older women's focus group).

Perceived risk factors for obstetric fistula

Participants were asked a direct question: What causes obstetric fistula-the condition in which women continuously leak urine after childbirth? Many could not identify a specific cause, but instead mentioned perceived predisposing or risk factors. Delay to access medical care during labor, particularly for women who got complications while trying to deliver from the community, was identified by all the groups as a risk factor:

"Obstetric fistula (Okudhabada) is mainly caused by delay to be taken to a health centre if the women gets problems during delivery, or attempts to deliver at home or delivers alone by herself" (young woman FGD participant).

Delay occurred during attempts at home delivery. While at home, any one can do whatever she thought in attempts to accomplish the delivery. Such manipulations could also lead to fistula:

Urine sample tampering — signs and response — indicates that all urine samples should be checked for unusual specimen characteristics, including temperature outside the expected range of 90–100 degrees within 4 minutes of production and unusual color or smell, soapy appearance, cloudiness or particles in the liquid. If a urine sample exhibits unusual specimen characteristics, the sample should undergo specimen validity testing to help identify whether and how tampering occurred, and providers should consider samples that have been tampered with to be presumptive positive.

### Tolerability in the elderly population of high-dose alpha lipoic acid: a potential antioxidant therapy for the eye [^116FzErL]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Lipoic acid has potential benefits in multiple systemic and ocular diseases. However, human studies of lipoic acid have struggled to find the optimal dosage due to side effects, alterations in rates of metabolism of different formulations of lipoic acid manufactured by different suppliers, and variations in absorption and clearance of lipoic acid across individuals. The present study evaluated three different doses in the elderly population, and the majority of subjects reported at least one adverse event at each dose, the most common of which was the known side effect of urine odor. The frequency of adverse events recorded could be high because subjects received planned phone calls during which a complete review of systems was performed. While there were no significant safety concerns among the reported adverse events, there was some GI intolerability that developed at higher doses of ALA. This is in contrast to Yadav et al, who observed excellent tolerability of 1,200 mg of ALA. This difference could be related to the younger age of patients in their study, or that their participants were given a standardized meal along with the medication, as opposed to this study in which patients were only recommended to take the medication along with their typical breakfast. Another possibility is that taking ALA concurrently with a meal does not completely reduce GI side effects.

### "Toilet cake" encephalopathy [^1177rUi1]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Paradichlorobenzene (PDB) is an aromatic compound found in several household insect repellents and deodorizers. Paradichlorobenzene may cause dependence and damage when inhaled or ingested. Prior cases of PDB neurotoxicity involved ingestion or inhalation of mothballs or occupational exposure. We report the first case of PDB neurotoxicity from chronic toilet bowl deodorizers ("toilet cake") sniffing. A 19-year-old woman, 4 weeks postpartum, presented with gradual mental status deterioration, lethargy, and general weakness for 2 weeks. On physical examination, the patient was found to have a strong odor of deodorizer and diffuse hyperpigmented skin lesions, with scratch marks in neck, axillae, trunk, and 4 limbs. She was alert but unable to communicate or follow commands. Ataxia, hyporeflexia, cogwheel rigidity, and decreased muscle tone were also noted. Laboratory tests revealed only normocytic anemia. A brain magnetic resonance imaging scan showed enhancement within the splenium of the corpus callosum. Postpartum depression, psychosis, and panhypopituitarism were excluded. Family members reported on further questioning that the patient was a habitual "toilet cake" sniffer for an unknown period. A urine test for 2,5-dichlorophenol (a PDB metabolite) level was 620 mg/L (3100 times higher than the average concentration with household exposure). Her clinical condition and body odor remained unchanged during the 30-day hospitalization and the skin findings improved.

### Naphthalene mothballs poisoning leading to intravascular hemolysis: a case report [^11394FZh]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Naphthalene is widely used in households as an insect repellent, but its poisoning is rare, especially in adults. Naphthalene is a strong oxidant with a pungent smell.

Case Report

We report a case of a 16-year-old female who ingested three naphthalene mothballs 3 days prior to admission and presented with history of recurrent vomiting, severe pallor, jaundice, and hemoglobinuria. Investigation found severe hemolytic anemia, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, acute kidney injury, and evidence of intravascular hemolysis. Her urine output was normal throughout the course of illness. She was managed conservatively with i.v. fluid, oral ascorbic acid, and blood transfusion. With treatment our patient improved completely and was discharged in hemodynamically stable condition. She is doing fine after further follow-up. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physician should keep the possibility of poisoning by an oxidizing agent, such as naphthalene, when a patient presents to the emergency department with rapid onset pallor, jaundice, and hemoglobinuria.

### Sniffing out significant "Pee values": genome wide association study of asparagus anosmia [^1125UYdR]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Methods

This study was conceived during a scientific meeting attended by several of the coauthors in bucolic Sweden, where it became apparent that some of us were unable to detect any unusual odor in our urine after consuming new spring asparagus. We subsequently sought epidemiological studies to further examine this phenomenon, and found the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (see supplementary file for details). The participants included in the current study included men and women of European descent with available genetic data from genome wide association studies from nested case-control studies. All participants gave informed consent, including consent for genetic analyses.

Definition of asparagus anosmia

The main outcome in our study was asparagus anosmia, which was collected in both the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study as part of a broader supplemental questionnaire sent to participants in 2010. They were asked to respond to the prompt: "After eating asparagus, you notice a strong characteristic odor in your urine". For the primary analysis, participants who responded "Strongly agree" were categorized as being able to smell asparagus and those who responded "Moderately agree", "Slightly agree", "Slightly disagree", "Moderately disagree", and "Strongly disagree" were categorized as having asparagus anosmia. Those who responded "I don't eat asparagus" were excluded from the analysis.

### Nursing home residents with suspected urinary tract infections: a diagnostic accuracy study [^114WvDzQ]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study looked at signs/symptoms triggering a UTI diagnosis and explored whether or not CRP could be of added value in the diagnosis of a UTI. Only 11.7% of our UTI suspicions corresponded to the applied definition of a confirmed UTI. Strong or foul smelling urine and acute change in mental status mainly triggered a UTI suspicion. However, only acute dysuria and acute suprapubic pain were found significant and increased the post-test probability. The combined nitrite and leucocyte esterase urine had a high negative predictive value. Antimicrobials were prescribed in more than half of the events with a suspected but unconfirmed UTI, indicating a potential significant overuse in this NH population.

Conducting research in LTCFs can be challenging. We also experienced some major limitations in our study. As there was no funding for this study (diagnostic material payed with own resources) we relied on the voluntary participation of NHs and on their staff to carry out the study. The observation period was limited to three months to make the study as feasible as possible and to limit the time investment. Three non-hospital laboratories were willing to take part in this study and invited all their surrounding NHs. Unfortunately, the majority of facilities were not eager to participate, either because they were not interested in the topic, had other projects going on or because they perceived the study as a significant time investment. In one region, we found no participants and therefore continued the study with only two microbiological laboratories. Because of this and a slower than expected inclusion of residents with a UTI suspicion, we reached only half of our intended sample size and only half of our expected confirmed UTI diagnoses. This led to larger confidence intervals around our estimates.

### Sniffing out significant "Pee values": genome wide association study of asparagus anosmia [^11273Fjf]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Anosmia for the urinary metabolites of asparagus is common. In this study of 6909 European-American men and women, three in five were unable to detect the odor in their urine. Linking information from genome wide association studies with the anosmia trait, we found 871 unique single nucleotide polymorphisms reaching genome wide significance. All were located on chromosome 1, containing multiple members of the olfactory receptor 2 gene family.

Our analyses included imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms from the 1000 Genomes Project, which allowed us to more thoroughly identify novel single nucleotide polymorphisms that might interact with the previously identified single nucleotide polymorphism to produce the anosmic phenotype. The previous genome wide association studies of asparagus anosmia identified an association with rs4481887, 8993 base pairs upstream of OR2M7. By incorporating comprehensive efforts to refine the signal, we identified three independent association signals in this region, tagged by rs13373863, rs71538191, and rs6689553. Although we did not conduct a further replication study of the genome wide signals, our findings validate and extend the previously reported associations between OR2 and asparagus anosmia. Both our study and a previous studywere conducted on people of European descent; thus it is unclear whether results would differ in non-European populations.

Two "probably damaging" missense single nucleotide polymorphisms in OR2M7 in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs6689553 (rs7555310 and rs7555424) are intriguing candidate variants that might be responsible for this association. We also identified a missense variant in OR2L3 that could be responsible for the association signal tagged by rs13373863. OR2L3, OR14C36, and OR2M7 are thought to be involved in G-protein receptor and olfactory receptor activity, and OR14C36 in the binding of an odorant to its receptor. The molecular basis at the root of human olfaction is not fully understood. Research has investigated specific anosmias and hyperosmias as a key to understanding olfaction, often focusing on the genetic determinants of these phenomena to better understand the overall functional relation. Our findings present candidate genes of interest for future research on the structure and function of olfactory receptors and on the compounds responsible for the distinctive odor produced by asparagus metabolites. Answering these questions might shed light more generally on the relation between the molecular structure of an odorant and its perceived odor.

### Interrupting the mechanisms of brain injury in a model of maple syrup urine disease encephalopathy [^113o8D9J]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) was first recognized as an inherited lethal encephalopathy beginning in the first week of life and associated with an unusual odor in the urine of affected children. It was later confirmed as a deficiency of branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH), which is the second step in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) breakdown. MSUD is characterized by BCAA and branched-chain keto acid (BCKA) accumulation. BCAAs are essential amino acids and powerful metabolic signals with severe consequences of both deprivation and accumulation. Treatment requires life-long dietary restriction and monitoring of BCAAs. However, despite excellent compliance, children commonly suffer metabolic decompensation during intercurrent illness resulting in life-threatening cerebral edema and dysmyelination. The mechanisms underlying brain injury have been poorly understood. Recent studies using newly developed mouse models of both classic and intermediate MSUD have yielded insight into the consequences of rapid BCAA accumulation. Additionally, these models have been used to test preliminary treatments aimed at competing with blood-brain barrier transport of BCAA using norleucine. Assessment of biochemical changes with and without treatment suggests different roles for BCAA and BCKA in the mechanism of brain injury.

### Tolerability in the elderly population of high-dose alpha lipoic acid: a potential antioxidant therapy for the eye [^1114NCxx]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

The adverse events reported are shown in Table 3, and the total number at each dose was 16 (600 mg), 19 (800 mg), and 19 (1,200 mg). The number of patients with any adverse event reported at each dose was eleven of 15 (600 mg), ten of 15 (800 mg), and ten of 14 (1,200 mg); some adverse events reported by subjects at lower doses were not reported at higher doses. There were no reported changes in vision. The most common adverse events reported were urine odor and GI side effects. Eleven of 15 subjects experienced the known side effect of urine odorat some point during the study. Three of the 15 subjects (one at 600 mg, one at 800 mg, and three at 1,200 mg) experienced upper GI side effects, including acid reflux, nausea, and stomach discomfort. Another subject also described a generalized "flushing sensation", which could be related to acid reflux at the 800 mg and 1,200 mg doses. Five of the 15 subjects (two at 600 mg, three at 800 mg, and two at 1,200 mg) experienced lower GI side effects, including loose stools and frank diarrhea (two subjects). With this small sample size, there were no statistically significant differences in the number of adverse events or the number of GI adverse events reported when the subjects were split into groups according to sex or age (Table 4). There was perhaps a trend for higher doses of ALA to be associated with more GI adverse events, but this was not statistically significant (Table 4). One subject was taking thyroid hormone supplementation (levothyroxine), a medication that may potentially be affected by concurrent use of ALA. This subject experienced urine odor, urinary urgency, and both upper and lower GI side effects.

The indication should be supported by the literature,– and should be appropriate for the specific patient population. Include guideline-based remindersfor the specific circumstances. Below is a simple example of appropriate and inappropriate reasons to culture urine are referenced online on the CDC website, though several other lists are available in the literature specific to particular clinical settings (eg, ICU, emergency department, nursing home, and catheterized versus non-catheterized patients): Appropriate uses of urine culture include the following: Presence of symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI): Flank pain or costovertebral angle tenderness Acute hematuria New pelvic discomfort New onset or worsening sepsis without evidence of another source on history, physical examination, or laboratory testing Fever or altered mental status without evidence of another source on history, physical examination, or laboratory testing In spinal-cord-injury patients and other highly complex patients (eg, patients with > 40% total body burn, recipients of kidney transplants with graft failure) symptoms may include increased spasticity, autonomic dysreflexia, and/or sense of unease. Inappropriate uses of urine cultures include the following: Odorous, cloudy, or discolored urine in the absence of other localizing signs and symptoms Reflex urine cultures based on urinalysis results, such as pyuria, in the absence of other indications (absence of pyuria suggests diagnosis other than CAUTI) Urine culture to document response to therapy unless symptoms fail to resolve.
Provide training on appropriate collection of urine. Specimens should be collected and should arrive at the microbiology laboratory as soon as possible, preferably within an hour. If delay in transport to the laboratory is expected, samples should be refrigerated (no more than 24 hours) or collected in preservative urine transport tubes. (Quality of evidence: LOW)
Train clinicians to consider other methods for bladder management (eg, intermittent catheterization, or external male or female collection devices) when appropriate before placing an indwelling urethral catheter. (Quality of evidence: LOW)

### Sniffing out significant "Pee values": genome wide association study of asparagus anosmia [^114MSBr8]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Asparagus has long been recognized as a delicacy. Writings by the Roman scholar Cato the Elder around 200 BC provide a method of planting asparagus, and a recipe for cooking asparagus is found in Apicius's De Re Coquinaria from the late 4th century AD. According to the United States Department of Agriculture food composition database, asparagus is rich in iron, fiber, zinc, folate, and vitamins A, E and C. Consumption of asparagus, as part of a diet high in vegetables, has been hypothesized to reduce the risk of cancer, cognitive impairment, and cardiovascular related diseases. Under the assumption that the urinary odor from asparagus consumption leads to avoidance of this vegetable, future work should consider Mendelian randomization studies using these identified single nucleotide polymorphisms to better understand how a lifetime of eating asparagus might protect people from developing chronic conditions. Furthermore, literature from the 15th century touts its aphrodisiac qualities. Studies could investigate assortative mating with respect to asparagus anosmia; however, differentiating choice of partner based on preference for flavor or odor would be challenging.

Interestingly, women in the Nurses' Health Study were more likely to report asparagus anosmia than men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, despite the fact that women have been shown to more accurately and consistently identify smells. We hypothesize that this unexpected result might be due to underreporting by a few modest women who are loathe to admit they can smell the distinctive odor in their urine. It is possible that women are less likely than men to notice an unusual odor in their urine because their position during urination might reduce their exposure to volatile odorants. This highlights a weakness of our study design that is shared by many studies of olfactory perception — namely, that we rely on self report of perception rather than on an objective measurement of olfactory stimulation. Our study is also limited by a one-time measure of anosmia; therefore, we do not have information on whether the ability to smell asparagus metabolites changes with age, and previous studies have shown that as humans age, their general olfactory function declines.

### Large-scale forward genetics screening identifies trpa1 as a chemosensor for predator odor-evoked innate fear behaviors [^117CK7J5]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Predator odors or kairomones, from the fur, skin, urine, feces, and excretory glands of the predators, have been widely used to evoke innate fear/defensive behaviors, such as avoidance and risk assessment behaviors, in laboratory mice. One of the best-studied kairomones is fox odorant 2,4,5-trimethyl-3-thiazoline (TMT), which can also induce instinctive freezing in naive mice. A potent analog of TMT, 2-methyl-2-thiazoline (2MT), has recently been shown to elicit highly robust freezing response in mice. It is widely believed that specific odorant receptors are responsible for sensing TMT/2MT to elicit innate fear/defensive behaviors –. Accordingly, genetic lesion of dorsal class II olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) rendered mice defective for TMT-induced avoidance. At least two dozens of candidate odorant receptors for TMT have been identified. Notably, optogenetic activation of Olfr1019-expressing OSNs induces immobility, whereas Olfr1019 knockout mice are partially defective for TMT-induced freezing. Moreover, other TMT sensing mechanisms seem to exist because the Grueneberg ganglion (GG), which does not typically express odorant receptors, have been implicated in TMT-evoked freezing. It has also been proposed that the trigeminal system plays a critical role in TMT-evoked freezing behavior.

The transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (Trpa1), a member of the TRP family of ion channels, has been shown to function as a chemical, mechanical, and temperature sensor –. In particular, Trpa1 is a well-known chemoreceptor for pungent natural compounds, such as cinnamaldehyde, allyl isothiocyanate and mustard oil –, as well as harmful environmental irritants, such as formalin and acrolein (tear gas) –. Accordingly, Trpa1 is highly expressed in the somatosensory systems, such as the trigeminal ganglia (TG), dorsal root ganglia and nodose ganglia, and has important functions in nociception, i.e. sensing harmful and potentially painful stimuli. Here, we performed a large-scale recessive genetics screen of randomly mutagenized mice using a highly robust 2MT-evoked innate fear assay. We found that the Trpa1-mediated chemosensory system, in addition to classical olfactory system, plays a central role in mediating predator odor-evoked innate fear/defensive behaviors in mice.

### A novel mutation in the flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 gene (FMO3) of a Norwegian family causes trimethylaminuria [^1164sv8f]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Loss-of-function mutations in the flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 gene (FMO3) cause the inherited disorder trimethylaminuria (TMAuria), or fish-odour syndrome. Here we describe the identification in a family from northern Norway of a novel causative mutation of TMAuria. A female child within the family presented with a TMAuria-like phenotype. The child and her mother were found to be heterozygous for a novel mutation (R238Q) in exon 6 of FMO3. The child's father lacked this mutation, but was heterozygous for a double polymorphic variant, E158K/E308G, which was not present in the child. During a consultation with her doctor the mother mentioned an uncle whom she remembered as having a strong body odour. This discussion led to genetic counselling of the uncle and analysis of his DNA showed him to be homozygous for the R238Q mutation. Analysis of the mutant FMO3 expressed in bacteria revealed that the R238Q mutation abolished catalytic activity of the enzyme and is thus a causative mutation for TMAuria. The specificity constant (k(cat)/K(M)) of the K158/G308 variant was 43% of that of ancestral FMO3. Because the child is heterozygous for the R238Q mutation and no other mutation known to cause TMAuria was detected in her DNA she is predicted to suffer from transient childhood TMAuria, whereas her great-uncle has primary TMAuria.

### A functional ABCC11 allele is essential in the biochemical formation of human axillary odor [^115K9m2R]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The characteristic human axillary odor is formed by bacterial action on odor precursors that originate from apocrine sweat glands. Caucasians and Africans possess a strong axillary odor, whereas many Asians have only a faint acidic odor. In this study, we provide evidence that the gene ABCC11 (MRP8), which encodes an apical efflux pump, is crucial for the formation of the characteristic axillary odor and that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 538G → A, which is prominent among Asian people, leads to a nearly complete loss of the typical odor components in axillary sweat. The secretion of amino-acid conjugates of human-specific odorants is abolished in homozygotic carriers of the SNP, and steroidal odorants and their putative precursors are significantly reduced. Moreover, we show that ABCC11 is expressed and localized in apocrine sweat glands. These data point to a key function of ABCC11 in the secretion of odorants and their precursors from apocrine sweat glands. SNP 538G → A, which also determines human earwax type, is present on an extended haplotype, which has reached > 95% frequency in certain populations in recent human evolution. A strong positive selection in mate choice for low-odorant partners with a dysfunctional ABCC11 gene seems a plausible explanation for this striking frequency of a loss-of-function allele.

### Isopropanol poisoning [^111jo1ZN]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Isopropanol is a clear, colorless liquid with a fruity odor and a mild bitter taste. Most commonly found domestically as rubbing alcohol, isopropanol is also found in numerous household and commercial products including cleaners, disinfectants, antifreezes, cosmetics, solvents, inks, and pharmaceuticals.

Aim

The aim of this review is to critically review the epidemiology, toxicokinetics, mechanisms of toxicity, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of isopropanol poisoning.

Methods

OVID MEDLINE and ISI Web of Science were searched to November 2013 using the words "isopropanol", "isopropyl alcohol", "2-propanol", "propan-2-ol", and "rubbing alcohol" combined with the keywords "poisoning", "poison", "toxicity", "ingestion", "adverse effects", "overdose", or "intoxication". These searches identified 232 citations, which were then screened via their abstract to identify relevant articles referring specifically to the epidemiology, toxicokinetics, mechanisms of toxicity, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of isopropanol poisoning; 102 were relevant. Further information was obtained from book chapters, relevant news reports, and internet resources. These additional searches produced eight non-duplicate relevant citations.

Epidemiology

The majority of isopropanol exposures are unintentional and occur in children less than 6 years of age. Although isopropanol poisoning appears to be a reasonably common occurrence, deaths are rare.

Toxicokinetics

Isopropanol is rapidly absorbed following ingestion with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 30 min. It can also be absorbed following inhalation or dermal exposure. Isopropanol is widely distributed with a volume of distribution of 0.45–0.55 L/kg. Isopropanol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to acetone, acetol and methylglyoxal, propylene glycol, acetate, and formate with conversion of these metabolites to glucose and other products of intermediary metabolism. The elimination of isopropanol is predominantly renal, though some pulmonary excretion of isopropanol and acetone occurs. In one case 20% of the absorbed dose was eliminated unchanged in urine, with the remainder excreted as acetone and metabolites of acetone. The elimination half-life of isopropanol is between 2.5 and 8.0 h, whereas elimination of acetone is slower with a half-life following isopropanol ingestion of between 7.7 and 27 h.

Mechanisms Of Toxicity

While the exact mechanism of action of isopropanol has not been fully elucidated, brain stem depression is thought to be the predominant mechanism. While the clinical effects are thought to be mostly due to isopropanol, acetone may also contribute.

Clinical Features

The major features of severe poisoning are due to CNS and respiratory depression, shock, and circulatory collapse. The most common metabolic effects are an increased osmol (osmolal) gap, ketonemia, and ketonuria. Diagnosis. Poisoning can be diagnosed using the measurement of isopropanol serum concentrations, though these may not be readily available. Diagnosis is therefore more typically made on the basis of the patient's history and clinical presentation. An osmol gap, ketonemia, and/or ketonuria without metabolic acidosis, along with a fruity or sweet odor on the breath and CNS depression support the diagnosis. Management. Supportive care is the mainstay of management with primary emphasis on respiratory and cardiovascular support. Hemodialysis enhances elimination of isopropanol and acetone and should be considered in very severe poisoning.

Conclusions

Severe isopropanol poisoning results in CNS and respiratory depression and circulatory collapse. Treatment primarily consists of symptom-directed supportive care. Although hemodialysis increases the elimination of isopropanol and acetone substantially, it should only be considered in severe life-threatening poisonings. Patients usually make a full recovery provided they receive prompt supportive care.

General

Treatment with PROGLYCEM should be initiated under close clinical supervision, with careful monitoring of blood glucose and clinical response until the patient's condition has stabilized. This usually requires several days. If not effective in 2 to 3 weeks, discontinue PROGLYCEM.

Prolonged treatment requires regular monitoring of urine glucose and ketones, especially under stress conditions. Advise patients to promptly report any abnormalities to their healthcare provider. Periodically monitor blood glucose to determine the need for dosage adjustment.

Consider the effects of PROGLYCEM on the hematopoietic system and the level of serum uric acid; the latter should be considered particularly in patients with hyperuricemia or a history of gout.

Since the plasma half-life of diazoxide is prolonged in patients with impaired renal function, a reduced dosage should be considered. Serum electrolyte levels should also be evaluated for such patients.

The antihypertensive effect of other drugs may be enhanced by PROGLYCEM, and this should be kept in mind when administering it concomitantly with antihypertensive agents.

Because of the protein binding, administration of PROGLYCEM with coumarin anticoagulants or its derivatives may require reduction in the dosage of the anticoagulant, although there has been no reported evidence of excessive anticoagulant effect. In addition, PROGLYCEM may displace bilirubin from albumin; consider this when treating newborns with increased bilirubinemia.

Pulmonary hypertension has been reported in neonates and young infants treated with diazoxide (see WARNINGS).

Information for Patients

Advise patients of the need for periodic laboratory testing during treatment with PROGLYCEM. In addition, advise patients to:

take PROGLYCEM on a regular schedule as prescribed, not to skip doses, not to take extra doses
consult their healthcare provider before starting any new medications
not allow anyone else to take this medication
follow dietary instructions
report any adverse reactions (i.e., increased urinary frequency, increased thirst, fruity breath odor) promptly to their healthcare provider
report pregnancy or to discuss plans for pregnancy with their healthcare provider

Laboratory Tests

Consider monitoring the following laboratory tests during treatment with PROGLYCEM (not all-inclusive):

blood glucose (recommended at periodic intervals in patients taking diazoxide orally for treatment of hypoglycemia, until stabilized)
blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine clearance
hematocrit, platelet count, total and differential leukocyte counts
serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
serum uric acid level
urine testing for glucose and ketones

### Parental reporting of smelly urine and urinary tract infection [^112Zc92t]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Parents often report that young children have "smelly urine" or a particular urinary odour. There is little evidence that these observations are relevant to the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI).

Aims

To determine whether parental reporting of smelly urine is of any relevance to the diagnosis of UTI in children less than 6 years of age.

Methods

Parents whose children were having urine collected as part of their admission to a large district hospital were given a simple questionnaire to complete regarding the current smell of their child's urine. Parents were asked whether their child's urine smelled different from usual or had a particular smell. Microscopy and culture results of the child's urine were compared to their parent's questionnaire answers to see if there was a association between parental reporting of a different or particular urine smell and a diagnosis of UTI.

Results

One hundred and ten questionnaires and urine samples were obtained. Fifty two per cent of parents thought that their child's urine smelled different from usual or had a particular smell. Only 6.4% of children were diagnosed as having a UTI. There was no statistically significant association between parental reporting of abnormal urine smell and diagnosis of UTI.

Conclusion

In determining whether a young child has a UTI, asking parents about urine smell is unlikely to be of benefit.

Odor delivery

For the odor stimulus presentation, we used a nine-odor air dilution olfactometer (RP Metrix Scalable Olfactometer Module LASOM 2), as described by others. Briefly, the odorants were diluted in mineral oil to 100 ppm. Saturated vapor was obtained by flowing nitrogen gas at flow rates of 100 ml/min through the vial with the liquid odorant. The odor streams were mixed with clean air and adjusted to a constant final flow rate of 900 ml/min. Odors were further diluted tenfold before reaching at a final concentration of 10 ppm to the final valve (via a four-way Teflon valve, NResearch). In between stimuli, 1000 ml/min of a steady stream of filtered air flowed to the odor port continuously. During stimulus delivery, a final valve switched the odor flow to the odor port, and diverted the clean airflow to an exhaust line. Odors were delivered to the mouse nostrils via a custom-made glass mask, at a flow rate of 1 L/min (duration — 2 s; interstimulus interval — 26 s). Odors were continuously removed by air suction. The olfactometer was calibrated using a miniPID (Aurora Scientific).

For pure odors we used a panel of six odorants known to activate different and partially overlapping areas in the dorsal part of the OB (butanal, pentanal, ethyl tiglate, propanal, methyl propionate, ethyl-butyrate, and ethyl acetate; all obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). As six natural odorants we used — male urine, female urine, peanut butter, trimethylthiazoline (TMT), and nest odor. Urine was collected from Nestin X TB males and females (~5 different donors for each urine mixture) and stored at −20 °C. Twenty-five microliter were placed in the odor vials. Peanut butter was made of 100% peanuts (Better&different, Mishor Edomim, Israel) and 1-g peanut butter was placed in the vials. For predator odor, we used 2 µl of TMT (Contech, Delta, Canada). Nest odor was made of 1-g nest bedding.

### Identification of a biomarker panel for improvement of prostate cancer diagnosis by volatile metabolic profiling of urine [^113GSezh]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

The knowledge on the urinary volatile signature of PCa acquired with this study has the potential to allow for the development of a sensor optimised for the recognition of volatiles with chemical groups herein elucidated and consequently with greater capabilities of chemical discriminations and diagnostic accuracy. However, e-nose devices are incapable to determine the identity and concentration of individual compounds responsible for discrimination between urine samples and, therefore, do not provide information about the metabolic pathways affected by the disease. Furthermore, the reproducibility of "e-nose" results can be affected by sensor drift over time, affecting instrument reproducibility. In the future, a best diagnostic approach may rely in the use of low-cost e-nose device for assessing the presence of PCa in a rapid, non-invasive way, followed by targeted assessment of known volatile biomarkers by GC-MS technology for diagnostic confirmation. The combination of e-nose and GC-MS technologies may provide a powerful tandem diagnostic tool potentially allowing for early non-invasive diagnosis of PCa with high accuracy.

### Urethritis and cervicitis-STI treatment guidelines… [^112Qrdio]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

Diseases Characterized by Urethritis and Cervicitis Urethritis Urethritis, as characterized by urethral inflammation, can result from either infectious or noninfectious conditions. Symptoms, if present, include dysuria, urethral pruritis, and mucoid, mucopurulent, or purulent discharge. Signs of urethral discharge on examination can also be present among persons without symptoms. Although. M. genitalium is associated with symptoms of urethritis and urethral inflammation and accounts for 15%–25% of NGU cases in the United States. Individual case reports have linked NGU to multiple bacterial species, including Corynebacterium propinquum, Kurthia gibsonii, Corynebacterium glucuronolyticum, Corynebacterium striatrium, Aerococcus urinae, and Neisseria elongata.
- Presumed gonococcal infection is established by documenting the presence of WBCs containing GNID in Gram stain or intracellular purple diplococci in MB or GV smears; men should be tested for
- Positive leukocyte esterase test on first-void urine or microscopic examination of sediment from a spun first-void urine demonstrating ≥ 10 WBCs/HPF. Men evaluated in settings in which Gram stain or MB or GV smear is unavailable who meet at least one criterion for urethritis should be tested for. Diagnostic Considerations Clinical presentation can include urethral discharge, irritation, dysuria, or meatal pruritus a purulent or mucopurulent endocervical exudate visible in the endocervical canal or on an endocervical swab specimen, and 2) sustained endocervical bleeding easily induced by gentle passage of a cotton swab through the cervical os.

6.3 supplementation

Dietary supplementation of L‐carnitines is controversial.L‐carnitines have historically been prescribed as a supplement to MCADD patients as part of a long‐term management plan at a dosage of 100 mg/kg/day; some patients require a lower dose of 50 mg/kg/day due to the side effect of fish‐smelling body odour resulting from the drug. It has been theorized that L‐carnitine supplementation may alleviate the secondary carnitine deficiency from acylcarnitine ester accumulation. The benefits of such supplementation remain unclear and are largely unverified. One study evaluating the impact of L‐carnitine supplementation at 50 mg/kg/day on performance of moderate intensity exercise found that while the carnitine group had significantly higher plasma concentrations of octanoylcarnitine, suggesting that supplemented patients had increased clearance of accumulated acylcarnitines, both groups had elevated free carnitine levels in plasma and urine; thus, they found no significant biochemical advantage for carnitine supplementation in MCADD patients. Further, L‐carnitine supplements have been shown to have no preventative effect on the development of complications or comorbidities such as obesity.

### Nursing home residents with suspected urinary tract infections: a diagnostic accuracy study [^114GejB9]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Participation

Eleven NHs participated in the study, totalling 1 263 eligible residents. The characteristics of this population can be consulted in Additional file 1.

UTI suspicions and triggering signs/symptoms

In 115 residents (9.11%; 80.0% female) at least one UTI was suspected during the three-month observation period. Twenty residents had two UTI suspicions and one resident had three suspicions. The median time between two UTI suspicions was 33.5 days (interquartile range (IQR): 23.0–39.0). In total, 137 UTI suspicions were reported.

Figure 1 presents the signs/symptoms most frequently reported overall and by type of caregiver. On average, 2.40 signs/symptoms (maximum: 8) per UTI suspicion were reported. For four suspicions, no signs/symptoms were reported (missing information). Strong or foul smelling urine (35.8%), acute change in mental status (27.7%), new or marked increase in frequency (18.2%) and restlessness (18.2%) mainly triggered a UTI suspicion. Acute dysuria was reported in 16.1% of the cases. The group of "other" reported signs/symptoms included among others overall body pain, vomiting, hyperglycaemia and sticky discharge. Acute pain, swelling or tenderness of the testes, epididymis or prostate, leukocytosis and new-onset hypotension were not reported. In less than half of all UTI suspicions (46.7%), typical UTI symptoms (i.e. acute dysuria, new or marked increase in frequency, urgency or incontinence, suprapubic pain/tenderness and/or acute costovertebral angle pain) was reported.

Urine culture results

Although the study protocol required a urine culture to be performed after each UTI suspicion, there were 13 results missing (9.49%). When a urine culture was performed (n = 124) the result was positive, negative or contaminated in 50.8% (n = 63), 21.8% (n = 27) and 27.4% (n = 34) of the cases, respectively.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115SLWCR]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

The evidence from studies of predictors of infection in older adult outpatients is sparse, of variable quality and demonstrates that a number of urinary symptoms commonly associated with UTI, such as nocturia and urgency, have limited use for diagnosing UTI. In men, incontinence, foul smelling urine and haematuria were predictors of UTI, but not in women. Importantly, abnormal vital signs (fever, tachycardia and hypotension) are of limited value in UTI diagnosis. Symptoms that may be less typically associated with UTI, such as inability to perform a number of acts of daily living (poor functional status), were strong predictors of UTI. It must be noted, however, that the majority of these estimates were derived from a single studyand are likely to be highly correlated with each other.

Haematuria was found to be of diagnostic value in diagnosing UTI in men, but not in women. We postulate that this could be a result of increased chance of contamination of urine specimens with blood in women, making it less discriminatory for UTI in females. Up to 40% of post-menopausal women have atrophic vaginitis, which can result in microscopic haematuria on urine dipstick. Urinary incontinence was found to be a strong predictor of UTI in men but not in women. This may be due to incontinence being approximately twice as common in women compared to men, and therefore less specific for the presence of UTI in women. Similarly, it may be that abnormal vital signs (such as fever, tachycardia and hypotension) were not found to be predictive of UTI, as if combined with other symptoms (such as breathlessness), they might better predict a different infection (such as a chest infection). We were only able to identify a single estimate for the value of combinations of symptoms in diagnosing UTI.

Unobserved urine sample collection — Having a well set up bathroom collection area can remove some opportunities for sample tampering during unobserved collection, and although all of the following may not be possible in all facilities, providers should employ appropriate measures to decrease the likelihood of urine sample tampering during unobserved collection. Do not allow patients to carry personal items with them into the collection area, ensure that potential adulterants, such as soap, ammonia, or bleach are not readily available in the collection area, place blue dye in the toilet and turn off the water source to the collection area during collection, and provide an alternative hand cleansing option to patients as they exit the bathroom.

### Sniffing out significant "Pee values": genome wide association study of asparagus anosmia [^117YNWhD]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Results

Among 6909 participants, 39.8% (n = 2748) strongly agreed that they could perceive a distinct odor in their urine after eating asparagus and 60.3% (n = 4161) said they could not and were classified as asparagus anosmic (table 1). The proportion of participants unable to detect the odor was slightly lower among men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study compared with women in the Nurses' Health Study.

Table 1
Characteristics of study population by ability to smell metabolites of asparagus in urine, 2010. Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise

HPFS = Health Professionals Follow-up Study; NHS = Nurses' Health Study.

Overall, 871 single nucleotide polymorphisms reached genome wide significance (P < 5×10⁻⁸) for asparagus anosmia (see supplementary table 1). Figure 1displays a Manhattan plot in which each dot represents a single nucleotide polymorphism laid out across the chromosomes from left to right. The height of the peaks corresponds to the strength of association with asparagus anosmia. The large peak represents a 0.46 Mb region on chromosome 1 (248139851–248595299). This region was split into two subregions by a recombination hotspot (see supplementary figure 2) and contained multiple members of the olfactory receptor 2 (OR2) gene family. The single nucleotide polymorphism identified previously in one studyand validated in another study(rs4481887) was also significantly associated with asparagus anosmia in this population (P = 1.41×10⁻⁴³) and is located in the same 1q44 region identified in this analysis.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^114oG7br]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Dilute urine samples — dilution is the most common cause of an invalid sample, and a combination of low creatinine (below 20 mg/dL) and specific gravity is used to indicate that a sample is dilute; in the case of dilute urine, the creatinine concentration of the sample can be used to normalize drug concentrations. Expert panel members commented that dilution is usually the result of deliberate water loading. For patients with a history of dilute urine samples, providers should advise the patient to decrease water intake prior to sample collection, collect samples first thing in the morning, collect samples before work or on days off if heavy hydration is required for occupation, and consider the use of an alternative matrix. There are some health conditions that can cause unusually high or low specific gravity and low creatinine, but a dilute urine sample from an underlying condition such as Diabetes Insipidus is very rare; providers should first advise appropriate hydration levels as a test for an underlying etiology of dilute samples.

### A second class of chemosensory receptors in the olfactory epithelium [^11469QG4]. Nature (2006). Excellent credibility.

The mammalian olfactory system detects chemicals sensed as odours as well as social cues that stimulate innate responses. Odorants are detected in the nasal olfactory epithelium by the odorant receptor family, whose approximately 1,000 members allow the discrimination of a myriad of odorants. Here we report the discovery of a second family of receptors in the mouse olfactory epithelium. Genes encoding these receptors, called 'trace amine-associated receptors' (TAARs), are present in human, mouse and fish. Like odorant receptors, individual mouse TAARs are expressed in unique subsets of neurons dispersed in the epithelium. Notably, at least three mouse TAARs recognize volatile amines found in urine: one detects a compound linked to stress, whereas the other two detect compounds enriched in male versus female urine-one of which is reportedly a pheromone. The evolutionary conservation of the TAAR family suggests a chemosensory function distinct from odorant receptors. Ligands identified for TAARs thus far suggest a function associated with the detection of social cues.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^116WfkPT]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the impact of different management strategies in urinary tract infections.

Design

Randomised controlled trial.

Setting

Primary care.

Participants

309 non-pregnant women aged 18–70 presenting with suspected urinary tract infection.

Intervention

Patients were randomised to five management approaches: empirical antibiotics; empirical delayed (by 48 hours) antibiotics; or targeted antibiotics based on a symptom score (two or more of urine cloudiness, urine smell, nocturia, or dysuria), a dipstick result (nitrite or both leucocytes and blood), or a positive result on midstream urine analysis. Self help advice was controlled in each group.

Main Outcome Measures

Symptom severity (days 2 to 4) and duration, and use of antibiotics.

Results

Patients had 3.5 days of moderately bad symptoms if they took antibiotics immediately. There were no significant differences in duration or severity of symptoms (mean frequency of symptoms on a 0 to 6 scale: immediate antibiotics 2.15, midstream urine 2.08, dipstick 1.74, symptom score 1.77, delayed antibiotics 2.11; likelihood ratio test for the five groups P = 0.177). There were differences in antibiotic use (immediate antibiotics 97%, midstream urine 81%, dipstick 80%, symptom score 90%, delayed antibiotics 77%; P = 0.011) and in sending midstream urine samples (immediate antibiotics 23%, midstream urine 89%, dipstick 36%, symptom score 33%, delayed antibiotics 15%; P < 0.001). Patients who waited at least 48 hours to start taking antibiotics reconsulted less (hazard ratio 0.57 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.89), P = 0.014) but on average had symptoms for 37% longer than those taking immediate antibiotics (incident rate ratio 1.37 (1.11 to 1.68), P = 0.003), particularly the midstream urine group (73% longer, 22% to 140%; none of the other groups had more than 22% longer duration).

Conclusion

All management strategies achieve similar symptom control. There is no advantage in routinely sending midstream urine samples for testing, and antibiotics targeted with dipstick tests with a delayed prescription as backup, or empirical delayed prescription, can help to reduce antibiotic use.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^116MnEoS]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Urine sample inspection and behavior — identifying tampering and invalid results: All urine samples should be inspected for unusual characteristics including unexpected temperature, unusual color, unusual smell, and soapy appearance, cloudiness or particles floating in the liquid, and a recently provided sample should be within expected body temperature range, approximately 90 to 100 degrees within 4 minutes of production. A visual inspection can indicate that a sample may be dilute or adulterated, and dilute urine is lighter in color than normal urine, which ranges from light/pale yellow to dark/deep amber. If the sample exhibits unusual specimen characteristics, specimen validity testing should be considered but should not be relied upon solely as evidence of sample tampering, but as an indication of the need for further testing; abnormal urine appearance can also be the result of a urinary tract infection, kidney stones, yeast infection, diet (eg, beets, asparagus) and the use of over-the-counter vitamins and medications (eg, ex-lax, Vitamin B), and requiring a minimum volume sample can help to increase the reliability of temperature readings and visual inspection as well as ensure there will be enough specimen available for testing. The expert panel advised broad use of clinical judgment in identifying behavioral signs that a patient may have tampered with a urine sample; if a patient's behavior suggests that he or she has recently used an illicit substance, but continues to produce negative urine test results, sample collection should be observed and specimen validity testing conducted, and the provider could adjust the test panel or order a more sensitive test. Some samples are considered substituted or invalid if they fail some aspect of specimen validity testing, and if a specimen is invalid, most labs will stop the testing process on the assumption that the concentration of a drug or metabolite as measured in the sample will be uninterpretable.

### The unexpected urine test: a matter far from simple [^116SNHso]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For patients who receive opioids or benzodiazepines, urine drug tests shed some light on the question of whether patients take their medicines as directed. How often do patients prescribed these drugs fall short? A commercial laboratory's review of 144,535 urine samples found a high prevalence of disagreement between what clinic staff reported on laboratory requisitions and what was detected in the urine. Before concluding that most patients fail to take opioids and benzodiazepines correctly, we should take into account that urine tests sent to national laboratories reflect a skewed subset of patients who receive prescriptions. Additionally, laboratory requisitions prepared by office staff are not likely to perfectly reflect what is prescribed. Nevertheless, this report by McClure et al reminds us that urine drug test results will frequently diverge from what clinicians expect. Urine tests convey a signal requiring interpretation followed by careful, patient-centered decisions.

### Child with early pubic hair / mature body odor [^113qwo35]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Additional information for children with early pubic hair/body odor states that a thorough medical history, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory assessment are essential to be able to rule out other underlying medical conditions. Most presentations of early pubic hair or body odor will be benign, but there is a higher risk of true pathology with pubic hair and/or body odor development in children of younger ages. DHEA-S (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) levels are often mildly elevated for age. There has been an association of early adrenarche and subsequent development of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in adolescent girls, and obesity may also predispose to early adrenarche.

### Olfactory detection of human bladder cancer by dogs: proof of principle study [^113C1edB]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine whether dogs can be trained to identify people with bladder cancer on the basis of urine odour more successfully than would be expected by chance alone.

Design

Experimental, "proof of principle" study in which six dogs were trained to discriminate between urine from patients with bladder cancer and urine from diseased and healthy controls and then evaluated in tests requiring the selection of one bladder cancer urine sample from six controls.

Participants

36 male and female patients (age range 48–90 years) presenting with new or recurrent transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (27 samples used for training; 9 used for formal testing); 108 male and female controls (diseased and healthy, age range 18–85 years — 54 samples used in training; 54 used for testing).

Main Outcome Measure

Mean proportion of successes per dog achieved during evaluation, compared with an expected value of 1 in 7 (14%).

Results

Taken as a group, the dogs correctly selected urine from patients with bladder cancer on 22 out of 54 occasions. This gave a mean success rate of 41% (95% confidence intervals 23% to 58% under assumptions of normality, 26% to 52% using bootstrap methods), compared with 14% expected by chance alone. Multivariate analysis suggested that the dogs' capacity to recognise a characteristic bladder cancer odour was independent of other chemical aspects of the urine detectable by urinalysis.

Conclusions

Dogs can be trained to distinguish patients with bladder cancer on the basis of urine odour more successfully than would be expected by chance alone. This suggests that tumour related volatile compounds are present in urine, imparting a characteristic odour signature distinct from those associated with secondary effects of the tumour, such as bleeding, inflammation, and infection.

The NMR chemical shifts of a substance in a complex mixture strongly depend on the composition of the mixture itself, as many weak interactions occur that are hardly predictable. Chemical shift variability is the major obstacle to automatically assigning, and subsequently quantitating, metabolite signals in body fluids, particularly urine. Here we demonstrate that the chemical shifts of signals in urine are actually predictable. This is achieved by constructing ca. 4000 artificial mixtures where the concentrations of 52 most abundant urine metabolites — including 11 inorganic ions — are varied, to sparsely but efficiently populate an N-dimensional concentration matrix. A strong relationship is established between the concentration matrix and the chemical shift matrix, so that chemical shifts of > 90 metabolite signals can be accurately predicted in real urine samples. The concentrations of the invisible inorganic ions are also accurately predicted, along with those of albumin and of several other abundant urine components.

### Targeted tshz3 deletion in corticostriatal circuit components segregates core autistic behaviors [^112d2Sjs]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Assessment of sensory function

Visual, auditory, and olfactory integrity is required to ensure the validity of the behavioral data. These sensorial capacities were tested according to previously described protocols.

Visual capacities

The mouse was raised, taken by the tail, and a thin stick was approached to its eyes, without touching the vibrissae. Raising the head was scored 1 and grasping or trying to grasp the pen was scored 2. The test was administered five times and the sum of the scores recorded. Swimming towards a distant shelf in the Morris Water Maze provided an additional assessment of the visual abilities.

Auditory capacities were measured using Preyer's response. It consists of a pinna twitching and going flat backwards against the head as reaction to sound. It is correlated with the average evoked auditory potential and can be considered as an indicator of auditory acuity. Mice emit vocalizations (less than 20 kHz) and ultrasounds (above 20 kHz) in the presence of a conspecific male. For this reason, we evaluated the responses to stimulations in the ultrasound bandwidth (50 ± 0.008 kHz and 35 ± 0.010 kHz) using commercial dog whistles. The mice received 5 stimulations with each sound. We scored 1 for ear twitching and 2 for a pinna going flat backwards against the head.

Olfactory ability to detect an odor was evaluated by an increased time in sniffing a new odor using an olfactory habituation/dishabituation test. Non-social aromas and social odors (urines from C57BL/6J and SWR male mice) were presented individually to each mouse. The trial was renewed the following day. The individual score was the median time spent.

ASD core features

Behaviors modeling the ASD domains as defined by DSM-5 were assessed. The tests were selected based on their strong robustness (reliability from 0.77 to 0.92) and on their high loading scores in factor analysis.

### Maple syrup urine disease diagnosed in a resource-limited setting in an infant in Nepal: a case report [^116owhD2]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The metabolism of branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) is required for protein synthesis and cell signaling. Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) is a rare inherited autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC). It manifests as the inability of body to metabolize branched-chain amino acids leading to a typical odor of burnt sugar in urine and other body fluids. It affects around 1 in 185,000 births. The first case of MSUD was described by Menkes et al. in 1954 associated with cerebral dysfunction and accumulation of abnormal urinary substances comprising of leucine, isoleucine, valine, and their corresponding alpha-ketoacids and alloisoleucine. Without intervention, buildup of these toxic metabolites leads to neurotoxicity. The mainstay of management of this metabolic disorder is dietary restriction and conscientious metabolic monitoring with a favorable prognosis, however metabolic crises due to trauma, infections or fasting can aggravate the condition with grave outcomes. The advent of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has expedited the timely diagnosis of metabolic disorders initiating early interventions. Here, we present a case of an infant with a biochemical diagnosis of flared-up MSUD along with COVID-19 infection in a limited resource-setting, who faced an unfortunate outcome due to delayed diagnosis and precipitation of symptoms as a result of recurrent illness.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^113TqUwP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

New evidence since previous review

We retrieved 28 more studies on signs and symptoms in suspected COVID‐19 patients, allowing pooling of the data for some features and estimation of summary measures of diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, this update contains new studies on the diagnostic value of olfactory symptoms, and includes a limited number of studies on combinations of symptoms.

Limitations of previous review

The main weakness of the initial review was the high risk of selection bias; many studies included patients who had already been admitted to hospital or who presented to hospital settings to seek treatment.

The lack of data on combinations of signs and symptoms was an important evidence gap. Consequently, there was no evidence on syndromic presentation and the value of composite signs and symptoms on the diagnostic accuracy measures.

Our search did not find any articles providing data on children. Children have been disproportionally underrepresented in the studies on diagnosing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Their absence seems related to the general mild presentation of the disease in the paediatric population and even more frequently the complete asymptomatic course. The full scope of disease presentation in children is however not known. Misclassification of children both at their presentation to the healthcare system and in the near future, where children will be asked to remain in quarantine when they present with predefined, but not yet evidence‐based symptoms needs to be avoided to decrease the possible damage done to children's health.

Another important patient group is older adults. They are most at risk of a negative outcome of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, especially mortality but also intensive care support. In the initial version of the review, only one study focused on adults aged 55 to 75 years. All other studies included adults of all ages and did not present results separately for the older age groups. The lack of a solid evidence base for the diagnosis of COVID‐19 in older adults adds to the difficulty in diagnosing serious infections in this age group, as other serious infections such as bacterial pneumonia or urinary sepsis also tend to lead to aspecific presentations.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^112ATx2J]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Urine detection window and sample integrity — It takes approximately 2 hours after use for a substance to be detected in urine, and the window of detection for most substances of interest is 1–3 days and up to 4 days in some cases, with duration dependent on factors such as fluid intake and urinary pH. Urine is the specimen most prone to sample tampering, and UDT can be circumvented through sample substitution, dilution and adulteration. A substituted sample replaces the patient's urine with another sample, either urine or some other liquid; diluting a urine sample makes it less likely that a drug or its metabolite(s) can be detected above the cutoff threshold of an immunoassay test; and adulteration uses a masking agent that destroys the presence of drugs in urine or interferes with the enzymatic reactivity of an immunoassay test.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^113VdMm8]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Urine sample integrity — collection and facility practices — emphasizes that urine should be considered the matrix most prone to tampering and that collection methods should protect dignity and privacy while minimizing opportunities for tampering. Observed sample collection can deter tampering and, if there are concerns, collection should be observed by a same‑gender staff member, though observed collection does not completely prevent tampering and providers should consider other mitigation strategies. Providers should consider unobtrusive collection methods for patients with a history of psychological trauma, employ facility measures to decrease tampering during unobserved collection, not allow personal items in the collection area, and consider placing blue dye in the toilet and turning off the water source during collection. If a provider suspects ongoing substance use despite negative tests, sample collection should be observed and specimen validity testing conducted; if a sample is suspected of tampering, it should be tested for specimen validity including creatinine concentration, pH level, specific gravity and adulterants, and all samples undergoing definitive testing should be tested for creatinine concentration, pH level and specific gravity if creatinine is low.

### Chronic back pain with possible prescription opioid misuse [^115qoHQ6]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Data on the effectiveness and safety of long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain are limited. Opioid adherence monitoring includes urine drug testing. Determining whether a patient's opioid prescription should be discontinued after an unexpected urine test result can be clinically complex.

Objective

To review safe opioid prescribing practices and appropriate interpretation and management of unexpected urine drug test results.

Evidence Review

Systematic reviews of the effectiveness and safety of long-term opioid therapy for chronic noncancer pain. Clinical management recommendations are derived from clinical guidelines generated by several professional medical organizations including the American Pain Society, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, and the Federation of State Medical Boards.

Findings

Informed consent and patient-prescriber agreements are important strategies to ensure that patients understand treatment goals and potential opioid risks. Monitoring for benefit and opioid misuse is accomplished by having frequent face-to-face assessments, performing urine drug tests, monitoring pill counts, and reviewing prescription drug monitoring program data, when available.

Conclusions and Relevance

The underlying causes for worrisome behaviors such as urine drug test results that are negative for the prescribed opioid should be fully investigated. Subsequent opioid prescriptions should be based on the revised risk and benefit assessment.

### Color, scent and size: exploring women's preferences around design characteristics of drug-releasing vaginal rings [^116xPqBK]. AIDS and Behavior (2022). Medium credibility.

"Do you know when you are busy having sex, SEX, [Participants laughing], there is that smell, the vagina has its own smell, sex on its own has its smell, so, I think, as I said that these, as I explained that since lemon is this strong and nice. Even a person coming in the room after you had sex, they will not feel that you were having sex, they will not feel that smell, that sense of saying, "Eish there was sex happening here", there are people who have smelly vaginas, you see. But if lemon flavoured ring is inserted, when the partner penetrates you, he will just smell lemon. He knows that my vagina smells lemon, you see. [Participants laughing]. It smells like spearmint, you see. It is not that spearmint flavour will be the same as Chappies (bubblegum), a strong Chappies, because I think they would not create something for us to insert that is going to be strong as Chappies inside our vaginas. It is just that flavour, that smell of that certain flavour". (Group 2, Participant 1, product inexperienced group)

Some participants suggested that people should have a choice of whether a product has a scent or not.

"I would prefer to have both, flavoured and non-flavoured [meaning scented and non-scented], so that a person can take their choice". (Group 3, Participant 2, mixed experience group)

Participants in all groups suggested that their concerns around product scent were related to whether the scent could cause vaginal irritation:

"I also do not see the need for the scent because some of women are sensitive in their vaginal areas, these scents are very strong. I might insert the lemon scented one and it does not like me, and maybe give me rash, so, I would just add color, but not the scent". (Group 1, Participant 1, product experienced group)

UTI definition

There is no universally accepted definition of UTI in individuals with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction. Most studies use either (i) a symptomatic definition of UTI (i.e. antibiotic treatment has been prescribed) or (ii) a strict definition of symptomatic UTI:
Antibiotic treatment has been prescribed.
Bacteriuria ≥ 10² CFU/mL.
At least one of seven UTI symptoms based on consensus guidelines (fever, autonomic dysreflexia [sweating, bradycardia, blood pressure elevation], increased spasticity, discomfort or pain over the kidney or bladder or during micturition, onset and/or increase in incontinence episodes, cloudy urine with increased odor, malaise, lethargy, or sense of unease).
Dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase.

However, other studies use either self-reported UTI, bacteriuria, or other definitions, making direct comparisons or meta studies complicated. For this study, we have not defined any exclusion or inclusion criteria regarding UTI definition; however, it could be argued that for catheter-associated UTIs, a higher level of bacteriuria should be accepted like the catheter-associated UTI definition from the 2009 International Clinical Practice Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America. In general, it must be assumed that UTIs within both neurogenic and non-neurogenic patients suffering from urinary retention are either catheter associated or a result of incomplete bladder emptying.

### Community awareness about risk factors, presentation and prevention and obstetric fistula in nabitovu village, iganga district, Uganda [^114CxBZi]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Awareness of obstetric fistula in developing countries remains a great challenge, and inadequate resources contribute greatly to this problem. Indeed, even patients often have limited knowledge about their condition. For instance, in a review of causes of obstetric fistula from patients' perspective, 70% of the women attributed obstetric fistula to prolonged labour, while 33% attributed the condition to God or operation to correct obstructed labor. This study revealed that pre-operative and post-operative counseling services were inadequate in correcting the levels of low community awareness of the risk factors and symptoms of obstetric fistula. In another community study from Nigeria found low level of awareness of obstetric fistula, as of 130 patients with fistula interviewed, only 70% could identify the cause as prolonged labor. Similarly, a study from Cameroon showed that 41.7% of women with fistula had no knowledge of the cause. There was modest awareness of the signs and symptoms of obstetric fistula as participants pointed out uncontrolled leakage of urine and unpleasant odor as the remarkable signs. However, participants were not aware of leakage of stool associated with some fistulas. Likewise, participants were not aware of other common signs and symptoms or associated complications of obstetric fistula. These include recurrent vaginal infections, neurological damage like foot drop and contracture of the lower limb, vaginal scarring and sexual problems, amenorrhea and infertility.

Perceived management of obstetric fistula

There was a misconception about fistula treatment as some participants believed that certain herbs could be used to cure obstetric fistula. This misconception could be explained by the low awareness of the problem of obstetric fistula in the community. The findings are encouraging that most participants recommended surgical repair of the fistula as the treatment for fistula. The low awareness about fistula treatment could be explained by the small number of hospitals that have skilled personnel and equipment for surgical repair obstetric fistula.

Perceived prevention of obstetric fistula

The participants had good knowledge on the preventive measures of the condition and these included careful operations, discourage early marriages, health education campaigns, early seeking of medical attention during labour, easy access to health units and safety of young girls. The participants' inadequate knowledge about preventable measures highlight the need for improved monitoring of labor, improved access to emergency obstetric services (particularly cesarean delivery), competent medical care for women both during and after obstructed labor, and the development of specialist fistula centers to treat injured women where fistula prevalence is high.

### Evolution of enzyme functionality in the flavin-containing monooxygenases [^113q2DgK]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are enzymes and key assets in vertebrates detoxification arsenal. FMOs are generally known for their ability to convert heteroatom-containing molecules into their water-soluble, readily excretable oxides. Differently from the more specific heme-containing cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, FMOs can accommodate a plethora of substrates within their active sites. Moreover, they also catalyze key steps in the activation of anti-inflammatory and anticancer drugs, and are involved in the endogenous synthesis of essential substances including taurine. For all these oxidations, FMOs employ molecular oxygen (O₂) and NADPH as a hydride donor. Human FMOs are linked to diseases and disorders, with trimethylaminuria −commonly known as the fish odor syndrome — as the most well-known example caused by mutations in a FMO-encoding gene.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria, antibiotic use, and suspected urinary tract infections in four nursing homes [^115UbqRF]. BMC Geriatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

One of the major issues in antibiotic stewardship in nursing homes is the use of antibiotics to treat suspected UTIs. Despite extensive research demonstrating a lack of benefit and a potential for harm for antibiotic use for ASB, this practice continues to be prevalent among clinicians serving nursing home residents. This study found a substantial proportion (50%) of antibiotics prescribed for a suspected UTI was given to asymptomatic residents. Our results were also consistent with previous research that identified fluoroquinolones as the most common type of antibiotic used to treat UTIs.

Somewhat surprisingly, our results indicated that resident demographics or indicators of health and functional status did not affect the likelihood of receipt of an antibiotic despite the absence of physical symptoms for UTI. Several resident conditions such as diabetes, stroke and causes of urinary tract dysfunction were not included in these data. Nonetheless, these results imply that differences in health and functional status among residents are not a driving force behind prescribing antibiotic treatment for ASB.

Our results provide evidence of the overwhelming importance of the presence or absence of an indwelling urinary catheter in the use of antibiotics for ASB. Our results from these four homes indicate that over 80 percent of the antibiotics prescribed for individuals with a catheter were written in the absence of signs or symptoms of a UTI. However, they were usually written in the presence of urinalysis results.

Previously published infection surveillance criteria for UTIs in long term care facilities have given too little attention to laboratory data as part of the diagnostic paradigm. However, in these data, we found widespread use of urine testing in the absence of signs and symptoms recognized in clinical guidelines as indicating the presence of a UTI. These results suggest that diagnostic testing may play a major role in the use of antibiotics for ASB.

Our data highlight the need for further assessment of how the interpretation of these tests might drive prescribing decisions in this setting. The medical literature emphasizes that older persons with a UTI may present differently than younger persons. Thus, a wide range of events may prompt the ordering of urinalyses - any change in cognitive status, change in behaviors, changes in the color or smell of urine, or even a fall. For cognitively impaired residents with limited communication abilities, any signs of discomfort or functional change may result in a urinalysis. However, given the prevalence of ASB, there is a high likelihood that any urinalysis will be abnormal and subsequent culture positive.
