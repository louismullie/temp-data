## Question

Subdural hemorrhage

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the evaluation and management of subdural hemorrhage. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify subdural hemorrhage by age of blood and mechanism. Then, I should verify epidemiology and risk factors, especially in older adults and those on antithrombotics. Next, I will review the diagnostic approach and imaging thresholds that trigger intervention. After that, I should outline acute and chronic management pathways, including when surgery is urgent versus when observation is reasonable. I will then examine anticoagulation reversal and resumption strategies. Finally, I need to consider special populations, outcome modifiers, and evidence gaps to frame shared decision-making and follow-up planning.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework, because treatment hinges on it. Subdural hemorrhage is typically described by age of blood on CT as acute (hyperdense), subacute (isodense), and chronic (hypodense), and this matters for operative urgency and expected recurrence risk, with chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) having a different pathophysiology driven by inflammation, neovascular fragility, and recurrent microbleeds rather than a single bridging vein tear, which helps explain its proclivity to recur after simple drainage [^1156eyYF] [^113pjSZH].

> I should double-check epidemiology and risk factors before I jump to treatment thresholds. Incidence estimates for cSDH in adults older than 65 range roughly from 8 to 58 per 100,000 per year and are rising with aging and antithrombotic use, and I initially thought antiplatelet exposure might exceed 60% in some cohorts, but wait, let me verify because the evidence is heterogeneous; the most reliable statement is that antithrombotic use is common and increasing in older adults with SDH and meaningfully complicates perioperative decisions, so I need to be cautious not to overstate a specific percentage [^notfound] [^112Tyu4b] [^1136nLXB].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach. In the acute setting, noncontrast head CT is the first-line test to detect SDH, quantify clot thickness, midline shift, and mixed density components that may predict evolution or recurrence. MRI can help with small collections, membranes, or mixed-age components and is more sensitive for subacute/chronic features, but I need to ensure CT is available rapidly when instability is suspected [^111RgMWH] [^1156eyYF] [^116PczES].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about surgery for every SDH; I should confirm when acute evacuation is indicated. For acute SDH, classic thresholds include thickness greater than 10 mm or midline shift greater than 5 mm regardless of GCS, and any neurologic deterioration, herniation, or refractory intracranial hypertension warrant emergent craniotomy or decompressive craniectomy, but I need to remember that comparative effectiveness data suggest that in patients where neurosurgeons experience equipoise, outcomes are similar between centers favoring early surgery and those favoring initial conservative management, so individualized decisions are appropriate when the patient is stable and mass effect is modest [^116PczES] [^112QLL7S] [^11287TJG].

> Let me consider the conservative pathway for acute SDH, because I should verify who can be safely observed. In large series, about three quarters of acute SDH patients are initially managed nonoperatively, with only about 6.5% later requiring delayed surgery, and predictors of deterioration include greater thickness, larger midline shift, convexity location, alcohol use, and falls; small SDH, especially 3 mm or less, rarely progress to needing surgery, though a minority may still enlarge radiographically, so structured observation with repeat CT is prudent [^111iw8hV] [^116aBCyB].

> I will now examine chronic SDH management, and I need to ensure I separate symptomatic from incidental cases. For symptomatic cSDH or those with significant mass effect, burr-hole drainage with closed-system subdural drainage is standard and reduces recurrence compared with drainage alone, whereas minimally symptomatic or small collections may be observed with serial imaging; recurrence after surgery ranges widely, roughly 2.5% to 33%, and radiologic features such as mixed density, septations, and membranes portend higher recurrence risk, which should inform counseling and follow-up intensity [^1156eyYF] [^1112LSiB] [^1175qtBb].

> But wait, what if we want to reduce recurrence or avoid surgery in selected patients; I should review adjuncts. Middle meningeal artery embolization (MMAE) has randomized data showing reduced recurrence and is increasingly used as an adjunct or alternative in stable cSDH patients, and tranexamic acid has emerging signals for delaying recurrence and reducing residual volume, though I need to confirm patient selection and local expertise before recommending MMAE broadly [^115yRbGT] [^115VK53W] [^1155ZC9A].

> I need to check the role of steroids because I recall conflicting data. Dexamethasone has been explored as medical therapy, but recent prospective work suggests limited or no efficacy in symptomatic cSDH overall, although a substudy hints that hematomas without hyperdense components may shrink more with steroids; given adverse effects in older adults, I should be cautious and reserve steroids, if at all, for carefully selected patients after discussing uncertain benefit [^115z3rQu] [^1112LSiB].

> Next, I should review anticoagulation management, and I must not conflate trauma guidance with spontaneous ICH. For traumatic SDH, rapid reversal of warfarin with PCC and vitamin K is standard, and for DOACs, idarucizumab or andexanet should be used when available based on agent and bleeding severity. However, platelet transfusion has not shown benefit and may be harmful in intracranial hemorrhage, so I should avoid routine platelet transfusion in antiplatelet-associated SDH unless there is a compelling, individualized indication [^1149eACZ].

> Hold on, I should verify when and how to resume anticoagulation after hemostasis. Most guidance supports restarting anticoagulation after 1 to 2 weeks if the thrombotic risk is high, balancing early hemorrhagic risk within 72 hours against later thromboembolic risk; individualized decisions using CHA₂DS₂-VASc and HAS-BLED considerations are reasonable, and some data suggest that earlier resumption may be acceptable in selected patients, but I need to coordinate this with the treating neurologist and surgeon [^113VBfLn] [^112Jseoe] [^112GE81d].

> I should confirm special populations and contexts. In older adults, brain atrophy increases SDH risk and blunts classic signs of raised intracranial pressure, so a low threshold for CT and inpatient observation is warranted, and in pediatrics, nonaccidental trauma must be considered when SDH is identified, with a multidisciplinary child protection approach. In athletes with head injury, rapid recognition and prevention of secondary injury are priorities, and in suspected spontaneous intracranial hypotension, subdural collections may be managed conservatively while treating the CSF leak, reserving drainage for significant mass effect [^113uYaYc] [^1124hpZy] [^116KEmZj] [^111uzaQX].

> Let me reconsider outcome modifiers and prognosis so I do not overgeneralize. Pre-injury antithrombotic use correlates with lower presenting GCS but does not consistently predict reaccumulation, and observational data in older adults with ASDH suggest that a strategy favoring early evacuation may be associated with lower mortality, although this conflicts with comparative effectiveness data showing no outcome difference when equipoise exists. Thus, I should integrate age, GCS, hematoma characteristics, and center expertise into shared decision-making [^114Hexo7] [^116bRmf1] [^112QLL7S].

> I should double-check the evidence gaps and why practice varies. There is persistent heterogeneity in outcome definitions and timing of assessments across cSDH studies, which limits comparability and guideline development, and ongoing efforts like CODE-CSDH aim to standardize core outcomes and data elements; until then, local protocols should emphasize structured imaging follow-up, standardized recurrence definitions, and patient-centered functional outcomes at 3 to 6 months [^1162NteP] [^115t97Qa] [^111ooroN].

> Finally, I need to ensure my practical algorithm is coherent. For acute SDH, obtain emergent noncontrast CT, assess GCS and pupillary response, reverse anticoagulation promptly, and proceed to urgent evacuation if thickness exceeds 10 mm, midline shift exceeds 5 mm, or there is neurologic deterioration. If stable with smaller collections, observe with neurologic checks and repeat CT, escalating if decline occurs. For cSDH, operate for symptomatic patients or those with significant mass effect using burr-hole drainage with closed-system drainage, consider MMAE in recurrent or high-risk cases, and observe small, asymptomatic collections with scheduled imaging. Throughout, individualize anticoagulation reversal and resumption using multidisciplinary input and document functional outcomes at follow-up [^116PczES] [^1156eyYF] [^115yRbGT].

Subdural hemorrhage (SDH) is bleeding between the dura and arachnoid, most often from bridging veins, and is classified by age as acute, subacute, or chronic. Acute SDH is a neurosurgical emergency when there is **thickness > 10 mm or midline shift > 5 mm**, or with neurologic decline, and requires urgent evacuation [^116PczES]; chronic SDH is managed surgically if symptomatic or with mass effect, with burr-hole drainage as first-line [^1112LSiB]. Nonoperative care is reserved for small, stable lesions without mass effect, with close neurologic monitoring and repeat imaging [^111iw8hV]. Anticoagulation should be **rapidly reversed** when indicated [^113uYaYc], and middle meningeal artery embolization is an emerging adjunct to reduce recurrence [^115yRbGT]. Prognosis is worse with acute SDH, anticoagulation, and delayed surgery, whereas chronic SDH generally has better outcomes with timely intervention [^112J52D5].

---

## Pathophysiology and risk factors

SDH arises from **bridging vein rupture** due to brain movement within the skull, with risk increased by cerebral atrophy, age, and anticoagulation [^112n6yLU]. Additional contributors include trauma, alcohol use, coagulopathy, and CSF shunts or spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^111po95z].

---

## Clinical presentation

Presentation varies with size, location, and chronicity: **acute SDH** presents with headache, nausea, vomiting, altered consciousness, seizures, focal deficits, and signs of raised ICP, whereas **chronic SDH** presents more subtly with cognitive decline, gait disturbance, headache, and focal deficits [^111ooroN].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

Noncontrast head CT is the **first-line modality**, showing crescentic hyperdense (acute), isodense (subacute), or hypodense (chronic) collections [^111RgMWH]. MRI helps characterize mixed-age hematomas and membranes and can detect small or isodense chronic SDH [^notfound].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indications for surgery** |
|-|-|
| Acute SDH | - Thickness > 10 mm or midline shift > 5 mm [^116PczES] <br/> - Neurologic deterioration <br/> - Refractory elevated ICP [^114SxZmu] |
| Chronic SDH | - Symptomatic (neurologic deficits, headache, cognitive changes) <br/> - Significant mass effect or midline shift <br/> - Failure of conservative management [^115CWrcy] |

---

Surgical techniques include **burr-hole drainage** (first-line for chronic SDH), twist-drill craniostomy, craniotomy for thick membranes or acute clots, and decompressive craniectomy for severe brain swelling [^1112LSiB] [^114Z5WqL] [^114eAvU4].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is appropriate for small, stable lesions without mass effect and includes neurologic monitoring, repeat imaging, and medical optimization; **close observation** is essential to detect delayed expansion or clinical deterioration [^111iw8hV].

---

## Role of anticoagulation reversal

Rapid reversal is indicated for patients on anticoagulants with acute SDH or before surgery; **PCC, vitamin K, and specific antidotes** (idarucizumab, andexanet) are used based on the agent and clinical urgency [^111wHd4G].

---

## Emerging therapies

Middle meningeal artery embolization reduces recurrence in chronic SDH and is **increasingly used as an adjunct or alternative to surgery** [^115yRbGT]. Tranexamic acid and corticosteroids are under study for select cases [^115RZ8dM].

---

## Prognostic factors and outcomes

Prognosis depends on age, hematoma size, midline shift, anticoagulation, and timing of intervention; **acute SDH has high mortality (40–90%)**, whereas chronic SDH generally has better outcomes with timely surgery [^116nHfuS] [^112J52D5]. Recurrence after surgery is 10–20% and is reduced by closed-system drainage and MMA embolization [^1112LSiB] [^1156eyYF] [^115yRbGT].

---

## Complications

Complications include **recurrence, seizures, infection, and neurologic deficits**; recurrence is less frequent with closed-system drainage and MMA embolization [^1156eyYF].

---

## Follow-up and rehabilitation

Follow-up includes serial imaging and neurologic exams to detect recurrence or complications; **rehabilitation** addresses cognitive and physical deficits, with multidisciplinary care for optimal recovery [^116hyxtU].

---

Subdural hemorrhage spans acute emergencies and chronic, indolent collections; **timely imaging, judicious surgical intervention, and anticoagulation management** are central to care, with MMA embolization offering a promising strategy to reduce recurrence.

### Spontaneous nontraumatic subdural hematomas… [^1169WeKZ]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Virchow, 1 in 1857, was one of the first to recognize the difference between traumatic and spontaneous subdural hemorrhage. 2 He thought that the latter arose from repeated small hemorrhages of a chronically inflamed dura, and to this condition he gave the name "pachymeningitis haemorrhagica interna". Many since have attempted to evaluate the role of infection in this lesion. Putnam, 3a who, in 1925, was the first to review this problem thoroughly, observed that infection had not been proved except as a rare etiologic factor. Leary4 also expressed the belief that the inflammatory cellular reaction is "incidental or accidental". Baker, 5 in 1938, supported Virchow's views, but he offered no additional proof for the infection theory, and it appears that Putnam's conclusions still hold. Chronic alcoholism was suggested as a cause of subdural hemorrhage by Kremiansky6 in 1868. Leary4 performed autopsy in 50 cases of subdural hemorrhage. SCOTT M.

### Unilateral or bilateral drainage for patients with bilateral chronic subdural hematoma: a systematic review and retrospective cohort study [^1166WEM4]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bilateral chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) accounts for approximately 16 to 35% of all cSDH cases. When surgery is indicated, the neurosurgeon must decide whether to perform unilateral or bilateral evacuation, usually based on clinical and radiological features, such as laterality of symptoms, extent of midline shift and hematoma diameter and volume. Consensus within existing literature regarding the preference for unilateral or bilateral evacuation remains elusive.

The approach for treating bilateral cSDH lacks a universally accepted gold standard, although in Denmark a national guideline for managing cSDH has been developed, which advocates primary bilateral surgery for bilateral cSDH. Several studies, including the aforementioned national guideline, suggest that opting for bilateral surgery significantly reduces the risk of growth and aggravation of the non-operated contralateral hematoma, which in turn could result in additional treatment. This proposition is based on the assumption that the contralateral hematoma might expand if only the larger ipsilateral hematoma is evacuated, leading to a shift in intracranial pressure and loss of contralateral counterbalance. Therefore, bilateral surgery is posited as a safeguard against eventual contralateral treatment in bilateral cSDH patients. However, bilateral evacuation might also increase the risk of surgical complications, such as a postoperative acute subdural hematoma (aSDH), extended surgery time, longer hospital stays and increased likelihood of wound infection or leakage.

The main objective of this study is to determine the incidence of additional contralateral treatment after initial unilateral surgery in patients with bilateral cSDH and to evaluate the effect of surgical approach (initial unilateral or bilateral surgery) on clinical outcome. To do this, we systematically reviewed the existing literature and, in addition, evaluated the data of our own retrospective cohort.

### Clinical and imaging characteristics, care pathways, and outcomes of traumatic epidural hematomas: a collaborative European neuroTrauma effectiveness research in traumatic brain injury study [^1136VGSA]. Neurosurgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Recent studies estimate that traumatic epidural hematomas (EDHs) are present in 8% to 19% of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). - EDHs are believed to portend better prognosis compared with other types of traumatic intracranial mass lesions, such as acute subdural hematomas (ASDHs) and intraparenchymal hemorrhages (IPHs). - This is potentially because of the absence of direct parenchymal damage and/or, in the case of voluminous EDHs, the efficacy of early evacuation.-

The 2006 Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) guidelines on surgical management of EDHs recommend evacuation of all EDHs ≥ 30 cm³, regardless of Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and specify clinical and radiographic parameter thresholds for nonoperative management with close neurological observation and serial scanning. A substantial portion of EDH literature, including most of the BTF guideline evidence base, is based on relatively small, retrospective, highly selected patient samples (eg, restricted to EDHs with no or "minor" concomitant hematomas; severe TBI; exclusively surgical cohorts). Consequently, knowledge of the entire EDH spectrum and distribution of clinical presentations, imaging phenotypes, management strategies, and outcomes is limited. Particularly, the prevalence of nonisolated EDHs and the influence of concomitant intracranial hematomas on surgical decision-making are unknown. Guideline adherence in current practice, especially given changing TBI demographics, - has not been evaluated.

In the setting of the large, prospective, multicenter, observational Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI (CENTER-TBI) core study, we aimed to describe clinical and imaging characteristics, management pathways, BTF guideline adherence, and outcomes of patients with EDHs. Characteristics were compared between patients with isolated EDH and those with concomitant ASDH and/or IPH. We additionally aimed to identify site and baseline factors influencing acute surgery targeting either the EDH itself or overall mass lesions.

### Rapid spontaneously resolving acute subdural hematoma [^111gxea7]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

This study reports a rare patient of a rapid spontaneously resolving acute subdural hematoma. In addition, an analysis of potential clues for the phenomenon is presented with a review of the literature.

Patient Presentation

A 1-year-and-2-month-old boy fell from a height of approximately 2 m. The patient was in a superficial coma with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 8 when he was transferred to the authors' hospital. Computed tomography revealed the presence of an acute subdural hematoma with a midline shift beyond 1cm. His guardians refused invasive interventions and chose conservative treatment. Repeat imaging after 15hours showed the evident resolution of the hematoma and midline reversion. Progressive magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the complete resolution of the hematoma, without redistribution to a remote site.

Conclusions

Even though this phenomenon has a low incidence, the probability of a rapid spontaneously resolving acute subdural hematoma should be considered when patients present with the following characteristics: children or elderly individuals suffering from mild to moderate head trauma; stable or rapidly recovered consciousness; and simple acute subdural hematoma with a moderate thickness and a particularly low-density band in computed tomography scans.

### The risk of deterioration in GCS13–15 patients with traumatic brain injury identified by computed tomography imaging: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115eYyvc]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA P protocol and is reported in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The review is registered with the PROSPERO prospective register of systematic reviews and (protocol is available at).

Inclusion criteria

Participants

Criteria were patients aged ≥ 12 years with an initial GCS of 13–15 with TBI identified by CT imaging. TBI included any traumatic extra-dural hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, intra-cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral contusion, or skull fracture. Studies had to be conducted in the context of an emergency hospital attendance including a presentation to the ED or during admission to an inpatient ward.

Prognostic factors

Factors potentially affecting the risk for adverse outcomes were included in the analysis if they were patient factors present at admission including: demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, medication use, symptoms, other clinical features, or factors available from initial investigations.

Outcome measures

Primary outcomes were: death, neurosurgical intervention, or any other measure of clinical deterioration such that admission to a hospital was warranted. Secondary outcome was: progression of TBI on repeat CT imaging.

Types of study design

All studies, other than case studies, were included.

Search methods for study identification

Studies published before 1996 were excluded due to more liberal use of CT imaging to diagnose TBI after this date.

The following electronic databases were searched with results restricted to English language studies:

- **EMBASE (via OVID) searched 11/24/2016**: 1996 to 2016, week 47;

### Subdural hematoma following subarachnoid hemorrhage… [^111QBbmP]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

IN THE recent literature dealing with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage and the surgical treatment of intracranial aneurysms, there is little or no recorded experience with the finding of associated subdural hematoma. That these two hemorrhagic processes may originate in a common bleeding episode has been recognized by Dott, 1 Helpern, 2 and Jaeger. 3 Recognition of this possibility will suggest, in cases of subdural hematoma without evidence of traumatic origin, a search for well-known sources of subarachnoid bleeding. On the contrary, in cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage followed by certain unusual developments, the presence of a subdural hematoma may be suspected. Of our series of 334 cases of proved subarachnoid hemorrhage of nontraumatic origin, 4 a subdural hematoma was discovered in 13. In each case the age of the subdural hematoma, as judged by the degree of clot organization or membrane formation, corresponded with the time lapse after a definite bleeding episode.

### Chronic subdural haematoma: modern management and emerging therapies [^1112LSiB]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic subdural haematoma (CSDH) is one of the most common neurological disorders, and is especially prevalent among elderly individuals. Surgical evacuation is the mainstay of management for symptomatic patients or haematomas exerting significant mass effect. Although burr hole craniostomy is the most widely practised technique worldwide, approximately 10–20% of surgically treated patients experience postoperative recurrence necessitating reoperation. Given the increasing incidence of CSDH in a growing elderly population, a need exists for refined techniques that combine a minimally invasive approach with clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness. In addition, nonsurgical treatment modalities, such as steroids, are attracting considerable interest, as they have the potential to reduce postoperative recurrence or even replace the need for surgery in selected patients. This Review provides an overview of the contemporary management of CSDH and presents considerations regarding future approaches that could further optimize patient care and outcomes.

### Traumatic low attenuation subdural fluid collections in children younger than 3 years… [^113AfJ7X]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

The main objective of this retrospective study was to determine the time course for the development of these fluid collections. Methods. The adjacent sulci are effaced, and cerebral edema is present. There is an increase in high attenuation clotted blood in the posterior interhemispheric fissure. D, Eleven days after the injury, there are increased sizes of the subdural fluid collections, with compression of the adjacent portions of the cerebrum. The posterior interhemispheric subdural hematoma has almost disappeared. The most common associated hemorrhage was in the subdural space, occurring in 48 of the patients. Epidural hemorrhage occurred in 3 of the patients and subarachnoid hemorrhage in 1. Three patients had no visible intracranial hemorrhage. The major practical implication of our findings relates to timing of the trauma for medicolegal purposes.

Our data indicate not only that low attenuation subdural fluid collections can be identified within hours or days after the injury but also that combinations of clotted intracranial blood and subdural fluid can occur after a single traumatic insult, potentially mimicking an acute and a chronic subdural hematoma. Other potential pathogenic mechanisms for posttraumatic low attenuation subdural fluid include a hygroma due to a tear in the arachnoid membrane, 6 an effusion from traumatized meninges, 7, 8 and a hyperacute hematoma with fresh unclotted blood or areas of unretracted semiliquid clot. 9, 10 A hyperacute hematoma pattern, with sequential CT examinations showing conversion of liquid extravasated blood to a hyperdense clot, was demonstrated in only 1 of our patients. There are reports of hyperacute subdural hematomas in infants, with low attenuation areas due to unclotted blood occurring in association with subdural hemorrhage seen on CT performed soon after the trauma. 10, 16.

Conclusions Our findings indicate that most trauma-related low attenuation subdural fluid collections in children younger than 3 years develop within the first week after the head injury. Coexistent clotted subdural blood is often present during the acute phase of the injury, and the imaging appearance may mimic that of acute hemorrhage into a chronic subdural fluid collection. Therefore, although low attenuation subdural fluid collections in association with acute intracranial hemorrhage may represent multiple traumatic events, they are not diagnostic. The pathogenesis of these fluid collections is likely multifactorial.

### Management of anticoagulant-related intracranial hemorrhage: an evidence-based review [^113qzFDz]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Surgery

The rationale to evacuate cerebral parenchymal hemorrhages is to prevent thrombin and hemoglobin degradation-product-mediated secondary brain damage. In addition, surgical removal of blood clots alleviates pressure gradients inside the skull and restitutes normal anatomy, thus reducing or abolishing pressure on and injury to vital midline diencephalic structures. There are no studies specifically addressing the question of surgical evacuation of hematoma in AICH, whether it is intra-parenchymal or elsewhere. In clinical practice, and for obvious reasons, reversal of coagulopathy precedes potential hematoma evacuation.

Randomized trials for spontaneous ICH go back to the early 1960s. The STICH trial (International Surgical Trial in Intracerebral Hemorrhage) randomized over 1,000 patients to early surgery (within 24 hours of randomization) or initial conservative treatment, but failed to show any clinical benefit of surgical evacuation. Subgroup analysis indicating potential benefit of surgery in superficial ICH (< 1 cm from cerebral surface) was the basis for the recently concluded STICH II trial, in which primary intention-to-treat analysis showed a small but nonsignificant increase in the number of patients having a favorable outcome at 6 months in the early surgery group. There was also a suggestion of a reduction in mortality, but this finding was also nonsignificant.

Surgical management after traumatic brain injury leading to acute epidural or subdural hemorrhage is generally indicated if the Glasgow Coma Scale score is ≤ 8 and there is a 5 mm or more shift on head computed tomography. In a retrospective case series of 11 patients on oral phenprocoumon (vitamin K antagonist) presenting with acute subdural hemorrhage, the authors reported mortality of 45.5% at 6 months and the remaining patients were functionally independent during the same follow-up period. Given the acuity and associated high morbidity and mortality of AICH, it is difficult to systematically study surgical therapy in this subgroup of patients.

### Diagnosis and management of stroke in adults with primary brain tumor [^112n6yLU]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Considerations

An acute change in neurological status or function irrespective of an existing cancer diagnosis requires immediate attention and further investigation (Fig. 1). A careful neurologic examination will help to provide neuroanatomic localization and the history of the event will help to further refine the differential diagnosis. Imaging of the appropriate region of the central nervous system is essential and acute changes in the limbs or torso should bring spinal cord processes into the diagnostic possibilities, underscoring the importance of the neurologic examination. While magnetic resonance imaging provides better anatomic and etiologic information, it is more time consuming. Conversely, in the setting of a rapid neurologic deterioration, a non-contrast CT of the head is the fastest and most easily available imaging modality to rule out acute intracranial hemorrhage. Despite the limited resolution, CT can distinguish multiple types of hemorrhage including epidural, subdural, subarachnoid, intraparenchymal, intratumoral, and intraventricular hemorrhage. The location of the blood can also provide information about the potential origin of bleeding. Epidural hemorrhages are more frequently due to injury of the middle meningeal artery after a trauma, yet venous bleeding from a skull fracture can also occur especially in the pediatric population. Subdural hematomas originate from a tear the bridging veins and most frequently result from head trauma. However, particularly in the setting of brain atrophy often found in elderly as a late consequence of cranial radiation, subdural hematomas can occur spontaneously. Subarachnoid hemorrhage from a defect in an intracranial artery can be traumatic or non-traumatic as well as aneurysmal versus non-aneurysmal. In patients with brain tumors, accidental injury to an artery during tumor resection or an aneurysm associated with infectious endocarditis are distinct causes for subarachnoid hemorrhage among brain tumor and all cancer patients, respectively. Specialized imaging studies such as CT angiography are required to help determine the location and cause of the hemorrhage. Importantly, intraventricular hemorrhage, which is most commonly seen with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage or hypertension-related intracerebral hemorrhage may cause obstructive hydrocephalus and usually results in poor outcome. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage can have multiple contributing and causative factors including hypertension, arterial venous malformation, aneurysm, amyloid angiopathy [iatrogenic], and coagulopathy. This is the most commonly seen type of hemorrhagic stroke. Intratumoral hemorrhage is a type of intraparenchymal bleeding which is most seen in pituitary adenomas and in high-grade tumors, including glioblastoma as well as some brain metastases such as melanoma, choriocarcinoma, and renal cell cancer. Although certain cancer types are more prone to bleeding, additional factors like thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, certain medications may also contribute to the risk of intratumoral bleeding.

### Acute surgery vs conservative treatment for traumatic acute subdural hematoma [^115mX5tW]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) is a common pathologic finding in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is associated with significant mortality and long-term morbidity. Treatment options include immediate cranial surgery for evacuation or initial conservative (nonsurgical) medical management with the potential for operative intervention in the event of neurologic decompensation. For this decision, the neurosurgeon weighs surgical risks against the risk of early death or disability due to deterioration. In cases of rapid neurologic decline due to ASDH with mass effect, acute surgery is required to relieve intracranial hypertension or herniation or to prevent death. However, in most cases, deciding between surgery and conservative management is less clear.

The 2006 Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelinesrecommend surgery when the hematoma is significantly large, irrespective of neurologic condition, or in the case of progressive neurologic deterioration referable to the lesion. However, the supporting evidence for surgery is limited, derived primarily from noncomparative studies with a small study population. Consequently, the threshold for ASDH surgical evacuation varies substantially among centers, reflecting strong center-specific treatment preferences that may signal clinicians' uncertainty.

Practice variations offer opportunities to assess the clinical effectiveness of interventions by examining the association between treatment variation and patient outcomes. In the recent large observational cohort studies Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI; conducted in Europe and Israel) and Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI; conducted in the US), designed for comparative effectiveness research, preferred local treatment approaches were embraced to estimate their clinical effectiveness.CENTER-TBI previously reported that substantial practice variations in acute surgery vs initial conservative treatment for ASDH were not associated with differences in outcome. We aimed to replicate this study in the US using TRACK-TBI. Our predefined goal was to compare the effectiveness of acute surgical evacuation with that of initial conservative treatment for patients with TBI and ASDH.

### Change in hematoma size after dexamethasone therapy in chronic subdural hematoma subtypes: a prospective study in symptomatic patients [^115z3rQu]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2023). Medium credibility.

The main treatment strategy for chronic subdural hematoma is surgical intervention. When a conservative pharmacological approach is considered in symptomatic patients, mainly dexamethasone therapy is applied. Recent trials revealed dexamethasone therapy to be an ineffective treatment in symptomatic patients with chronic subdural hematoma. Whether the efficacy of dexamethasone therapy differs in radiological hematoma subtypes is unknown. The aim of this substudy was to identify which hematoma subtype might be favorable for dexamethasone therapy. As part of a randomized controlled trial, symptomatic chronic subdural hematoma patients received 19-days dexamethasone therapy. The primary outcome measure was the change in hematoma size as measured on follow-up computed tomography (CT) after 2 weeks of dexamethasone in six hematoma (architectural and density) subtypes: homogeneous total, laminar, separated and trabecular architecture types, and hematoma without hyperdense components (homogeneous hypodense, isodense) and with hyperdense components (homogeneous hyperdense, mixed density). We analyzed hematoma thickness, midline shift, and volume using multi-variable linear regression adjusting for age, sex and baseline value of the specific radiological parameter. From September 2016 until February 2021, 85 patients were included with a total of 114 chronic subdural hematoma. The mean age was 76 years and 25% were women. Larger decrease in hematoma thickness and midline shift was revealed in hematoma without hyperdense components compared with hematoma with hyperdense components (adjusted [adj.] b -2.2mm, 95% confidence interval [CI] -4.1 to -0.3 and adj. b -1.3mm, 95% CI -2.7 to 0.0 respectively). Additional surgery was performed in 57% of patients with the highest observed rate (81%) in separated hematoma. Largest hematoma reduction and better clinical improvement was observed in chronic subdural hematoma without hyperdense components after dexamethasone therapy. Evaluation of these parameters can be part of an individualized treatment strategy.

### Impact of surgical timing on chronic subdural hematoma outcomes: novel insights from a multicenter study [^1113W5oc]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This is the first study to identify a specific surgical timing cut-off in the treatment of mildly symptomatic CSDH associated with improved clinical outcomes and recovery, offering a potential reference point for clinical decision-making. Patients who underwent surgery within three days from hospital admission exhibited significantly better postoperative neurological outcomes and shorter hospital stays. Surgical timing did not influence postoperative complications, including hematoma recurrence or the need for early reintervention. These results support the prioritization of early surgical intervention in eligible patients, potentially improving both clinical outcomes and healthcare resource utilization. Future prospective trials are warranted to confirm these findings and refine recommendations for the optimal timing of surgical evacuation in CSDH patients.

### Management of raised intracranial pressure in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: time for a consensus? [^114dgii7]. Neurosurgical Focus (2017). Low credibility.

Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is a well-recognized phenomenon in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) that has been demonstrated to lead to poor outcomes. Despite significant advances in clinical research into aSAH, there are no consensus guidelines devoted specifically to the management of elevated ICP in the setting of aSAH. To treat high ICP in aSAH, most centers extrapolate their treatment algorithms from studies and published guidelines for traumatic brain injury. Herein, the authors review the current management strategies for treating raised ICP within the aSAH population, emphasize key differences from the traumatic brain injury population, and highlight potential directions for future research in this controversial topic.

### Simultaneous occurrence of epidural, subdural, and subarachnoid hemorrhages in the spinal canal: a rare case report [^112puRNr]. Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This case report highlights the unique and complex presentation of simultaneous epidural, subdural, and subarachnoid hemorrhages within the spinal canal, emphasizing the critical role of MRI in their diagnosis and management. The unique coexistence of these hemorrhages presented significant challenges, yet timely MRI imaging and surgical intervention were pivotal in preventing further neurological decline. Postoperative improvements in the patient's symptoms underline the importance of early identification and prompt treatment in cases of spinal hematomas.

### Aphasia and chronic subdural hematoma evacuation: a retrospective cohort study [^116Xqz4F]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

The incidence of chronic subdural hematomas (cSDH) has increased significantly in recent years. This is likely a multifactorial phenomenon attributed to an aging population, rise in anticoagulant use, improvement in diagnostic tools and screening, and a higher incidence of traumatic brain injury-related incidents. - According to the U.S. Census Bureau, by 2030, 20% of the U.S. population will be older than 65 years. This demographic shift can similarly be observed globally, with the United Nations projecting that by 2050, 1.5 billion individuals worldwide will be older than 65, with those aged 80 and older representing the fastest growing segment in developed countries.

Elderly patients are particularly at risk of subdural hematoma (SDH)-related morbidity and mortality, because of factors such as increased use of antithrombotic medications, rising rates of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, and cerebral atrophy.cSDH are typically located along the convexity surface of the cerebrum and can present with a wide range of symptoms. Some of these can include headache, seizures, imbalance, lethargy, limb weakness, numbness, and aphasia. Despite the hematoma often spanning across the cerebral hemisphere's surface, it remains unclear why certain symptoms — such as aphasia — are selectively affected in some patients while others are spared. A schematic of the common treatment paradigm and features of SDHs is provided in Figure 1.

### Advances in management of subdural effusion after decompressive craniectomy for traumatic brain injury [^116q9R8w]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Subdural effusion is a common complication after decompressive craniectomy for traumatic brain injury. While many cases are asymptomatic and resolve with conservative management, some patients develop significant mass effect, leading to elevated intracranial pressure, midline shift, and clinical worsening, which may require surgery. Current treatment strategies vary widely, with no established consensus. This paper reviews the pathogenesis, diagnosis, classification, and management of subdural effusion to guide clinical decision-making and improve outcomes following decompressive craniectomy.

### Surgery versus conservative treatment for traumatic acute subdural haematoma: a prospective, multicentre, observational, comparative effectiveness study [^112QLL7S]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Background

Despite being well established, acute surgery in traumatic acute subdural haematoma is based on low-grade evidence. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of a strategy preferring acute surgical evacuation with one preferring initial conservative treatment in acute subdural haematoma.

Methods

We did a prospective, observational, comparative effectiveness study using data from participants enrolled in the Collaborative European Neurotrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) cohort. We included patients with no pre-existing severe neurological disorders who presented with acute subdural haematoma within 24 h of traumatic brain injury. Using an instrumental variable analysis, we compared outcomes between centres according to treatment preference for acute subdural haematoma (acute surgical evacuation or initial conservative treatment), measured by the case-mix-adjusted percentage of acute surgery per centre. The primary endpoint was functional outcome at 6 months as rated with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended, which was estimated with ordinal regression as a common odds ratio (OR) and adjusted for prespecified confounders. Variation in centre preference was quantified with the median OR (MOR). CENTER-TBI is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02210221, and the Resource Identification Portal (Research Resource Identifier SCR_015582).

Findings

Between Dec 19, 2014 and Dec 17, 2017, 4559 patients with traumatic brain injury were enrolled in CENTER-TBI, of whom 1407 (31%) presented with acute subdural haematoma and were included in our study. Acute surgical evacuation was done in 336 (24%) patients, by craniotomy in 245 (73%) of those patients and by decompressive craniectomy in 91 (27%). Delayed decompressive craniectomy or craniotomy after initial conservative treatment (n = 982) occurred in 107 (11%) patients. The percentage of patients who underwent acute surgery ranged from 5.6% to 51.5% (IQR 12.3–35.9) between centres, with a two-times higher probability of receiving acute surgery for an identical patient in one centre versus another centre at random (adjusted MOR for acute surgery 1.8; p < 0.0001]). Centre preference for acute surgery over initial conservative treatment was not associated with improvements in functional outcome (common OR per 23.6% [IQR increase] more acute surgery in a centre 0.92, 95% CI 0.77–1.09).

Interpretation

Our findings show that treatment for patients with acute subdural haematoma with similar characteristics differed depending on the treating centre, because of variation in the preferred approach. A treatment strategy preferring an aggressive approach of acute surgical evacuation over initial conservative treatment was not associated with better functional outcome. Therefore, in a patient with acute subdural haematoma for whom a neurosurgeon sees no clear superiority for acute surgery over conservative treatment, initial conservative treatment might be considered.

### Small subdural hemorrhages: is routine intensive care unit admission necessary? [^115B4Wr1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

With advancing technology, the sensitivity of computed tomography (CT) for the detection of subdural hematoma (SDH) continues to improve. In some cases, the finding is limited to one or 2 images of the CT examination. At our institution, all patients with an SDH require intensive care unit (ICU) admission, regardless of size. In this report, we tested the hypothesis that patients with a small traumatic SDH on their presenting CT examination do not require the intensive monitoring offered in the ICU and can instead be managed on a hospital unit with a lower level of monitoring. This is a retrospective study of patients evaluated and treated at a level I trauma center for acute traumatic intracranial hemorrhage between 2011 and 2014. The clinical and imaging profile of 87 patients with traumatic SDH were studied. Patients with small isolated traumatic subdural hemorrhage (tSDH) (< 10 cm³ blood volume) spent less time in the ICU, demonstrated neurologic and medical stability during hospitalization, and did not require any neurosurgical intervention. It is our recommendation that patients with isolated tSDH (< 10 cm³) do not require ICU monitoring. Patients with small tSDH and additional intracranial hemorrhages overall show low rates of medical decline (4%) and neurologic decline (4%) but may still benefit from ICU observation. Patients with tSDH greater than 10 cm(3) overall demonstrated poor clinical courses and outcome and would benefit ICU monitoring.

### A reliable grading system for prediction of chronic subdural hematoma recurrence requiring reoperation after initial burr-hole surgery [^112kjU1F]. Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

S urgical management is the preferred initial treatment option for patients with chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) when mass effect results in clinical symptomatology. Postoperative recurrence requiring reoperation (RrR) remains a crucial problem associated with current surgical treatment and occurs in 2.5% to 33% of cases. -

Inconsistencies regarding a variety of factors potentially precipitating CSDH RrR across numerous studies contribute that there is no widely adopted grading system for individual prediction of postoperative RrR that can be used in clinical treatment and clinical research. Furthermore, lack of a prognostic grading system, which can be used as part of standardized clinical assessment of patients with CSDH, contributes to inconsistency in clinical care and enrollment criteria for clinical research, failure to render objective criteria for assessing efficacy of treatment strategies, and comparisons of treatment efficacy between clinical studies.

The purpose of this study was to develop a CSDH grading system of postoperative RrR based on predictive factors that can be objectively assessed at the time of first presentation and initial surgical treatment, which can be used as part of standardized clinical assessment of patients with CSDH.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic approach in adult patients with traumatic brain injury receiving oral anticoagulant therapy: an Austrian interdisciplinary consensus statement [^111wHd4G]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical question: Should NOACs always be reversed in case of hemorrhagic TBI? If not, are there criteria to guide decision-making?

There are insufficient data in the literature to recommend NOAC reversal in all patients with TBI. There are also insufficient data to determine whether certain patients do not require anticoagulation reversal.

Studies of the risks and benefits of not reversing the NOAC effect in selected subpopulations with TBI are scarce. Case series have shown that elderly patients with TBI caused by a fall from low height (GCS ≥ 14) have favorable outcomes in the absence of a clear reversal strategy (no specific antidotes available).

The decision to actively reverse the anticoagulant effects of NOAC in patients with TBI must be balanced against the risks associated with rapid anticoagulation reversal, the limited availability of specific reversal agents, and also the costs of treatment. The neurological and overall clinical condition of the patient should also be considered (e.g. imaging results, concomitant use of platelet inhibitors, hepatic and renal function, the potential for ongoing bleeding to cause central nervous system damage, and the potential need for surgery within the next 48 h).

Expert opinion based on clinical practice suggests that NOAC reversal is not required in the following circumstances: (1) negative initial CCT scan and a GCS ≥ 14, (2) open head injury where inspection of the injured scalp indicates normal coagulation status, and (3) unilateral chronic subdural hematomas and minimal or absent symptoms (GCS 15, slight headache, unilateral minimal weakness, reflex asymmetry, midline shift < 5 mm). A wait-and-observe strategy may be applied to patients meeting these criteria.

### Emergent treatment of athletes with brain injury [^116KEmZj]. Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

The focus of this article is the early recognition and emergent treatment of severe or catastrophic traumatic brain injury. The pathophysiology and management of mild traumatic brain injury are reviewed extensively in other sections. Classification of head injuries can be based on anatomic location (epidural, subdural, intraparenchymal), mechanism of injury (coup, contrecoup, linear, rotational), distribution (focal or diffuse), and clinical presentation. Severe head injuries include epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, intracerebral contusion/hemorrhage, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, diffuse axonal injury, and malignant brain edema syndrome, either alone or in combinations. Protective equipment, regulations, and athletic training have improved dramatically as a result of the recognition of potentially devastating neurological injuries from competitive play. Physicians and other healthcare professionals have become integral members of organized sport and must advocate for the players' best interest. Once a neurological injury has been identified on field, it is imperative that prompt management and prevention of secondary injury occur. The goal of this article is to help provide a clear plan of action that is well thought out and rehearsed and that will lead to improved outcomes for the players, particularly those with severe or catastrophic brain injury.

### Chronic subdural hematoma: toward a new management paradigm for an increasingly complex population [^112Tyu4b]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is a frequent yet poorly studied entity. Patients with cSDH are increasingly using antithrombotic medication, are now older, and present with a variety of clinical symptoms, including incidental discoveries. Despite this increasing complexity, management has remained roughly unchanged since the late 1990s. We review here the state of cSDH research under way at Université de Sherbrooke and around the world with a focus on studies addressing specific gaps in the current evidence base. We show that evidence is lacking at many decision points in the typical cSDH patient treatment algorithm. No definition of cSDH is universally accepted, and a formal definition project, along with suggested common data elements to be reported in future trials (CODE-CSDH: formal cSDH definition project) is ongoing. An amendment to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11) has also been proposed to improve classification and registry research. Within the cSDH clinical assessment, evidence for the occurrence of nonepileptic, stereotypical, and intermittent symptoms (NESIS) is emerging. The GENESIS study (Generation Evidence on the etiology and management of NESIS) will test etiological and therapeutic hypotheses for this patient subpopulation. For patients at high risk of recurrence, the TRACS (TXA for cSDH) and EMMACS studies (Embolization of the Middle Meningeal Artery in Chronic Subdural Hematoma study) are, respectively, assessing the use of tranexamic acid and meningeal artery embolization. The overarching vision is that patients with cSDH might be stratified for operative versus conservative treatment based on the need for mass effect removal, then be offered adjuvant therapies based on their risk of recurrence and thrombotic complications. We believe that such tailoring of therapy to each individual should help improve outcomes.

### Acute surgery vs conservative treatment for traumatic acute subdural hematoma [^114W8WEE]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Among US trauma centers, is a treatment strategy for traumatic acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) preferring acute surgery superior to one preferring conservative treatment?

Findings

In this comparative effectiveness study of 711 patients with ASDH across 18 trauma centers, treatment varied highly between centers; proportions of patients undergoing acute surgery ranged from 0% to 86% (median, 17% [IQR, 5%-27%]). Center preference for acute surgery over conservative treatment was not associated with better 6-month outcomes.

Meaning

This study suggests that patients with ASDH treated in centers that prefer acute surgery over conservative treatment have outcomes similar to patients treated in centers that prefer conservative treatment over acute surgery.

### The implications of antithrombotic agents on subdural hematoma evacuation: what does "reversal" truly entail? [^112Jseoe]. Neurosurgical Focus (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The optimal perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy (ATT) in patients requiring urgent neurosurgical intervention for subdural hematoma (SDH) is poorly understood. The delicate equilibrium of effective hemostasis while preventing thrombosis is complex and relies on numerous factors such as indication for and type of ATT, medical comorbidities, and extent of neurological injury. This study aimed to analyze the impact of ATT and reversal strategies on surgical outcomes to highlight current challenges in the management of these high-risk patients.

Methods

The authors performed a retrospective surgical cohort analysis of 100 patients undergoing urgent SDH evacuation at a level I trauma center between March 2020 and May 2021. The patients were first stratified into two cohorts based on preoperative ATT use and then further segregated by receipt of reversal agents. Statistical analysis included the chi-square test, Welch two-sample t-test, and multivariate logistic regression. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary endpoints included radiographic SDH reexpansion, revision surgery, improvement in preoperative neurological deficits, and incidence of thromboembolism. A crossover cohort was secondarily analyzed in patients for whom ATT was interrupted for a minimum duration equal to effective drug metabolism. Finally, ATT reinitiation patterns were examined.

Results

Of 100 patients, 48% received ATT, 54.2% of whom were given reversal agents. ATT use was significantly associated with decreased rates of postoperative neurological improvement (p = 0.023) with trends toward increased mortality (p = 0.078), SDH reexpansion (p = 0.12), and need for revision surgery (p = 0.10). Patient crossover revealed a 4 times greater likelihood of death in patients without ATT interruption prior to surgery (p = 0.040) without an observable impact on secondary outcomes. ATT reversal contributed no improvement in outcomes other than a decreased intensive care unit length of stay when adjusted for in-hospital mortality (p = 0.014). The rate of postoperative thromboembolism following ATT reversal was 11.5%. ATT reinitiation was highly variable, occurring in 59.5% of patients, with median times of 17 and 15 days for antiplatelets and anticoagulants, respectively.

Conclusions

Use of preoperative ATT portends poor clinical outcomes following nonelective SDH evacuation regardless of attempts to reverse these medications with replacement blood products. This study further reinforces the critical need for judicious use of ATT and optimization of reversal strategies in high-risk patient populations as best guided by multidisciplinary teams and evolving clinical practice guidelines.

### Bilateral subdural effusion and cerebral displacement associated with spontaneous intracranial hypotension: diagnostic and management strategies. report of two cases [^113k1j4M]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

The authors describe two patients with bilateral subdural effusion and cerebral displacement associated with spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) and discuss the possible pathophysiological origins of these abnormalities. The signs seen on magnetic resonance imaging in both cases, such as tonsillar descent, subdural effusion, meningeal enhancement, downward displacement of the optic chiasm, and crowding of this structure and the hypothalamus between the pituitary gland and brain, can help to establish the diagnosis of SIH. Therapy with a lumbar epidural blood patch resulted in the rapid resolution of all symptoms and most morphological abnormalities. The authors propose diagnostic and management strategies based on their own experiences and the reported cases of SIH in the medical literature.

### Factors correlated with the postoperative recurrence of chronic subdural hematoma: an umbrella study of systematic reviews and meta-analyses [^1175qtBb]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Protocol

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis; the research protocol was established based on the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.

Literature search

We performed a systematic search in Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, and Cochrane Library from their establishment to September 2020. Key words and medical subject heading terms associated with the condition (i.e. CSDH, chronic subdural, hematoma, haematoma, hemorrhage, hemorrhage, and recurrence) were cross-referenced with terms pertinent to postoperative recurrence (i.e. burr hole, twist drill, percutaneous, craniotomy, endoscopy, embolization of middle meningeal artery (MMA), steroid, atorvastatin, Goreisan, ACEI, management, treatment, surgery, evacuation, irrigation, drainage, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses) in relevant combinations. All studies considered relevant by the evaluator were included, and qualified research references were manually retrieved. All identified publications underwent a parallel review of titles, abstracts, and full texts.

Eligibility criteria

Duplicate references and articles with a sample size of < 15 consecutive patients were not included. Moreover, we excluded references regarding the treatment outcomes of mixed acute and subacute subdural hematomas as well as references with mixed conservative and surgical treatment outcomes. Studies without clear treatment options and those with nonsurgical treatment outcomes and reports that only examined infants with CSDH and nonhuman species were not considered. Incomplete reports, case reports, abstracts provided in meetings, and letters to the editor were also excluded. Studies that evaluated the treatment of patients with clinical symptoms on radiology and those with one or more follow-up management outcomes were included. Most studies recorded only the first recurrence. Compared with the first postoperative recurrence, the second recurrence after surgery has many interfering factors. Therefore, we recorded only the first recurrence in our analysis. Finally, when there were two or more meta-analyses examining the correlation between the same risk factors and outcomes, the most recent meta-analysis with the largest number of events was prioritized and included for further analysis. Finally, we assessed whether the results reported in overlapping meta-analysis were consistent in terms of direction, statistical significance, and relevance.

### Core outcomes and common data elements in chronic subdural hematoma: a systematic review of the literature focusing on reported outcomes [^113ALhWw]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

The plethora of studies in chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) has not resulted in the development of an evidence-based treatment strategy, largely due to heterogeneous outcome measures that preclude cross-study comparisons and guideline development. This study aimed to identify and quantify the heterogeneity of outcome measures reported in the CSDH literature and to build a case for the development of a consensus-based core outcome set. This systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and was registered with the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42014007266). All full-text English language studies with > 10 patients (prospective) or > 100 patients (retrospective) published after 1990 examining clinical outcomes in CSDH were eligible for inclusion. One hundred two eligible studies were found. There were 14 (13.7%) randomized controlled trials, one single arm trial (1.0%), 25 (24.5%) cohort comparison studies, and 62 (60.8%) prospective or retrospective cohort studies. Outcome domains reported by the studies included mortality (63.8% of included studies), recurrence (94.1%), complications (48.0%), functional outcomes (40.2%), and radiological (38.2%) outcomes. There was significant heterogeneity in the definitions of the outcome measures, as evidenced by the seven different definitions of the term "recurrence", with no definition given in 19 studies. The time-points of assessment for all the outcome domains varied greatly from inpatient/hospital discharge to 18 months. This study establishes and quantifies the heterogeneity of outcome measure reporting in CSDH and builds the case for the development of a robust consensus-based core outcome set for future studies to adhere to as part of the Core Outcomes and Common Data Elements in CSDH (CODE-CSDH) project.

Q3. What predisposing conditions should be considered?

There may be no predisposing conditions to the development of SIH. The evidence identifying possible predisposing conditions is limited but enquiry may be made about connective tissue disorders and joint hypermobility disorders; and spinal pathology including osteophytes, disc herniation and discogenic microspurs in direct relation to the site of the spinal leak.

Q4. When and where should patients with SIH be referred?

Patients with suspected SIH should be referred to their local neurologist. If the patient is able to care for his or her self, the urgency of the referral should be 2–4 weeks, depending on the severity of clinical features including mental health impact. If the patient is not able to care for his or her self but has help, the urgency should be within 48 hours; and if they are not able to care for themselves and do not have help there should be an emergency admission. If the local neurologist does not have access to a practitioner skilled in performing EBPs they should be referred urgently to a regional centre with this expertise.

Patients should have early referral to a specialist centre if the diagnosis is in doubt, first-line treatments fail or there is a rapid clinical deterioration or serious complications such as subdural haematoma with mass effect (urgent referral to a tertiary neuroscience centre). For reasons other than rapid clinical deterioration, the time to assessment in a specialist neuroscience centre with expertise in SIH management should be within 1 month.

A specialist neuroscience centre should have the following services:

Neuroradiological investigations and expertise including CT myelography (CTM) and/or digital subtraction myelography (DSM).
Specialist clinical opinion, familiar and skilled in diagnosis and treatment of SIH.
Practitioners skilled in epidural blood patching.
Multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting where patients with SIH are discussed.
Expertise in performing targeted patching.
Local guidelines for the use of fibrin sealant.
Surgical expertise to repair a spinal CSF leak.

### Nonsurgical acute traumatic subdural hematoma: what is the risk? [^111iw8hV]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

Object

The Brain Trauma Foundation has published guidelines on the surgical management of traumatic subdural hematoma (SDH). However, no data exist on the proportion of patients with SDH that can be selected for conservative management and what is the outcome of these patients. The goals of this study were as follows: 1) to establish what proportion of patients are initially treated conservatively; 2) to determine what proportion of patients will deteriorate and require surgical evacuation; and 3) to identify risk factors associated with deterioration and delayed surgery.

Methods

All cases of acute traumatic SDH (869 when inclusion criteria were met) presenting over a 4-year period were reviewed. For all conservatively treated SDH, the proportion of delayed surgical intervention and the Glasgow Outcome Scale score were taken as outcome measures. Multiple factors were compared between patients who required delayed surgery and patients without surgery.

Results

Of the 869 patients with acute traumatic SDH, 646 (74.3%) were initially treated conservatively. A good outcome was achieved in 76.7% of the patients. Only 6.5% eventually required delayed surgery, and the median delay for surgery was 9.5 days. Factors associated with deterioration were as follows: 1) thicker SDH (p < 0.001); 2) greater midline shift (p < 0.001); 3) location at the convexity (p = 0.001); 4) alcohol abuse (p = 0.0260); and 5) history of falls (p = 0.018). There was no significant difference in regard to age, sex, Glasgow Coma Scale score, Injury Severity Score, abnormal coagulation, use of blood thinners, and presence of cerebral atrophy or white matter disease.

Conclusions

The majority of patients with SDH are treated conservatively. Of those, only 6.5% later required surgery, for raised intracranial pressure or SDH progression. Patients at risk can be identified and followed more carefully.

### The 2023 WSES guidelines on the management of trauma in elderly and frail patients [^113uYaYc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Head trauma in the geriatric patient carries a greater risk of intracranial injury irrespective of ISS, together with an increased mortality and morbidity (two-fold and four-fold, respectively) compared to the younger population. This is due to the increased risk of hemorrhage in all the intracranial compartments, but particularly the subdural compartment. Even in cases of serious intracranial injury, geriatric patients are less likely to manifest neurologic signs of raised intracranial pressure because of brain atrophy. It is estimated that around 3% of geriatric trauma patients have intracranial injury without clinical signs, history of loss of consciousness, focal neurology, or change in GCS. Therefore, consensus documents currently recommend performing head CT scan in all geriatric patients with head injury, included those who report minor trauma. There is greater probability that geriatric patients with head trauma will return to independent living if early detection and treatment of traumatic injuries did occur and if they are treated promptly. Patients who are under anticoagulants, and those with hematologic conditions or liver disease are at increased risk for intracranial hemorrhage after trauma. Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication also cause coagulopathy. Prompt head CT of geriatric trauma patients who take anticoagulation medication should be carried out, even in those with minor head trauma. If CT images are positive for intracranial injury, coagulopathy should be reversed as soon as possible because the risk from head injury generally outweighs the benefit of anticoagulation therapy. If CT images are negative for hemorrhage the patient's coagulopathy does not require reversal, but the patient should be monitored closely within a protocol of 24-h of observation followed by repeat CT to identify occurrences of delayed bleeding. The threshold for performing follow-up CT should be low in these patients if there is any evidence of clinical deterioration. Protocols suggest that all patients with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage who are treated conservatively undergo follow-up CT at 4–6 h, or earlier if there is clinical deterioration.

### Management of patients with acute subdural hemorrhage during treatment with direct oral anticoagulants [^111g5nuB]. Neurocritical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Anticoagulation therapy is a major risk factor for unfavorable patient outcomes following (traumatic) intracranial hemorrhage. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are increasingly used for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic diseases. Data on patients treated for acute subdural hemorrhage (SDH) during anticoagulation therapy with DOAC are limited.

Methods

We analyzed the medical records of consecutive patients treated at our institution for acute SDH during anticoagulation therapy with DOAC or vitamin K antagonists (VKA) during a period of 30 months. Patient characteristics such as results of imaging and laboratory studies, treatment modalities and short-term patient outcomes were included.

Results

A total of 128 patients with preadmission DOAC (n = 65) or VKA (n = 63) intake were compared. The overall 30-day mortality rate of this patient cohort was 27%, and it did not differ between patients with DOAC or VKA intake (26% vs. 27%; p = 1.000). Similarly, the rates of neurosurgical intervention (65%) and intracranial re-hemorrhage (18%) were comparable. Prothrombin complex concentrates were administered more frequently in patients with VKA intake than in patients with DOAC intake (90% vs. 58%; p < 0.0001). DOAC treatment in patients with acute SDH did not increase in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates compared to VKA treatment.

Conclusions

These findings support the favorable safety profile of DOAC in patients, even in the setting of intracranial hemorrhage. However, the availability of specific antidotes to DOAC may further improve the management of these patients.

### Association of subdural hematoma with increased mortality in lobar intracerebral hemorrhage… [^111tpJ4D]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Subdural hematoma thickness more than 5 mm was an independent predictor of increased 30-day mortality after controlling for other factors including ICH volume. Further analysis showed that the effect of SDH on mortality depended on ICH volume, with larger odds for mortality in those with low ICH volume. Further analysis showed that SDH was associated with an increased risk of mortality in those with an ICH volume lower than 30 cm3 but not in those with an ICH volume 30. Surgical evacuation was more common in those with SDH than those without SDH. Among the 24 patients who underwent surgery, mortality was higher in those who had SDH compared with those who did not have SDH.

Collapse at the onset of symptoms, or being found unresponsive, was more common when SDH was present but this association was explained by larger ICH volumes resulting in more severe stroke symptoms. Second, there were 4 patients admitted to the hospital where SDH only became apparent on repeated imaging. These patients were under medical supervision at the time when SDH become apparent and therefore antecedent trauma, at least in the 24 hours prior, can be reliably excluded. The decreased effect of SDH on mortality in those with higher ICH volumes probably reflects the poor prognosis conferred by the large ICH. Our data suggest that SDH may be of greater clinical relevance in patients with smaller ICH volumes who are not necessarily destined for poor outcomes based on ICH size alone. Subdural hematomas are relatively accessible by surgery; however, in our study, half of patients with SDH who had surgery died.

Whether the observed high mortality rate is because surgery is relatively ineffective for this syndrome, or because prognosis is poor regardless of surgery, cannot be determined in this observational study.

### Factors associated with success of conservative therapy in chronic subdural hematoma: a single-center retrospective analysis [^1136nLXB]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) predominantly affects elderly and has an estimated incidence of 8.1–58 per 100,000 per year for patients older than 65 years. Because of the aging population the prevalence of cSDH is expected to increase rapidly in the near future. Clinical presentation can differ concerning the type and severity of symptoms. Some patients experience none, or very mild symptoms.

Surgical therapy is the mainstay of treatment for patients with severe symptoms, such as diminished level of consciousness, hemiparesis or intractable headache. However, especially in this often frail population, surgery comes with complications and an increased risk of mortality and disability, leaving patients dependent on care. Patients with no or relatively mild symptoms, can be managed conservatively by employing a 'wait-and-watch' or 'wait-and-scan' policy with regular outpatient clinic visits and additional CT-scans if necessary. Strict criteria for conservative or surgical treatment, or general guidelines for cSDH treatment, are not available, leading to considerable treatment variation between hospitals and physicians.

Existing cSDH literature is mainly focused on surgically treated patients. Studies regarding the effect of conservative therapy are scarce and mostly case reports or series concerning selective, non-consecutive populations. A recent systematic review however, reported that success of conservative therapy could be achieved in 60% of all cases. Unfortunately, consistent factors influencing success could not be established. In absence of these parameters, clinicians face challenges in adequately assessing whether the potential benefits and risks of surgery outweigh those of initiating or continuing conservative therapy. This study aims to evaluate the success of initial conservative therapy on a patient level, as well as on hematoma level, as patients with unilateral or bilateral hematoma are not equal, and to identify factors associated with success, in a large consecutive cohort of patients.

### Traumatic spinal subdural hematoma with spontaneous resolution [^114RSXsi]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

A case report with a literature review is presented.

Objective

To describe and review the clinical presentations, characteristic findings from imaging studies, and treatment of traumatic spinal subdural hematoma.

Summary Of Background Data

Traumatic spinal subdural hematoma is uncommon, and only eight cases have been reported in the literature. Concomitant intracranial and spinal subdural hematoma in the same patient has not been well studied.

Methods

A case of concomitant spinal and intracranial subdural hematoma is reported as well as a review of the literature.

Results

Including our patient, we found that five of the nine patients with traumatic spinal subdural hematoma also had intracranial hematoma. We hypothesize that the mechanism of traumatic spinal subdural hematoma may be associated with intracranial events. Recognition of blood products in magnetic resonance imaging scans is important to distinguish spinal subdural hematoma from other spinal lesions. It is generally agreed that prompt laminectomy with evacuation of hematoma should be performed before irreversible damage to the spinal cord occurs. However, including our patient, three of the nine reported cases with thoracic or lumbar subdural hematoma resolved spontaneously with conservative treatment.

Conclusions

This 12-year-old boy illustrated the rapid spontaneous resolution of traumatic subdural hematoma in both left hemisphere and lumbar spine with conservative treatment. This report suggests a possible role of conservative management for traumatic lumbar subdural hematoma, especially when the patients already have neurologic recovery.

### Relevance of comorbidities and antithrombotic medication as risk factors for reoperation in patients with chronic subdural hematoma [^1149eACZ]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Clinical management of patients with antithrombotics

The incidence rate of chronic subdural hematomas is rising and has been associated with the increasing use of antithrombotics. Patients with cSDH will, therefore very frequently present with antithrombotic medication and chronic comorbidities that need to be considered in their clinical management.

In contrast to other reported strategies, where patients on antiplatelet drugs with cSDH routinely receive platelet transfusions, only a few such patients received a platelet transfusion before surgery in this study. In recent years, the use of platelet transfusions in emergencies such as intracranial bleedings has been questioned due to reports of lacking benefit or even detrimental effects. In the prospective, multi-center PATCH-study, platelet transfusion was concluded to be inferior to standard care in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. It was associated with higher complication and mortality rates. Our study suggests that cSDH patients on antiplatelet drugs can have an excellent clinical outcome, as measured by GOS, without the extensive use of platelet transfusions. Instead, assessing platelet function and a short delay of the surgical intervention under clinical observation or hemostatic treatment with, e.g. desmopressin or tranexamic acid in more urgent cases seem to be sufficiently effective management strategies. Of note, the addition of tranexamic acid to standard surgical cSDH drainage has been associated with a delay of hematoma recurrence and a reduction of residual hematoma volume in a recent prospective randomized trial, indicating that it might be the preferrable choice when hemostatic management of cSDH patients on antiplatelets is required.

### Factors associated with success of conservative therapy in chronic subdural hematoma: a single-center retrospective analysis [^115CWrcy]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this single-center, retrospective study, conservative therapy of patients with a cSDH and no, or only mild, symptoms could be achieved without crossover-to-surgery in a slight majority of patients, even in the presence of (mild) motor deficits. Parameters associated with success were hematoma volume and hypodense hematoma type. As time to crossover in these selected patients is in the order of weeks, cautious follow-up appears to be safe and feasible. In order to determine the true efficacy of conservative therapy, especially considering clinical outcomes, future prospective studies are necessary. This requires a standardized, nationwide (and preferably international), and integrated approach.

### Working toward rational and evidence-based treatment of chronic subdural hematoma [^113pjSZH]. Clinical Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is one of the most common neurosurgical conditions that can usually be treated with relatively simple and effective surgical procedures. It affects primarily the elderly, a rising population worldwide. Together with improved awareness among the medical profession and greater access to modern imaging facilities, the incidence of CSDH is set to rise significantly. Maximization of the efficiency of management of CSDH is therefore a priority. To this end, a review of the findings of clinical and laboratory research underpinning the basis of the modern management of CSDH has been carried out. This review focuses on the pathophysiology and briefly discusses the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and surgical treatments of CSDH, concluding that a one-for-all management strategy is not appropriate. Creating rational bases for the selection of an ideal treatment strategy for an individual patient should be the target. This can be achieved through better understanding of the nature of the condition through systematic basic science research, ascertaining the merits of different surgical techniques in well-designed and rigorously executed clinical trials, using advances in imaging techniques to classify CSDH (a subject not addressed here), and training in and ongoing refinement of clinical acumen and surgical skills of individual surgeons.

### Radiological prognostic factors of chronic subdural hematoma recurrence: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1156eyYF]. Neuroradiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is a frequently encountered neurosurgical disorder of the elderly with a rising incidence. Historically, CSDH was considered as a progressive and recurrent hemorrhage due to rupture of cortical bridging veins initiated by trauma. Recently however, it has been suggested that a more complex pathway of inflammation, angiogenesis, recurrent micro-hemorrhages, and local coagulopathy in the subdural space is involved. This inflammatory response is presumed to play a key role in hematoma formation, re-bleeding, and maintenance.

The diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms and radiological investigation, mostly non-contrast CT scan. Surgery through burr hole drainage or twist drill craniostomy (BHC, TDC) is the mainstay of treatment worldwide. Alternative strategies include watchful observation or high-dose glucocorticoids administration depending on symptom severity and local protocols. Ultimately, the aim of all therapeutic modalities is adequate symptom relieve by effective hematoma resolution.

Recurrence of CSDH after surgery occurs frequently with reported rates that vary between 2.5 and 33%. Postoperative closed drainage as interventional measure is effective in reducing recurrence risk by roughly 50%. Recurrent CSDH poses a formidable challenge in the treatment of symptomatic patients. Recurring symptoms and additional treatment increase patient burden, prolong hospital admissions leading to higher costs, and contribute to a potential poor outcome. Therefore, the identification of factors associated with recurrence is important for individual risk assessment, treatment decisions, and possibly optimization of pre- and postoperative management. An individualized approach could entail adjusting the timing of surgery and anti-thrombotic therapy resumption or even exploring alternative treatment strategies depending on local protocols.

Many radiological parameters of CSDH have been reported to be associated with the recurrence risk, including uni- or bilateral hematoma, preoperative hematoma thickness and midline shift, hematoma density and internal architecture, cerebral atrophy, and hematoma volume. However, studies have shown conflicting results and large discrepancies in recurrence rates due to heterogeneity in treatment, radiological measurement techniques, and variation in hematoma classifications for hematoma density or architecture.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to identify radiological prognostic factors of CSDH recurrence in surgically treated symptomatic CSDH patients.

### Core outcomes and common data elements in chronic subdural hematoma: a systematic review of the literature focusing on reported outcomes [^1162NteP]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This systematic review highlights the heterogeneity of outcome reporting in clinical efficacy studies of CSDH. It demonstrates the lack of a robust evidence-based approach to the management of this common neurosurgical condition and identifies the need for the development of a robust, patient-centered set of core outcome measures for CSDH as part of the CODE-CSDH project.

Q17. How should complications of SIH be identified and managed?

Subdural haematoma

MRI of the brain with contrast and whole spine should be performed to investigate the possibility of spinal CSF leak in patients with subdural haematoma/hygromas where there is a high index of suspicion such as supportive history of orthostatic headache, or absence of trauma/coagulopathy/alcohol misuse.

Small or asymptomatic haematomas should be managed conservatively while treating the CSF leak. Symptomatic haematomas with significant mass effect may need burr hole drainage in conjunction with treating the leak.

Cerebral venous thrombosis

CT or MR venography should be considered in any sudden change in headache pattern or neurological examination in the context of SIH.

EBP should be prioritised as initial treatment of SIH with cerebral venous thrombosis. Addition of anticoagulation may be considered balancing the risks of bleeding complications on an individual basis.

Superficial siderosis

Patients with SIH undergoing MRI should have MRI of the brain and spine with blood-sensitive sequences which can detect superficial siderosis. A higher index of suspicion is needed in patients with SIH who develop ataxia, hearing loss or myelopathic features. CSF ferritin levels and xanthochromia may be measured.

Patients with SIH with siderosis should be managed in a specialist centre of expertise for this disorder. Symptomatic patients with superficial siderosis should be offered non-targeted EBP, or targeted treatment of the CSF leak site if detected on imaging. Deferiprone may be considered in symptomatic patients where the underlying CSF leak is unable to be found or treated.

Q18. What is the best approach for headache management in SIH?

Treatment of headache in SIH should focus primarily on management of the CSF leak, in tandem with best symptomatic management. Appropriate pain relief should be given as part of best symptom management. Paracetamol and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be considered. Opioid medication may be required to provide adequate pain relief, but should be avoided in the routine long-term management of headache in SIH.

In patients not responding to initial management of SIH, it is important to look for comorbid primary headache and treat as per phenotype, and important to consider and warn patients about the risk of medication overuse headache. For management of associated primary headache, drugs that potentially lower CSF pressure such as topiramate and indomethacin, and migraine preventives that can reduce blood pressure such as candesartan and beta blockers should be used with caution, as they may exacerbate the postural symptoms of SIH.

### 2023 guideline for the management of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113jwLrg]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) — diagnostic evaluation and vascular imaging are guided as follows: In patients with acute onset of severe headache, prompt diagnostic workup and evaluation are recommended (Class 1, Level of Evidence B-NR) to diagnose/exclude aSAH and minimize morbidity and mortality; in those who present > 6 hours from symptom onset or who have a new neurological deficit, a noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) and, if negative for aSAH, lumbar puncture (LP) should be performed (Class 1, B-NR); in those who present ≤ 6 hours from symptom onset and without new neurological deficit, a noncontrast head CT performed on a high-quality scanner and interpreted by a board-certified neuroradiologist is reasonable (Class 2a, B-NR); in patients with acute onset of severe headache without a new neurological deficit, application of the Ottawa SAH Rule may be reasonable (Class 2b, B-NR); for spontaneous SAH with high concern for an aneurysmal source and a negative or inconclusive CT angiography (CTA), digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is indicated to diagnose/exclude cerebral aneurysm(s) (Class 1, B-NR); and in SAH from confirmed cerebral aneurysm(s), DSA can be useful to determine the optimal strategy for aneurysm intervention (Class 2a, B-NR).

### Acute surgery vs conservative treatment for traumatic acute subdural hematoma [^112u8EHk]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the score on the Glasgow Outcome Scale–Extended (GOSE), an 8-point scale ranging from 1 (death) to 8 (upper good recovery), at 6 months. The GOSE was administered by trained personnel to capture TBI-related disability (ie, excluding disability attributable to extracranial injuries). Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality, hospital length of stay (in days), discharge destination, and 6-month quality of life assessed with the Quality of Life after Brain Injury Questionnaire Overall Scale (Qolibri-OS). Measures were administered through structured interviews by trained personnel at each outcome time point.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed from December 1, 2022, to December 20, 2024. Practice variation was described using proportions and IQRs of patients undergoing acute surgery per center. Between-center differences in acute surgery were adjusted for case mix and quantified with a median odds ratio (MOR), which depicts the treatment variation between centers not attributable to chance and not explained by other case-mix factors.

The main analysis associated center-level treatment strategies with functional outcome to derive effectiveness. This natural experiment (ie, patients are "allocated" to one or another treatment strategy based on where the accident occurred) may lead to reduction of unmeasured confounding because patients are brought to hospitals without knowledge of neurosurgical treatment preference (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). Specifically, we compared centers with different preferences for acute surgical evacuation, quantified by the case-mix–adjusted probability of acute surgery vs initial conservative treatment as observed in each center. We presented baseline characteristics and CRASH-CT (Corticosteroid Randomisation After Significant Head Injury Trial–CT) scores, a validated baseline prognostic model integrating country, age, GCS score, pupil abnormality, major extracranial injury, and presence of CT scan abnormalities (petechial hemorrhages or diffuse axonal injury, basal cistern obliteration, subarachnoid hemorrhage, midline shift, and evacuated hematoma), across quartiles of the instrumental variable (ie, the case-mix–adjusted probability of performing acute surgery). The first quartile contains centers least likely to perform acute surgery, and the fourth quartile contains centers most likely to perform acute surgery. The instrumental variable analysis is based on preference for acute surgery rates as a continuous variable; the quartiles are presented to provide insight as to the comparability of patient populations across the instrument, which allows the reader to evaluate how comparable the patient characteristics are (instrumental variable assumption; the instrument is independent of confounders).

### Imaging for the diagnosis and management of traumatic brain injury [^116PczES]. Neurotherapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Surgical management of SDHs, like EDHs, depends on a number of factors, including the patient's GCS score, pupil exam, comorbidities, age, and CT findings. Neurologic deterioration over time is another important factor in surgical decision-making. As with EDHs, CT findings that appear to predict a poor prognosis include clot thickness, midline shift, and basilar cistern compression. While specific threshold values are difficult to determine, and vary among different studies, the Surgical Management of Traumatic Brain Injury Guidelines issued by a consortium of neurosurgeons following a review of the available scientific literature recommends surgical evacuation of acute SDHs that are > 10 mm thick or those causing a midline shift > 5 mm visible on the CT scan (Table 2).

Table 2
Acute Subdural Hematoma, Management Considerations

SDH = Subdural hematoma; ICP = intracranial pressure.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) occurs in ~40% of patients with moderate to severe head injury and is commonly associated with other types of intracranial hemorrhage. SAH may result from direct laceration of the small cortical vessels traversing the subarachnoid space, redistribution of intraventricular hemorrhage exiting the fourth ventricular outflow foramen, or direct extension from cortical contusion/hematoma. Patients with traumatic SAH have a significantly worse outcome than those without SAH: 41% of patients without traumatic SAH achieved a level of good recovery compared with only 15% of patients with SAH, according to the results of a large study conducted by the European Brain Injury Consortium.

Acute SAH is readily identified on noncontrast CT scans as linear areas of high attenuation in the cerebral sulci at the convexities, Sylvian fissures, or basilar cisterns. It is important to examine areas such as the interpeduncular cistern, which may contain subtle SAH that is easily missed without conscious attention to this area. In ~5% of patients with TBI, SAH may be the only abnormal finding on a noncontrast CT scan.

Hydrocephalus is a common complication of traumatic SAH and may develop acutely or in a delayed fashion. Intraventricular hemorrhage or inflammatory arachnoiditis may result in hydrocephalus in the acute setting, while decreased resorption of CSF by arachnoid villi is responsible for chronic hydrocephalus.

### Intracerebral haemorrhage: current approaches to acute management [^1155ZC9A]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Acute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage is a life-threatening illness of global importance, with a poor prognosis and few proven treatments. As a heterogeneous disease, certain clinical and imaging features help identify the cause, prognosis, and how to manage the disease. Survival and recovery from intracerebral haemorrhage are related to the site, mass effect, and intracranial pressure from the underlying haematoma, and by subsequent cerebral oedema from perihaematomal neurotoxicity or inflammation and complications from prolonged neurological dysfunction. A moderate level of evidence supports there being beneficial effects of active management goals with avoidance of early palliative care orders, well-coordinated specialist stroke unit care, targeted neurointensive and surgical interventions, early control of elevated blood pressure, and rapid reversal of abnormal coagulation.

RATIONALE AND BACAKGROUND INFORMATION

CSDH is a collection of blood and fluid surrounded by membranes that accumulates on the brain surface over weeks to months (Figure 1A). It predominately affects older people and often has a delayed association with a preceding head trauma. Patients commonly present with symptoms such as confusion, unbalanced walking, limb weakness, and headaches. This might differentially lead to suspicion of stroke, although the onset is more gradual, and computed tomography (CT) imaging of the head is diagnostic (Figure 1B).

FIGURE 1.
A, Anatomic location of CSDH: graphic highlighting layers overlying the brain involved in CSDH. B, Anatomic location of CSDH: corresponding CT image of CSDH showing area of low density (dark gray) on the right side of the image.

The incidence of CSDH has been increasing rapidly from 1.7 to 31 per 100 000 persons per year up to 2000, to around 20 to 80 per 100 000 persons per year from 2000 to 2019. The projected increase in incidence implies that CSDH may become the most common neurosurgical condition treated in adults. The mainstay of treatment is surgical drainage of the collection and patients spend an average of 7 d in the neurosurgery unit.

There has been significant growth in the number of CSDH publications in recent years mirroring progress in potential management options and outcomes. Interest in alternatives to surgery including drug therapies and radiological occlusion of blood vessels is growing, but the efficacy of these alternatives is yet to be established. Currently, there is wide variation in how and when patient outcome is measured among studies, making it difficult to conclusively compare between studies or generalize the data to a wider population. Much could be gained by agreeing a minimum set of standardized outcomes that should be measured and reported in all CSDH studies, known as a Core Outcome Set (COS). A COS will help align future research studies and is necessary to understand the effect of different treatments on patient function and recovery. To ensure study results are relevant, the COS needs to be informed by what is important to patients as well as to clinicians and researchers. In addition to outcomes, the type of patient included in CSDH studies and baseline data reported on them varies greatly. A standardized definition of CSDH and set of baseline Data Elements (DEs) would help clarify the populations being studied. This is important as outcomes in CSDH patients can be influenced by different patterns on imaging, operative techniques employed, and patient baseline characteristics.

### The management of patients with intradural post-traumatic mass lesions: a multicenter survey of current approaches to surgical management in 729 patients coordinated by the European brain injury consortium [^112fMcr9]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Controversy exists about the indications and timing for surgery in head injured patients with an intradural mass lesion. The aim of this study was to survey contemporary approaches to the treatment of head injured patients with an intradural lesion, placing a particular focus on the utilization of decompressive craniectomy.

Methods

A prospective international survey was conducted over a 3-month period in 67 centers from 24 countries on the neurosurgical management of head injured patients with an intradural mass lesion and/or radiological signs of raised intracranial pressure. Information was obtained about demographic, clinical, and radiological features; surgical management, and mortality at discharge.

Results

Over the period of the study, data were collected about 729 patients consecutively admitted to one of the participating centers. The survey included 397 patients with a severe head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] 3–8), 155 with a moderate head injury (GCS 9–12) and 143 patients with a mild head injury (GCS 13–15). An operation was performed on 502 patients (69%). Emergency surgery (< 24 h) was most frequently performed for patients with an extracerebral mass lesions (subdural hematomas) whereas delayed surgery was most frequently performed for an intracerebral hematoma or contusion. Decompressive craniectomy was performed in a substantial number of patients, either during an emergency procedure (n = 134, 33%) or a delayed procedure (n = 47, 31%). The decompressive procedure was nearly always combined with evacuation of a mass lesion. The size of the decompression was however considered too small in 25% of cases.

Conclusion

The results provide a contemporary picture of neurosurgical surgical approaches to the management of head injured patients with an intradural mass lesion and/or signs of raised intracranial pressure in some Neurosurgical Units across the world. The relative benefits of early versus delayed surgery in patients with intraparenchymal lesions and on the indications, technique and benefits of decompressive craniectomy could be topics for future head injury research.

Nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage is an important health issue. Although common causes such as hypertension and cerebral amyloid angiopathy predominantly affect the elderly, there exists a spectrum of uncommon etiologies that contribute to the overall incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage. The identification of these rare causes is essential for targeted clinical management, informed prognostication, and strategic secondary prevention where relevant. This topical review explores the uncommon intracerebral hemorrhage causes and provides practical clues for their clinical and imaging identification. By expanding the clinician's differential diagnosis, this review aims to bridge the gap between standard intracerebral hemorrhage classification systems and the nuanced reality of clinical practice.

### To drill or not to drill, that is the question: nonsurgical treatment of chronic subdural hematoma in the elderly. A systematic review [^115RZ8dM]. Neurosurgical Focus (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is one of the most common neurosurgical pathologies, typically affecting the elderly. Its incidence is expected to grow along with the aging population. Surgical drainage represents the treatment of choice; however, postoperative complications and the rate of recurrence are not negligible. For this reason, nonsurgical alternatives (such as middle meningeal artery embolization, steroids, or tranexamic acid administration) are gaining popularity worldwide and need to be carefully evaluated, especially in the elderly population.

Methods

The authors performed a systematic review according to PRISMA criteria of the studies analyzing the nonsurgical strategies for CSDHs. They collected all papers in the English language published between 1990 and 2019 by searching different medical databases. The chosen keywords were "chronic subdural hematoma", "conservative treatment/management", "pharmacological treatment", "non-surgical", "tranexamic acid", "dexamethasone", "corticosteroid", "glucocorticoid", "middle meningeal artery", "endovascular treatment", and "embolization".

Results

The authors ultimately collected 15 articles regarding the pharmacological management of CSDHs matching the criteria, and 14 papers included the endovascular treatment.

Conclusions

The results showed that surgery still represents the mainstay in cases of symptomatic patients with large CSDHs; however, adjuvant and alternative therapies can be effective and safe in a carefully selected population. Their inclusion in new guidelines is advisable.

### Rapid spontaneously resolving acute subdural hematoma [^117REyiV]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction:

This study reports a rare patient of a rapid spontaneously resolving acute subdural hematoma. In addition, an analysis of potential clues for the phenomenon is presented with a review of the literature.

Patient Presentation:

A 1-year-and-2-month-old boy fell from a height of approximately 2 m. The patient was in a superficial coma with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 8 when he was transferred to the authors' hospital. Computed tomography revealed the presence of an acute subdural hematoma with a midline shift beyond 1 cm. His guardians refused invasive interventions and chose conservative treatment. Repeat imaging after 15 hours showed the evident resolution of the hematoma and midline reversion. Progressive magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the complete resolution of the hematoma, without redistribution to a remote site.

Conclusions:

Even though this phenomenon has a low incidence, the probability of a rapid spontaneously resolving acute subdural hematoma should be considered when patients present with the following characteristics: children or elderly individuals suffering from mild to moderate head trauma; stable or rapidly recovered consciousness; and simple acute subdural hematoma with a moderate thickness and a particularly low-density band in computed tomography scans.

### A proposed stratification system to address the heterogeneity of subdural hematoma outcome reporting in the literature [^116nHfuS]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Subdural hematomas (SDH) represent one of the most common intracranial mass-lesions associated with high morbidity and mortality. Predominately a disease of the elderly, recent projections indicate 1.5 billion individuals will be over 65 by 2050, with over 80 representing the fastest growing segment of the population in developed countries. Historically, SDHs have been categorized by the blood product age, i.e. acute, subacute, and chronic (Fig. 1). However, the differences that exist between SDH types are not limited to exclusively their radiographic densities, which may have only a small role in the complex pathophysiology pathway from which they develop. The majority of SDHs occur secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Traumatic brain injuries can vary greatly in both their mechanism of injury and severity. Herein arises the challenge in categorizing these varied patients. Despite sharing blood products identified on computed tomography (CT), conventional reporting does not allot any measure towards the magnitude of TBI. Traumatic brain injuries unto themselves are associated with numerous physiologic changes and downstream sequalae with the potential to have devastating neurological outcomes. Although a SDH is often easily recognized on imaging, it still does not adequately represent the underlying injury which may be occurring on a molecular or cellular level. Consequently, an assortment of intracranial pathology is frequently categorized together under a single designation.

Fig. 1
Conventional categorization of subdural hematomas. In this panel of computed tomography coronal images, the three types of subdural hematomas are illustrated using conventional reporting. Figure 1A shows an acute subdural hematoma with a hyperdense appearance relative to brain tissue while a subacute subdural hematoma is isodense (Fig. 1B). A chronic subdural hematoma is hypodense relative brain tissue and similar in appearance to cerebrospinal fluid (Fig. 1C)

A major challenge within the academic literature on SDHs has been inconsistent outcomes reported across studies, most notably for older age groups with acute hemorrhages. Mortality rates have ranged from 40 to 90% for acute SDHs in select populations though more recent reports since 2010 have ranged from 15 to 67.2% for elderly patients. Admittedly, there will always be some variation between studies, but such extreme differences have led to contradictory recommendations in the literature and underscore a greater issue at hand. In this investigation, we sought to elucidate upon the unique subpopulations being combined in the current conventional reporting of SDHs and proposed a stratification system to help standardize and improve reproducibility of future research on this topic.

### Guideline adherence and outcome in neurosurgical treatment of traumatic acute subdural hematoma [^114SxZmu]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2025). Medium credibility.

An acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) is the most common focal injury in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and a major cause of death and morbidity worldwide. The decision to perform neurosurgical evacuation of the ASDH is complex. The Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) issued guidelines in 2006, recommending evacuation for ASDHs > 1 cm or with > 5 mm midline shift regardless of patients' Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and in cases of neurological deterioration, abnormal pupillary reaction, or high intracranial pressure (ICP). Despite their global recognition, the evidence supporting these guidelines is weak. This study assesses adherence to BTF guidelines in a European cohort and determines the effect on mortality and functional outcomes. Data from the prospective observational Collaborative European Neurotrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) study were analyzed. Patients presenting after a TBI with an ASDH on the initial computed tomography scan across 65 trauma centers in Europe and Israel between 2014 and 2018 were included. Patients with concomitant epidural hematoma were excluded. Adherence to BTF guidelines for ASDH surgery and ICP monitoring was assessed, including subgroup analyses based on age and TBI severity. Multivariable logistic regression models examined the association between guideline adherence and outcomes, adjusting for prespecified confounders. Among 985 patients with traumatic ASDH, overall guideline adherence was 74% (n = 724), with higher adherence to conservative treatment (95% [n = 533]) compared with surgical recommendations (45% [n = 191]). Adherence varied by age and TBI severity, being lower in elderly and severely injured patients. ICP monitoring adherence in comatose patients was 63% (n = 240). Adherence to surgical ASDH guidelines was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 0.72 [0.43–1.2]) or 6-month functional outcome (OR: 0.73 [0.47–1.1]). Overall adherence to BTF guidelines for surgical ASDH management was low. The current surgical thresholds do not align with clinical practice. Elderly patients and those with severe TBI were less likely to be treated per guidelines. Incorporating patient age, GCS and hematoma volume into the guidelines may enhance their relevance and adherence in clinical practice.

### Acute surgery vs conservative treatment for traumatic acute subdural hematoma [^115daHCV]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

We found that patients with traumatic ASDH with similar prognoses received different clinical management strategies across 18 US Level 1 trauma centers. Patients treated in centers that preferred acute surgery over (initial) conservative treatment had similar 6-month outcomes as patients treated in centers that preferred (initial) conservative treatment. Results were consistent for patients with bilateral reactive pupils and a GCS score of 3 to 14, a patient population with greater clinical practice variation. As expected, patient-level analysis with multivariable regression and propensity score weighting revealed poorer functional outcomes for acute surgery due to residual confounding.

A randomized clinical trial to answer this question would be ideal but is highly challenging. The RESCUE-ASDH (Randomized Evaluation of Surgery with Craniectomy for Patients Undergoing Evacuation of Acute Subdural Hematoma) trial, conducted among patients with ASDH, examined the surgical technique rather than indication. Observational studies using instrumental variable analysis offer a promising alternative to conducting randomized clinical trials. An instrumental variable analysis can, like randomization, reduce bias due to unmeasured confounding, which regression and propensity score methods are unable to do. Our study validity hinges on the suitability of the center treatment rate as an instrumental variable. Residual (regional) prognostic differences may still be associated with the observed practice variations. Our instrument was strongly correlated with acute surgery and not with baseline prognosis, supporting its reliability. Variability in ASDH surgery rates is likely associated with clinician preferences. To further elucidate the associations between ASDH treatment strategies within centers and TBI outcomes, adjustments were made for other between-center differences using random-effects modeling.

### The neurocritical and neurosurgical care of subdural hematomas [^111m7p9f]. Neurocritical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Subdural hematomas (SDHs), though frequently grouped together, can result from a variety of different etiologies, and therefore many different subtypes exist. Moreover, the high incidence of these lesions in the neurocritical care settings behooves practitioners to have a firm grasp on their diagnosis and management. We present here a review of SDHs, with an emphasis on how different subtypes of SDHs differ from one another and with discussion of their medical and surgical management in the neurocritical care setting. In this paper, we discuss considerations for acute, subacute, and chronic SDHs and how presentation and management may change in both the elderly and pediatric populations. We discuss SDHs that arise in the setting of anticoagulation, those that arise in the setting of active cerebrospinal fluid diversion, and those that are recurrent and recalcitrant to initial surgical evacuation. Management steps reviewed include detailed discussion of initial assessment, anticoagulation reversal, seizure prophylaxis, blood pressure management, and indications for intracranial pressure monitoring. Direct surgical management options are reviewed, including open craniotomy, twist-drill, and burr-hole drainage and the usage of subdural drainage systems. SDHs are a common finding in the neurocritical care setting and have a diverse set of presentations. With a better understanding of the fundamental differences between subtypes of SDHs, critical care practitioners can better tailor their management of both the patient's intracranial and multi-systemic pathologies.

TABLE 2.
Management and Outcome Characteristics of all Participants With EDHs and by Presence of Concomitant ASDHs and/or IPHs on the First Scan

FIGURE 2.
Surgical care pathways of participants with EDHs, by presence of concomitant acute subdural hematomas and/or IPHs on the first scan. A, Participants with isolated EDHs (n = 133). Most of the isolated EDHs had volumes < 15 cm 3 (103 participants, 77%), most of which were treated conservatively throughout the entire clinical course (96 participants, 93%). Participants with isolated EDHs between 15 and 30 cm 3 received either initially conservative treatment (7 participants, range EDH volumes 16–28 cm 3) or early targeted EDH evacuation (4 participants, range EDH volumes 15–19 cm 3, motivated by mass effect on computed tomography, or clinical deterioration). Most participants with isolated EDHs ≥ 30 cm 3 received early targeted EDH evacuation (15 participants, 79%). Early targeted EDH evacuation was used after the first scan in 22 participants with isolated EDH (17%), with a median EDH volume of 54 cm 3, IQR 18 to 110. Seven participants with isolated EDH who were not operated directly after the first scan (motivated by guideline adherence, little/no mass effect, no surgical lesion, or acceptable/good neurologic condition) later received delayed targeted EDH evacuation. In these, repeat scanning revealed hematoma enlargement, with a median EDH volume of 26 cm 3 on the first scan and 44 cm 3 on the last follow-up scan before surgery. Two participants received EDH evacuation during surgery for another indication, one in the early phase, for depressed skull fracture elevation (3 cm 3 EDH), and the other during evacuation of a delayed large contusion. B, Participants with nonisolated EDHs (n = 328) Most of the nonisolated EDHs had volumes < 15 cm 3 (225 participants, 69%), most of which were treated conservatively throughout the entire clinical course (169 participants, 75%). Participants with nonisolated EDHs between 15 and 30 cm 3 received either initially conservative treatment (42%, median EDH volume 21 cm 3, IQR 17–22), early targeted EDH evacuation (42%, median EDH volume 23 cm 3, IQR 21–26), or surgery for another main indication. Most participants with nonisolated EDHs ≥ 30 cm 3 received early targeted EDH evacuation (55 participants, 82%). In the early clinical course, after the first scan, a third of participants with nonisolated EDH received a surgical intervention. Early targeted EDH evacuation was used in 77 participants (23%), with a median EDH volume of 46 cm 3, IQR 29 to 78. Early nontargeted EDH evacuation was performed in 11 participants, during surgery for another main indication: ipsilateral ASDH evacuation or DC, elevation of adjacent depressed skull fracture. Early craniotomies/DCs for other indications, during which the EDH was not evacuated, were performed in 23 participants, who received contralateral ASDH evacuation/DC, supratentorial ASDH evacuation/DC (in participants with posterior fossa EDHs), ipsilateral ASDH evacuation/DC (EDH outside craniotomy window). Various delayed surgical interventions were used in 33 participants with nonisolated EDHs who initially received conservative management. Delayed targeted EDH evacuation was used in 21 participants, with a median EDH volume of 18 cm 3 on the first scan and 44 cm 3 on the last follow-up scan before surgery. ASDH, acute subdural hematoma; DC, decompressive craniectomy; EDH, epidural hematoma; IPH, intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Targeted EDH evacuation: EDH evacuation was the main surgical indication; Nontargeted EDH evacuation: EDH evacuation performed, but was not the main surgical indication; Craniotomy/DC, no EDH evacuation: craniotomy or DC for ASDH and/or IPH evacuation/decompression, during which the EDH was not evacuated; Initially conservative: initial nonsurgical management strategy after the first scan; Conservative: no major intracranial surgery throughout the entire clinical course.

### Core outcomes and common data elements in chronic subdural hematoma: a systematic review of the literature focusing on reported outcomes [^114Cw3os]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

The plethora of studies in chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) has not resulted in the development of an evidence-based treatment strategy, largely due to heterogeneous outcome measures that preclude cross-study comparisons and guideline development. This study aimed to identify and quantify the heterogeneity of outcome measures reported in the CSDH literature and to build a case for the development of a consensus-based core outcome set. This systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and was registered with the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42014007266). All full-text English language studies with > 10 patients (prospective) or > 100 patients (retrospective) published after 1990 examining clinical outcomes in CSDH were eligible for inclusion. One hundred two eligible studies were found. There were 14 (13.7%) randomized controlled trials, one single arm trial (1.0%), 25 (24.5%) cohort comparison studies, and 62 (60.8%) prospective or retrospective cohort studies. Outcome domains reported by the studies included mortality (63.8% of included studies), recurrence (94.1%), complications (48.0%), functional outcomes (40.2%), and radiological (38.2%) outcomes. There was significant heterogeneity in the definitions of the outcome measures, as evidenced by the seven different definitions of the term "recurrence", with no definition given in 19 studies. The time-points of assessment for all the outcome domains varied greatly from inpatient/hospital discharge to 18 months. This study establishes and quantifies the heterogeneity of outcome measure reporting in CSDH and builds the case for the development of a robust consensus-based core outcome set for future studies to adhere to as part of the Core Outcomes and Common Data Elements in CSDH (CODE-CSDH) project.

### Management of anticoagulation following central nervous system hemorrhage in patients with high thromboembolic risk [^113VBfLn]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Summary Background

Patients who present with central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage while on anticoagulation (AC) for thromboembolic (TE) risk factors are a challenge to manage.

Objective

We sought to inform decisions surrounding the timing and intensity of AC resumption by performing a systematic review.

Methods

Three reviewers screened publications from Medline and EMBASE and extracted data. Hemorrhagic and TE adverse events that occurred subsequent to the index hemorrhage were recorded, as was their timing relative to presentation and covariates that might influence their occurrence.

Results

Data were extracted from 63 publications detailing 492 patients; 7.7% of patients experienced hemorrhagic complications and 6.1% experienced TE complications. Hemorrhagic complications were more common within 72 h of presentation while TE complications were more common thereafter. Patients restarted on AC after 72 h were significantly more likely to have a TE complication (P = 0.006) and those restarted before 72 h were more likely to hemorrhage (P = 0.0727). Factors associated with re-hemorrhage included younger age, traumatic cause, subdural hematomas and failure to reverse AC. TE complications were more common in younger patients and those with spinal hemorrhage, multiple hemorrhages, and non-traumatic causes of the index hemorrhage. Re-initiation of AC at a lower intensity also significantly increased the risk of TE complications.

Interpretation

Our results suggest that it may be prudent to re-initiate AC earlier than previously thought, with the timing and intensity modified based on predictors of TE and hemorrhagic complications. These findings must be explored in a prospective study because of limitations inherent to the analyzed studies.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries in adults: an evidence and consensus-based update [^111ZJj21]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The task force decided a priori to make an attempt to keep the guidelines applicable to the complete patient spectrum within EDs, that is, to ensure that all adult patients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury can be managed according to the guidelines.

Certain assumptions were also made a priori concerning aspects of management that were deemed unnecessary for critical review. The task force all agreed that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would not be considered in these guidelines concerning initial management and that in-hospital observation, instead of CT, would be regarded only as a secondary management option. The use of plain skull films was addressed and rejected in the previous guidelines. Additionally, we chose not to consider later aspects of management, such as detection and treatment of post-concussion syndrome (PCS) and chronic subdural hematomas. We also agreed that all pathological findings on head CT should lead to hospital admission. Finally, we would not address the surgical or medical management of intracranial complications.

The task force was unclear concerning the selection of patients for CT scanning or discharge, following minimal, mild and moderate head injuries. We were also unclear concerning which patients, irrespective of initial CT scan results, should have hospital admission for clinical observation, a repeat CT scan, or both. Therefore, consensus was achieved to address two important clinical questions that would require systematic review of evidence and would form the basis of the updated guidelines, shown below.

Clinical question 1: 'Which adult patients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury need a head CT and which patients may be directly discharged?'.

Clinical question 2: 'Which adult patients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury need in-hospital observation and/or a repeat head CT?'.

### Pharmacist's guide to common intracranial bleeding terms and treatments [^116oiaTn]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pharmacists care for patients with intracranial bleeding such as those with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) or subdural hematoma (SDH), although these bleeding events are often generically termed "head bleed". This over-simplified term refers to a heterogeneous group of life-threatening intracranial hemorrhages, each with a distinctive etiology and treatment paradigm.

Data Sources

Common intracranial hemorrhage types were reviewed to identify the scope of this narrative review.

Study Selection and Data Abstraction

Relevant studies and guidelines pertinent to the selected topic were considered.

Data Synthesis

Various hemorrhage types such as intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and SDH fall into the colloquialism of "head bleed". However, these and other hemorrhage types are radiographically distinct and often require different management strategies. Surgical management is helpful in some of these situations (SDH, SAH) and limited in scope for others (ICH). Pharmacotherapy for reversal of coagulopathy and treatment of elevated intracranial pressure may be considered similar across the spectrum of intracranial bleeding pathologies, while other factors such as seizure prophylaxis and blood pressure control depend on the bleeding type.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Differences in the need for surgical intervention, neurologic monitoring, cerebral perfusion changes, risk of seizure, optimal blood pressure, and other clinical characteristics make each type of intracranial bleeding unique.

Conclusions

Pharmacists should be aware of the differences in surgical and pharmacotherapy strategies among these intracranial hemorrhages to optimize care for this neurocritical care population.

### Chronic subdural haematoma: the role of peri-operative medicine in a common form of reversible brain injury [^116hyxtU]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Epidemiological studies project a significant rise in cases of chronic subdural haematoma over the next 20years. Patients with this condition are frequently older and medically complex, with baseline characteristics that may increase peri-operative risk. The intra-operative period is only a small portion of a patient's total hospital stay, with a majority of patients in the United Kingdom transferred between institutions for their surgical and rehabilitative care. Definitive management remains surgical, but peri-operative challenges exist which resonate with other surgical cohorts where multidisciplinary working has become the gold standard. These include shared decision-making, medical optimisation, the management of peri-operative anticoagulation and the identification of key points of equipoise for examination in the future trials. In this narrative review, we use a stereotyped patient journey to provide context to the recent literature, highlighting where multidisciplinary expertise may be required to optimise patient care and maximise the benefits of surgical management. We discuss the triage, pre-operative optimisation, intra-operative management and immediate postoperative care of patients undergoing surgery for a chronic subdural haematoma. We also discuss where adjunctive medical management may be indicated. In so doing, we present the current and emerging evidence base for the role of an integrated peri-operative medicine team in the care of patients with a chronic subdural haematoma.

### Multicenter assessment of the brain injury guidelines and a proposal of guideline modifications [^114nA8QD]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is responsible for the utilization of vast healthcare resources, with an estimated cost of $76.5 billion in 2010 in the USA. In 2013, TBI was diagnosed in more than 2.8 million emergency department (ED) visits and 282 000 hospital admissions. Most protocols governing patient care for TBI with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) mandate an inpatient or intensive care unit (ICU) admission, a neurosurgery consult, and at least one repeat head CT scan. The allocation of resources is at the forefront of the current discussion regarding healthcare. Decreasing unnecessary hospital and ICU admissions, reducing consults of questionable utility and minimizing CT scans of limited clinical relevance are all potential sources for dramatic cost savings.

The Brain Injury Guidelines (BIG) provide a method to stratify and treat mild TBI. BIG 1 injuries are < 4 mm subdural hematomas (SDH), < 4 mm epidural hematomas (EDH), < 4 mm intraparenchymal hemorrhages (IPH) or "trace" subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH). Patients with BIG 1 injuries are observed for 6 hours in the emergency department (ED) and do not receive a planned neurosurgery consultation or repeat head CT. BIG 2 injuries are 4 to 7 mm SDH, 4 to 7 mm EDH, 4 to 7 mm IPH or "localized" SAH. These patients are admitted to the hospital, but do not receive a neurosurgery consultation or a repeat head CT. BIG 3 injuries are > 8 mm SDH, > 8 mm EDH, > 8 mm IPH, or "scattered" SAH and are managed with admission, a neurosurgery consultation and at least one scheduled repeat head CT. The complete criteria by which patients are categorized as BIG 1, 2, or 3 are outlined in the definitions section below.

### Cerebral amyloid angiopathy and risk of isolated nontraumatic subdural hemorrhage… [^116S2EFP]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question Is cerebral amyloid angiopathy an independent risk factor for isolated nontraumatic subdural hemorrhage. Findings In this cohort study including 487 223 participants from the UK Biobank and 158 008 participants from the All of Us Research Program, a diagnosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy was associated with an increased risk of nontraumatic subdural hemorrhage, independent of vascular risk factors and antithrombotic medication use. Meaning Cerebral amyloid angiopathy may be a novel risk factor for isolated nontraumatic subdural hemorrhage. Importance Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is a common cause of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in older patients. Although other types of intracranial hemorrhage can occur in conjunction with CAA-related intracerebral hemorrhage, the association between CAA and other subtypes of intracranial hemorrhage, particularly in the absence of intracerebral hemorrhage, remains poorly understood.

The outcome was an isolated nontraumatic SDH, identified using ICD-10-CM codes. Two identical analyses were performed separately in the 2 cohorts. First, the risk of SDH in patients with and without CAA was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for demographic characteristics, cardiovascular comorbidities, and antithrombotic medication use. Second, multivariable logistic regression was used to study the association between CAA and SDH. There were 649 cases of incident SDH. Of the 126 participants diagnosed with CAA, 3 developed SDH. In adjusted Cox regression analyses, participants with CAA had an increased risk of having an SDH compared with those without CAA. The findings were replicated in All of Us, in which 52 participants had CAA and 320 had an SDH. All of Us participants with CAA had an increased risk of having an SDH compared with those without CAA.

In adjusted multivariable logistic regression analysis, CAA was associated with higher odds of SDH.

### New horizons in subdural haematoma [^112J52D5]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Subdural haematoma (SDH) is a common injury sustained by older people living with frailty and multimorbidity, and typically following falls from a standing height. Anticoagulant and antiplatelet use are commonly indicated in older people with SDH, but few data inform decision-making surrounding these agents in the context of intracranial bleeding. Opposing risks of rebleeding and thrombosis must therefore be weighed judiciously. Decision-making can be complex and requires detailed awareness of the epidemiology to ensure the safest course of action is selected for each patient. Outcomes of surgical decompression in acute SDH are very poor in older people. However, burr hole drainage can be safe and effective in older adults with symptomatic chronic SDH (cSDH). Such patients need careful assessment to ensure symptoms arise from cSDH and not from coexisting medical pathology. Furthermore, the emerging treatment of middle meningeal artery embolisation offers a well-tolerated, minimally invasive intervention which may reduce the risks of rebleeding in older adults. Nonetheless, UK SDH management is heterogenous, and no accepted UK or European guidelines exist at present. Further randomised trial evidence is required to move away from clinical practice based on historic observational data.

### Rapid spontaneously resolving acute subdural hematoma [^112a7Vsy]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) is associated with an overall mortality rate of 50% to 90%, the highest of all traumatic intracranial injuries. To avoid further deterioration associated with a secondary injury, current guidelines recommend a craniotomy in patients in whom the ASDH thickness is larger than 10 mm or the midline shift is beyond 5 mm. However, rapid spontaneous resolution of ASDH has been observed in a few patients, some of whom even required a craniotomy. An unexpected good recovery was reported for patients who were treated with conservative treatment. Here, the authors present a patient of rapid resolving ASDH with an analysis of the literature.

### Acute-to-chronic subdural hematoma: radiographic and clinical progression from acute subdural hematoma [^114iYuAT]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

If ASDH develops to CSDH, treatment is necessary earlier due to increase in volume and midline shift. Patients with larger ASDH volume tend to be treated even earlier. Therefore, close monitoring of these patients is crucial since sudden clinical deterioration even with DOC is not uncommon in this type of SDH.

### Improving the management of acute subdural hematomas; identifying characteristics associated with acute subdural hematoma size and expansion [^116aBCyB]. Emergency Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The incidence of subdural hematomas (SDHs) is increasing due to the aging population, frequent use of anticoagulants/antiplatelets, and fall-related trauma. While some acute SDHs remain stable and require no intervention, others expand, necessitating neurosurgical management. Our study objective was to better identify predictors of acute SDH enlargement to guide clinical management.

Methods

This retrospective study analyzed 32,401 noncontrast CT brain scans over six years. We identified 262 patients with acute SDHs and evaluated demographic, clinical, and radiologic factors associated with hematoma enlargement and the need for surgical intervention. Statistical analyses, including univariate analyses, logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curves, were performed to determine predictors of SDH growth and surgery.

Results

SDH enlargement occurred in 58/232 (25%) of patients with follow-up imaging. Larger initial SDH size, concurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage, hypertension, convexity location, and midline shift were significantly associated with hematoma expansion (p < 0.05). No patient with an initial SDH ≤ 3 mm required surgery initially or in follow-up, although 8/72 (11.1%) enlarged (maximum width 10 mm). An 8.5-mm initial SDH size threshold best predicted the need for surgical intervention (AUC 0.81).

Conclusions

Initial SDH size, hypertension, SAH, initial midline shift, and convexity location are key predictors of hematoma expansion. Although patients' with SDHs ≤ 3 mm rarely expanded, they never required surgery. A prospective study to determine a more judicious use of hospital-based resources, especially for those patients with initial SDH size > 3 mm who have risk factors for expansion, would be an important step in the management of SDHs.

This report describes the unusual case of a man with chronic mental illness, presenting with polydipsia and psychotic symptoms atypical of his usual episodes of illness. This report is a reminder to all doctors to beware of organic causes of mental illness, not only in new presentations but also in patients well known to services. In particular this is important when unusual symptoms are present. The report includes some discussion of why finding an organic cause in patients with psychiatric illness can pose challenges and demonstrates the need for good communication between professionals in order to best serve patients. It also highlights the importance of appropriate and timely investigations.

### Improving care in elderly neurosurgery initiative guideline on management of chronic subdural haematoma in older people-relevance for the geriatrician [^112y1qFX]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic subdural haematoma (cSDH) is a common subtype of traumatic brain injury, typically affecting older people living with frailty and multimorbidity. Until now, no published guideline has existed internationally to guide management, perhaps explaining why the care of the older cSDH patient varies between neurosurgical centres. The Improving Care in Elderly Neurosurgery Initiative guideline is the first guideline dedicated to the care of patients with cSDH across the entire patient pathway, from initial presentation through to rehabilitation and discharge after surgery. It includes specific recommendations for those patients not requiring surgery who, in the UK, are mostly managed in satellite hospitals away from the tertiary neurosurgical centre. It therefore has relevance to clinicians across the entire UK and also potentially to a broader international audience. In this guideline commentary we summarise the key points for geriatricians and those allied specialties such as acute medicine who deliver care to a large proportion of patients with cSDH. We discuss issues and limitations relating to guideline development, in particular in the rapidly evolving field of Middle Meningeal Artery Embolisation. We also comment on factors which may influence guideline implementation and future service development. Finally we call for some form of national registry in older people sustaining SDH, which may need to be supported by financial incentives to drive investment in services for this historically neglected patient group.

### Acute surgery vs conservative treatment for traumatic acute subdural hematoma [^111X5pmN]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The findings should be considered within the context of the methods used. Our instrumental variable analysis offers insights into whether patients' outcomes would improve if centers altered their policies regarding a specific intervention, rather than estimating effects on individual patients. The instrumental variable design measures a center-level policy effect, not an individual-level treatment effect. Here, the instrument is the center treatment rate, serving as a proxy for the surgeon's treatment preference. Given that the same patient may undergo surgery in one center but not in another, it naturally follows that multiple treatment options exist. These results pertain to patients for whom neurosurgeons may be in equipoise, meaning that more than 1 treatment option can be considered. Because equipoise varies across centers, it is challenging to identify which patients and to what extent uncertainty applies. Nonetheless, from our findings, when there is equipoise regarding the decision to evacuate or not, no difference in outcome due to a center's treatment strategy is anticipated.

Surgical evacuation of ASDH is a fundamental indication for treatment of life-threatening neurologic deterioration. The current findings do not subtract from the well-established effect of acute evacuation of large ASDH in neurologically compromised patients. Beyond patients with brain herniation and unreactive pupils, surgical timing and indications may vary, as a substantial proportion of patients who undergo medical stabilization as part of initial conservative management have satisfactory outcomes. Our findings replicate and extend reports from CENTER-TBI and therefore provide robust evidence that for patients with an ASDH in which there is uncertainty among the neurosurgical community regarding the immediate surgical indication, conservative, nonsurgical treatment may be thoughtfully considered in accordance with institutional best practices, clinician-specific knowledge, and ongoing clinical progression, factoring in major clinical modifiers such as frailty, multiple trauma, and prior cerebral insults.

### Non-electrographic seizures due to subdural hematoma: a case series and review of the literature [^1125K7Pb]. Neurocritical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Seizures due to subdural hematoma (SDH) are a common finding, typically diagnosed using electroencephalography (EEG). At times, aggressive management of seizures is necessary to improve neurologic recovery and outcomes. Here, we present three patients who had undergone emergent SDH evacuation and showed postoperative focal deficits without accompanying electrographic epileptiform activity. After infarction and recurrent hemorrhage were ruled out, seizures were suspected despite a negative EEG. Patients were treated aggressively with AEDs and eventually showed clinical improvement. Long-term monitoring with EEG revealed electrographic seizures in a delayed fashion. EEG recordings are an important tool for seizure detection, but should be used as an adjunct to, rather than a replacement for, the clinical examination in the acute setting. At times, aggressive treatment of suspected postoperative seizures is warranted despite lack of corresponding electrographic activity and can improve clinical outcomes.

### Spontaneous spinal subdural hematoma of intracranial origin presenting as back pain [^115LvTXN]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Spinal subdural hematoma (SDH) is an uncommon condition mainly associated with bleeding dyscrasias, use of anticoagulants, trauma, iatrogenic procedures, and vascular malformations. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are recommended to prevent progressive neurologic compromise. Spinal SDH concomitant with intracranial SDH is an even rarer entity, with few cases reported in the English literature. Here we present a case of spontaneous spinal SDH with intracranial SDH presenting as sacral back pain in a 70-year-old man. We also describe the potential mechanism, treatment, and prognosis of concomitant spinal and intracranial SDH.

Case Report

We report an unusual case of spontaneous spinal SDH concomitant with intracranial SDH and discuss the epidemiology, clinical presentation, potential etiology, treatment, and prognosis of this disease. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Awareness of the association between spinal SDH and intracranial SDH can expedite appropriate imaging of both brain and spine, which can lead to a more complete diagnosis and require changes in patient management in the emergency setting.

### Study protocol on defining core outcomes and data elements in chronic subdural haematoma [^115t97Qa]. Neurosurgery (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

CSDH is increasing in incidence and a growing research focus. There is no international consensus on a standardized COS in CSDH, which is necessary to help align future research studies and understand the effect of new treatment strategies on patient function and recovery. This will be complemented by developing a clear definition of CSDH and a set of baseline DEs reportable in studies. It is expected that consensus on a CSDH COS, definition, and baseline data element set will be reached through this Delphi survey involving relevant patient, carer, and healthcare professional and researcher stakeholders.

ACUTE MANAGEMENT

How do I approach the management of ICH?

ICH is a neurological emergency. The presence of expanding haematoma and vasogenic oedema inside the fixed volume of the cranial vault can lead to a precipitous increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) and fatal brain herniation syndromes. The principle of 'time is brain' also firmly applies to ICH; haematoma expansion occurs very earlyand independently predicts a poor outcome. The rapid delivery of a care bundle incorporating anticoagulation reversal, intensive blood pressure management and neurosurgery/critical care if required has been associated with a substantial improvement in 30-day case-fatality rates.

The overarching goals of acute management are to stabilise the patient to ensure they survive the initial insult, and to prevent secondary brain injury (figure 4). Patients with ICH may require immediate intensive care unit admission. Otherwise, all patients should be admitted to an acute stroke unit as soon as possible; the benefit is at least as great for patients with ICH as it is for those with ischaemic stroke. The general principles of acute care are the same as those for acute ischaemic stroke, as outlined in the first article in this series. Secondary prevention measures, cerebral small vessel disease and decisions regarding restarting antithrombotic therapy will be addressed in subsequent articles.

Figure 4
Schema of the time course and mechanisms of secondary brain injury in intracerebral haemorrhage, including intraventricular haemorrhage.

Management of the complications of ICH is a key focus of acute care. Raised ICP can result from the mass effect of the bleed or peri-haematomal oedema or from hydrocephalus. Although there is a lack of evidence to guide its management in ICH, measures used for raised ICP in other settings may help. These include raising the head of the bed to 30° (although without supportive evidence in acute stroke), mild sedation, analgesia and mannitol (or hypertonic saline, depending on cardiac and renal comorbidities). Intensive ICP monitoring is recommended in those with a GCS < 9, evidence of herniation or hydrocephalus. Corticosteroids are possibly associated with more harm than benefit when used for lowering ICP in ICH, so should not be used. Early-onset seizures are not uncommon, occurring in one in seven patients, with most occurring at or near the onset. Clinical seizures should be managed with antiseizure medications, but prophylactic treatment should not be offered routinely. Cortical involvement, age younger than 65 years, volume greater than 10 mL and early seizures within 7 days of ICH identify patients at higher risk of subsequent late seizure development.

### Acute surgery vs conservative treatment for traumatic acute subdural hematoma [^111qQijp]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Study Population

TRACK-TBI was a prospective, observational study across 18 US Level 1 trauma centers. Patients of all ages, without preexisting major neurologic or psychiatric disorders, who presented to the emergency department (ED) of a participating center within 24 hours of acute nonpenetrating TBI and completed a head computed tomography (CT) scan were eligible for enrollment. Traumatic brain injury was defined, per the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine Criteria, as a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function, such as loss of consciousness, amnesia, alteration of mental status after the accident, and/or neurologic deficits. Patients considered by the medical team and the principal investigator of the participating center to be clinically brain dead or deemed to have an unsurvivable injury were not included. The enrollment period was from February 1, 2014, to July 31, 2018, by convenience sampling. All Level 1 trauma centers that participate in TRACK-TBI provided patients who were included in the study population.

The current study is a secondary analysis of the TRACK-TBI dataset. We excluded patients younger than 17 years and those discharged directly from the ED. We selected patients with ASDH regardless of size or presumed necessity for surgical or nonsurgical conservative (medical management) treatment. To comprehensively compare treatment preferences, we intentionally included all patients with ASDH. However, in the sensitivity analysis, we restricted the analytic sample to patients without an extreme prognosis on either end of the spectrum: specifically, those with 1 or 2 unreactive pupils (poorer prognosis) or with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15 (relatively good prognosis) at ED arrival.

Decompressive craniectomy — primary approach involves leaving the bone flap out after evacuation of a mass lesion (typically an acute subdural hematoma (SDH)). In the presence of brain swelling, a primary decompressive craniectomy is recommended following evacuation of the mass lesion, though the bone flap may be replaced if the underlying brain is not compressed and other factors are considered (e.g., burden of concomitant brain injuries, other extracranial injuries, availability of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, and intensive care unit (ICU) facilities).

### Practical pearls for management of cranial injury in the developing world [^114AgooF]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with approximately 69 million individuals affected globally each year, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where neurosurgical resources are limited. The neurocognitive consequences of TBI range from life-threatening conditions to more subtle impairments such as cognitive deficits, impulsivity, and behavioral changes, significantly impacting patients' reintegration into society. LMICs bear about 70% of the global trauma burden, with causes of TBI differing from high-income countries (HICs). The lack of equitable neurosurgical care in LMICs exacerbates these challenges. Improving TBI care in LMICs requires targeted resource allocation, neurotrauma registries, increased education, and multidisciplinary approaches within trauma centers. Reports from successful neurotrauma initiatives in low-resource settings provide valuable insights into safe, adaptable strategies for managing TBI when "gold standard" protocols are unfeasible. This review discusses common TBI scenarios in LMICs, highlighting key epidemiological factors, diagnostic challenges, and surgical techniques applicable to resource-limited settings. Specific cases, including epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebrospinal fluid leaks, are explored to provide actionable insights for improving neurosurgical outcomes in LMICs.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) diagnostic approach with modern noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) emphasizes early imaging: clinicians can use the high sensitivity of noncontrast head CTs within the first 6 hours of onset to reliably rule out SAH without lumbar puncture (LP), and a normal noncontrast head CT within 6 hours in neurologically intact patients is sufficient to preclude further diagnostic workup; if clinical suspicion remains high despite negative findings, further evaluation may be pursued.

### Diagnosis and management of subarachnoid haemorrhage [^1131qvQb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

While advancements in medical technology and treatment protocols have significantly improved outcomes, SAH remains a challenging condition with profound implications for patient care. The highly individualised nature of SAH, due to factors such as aneurysm location patient comorbidities, and pathophysiology underscores the importance of personalised treatment strategies. The incidence of multi-system complications further exemplifies the need for an interdisciplinary approach, which is critical for optimising patient outcomes.

As we continue to face these multifaceted challenges, there is a pressing need for ongoing research to refine existing treatment protocols and to develop new, innovative approaches to manage SAH. Future studies should aim to address the gaps in our understanding of SAH pathophysiology and to evaluate strategies that could mitigate the systemic inequities that currently limit the accessibility of optimal care.

The collaboration between neuroscientists, clinicians, and health policy experts will be crucial in this endeavour. The development of novel therapeutics and improved management techniques, backed by robust data collection and analysis, holds the promise of enhancing the quality of life for individuals affected by SAH.

### Acute surgery vs conservative treatment for traumatic acute subdural hematoma [^11775czV]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

This study has some strengths. Complex analyses of complex datasets with multiple defensible analytic approaches are often subject to biases. Our study benefits from a comparative effectiveness design; predefined analyses; using robust, contemporary, prospective and standardized data corroborated by independent analyses across 2 experienced statistical teams.

This study also has some limitations. Interpreting instrumental variable analysis is inherently challenging. The interpretation of instrumental variable effect estimates differs from that of conventional analyses. The undefined patient population in instrumental variable effect estimation makes it difficult to ascertain a mean treatment effect for an individual patient.

Potential residual confounding is another limitation, attributable to local practice variations associated with surgical thresholds, notwithstanding statistical adjustments, study method (instrumental variable analysis with a priori hypothesized neurosurgeon preferences), and robust effect estimates. Previous cluster analyses found no correlation between acute and critical care treatment options, including surgical treatment.

TRACK-TBI patients were enrolled from US Level 1 trauma centers affiliated with academic institutions. Hence, our results may not be generalizable to centers with fewer institutional resources or different demographics.

TRACK-TBI differed from CENTER-TBI in the following: no survey of predefined clinician preferences was completed, enrolled patients with TBI were less likely to have major extracranial injuries, and patients presenting with unsurvivable injuries as deemed by the TRACK-TBI site principal investigator were excluded from enrollment. In addition, patient-level effect estimates from regression and propensity score analyses differed from the center-level instrumental variable comparison in TRACK-TBI but not in CENTER-TBI, which may be attributable to the larger sample size of CENTER-TBI. The precise timing of clinical decision-making for medical and/or surgical management of TBI was not recorded in TRACK-TBI, constituting immortal time bias. However, we estimate this bias to be small because sensitivity analyses with different temporal definitions of acute surgery showed consistent ORs. Finally, estimating an overall effect of any intervention in TBI is amenable to a neutral result due to averaging heterogeneous effects.

Future research should evaluate surgery in ASDH across age groups, the extent of neurologic compromise, and different medical comorbidity domains. We advocate for high-quality comparative studies specifically targeting patients likely to benefit from acute surgery in TBI with ASDH. Meta-analyses using patient-level data across similar large studies may possess the appropriate statistical strength to accommodate the required large samples.

### Simultaneous occurrence of epidural, subdural, and subarachnoid hemorrhages in the spinal canal: a rare case report [^113vjQih]. Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Simultaneous spinal epidural, subdural, and subarachnoid hemorrhages are exceedingly rare, with no prior documented case of all three occurring simultaneously in the literature. We present the case of a 59-year-old woman who developed acute lower back pain and progressive weakness in her lower extremities. MRI revealed three distinct types of hemorrhages: an epidural hematoma extending from T12 to the lumbar spine, a subdural hematoma between T11 and S1, and a subarachnoid hemorrhage involving the cauda equina. Surgical decompression was performed, leading to significant clinical improvement. This case underscores the critical role of MRI in the diagnosis of complex spinal hematomas and highlights the importance of prompt surgical intervention to prevent further neurological deterioration. Our report contributes valuable insights into the management of multifaceted spinal hemorrhages, emphasizing the need for early recognition and treatment in such rare presentations.

### Acute surgery vs conservative treatment for traumatic acute subdural hematoma [^11287TJG]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

It is unclear whether performing surgery for most patients with an acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) is superior to conservative treatment.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of a strategy preferring acute surgical ASDH evacuation with one preferring initial conservative treatment.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This comparative effectiveness study used data from February 1, 2014, to July 31, 2018, from the prospective observational Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury Study, conducted at 18 Level 1 trauma centers in the US. The study included patients with nonpenetrating TBI presenting to the emergency department and admitted within 24 hours after injury with ASDH detected on acute head computed tomography scan. Statistical analysis was performed from December 1, 2022, to December 20, 2024.

Exposures

Acute surgical hematoma evacuation vs initial conservative treatment, comparing outcomes between centers according to treatment preferences, measured by the case mix-adjusted probability of undergoing acute surgery (vs conservative treatment) per center.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Functional disability at 6 months was assessed with the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended at 6 months, analyzed with ordinal logistic regression adjusted for prespecified confounders, quantified with a common odds ratio (OR). Variation in center preference was quantified with a median OR (MOR).

Results

Of 2697 included patients, 711 (mean [SD] age, 46.5 [19.4] years; 539 men [76%]) had an ASDH, of whom 148 (21%) underwent acute cranial surgery and 563 (79%) underwent initial conservative treatment. The acute surgery cohort had lower mean (SD) Glasgow Coma Scale scores (6.8 [4.4] vs 11.4 [4.6]), more pupil abnormalities (both pupils unreacting: 43 of 133 [32%] vs 41 of 477 [9%]), and fewer isolated ASDHs (eg, more with concurrent intracranial lesions; 92 of 133 [69%] vs 297 of 563 [53%%]) compared with the conservative treatment cohort. In the surgical cohort, 129 of 148 patients (87%) underwent decompressive craniectomy (DC), and 17 of 148 (11%) underwent craniotomy. In the conservative treatment cohort, 67 of 563 patients (12%) underwent delayed cranial surgery (DC or craniotomy). The proportion of patients undergoing acute surgery ranged from 0% to 86% (median, 17% [IQR, 5%-27%]) between centers, with up to a 3-fold higher probability of prognostically similar patients receiving acute surgery in one center compared with another random center (MOR, 2.95 [95% CI, 1.79–7.47]; p = 0.06). Center preference for acute surgery over initial conservative treatment was not associated with a better outcome (OR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.88–1.26] per 22% [IQR, 5%-27%] increase in acute surgery at a given trauma center).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this comparative effectiveness study, similar patients with traumatic ASDH were treated differently due to center-specific treatment preferences. Outcomes were similar in centers preferring surgical evacuation and those preferring initial conservative treatment. This study suggests that, for a patient with ASDH for whom a neurosurgeon experiences clinical equipoise between acute surgery vs (initial) conservative treatment, conservative treatment may be considered.

### The surgical management of chronic subdural hematoma [^114Z5WqL]. Neurosurgical Review (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is an increasingly common neurological disease process. Despite the wide prevalence of cSDH, there remains a lack of consensus regarding numerous aspects of its clinical management. We provide an overview of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of cSDH and discuss several controversial management issues, including the timing of post-operative resumption of anticoagulant medications, the effectiveness of anti-epileptic prophylaxis, protocols for mobilization following evacuation of cSDH, as well as the comparative effectiveness of the various techniques of surgical evacuation. A PubMed search was carried out through October 19, 2010 using the following keywords: "subdural hematoma", "craniotomy", "burr-hole", "management", "anticoagulation", "seizure prophylaxis", "antiplatelet", "mobilization", and "surgical evacuation", alone and in combination. Relevant articles were identified and back-referenced to yield additional papers. A meta-analysis was then performed comparing the efficacy and complications associated with the various methods of cSDH evacuation. There is general agreement that significant coagulopathy should be reversed expeditiously in patients presenting with cSDH. Although protocols for gradual resumption of anti-coagulation for prophylaxis of venous thrombosis may be derived from guidelines for other neurosurgical procedures, further prospective study is necessary to determine the optimal time to restart full-dose anti-coagulation in the setting of recently drained cSDH. There is also conflicting evidence to support seizure prophylaxis in patients with cSDH, although the existing literature supports prophylaxis in patients who are at a higher risk for seizures. The published data regarding surgical technique for cSDH supports primary twist drill craniostomy (TDC) drainage at the bedside for patients who are high-risk surgical candidates with non-septated cSDH and craniotomy as a first-line evacuation technique for cSDH with significant membranes. Larger prospective studies addressing these aspects of cSDH management are necessary to establish definitive recommendations.

### Acute surgery vs conservative treatment for traumatic acute subdural hematoma [^112eGtUP]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this comparative effectiveness study, similar patients with traumatic ASDH received different acute surgical and conservative treatments across different centers due to center-specific factors. Outcomes were similar in centers preferring surgical evacuation and those preferring initial conservative treatment. For a patient with ASDH for whom a neurosurgeon finds clinical equipoise between acute surgery and initial conservative, nonsurgical management, initial conservative treatment may be considered.

### ARISE I consensus statement on the management of chronic subdural hematoma [^115yRbGT]. Stroke (2024). Medium credibility.

ARISE (Aneurysm/AVM/cSDH Roundtable Discussion With Industry and Stroke Experts) organized a one-and-a-half day meeting and workshop and brought together representatives from academia, industry, and government to discuss the most promising approaches to improve outcomes for patients with chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH). The emerging role of middle meningeal artery embolization in clinical practice and the design of current and potential future trials were the primary focuses of discussion. Existing evidence for imaging, indications, agents, and techniques was reviewed, and areas of priority for study and key questions surrounding the development of new and existing treatments for cSDH were identified. Multiple randomized, controlled trials have met their primary efficacy end points, providing high-level evidence that middle meningeal artery embolization is a potent adjunctive therapy to the standard (surgical and nonsurgical) management of neurologically stable cSDH patients in terms of reducing rates of disease recurrence. Pooled data analyses following the formal conclusion and publication of these trials will form a robust foundation upon which guidelines can be strengthened for cSDH treatment modalities and optimal patient selection, as well as delineate future lines of investigation.

### Abusive head trauma in infants and children: technical report [^1124hpZy]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Surgical management in abusive head trauma — A significant number of children presenting with AHT require surgical intervention; in a 5-year review at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital, 58 of 213 children with AHT required surgical intervention. Unfortunately, no evidence-based guidelines exist to guide the selection of surgical strategies, and case series and pathology-specific literature can guide providers. For skull fractures and epidural hemorrhage, literature-based guidance is limited; a Brain Trauma Foundation rigorous literature-based review provided indications for elevation of open and closed fractures and evacuation of epidural hemorrhage based on size and neurologic status. Subdural hemorrhage fluid collections are common in the subdural space of children who have experienced AHT.

### Evaluation of clinical outcome and predictive factors for thromboembolism or hemorrhagic complications in patients treated for chronic subdural hematoma. A prospective observational study [^112GE81d]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is one of the most common neurosurgical conditions, predominantly affecting the elderly population. The use of anticoagulant (AC) or antiplatelet (AP) medications has been shown to increase the risk of developing a CSDH. However, several studies have shown that these drugs do not influence the outcome or the risk of complications, such as rebleeding or recurrence, after surgical treatment.

Currently, there are no clear evidence-based guidelines or specific neurosurgical risk scores for managing antiplatelets or anticoagulants in patients with CSDH. This lack of guidelines leads neurosurgeons to manage the interruption or resumption of these drugs based on personal experience and preferences. There is significant variability in the duration of interruption between different neurosurgical practices. Moreover, thromboembolic complications have often been underestimated or not thoroughly reported in the literature.

Scores such as CHA₂DS₂-VASc or HAS-BLED estimate the risk of thromboembolic and bleeding events in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, guiding therapeutic decisions. Considered risk factors include congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, age, diabetes mellitus, stroke, vascular disease, sex, abnormal liver and renal function, bleeding predisposition, labile INRs, and substance use. These scores have been proven to help predicting complications risk in the perioperative period of non-cardiac surgeries. However, their role and application in the neurosurgical field have not yet been investigated.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes and complications (such as acute rebleeding, recurrence, or thromboembolic events) up to 6 months in patients who underwent CSDH evacuation. We will compare patients who were taking anticoagulants or antithrombotic medications with a control group. Additionally, we will evaluate the role of CHA₂DS₂-VASc and HAS-BLED scores in predicting thromboembolic vascular events or hemorrhages.

### Comparative effectiveness of surgery for traumatic acute subdural hematoma in an aging population [^116bRmf1]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2019). Medium credibility.

There is uncertainty as to the optimal initial management of patients with traumatic acute subdural hematoma, leading to regional variation in surgical policy. This can be exploited to compare the effect of various management strategies and determine best practices. This article reports such a comparative effectiveness analysis of a retrospective observational cohort of traumatic acute subdural hematoma patients in two geographically distinct neurosurgical departments chosen for their - a-priori defined - diverging treatment preferences. Region A favored a strategy focused on surgical hematoma evacuation, whereas region B employed a more conservative approach, performing primary surgery less often. Region was used as a proxy for preferred treatment strategy to compare outcomes between groups, adjusted for potential confounders using multivariable logistic regression with imputation of missing data. In total, 190 patients were included: 108 from region A and 82 from region B. There were 104 males (54.7%). Matching current epidemiological developments, the median age was relatively high at 68 years (interquartile range [IQR], 54–76). Baseline characteristics were comparable between regions. Primary evacuation was performed in 84% of patients in region A and in 65% of patients in region B (p < 0.01). Mortality was lower in region A (37% vs. 45%, p = 0.29), as was unfavorable outcome (53% vs. 62%, p = 0.23). The strategy favoring surgical evacuation was associated with significantly lower odds of mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21–0.88) and unfavorable outcome (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.27–1.02) 3–9 months post-injury. Therefore, in the aging population of patients with acute subdural hematoma, a treatment strategy favoring emergency hematoma evacuation might be associated with lower odds of mortality and unfavorable outcome.

### Effect of pre-management antithrombotic agent use on outcome after traumatic acute subdural hematoma in the elderly: a systematic review [^114Hexo7]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2023). Medium credibility.

Traumatic acute subdural hematomas (ASDH) are common in elderly patients (age ≥ 65 years) and are associated with a poorer prognosis compared with younger populations. Antithrombotic agent (ATA) use is also common in the elderly; however, the influence that pre-morbid ATA has on outcome in ASDH is poorly understood. We hypothesized that pre-morbid ATA use significantly worsens outcomes in elderly patients presenting with traumatic ASDH. English language medical literature was searched for articles relating to ATA use in the elderly with ASDH. Data were collated and appraised where possible. Analyses of study bias were performed. Twelve articles encompassing 2038 patients were included; controls were poorly described in the included studies. Pre-morbid ATA use was seen in 1042 (51.1%) patients and 18 different ATA combination therapies were identified, with coumarins being the most common single agent used. The newer direct oral anticoagulants were evaluated in only two studies. ATA use was associated with a lower presenting Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score but not hematoma volume on computed tomography (CT) or post-operative hematoma re-accumulation. No studies connected ATA use with patient outcomes without the presence of confounders and bias. Reversal strategies, bridging therapy, recommencement of ATA, and comparison groups were poorly described; accordingly, our hypothesis was rejected. ATA reversal methods, identification of surgical candidates, optimal surgery methods, and when or whether ATA should be recommenced following ASDH resolution remain topics of debate. This study defines our current understanding on this topic, revealing clear deficiencies in the literature with recommendations for future research.

### Imaging for the diagnosis and management of traumatic brain injury [^111RgMWH]. Neurotherapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

ROLE OF IMAGING IN DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF TBI

Imaging is critical to both the diagnosis and management of TBI. For diagnosis of TBI in the acute setting, noncontrast CT is the modality of choice as it quickly and accurately identifies intracranial hemorrhage that warrants neurosurgical evacuation. CT readily identifies both extra-axial hemorrhage (epidural, subdural, and subarachnoid/intraventricular hemorrhage) and intra-axial hemorrhage (cortical contusion, intraparenchymal hematoma, and TAI or shear injury). While CT is the mainstay of TBI imaging in the acute setting, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has better diagnostic sensitivity for certain types of injuries that are not necessarily hemorrhagic, including cortical contusions and nonhemorrhagic traumatic axonal injuries.

For the management of TBI patients, noncontrast CT readily identifies the progression of hemorrhage and signs of secondary injury relevant to neurocritical care, such as cerebral swelling, herniation, and hydrocephalus.

In this review, we discuss each type of primary and secondary brain injury in turn, with an emphasis on the imaging features that are of particular relevance to medical and surgical management and decision-making.
