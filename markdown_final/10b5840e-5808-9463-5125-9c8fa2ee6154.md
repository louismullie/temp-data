## Question

10 month well child check

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the 10-month well-child visit. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the visit's purpose and where it fits in the periodicity schedule. Then, I should verify the core components: history, examination, growth and nutrition, development, immunizations, and anticipatory guidance. Next, I will consider special populations and quality improvement levers. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, actionable checklist and note any controversies or evidence gaps that might modify practice, ensuring each point is supported by guidelines or high-quality evidence where available.

> Let me first confirm the visit's purpose and timing. The 10-month visit is a routine preventive health supervision visit in early infancy, typically occurring around 9–10 months, and it sits between the 9-month and 12-month visits in the AAP/Bright Futures periodicity schedule; it is not a mandated developmental screening visit, but it is a key opportunity for surveillance, growth assessment, immunization catch-up, and anticipatory guidance, with developmental screening formally recommended at 9, 18, and 30 months and autism-specific screening at 18 and 24 months [^5d38daf3] [^8d65defa] [^f66a21cb].

> I need to check the core history elements. A complete history should include birth history, prior screenings and results, diet and feeding transitions, sleep patterns, dental care, and medical, surgical, family, and social histories; this frames risk assessment and anticipatory guidance and aligns with Bright Futures principles for comprehensive preventive care [^f5bb7d0d].

> Next, I should review the physical examination. A head-to-toe exam with growth parameters and plotting on WHO growth charts for 0–24 months is standard; I should confirm that weight-for-length is used to assess overweight in this age group and that vision and hearing surveillance are incorporated, even if formal screening is not yet indicated at 10 months, with visual system assessment at each routine visit and hearing risk review and follow-up as needed [^bad5dac2] [^d174137a] [^7a976559].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about development. I should verify that developmental surveillance is performed at every well-child visit, with standardized screening reserved for 9, 18, and 30 months; at 10 months, surveillance using milestone checklists and caregiver input is appropriate, and if concerns arise, a validated tool can be used off-schedule or the child can be scheduled for an early return visit to complete screening and consider referral to early intervention if indicated [^5d38daf3] [^d732855f] [^0aee11fa].

> I will now examine growth and nutrition. Let me think about feeding transitions: by 10 months, most infants are consuming complementary foods alongside breast milk or formula; I should confirm guidance to avoid juice and sugar-sweetened beverages before 1 year, encourage water in a cup, and discuss weaning from bottle to cup by 12 months; growth should be plotted and interpreted with attention to weight-for-length trends and parental obesity risk, and I need to ensure oral health risk assessment and fluoride varnish are addressed now that the first tooth has likely erupted [^f5bb7d0d] [^ec9a84d7] [^4e9112f4].

> Wait, let me verify immunization status. At 10 months, infants are generally due for catch-up vaccines if behind, and the hepatitis B series should be completed by 6 months; I should confirm that any missing vaccines are administered according to the CDC schedule and document dates and lot numbers accurately [^3f2dd569].

> Next, I should review anticipatory guidance priorities. Safety remains paramount: car seats rear-facing until at least 2 years or until the seat's height/weight limit is reached, drowning prevention, burn and poison prevention, and safe sleep; I should also discuss screen time avoidance before 18 months except video chatting, and I need to ensure discipline counseling is evidence-based, given widespread misapplication of time-out techniques in families [^f5bb7d0d] [^5a17c15a].

> But wait, what if the family faces social determinants of health challenges? I should double-check that we screen for maternal depression using a validated tool such as the EPDS at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months, and if missed earlier, the 10-month visit is an opportunity to screen and refer; I also need to assess family stressors, social supports, and connect families with community resources, as these factors directly impact child development and parenting capacity [^692a9b63] [^cc635804] [^f9770f16].

> Let me consider special populations. For children with special health care needs, I should confirm that visits are longer and more frequent, with explicit anticipatory guidance on caregiver stress, early intervention linkages, and coordination of care; for children in foster or kinship care, I need to ensure trauma-informed screening, visitation monitoring, and developmental surveillance are prioritized; for families with low health literacy or structural barriers, I should consider alternative models such as group well-child care or community health worker integration to improve attendance and quality [^a033df8e] [^22f0f1ed] [^f0803dcb] [^3cb681b8].

> I should confirm quality improvement levers. Many practices achieve higher reliability for preventive services by using visit templates, previsit screening, and team-based care; embedding developmental screening workflows, oral health risk assessment prompts, and maternal depression screening into the EHR improves uptake, and practices report that longer visits correlate with more content and higher satisfaction, though time constraints remain a persistent barrier [^f0cfa55d] [^e96b3c87] [^a9d3ee4c].

> Hold on, I should verify controversies and evidence gaps. The USPSTF found insufficient evidence for universal developmental screening at 9 months, whereas the AAP recommends it; this discrepancy reflects differing evidentiary thresholds and should be communicated transparently to families, with shared decision-making when surveillance raises concerns; likewise, while Bright Futures endorses fluoride varnish every 6 months, access and billing can be barriers, so I need to ensure systems are in place to support this practice [^1c658652] [^8d65defa] [^ec9a84d7].

> Let me synthesize a practical 10-month checklist. History: feeding, sleep, development, family stressors, social supports; Examination: growth plotted with weight-for-length, head circumference, vitals, complete physical exam including vision and hearing surveillance; Development: surveillance with milestone review and caregiver concerns, screen if concerns or if 9-month screen was missed; Immunizations: catch-up as indicated; Anticipatory guidance: nutrition and weaning, oral health and fluoride varnish, safety (car seats, drowning, burns, sleep), screen time, and discipline; Screening: maternal depression if not done, social determinants, and oral health risk; Documentation: concerns, goals, and referrals, with a plan for the 12-month visit and early intervention referral if any red flags are identified [^f5bb7d0d] [^5d38daf3] [^ec9a84d7] [^692a9b63].

---

The 10-month well-child visit focuses on **growth and development surveillance** [^5d38daf3], **immunization updates** [^3f2dd569], and **anticipatory guidance** for parents [^f5bb7d0d]. Key elements include measuring growth, assessing milestones, screening for developmental delays [^8d65defa], and updating vaccines. Parents should receive counseling on nutrition, sleep, safety, and oral health, and clinicians should screen for maternal depression and social determinants of health [^692a9b63] [^f9770f16]. This visit helps ensure early detection of issues and supports optimal development [^5a4c3e46].

---

## Growth and nutrition

- **Growth measurement**: Measure length, weight, and head circumference; plot on WHO/CDC growth charts to assess growth trajectory [^bad5dac2].

- **Nutrition counseling**: Discuss transition to solids, iron-rich foods, and continued breastfeeding or formula; avoid juice and limit sugar-sweetened beverages [^f5bb7d0d].

- **Oral health**: Perform oral health risk assessment; apply fluoride varnish if indicated; counsel on toothbrushing with a smear of fluoride toothpaste [^ec9a84d7] [^4e9112f4].

---

## Developmental surveillance and screening

- **Developmental surveillance**: Assess milestones (gross motor, fine motor, language, social) and elicit parent concerns [^5d38daf3].

- **Developmental screening**: If the 9-month screen was missed or concerns arise, use a validated tool (e.g. Ages and Stages Questionnaire) [^0aee11fa].

- **Autism screening**: Not routinely indicated at 10 months; reserve for concerns or at 18 and 24 months [^fbd16c3b].

---

## Immunizations

Review the **immunization record** and administer catch-up vaccines if needed, including DTaP, IPV, Hib, PCV13, rotavirus, and hepatitis B [^3f2dd569].

---

## Physical examination

Perform a **head-to-toe exam**, including cardiac, respiratory, abdominal, neurologic, and musculoskeletal systems. Also assess vision and hearing, and refer if abnormalities are detected [^d174137a] [^7a976559].

---

## Anticipatory guidance

- **Safety**: Car seat rear-facing until 2 years or seat limits; drowning, burn, and poison prevention; safe sleep [^f5bb7d0d].

- **Sleep**: Encourage consistent routines and self-soothing; avoid bed-sharing [^f5bb7d0d].

- **Screen time**: Avoid screen time under 18 months except video chatting [^f5bb7d0d].

- **Behavior**: Discuss discipline, social play, and language development [^f5bb7d0d].

---

## Parental and family assessment

Screen for **maternal depression** using a validated tool (e.g. EPDS) if not previously done [^692a9b63]. Also assess social determinants of health — including food security, housing stability, and social support — and provide resources as needed [^f9770f16].

---

## Documentation and follow-up

Record growth, immunizations, developmental findings, and counseling provided. Schedule the next well-child visit at 12 months and arrange early intervention referrals if developmental concerns are identified [^5d38daf3].

---

The 10-month well-child visit is a **comprehensive assessment** of growth, development, and family needs, with counseling and screening to support optimal child health and development.

### Six questions for well-child care redesign [^63c38783]. Academic Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

In the United States, well-child care has the goal of providing comprehensive care to children by addressing developmental, behavioral, psychosocial, and health issues through visits at recommended intervals. The preventive care needs of families can outpace the capacity of clinics and practices to provide it, necessitating a redesign of our well-child care system that aligns the structure of preventive care delivery with the needs of families. Here we focus on 6 questions (the what, when, who, why, how, and where) for well-child care redesign for infants and young children. By addressing these key questions and providing recommendations for advancing well-child care redesign in the clinical and research arenas, we hope to accelerate the process of well-child care redesign. In the current political and socioeconomic environment, continuing with well-child care "as usual" will mean that many families will find that their well-child care visits do not fully address the most pressing needs impacting children's health and well-being. It is time to implement and sustain real change in our system for preventive care.

Measurement

The measurement strategy included quantitative measures and qualitative assessments to foster understanding of whether and how 11 evidence-informed strategies (core practices; see table 1) related to the parent–child relationship and affected practice change within the well-child visit for children from birth to 3 years.

Quantitative measures

Outcome measures

Parent knowledge of SE development and self-efficacy Data source: 10 preselected items from the validated Knowledge of Infant Development Inventory (KIDI) parent questionnaire. Strategy: monthly, collect 30 KIDI questionnaires from parents with children 0–36 months each month who have a well-child visit.
Parent–child relationship Data source: percentage reporting top 2 boxes of 1–7 scale for each of the three questions: (a) How confident do you feel leaving this visit that you are able to support your child’s SE development?; (b) How confident do you feel leaving this visit that you know how to strengthen your relationship and your family’s relationship with your child?; (c) How confident are you that you could find resources in the community to help you strengthen your relationship with your child if you needed them? Strategy: monthly, collect 30 responses from parents of children 0–36 months of age.

Process measures sought to understand changes at the practice level. Data were collected from patient charts on 100% of children seen at a well-child visit during the measurement month (or a sample of 20 if information not easily accessible).

Percentage of well-child visits where child leaves with at least one goal related to SE development co-created between parent and provider.
Percentage of children receiving age-appropriate SE developmental screens or assessments at well-child visits.
Percentage of those with positive screens or assessments referred.
Percentage of well-child visits where a strength-based bundle was used and included: observation, reflection, engagement and positive instructive feedback.
Percentage of child visits with screening/assessment completed for family stressors (eg, parental depression, social determinants of health).
Percentage of those screening positive for family stressors who are offered support or services aligned with their self-identified needs and priorities.
Percentage of referrals where loop is closed (per the parent, it has resolution and no longer a topic they need help with).

### A survey of parents' perceptions and use of time-out compared to empirical evidence [^5a17c15a]. Academic Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess parents' perceptions and use of time-out (TO) in contrast to empirical indications and examine the relationship between reported implementation procedures and perceived effectiveness.

Methods

We surveyed parents of preschool and school-age children (n = 401, aged 15 months to 10 years) at well-child visits with regard to their awareness, perception, and usage of TO. Parents were specifically surveyed regarding TO components that have been empirically evaluated or pertain directly to its underlying behavioral principles. Descriptive analyses, group comparisons, and correlational analyses were used to characterize responses and evaluate the relationship between TO administration variation and perceived effectiveness.

Results

Most parents (76.8%) reported using TO in response to misbehavior, but a large majority of these parents (84.9%) reported implementing TO in a manner counter to empirical evidence. Parents who endorsed TO as effective varied significantly from those who did not on key implementation components (eg, use of a single warning). Further, several reported implementation practices were correlated with perceived effectiveness and challenging child behavior. For example, requiring a child to be calm before ending TO was positively correlated with perceived effectiveness.

Conclusions

These results cement TO as a widely disseminated practice but cast doubt on the fidelity with which it is typically implemented. Better methods of educating parents on evidence-based discipline are needed.

### Well-child visits for infants and young children [^f5bb7d0d]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

The well-child visit allows for comprehensive assessment of a child and the opportunity for further evaluation if abnormalities are detected. A complete history during the well-child visit includes information about birth history; prior screenings; diet; sleep; dental care; and medical, surgical, family, and social histories. A head-to-toe examination should be performed, including a review of growth. Immunizations should be reviewed and updated as appropriate. Screening for postpartum depression in mothers of infants up to six months of age is recommended. Based on expert opinion, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends developmental surveillance at each visit, with formal developmental screening at nine, 18, and 30 months and autism-specific screening at 18 and 24 months; the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation. Well-child visits provide the opportunity to answer parents' or caregivers' questions and to provide age-appropriate guidance. Car seats should remain rear facing until two years of age or until the height or weight limit for the seat is reached. Fluoride use, limiting or avoiding juice, and weaning to a cup by 12 months of age may improve dental health. A one-time vision screening between three and five years of age is recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to detect amblyopia. The American Academy of Pediatrics guideline based on expert opinion recommends that screen time be avoided, with the exception of video chatting, in children younger than 18 months and limited to one hour per day for children two to five years of age. Cessation of breastfeeding before six months and transition to solid foods before six months are associated with childhood obesity. Juice and sugar-sweetened beverages should be avoided before one year of age and provided only in limited quantities for children older than one year.

### Promoting social emotional development during the paediatric well-child visit: a demonstration project [^2f7dfc72]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Design

Our theory of change was portrayed in a Driver Diagramand companion change package that reflected 11 evidence-informed strategies, named core practices. The core practices are high leverage changes that could promote SE health, the parent–child bond and parental mental health within the paediatric well-child visit (see table 1). Throughout the learning community, paediatric practices tested multiple change ideas and implemented core practices 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11. Paediatric practices made plans for but did not move to testing for core practices 4, 5, 7.

Paediatric practices tested and implemented changes within well-child visits for children aged 0–3 years. The learning community provided peer support, learning and reflection grounded in transparent sharing between participants of tests of change, data and results. Expert faculty coached teams on core content related to SE development, the Model for Improvement, and how to adapt changes to local well-child visit settings. Paediatric practice teams represented by a team leader, medical provider champion, family partner(s) and data lead attended one in-person and two virtual learning sessions combined with monthly coaching and technical assistance webinars over the 12-month initiative. Monthly webinars balanced presentations by faculty with expertise in SE development, family engagement and quality improvement with sharing by the participating practice teams. Topics included process mapping for improved workflow, family engagement strategies, co-created goal setting, and conducting strength-based observation and feedback. There was high team engagement: 72% attended monthly webinars and 97% attended the three learning sessions.

Qualitative assessments were used to inform and customise the curriculum for the second half of the learning community. They provided additional context on the experiences of testing and implementing the core practices and of collecting, reporting and analysing data. For instance, following interviews with 10 paediatric practices, additional reports from participating teams were included in the monthly calls as this was noted as one of the greatest benefits of participating in the learning community.

Participants reported monthly progress on NICHQ’s Collaboratory, an online platform, for discussion, resource sharing, data submission and data visualisation. Faculty experts and learning community leadership reviewed and provided coaching on Plan–Do–Study–Act (PDSA) submissions and quantitative data. Each paediatric practice team received $10 000 to support learning activities.

### Pediatric preventive care: population health and individualized care [^b6801843]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Well-child care is a near-universal service for young children toward which a great deal of time and professional resources are devoted but for which there is scant evidence of effectiveness in routine practice. It is composed of many components, the value of which likely varies with the quality of their provision and the needs and priorities of the children and families who receive them. Achieving more efficient and effective preventive care will require that pediatric practices segment the population they serve and design schedules and staffing to match patients' health, well-being, personal and social circumstances, and service needs. Care should be individualized and include essential screening, tests, procedures, and education on the basis of assessment of patients' and families' needs and priorities. The traditional schedule of individual, comprehensive preventive care visits should be reconsidered and replaced with a schedule that allows complete care to be provided over a series of visits, including those for acute and chronic care. Preventive pediatric care should be provided in family-centered, team-based practices with strong linkages to other providers in the community who serve and support children and families. Care should make use of the wide variety of modalities that exist, and face-to-face time should be reserved for those services that are both important and uniquely responsive to in-office intervention. This model of preventive care will require changes in training, responsibilities and reimbursement of health care team members, and enhanced communication and collaboration among all involved, especially with families.

### Rethinking well-child care in the United States: an international comparison [^6d380be2]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The increasing scope of health supervision recommendations challenges well-child care delivery in the United States. Comparison of the United States with other countries' delivery systems may highlight different assumptions as well as structural approaches for consideration.

Objective

Our goal was to describe the process of well-child care delivery in industrialized nations and compare it to the US model of child health care.

Methods

Literature reviews and international experts were used to identify 10 countries with unique features of well-child care delivery for comparison to the United States. Key-informant interviews using a structured protocol were held with child health experts in 10 countries to delineate the structural and practice features of their systems. Site visits produced additional key informant data from 5 countries (The Netherlands, England, Australia, Sweden, and France).

Results

A primary care framework was adapted to analyze structural and practice features of well-child care in the 10 countries. Although well-child care content is similar, there are marked differences in the definitions of well-child care and the scope of practice of primary care professionals and pediatricians specifically who provide this care across the 10 countries. In contrast to the United States, none of the countries place all well-child care components under the responsibility of a single primary care provider. Well-child care services and care for acute, chronic, and behavioral/developmental problems are often provided by different clinicians and within different service systems.

Conclusions

Despite some similarities, well-child care models from other countries differ from the United States in key structural features on the basis of broad financing differences as well as specific visions for effective well-child care services. Features of these models can inform child health policy makers and providers in rethinking how desired improvements in US well-child care delivery might be sought.

### Screening for postpartum depression at well-child visits: is once enough during the first 6 months of life? [^ba3b9af6]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Screening for maternal depression is gaining acceptance as a standard component of well-child care. We tested the feasibility of this policy and determined the prevalence and incidence of maternal depression at well-child visits during the first 6 months of life.

Methods

Providers in an adolescent-oriented maternity program were cued electronically, when they opened the electronic medical records of 0- to 6-month-old infants to conduct well-child visits, to ask the mothers to complete the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale. Incident cases represented mothers who crossed the referral threshold (score of > or =10) after the first screening.

Results

Mothers usually brought their infants to the clinic, and none refused screening. Providers could act on 99% of the 418 screening cues; they administered the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale 98% of the time and always referred mothers with scores of > or =10. Overall, 20% of the mothers scored > or =10. Scores were unstable at < or =3 postpartum weeks (kappa = 0.2). Thereafter, the prevalence and incidence of scores of > or =10 decreased from 16.5% at 2 months to 10.3% and 5.7%, respectively, at 4 months. Prevalence increased to 18.5% at the 6-month visit, and incidence decreased to 1.9%. Repeat screening detected only 2 mothers (5.7%) with scores of > or =10.

Conclusions

Electronic cueing improved compliance with the detection and referral phases of screening for maternal depression at well-child visits. Screening 2 months after delivery detects most mothers who become depressed during the first 6 postpartum months, and screening at the 6-month well-child visit is preferable to screening at the 4-month visit.

### Assessing development in the pediatric office [^c53136d3]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the proportion of children aged 10 to 35 months who were reported ever to have received a developmental assessment (DA) and to examine characteristics of the child, family, and health care setting associated with the receipt of a DA.

Methods

The National Survey of Early Childhood Health, conducted in 2000, is a survey of 2068 parents of children 4 to 35 months of age. Children were classified as having received a DA in response to 2 questions: whether the child's pediatric provider ever told parents that he or she was doing a "developmental assessment" and/or parents recalled explicit components of a DA, such as stacking blocks or throwing a ball. Parent-reported receipt of a DA was assessed in relationship to child and family, health care access, other measures of health care content and process, and measures of quality and satisfaction.

Results

Approximately 57% of children 10 to 35 months of age ever received a DA. Forty-two percent of parents recalled ever being told by their child's pediatric provider that a DA was being done. Thirty-nine percent recalled their child's being asked to perform specific tasks routinely included in a DA. Bivariate analysis indicates that receipt of a DA is not associated with child or family sociodemographic characteristics such as maternal education and household income, with the exception of race/ethnicity. Less acculturated Hispanic parents reported a DA more frequently than parents in other racial/ethnic groups (66% vs 56%). A smaller proportion of parents whose children who used community health centers reported their child's ever having received a DA compared with children who use other settings (51% vs 60%). Compared with other children, parents whose child ever received a DA reported more frequently than other parents that the time spent with the child's provider during the last well-child visit was adequate (94% vs 80%). They also reported longer visits (19 minutes vs 16 minutes), higher family-centered care ratings (mean: 71 vs 59), and higher satisfaction with well-child care (8.9 vs 8.4). Receipt of a DA is also associated with the content of developmentally focused anticipatory guidance received. For each health supervision topic analyzed, frequency of discussion is higher for children who ever received a DA. In multivariate analysis, odds of receiving a DA are higher for children with longer visits with the provider (odds ratio: 1.03; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.05) and lower for children in community health clinics compared with a private office (odds ratio: 0.61; 95% confidence interval: 0.39-0.96), even accounting for total well-child visits to the pediatric provider.

Conclusion

Although guidelines endorse the routine provision of DAs, parents of many children do not report receiving DAs. Children who receive assessments are more likely to receive other developmental services, and their parents are more likely to report greater satisfaction with care and rate the interpersonal quality of well-child care more favorably. The substantial number of children who do not receive these routinely recommended services raises important questions about the quality of care received.

### Duration of a well-child visit: association with content, family-centeredness, and satisfaction [^e96b3c87]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Studies of pediatric primary care suggest that time is an important limitation to the delivery of recommended preventive services. Given the increasingly frenetic pace of pediatric practice, there is an increased need to monitor the length of pediatric visits and the association of visit length with content, family-centered care, and parent satisfaction with care.

Objective

To examine the length of well-child visits and the associations of visit length with content, family-centered care, and parent satisfaction among a national sample of children.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional telephone survey of parents of children aged 4 to 35 months from the 2000 National Survey of Early Childhood Health (n = 2068).

Results

One-third (33.6%) of parents reported spending ≤ 10 minutes with the clinician at their last well-child visit, nearly half (47.1%) spent 11 to 20 minutes, and 20.3% spent >20 minutes. Longer visits were associated with more anticipatory guidance, more psychosocial risk assessment, and higher family-centered care ratings. A visit of >20 minutes was associated with 2.4 (confidence interval [CI]: 1.5-3.7) higher odds of receiving a developmental assessment, 3.2 (CI: 1.7-6.1) higher odds of recommending the clinician, and 9.7 (CI: 3.5-26.5) higher odds of having enough time to ask questions.

Conclusions

Many well-child visits are of short duration, and shorter visits are associated with reductions in content and quality of care and parent satisfaction with care. Efforts to improve preventive services will require strategies that address the time devoted to well-child care. The results of this study should be interpreted in light of changes in practice standards, reimbursement, and outcome measurement that have taken place since 2000 and the limitations of the measurement of utilization solely on the basis of parent report.

### The pediatrician's role in preventing child maltreatment: clinical report [^e38175a0]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Well-child visits—anticipatory guidance and prevention framework: Well-child visits offer valuable opportunities for pediatric health care providers (HCPs) to preemptively discuss anticipated and challenging behavioral and developmental issues, and subsequent visits allow follow-up on previously identified issues. The more frequent visits recommended for children and adolescents with disabilities and other special health care needs should also include anticipation of added caregiver stress and practical guidance on maintaining a healthy parent-child relationship. Table 2 gives examples of opportunities for incorporating child maltreatment prevention into a pediatric health supervision visit by addressing parental support and coping skills at various developmental stages, and although this list is not exhaustive, it highlights key recommendations for anticipatory guidance. One well-studied tool for primary prevention of child maltreatment in the office setting is the evidence-informed Safe Environment for Every Kid (SEEK) model.

### Delivery of well-child care: a look inside the door [^a033df8e]. Academic Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the delivery of well-child care and its components; to compare that delivery with recommendations in Bright Futures; and to compare delivery of well-child care for children with special health care needs with that for children without special needs.

Methods

Over a 10-week period, 2 medical students observed and documented characteristics of well-child care visits by general pediatricians and midlevel pediatric providers. Parents completed a demographic questionnaire and a screener for children with special health care needs.

Results

A total of 483 visits by 43 pediatricians and 9 midlevel providers with patients from 0 to 19 years of age were observed. Adjusted mean visit duration was 20.3 minutes; 38.9% of visits began with an open-ended question about parent/child concerns. A mean of 7.2 health supervision/anticipatory guidance topics were addressed per visit. Clinicians addressed a mean of 42% of Bright Futures-recommended age-specific health supervision/anticipatory guidance topics. Topics addressed less frequently than recommended included family support, parental well-being, behavior/discipline, physical activity, media screen time, risk reduction/substance use, puberty/sex, social-peer interactions, and violence. Shorter visits were associated with asking about parent/child concerns and with addressing greater proportions of recommended health supervision/anticipatory guidance topics. Well-child care visits with children with special health care needs were 36% longer than those with children without special needs and addressed similar numbers of age-specific health supervision/anticipatory guidance topics. More time was spent with children with special health care needs addressing health supervision/anticipatory guidance topics, other conditions (usually their chronic condition), and testing, prescriptions, and referrals.

Conclusions

Utilizing direct observation of visits with pediatric clinicians, we found that solicitation of parent/child concerns occurred less frequently than recommended. Fewer than half of recommended visit-specific health supervision/anticipatory guidance topics were addressed, and there was little congruence with some Bright Futures age group-specific recommendations. Notably, both solicitation of patient/parent concerns and greater adherence to health supervision/anticipatory guidance recommendations were associated with shorter visits. Well-child care visits with children with special health care needs were longer than those with children without special needs; more time was spent addressing similar numbers of health supervision/anticipatory guidance topics as well as their chronic conditions.

### A randomized controlled trial of group well-child care: improved attendance and vaccination timeliness [^f0803dcb]. Clinical Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Well-child care has suboptimal outcomes regarding adherence to appointments and recall of guidance, especially among families facing structural barriers to health. Group well-child care (GWCC) aims to improve these outcomes by enhancing anticipatory guidance discussions and peer education. We conducted a randomized controlled trial, comparing GWCC with traditional, individual well-child care (IWCC) and assessed health care utilization, immunization timeliness, recall of anticipatory guidance, and family-centered care. Ninety-seven mother-infant dyads were randomized to GWCC or IWCC. Compared with IWCC infants, GWCC infants attended more of the 6 preventive health visits (5.41 vs 4.87, P < .05) and received more timely immunization at 6 months and 1 year but did not differ in emergency or hospital admission rates. There were no differences in mothers' reports of anticipatory guidance received or family-centered care. As primary care is redesigned for value-based care and structural vulnerabilities are considered, GWCC may be a key option to consider.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 736: optimizing postpartum care [^73322fa6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 736—postpartum visit timing and components—states that 23% of employed women return to work within 10 days postpartum and an additional 22% between 10 days and 40 days; therefore, timing of the comprehensive postpartum visit should be individualized and woman centered, occurring no later than 12 weeks from birth, and completion of the visit does not obviate the need for continued recovery and support through 6 weeks postpartum and beyond. The comprehensive postpartum visit is a medical appointment and is not an “all-clear” signal, and it should include a full assessment of physical, social, and psychological well-being across domains including mood and emotional well-being, infant care and feeding, sexuality, contraception, and birth spacing, sleep and fatigue, physical recovery from birth, chronic disease management, and health maintenance.

### An explanatory model of factors related to well baby visits by age three years for medicaid-enrolled infants: a retrospective cohort study [^4574c87b]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Well baby visits (WBVs) are a cornerstone of early childhood health as well as disease prevention and management. Defined as “a series of frequent, repetitive, routine examinations” by a medical provider, WBVs include monitoring of physical growth, sensory screenings, developmental and behavioral assessments, and immunizations. WBVs are an important conduit through which caregivers receive anticipatory guidance from medical providers and referrals for specialty and surgical care. The 2000 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) preventive pediatric health care guidelines recommend that all infants receive 10 WBVs between age 1 month and 3 years.

A number of studies have examined health and educational outcomes associated with WBVs during infancy and early childhood. Infants receiving the recommended number of WBVs in the first two years of life are subsequently more likely to have physician visits (to help address acute health problems) and less likely to have a visit to the emergency department. Another study found a significant association between WBVs and kindergarten readiness, highlighting the social and educational benefits associated with WBVs.

### Promoting social emotional development during the paediatric well-child visit: a demonstration project [^dc59dd78]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

A quarterly ‘Joy in Work’ balancing measure was collected and reported to assess whether the new work related to SE development during well-child visits affected staff satisfaction. Quarterly anonymous surveys asked staff if they would strongly agree, agree, disagree or strongly disagree with the statement, ‘I would recommend this practice as a great place to work’.

For 12 months, between April 2019 and April 2020, teams voluntarily reported monthly de-identified quantitative data. NICHQ initially proposed weekly data collection to have more data points such that improvement patterns would emerge sooner in the project, however, none of the participating practices could support a weekly data reporting requirement. Based on this feedback and to further reduce the burden of new measurement and reporting, the measures were introduced in stages between April and July 2019 and reported through May 2020.

Qualitative assessments

Paediatric practices participated in qualitative assessments to inform learning and improvement during the 12-month learning community.

Self-assessment of progress on core practice strategies (two surveys)

Practice teams were asked to respond to two surveys, one administered during project midpoint and one at project end, to assess teams’ progress on the testing and implementation of the core practice strategies. Core practices were defined as high leverage changes that could promote SE health, the parent–child bond and parental mental health within the paediatric well-child visit (see table 1). Participants were asked to rate their perceived progress on the 11 core practices using a 6-point scale (0=no work on practice, 1=plans but no action on practice, 2=testing one idea related to practice, 3=testing multiple ideas related to practice, 4=testing multiple ideas related to practice with plans to implement, and 5=implemented ideas related to practice and working on sustaining improvement). Descriptive statistics, including frequencies and means, were examined among participants’ responses at both time points. In addition, t-tests were conducted to determine whether participants’ perceived progress on each of the core practices differed significantly over the course of the project.

Experiences of participating paediatric practices (interviews)

Interviews were conducted with 10 of the paediatric practices that responded to an open invitation at the midpoint of the learning community. Notes from the semistructured interviews were reviewed using thematic analysis with NVivo V.12.0. Interviews were initially reviewed in their entirety and then iteratively coded until primary, secondary and tertiary themes were identified. Results of the thematic analysis provided important insights into the barriers and facilitators of incorporating the core practices into the paediatric well-child visit.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 755: well-woman visit [^6b371e0f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Well-woman visit—abstract guidance emphasizes that a well-woman visit provides an excellent opportunity to counsel patients about maintaining a healthy lifestyle and minimizing health risks. Taking a comprehensive history (specifically obtaining detailed information on symptoms and past medical and gynecologic history) will inform if certain components of the physical examination, including breast or pelvic examination, are indicated at that visit and will inform shared decision making for these examinations. Family history should be used as a risk assessment tool and should be completed and updated regularly to ensure the most comprehensive assessment of a woman’s personal risk factors. Another key component of a well-woman visit for a reproductive-aged woman is the development and discussion of her reproductive life plan to ensure that medical testing and treatments provided are aligned with her current and future plans. Obstetrician–gynecologists provide care for women across the lifespan, and periodic well-woman visits are appropriate and necessary for perimenopausal women and postmenopausal women as well.

### Are pediatric quality care measures too stringent? [^fd8191ef]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

We aimed to demonstrate the application of national pediatric quality measures, derived from claims-based data, for use with electronic medical record data, and determine the extent to which rates differ if specifications were modified to allow for flexibility in measuring receipt of care.

Methods

We reviewed electronic medical record data for all patients up to 15 years of age with ≥1 office visit to a safety net family medicine clinic in 2010 (n = 1544). We assessed rates of appropriate well-child visits, immunizations, and body mass index (BMI) documentation, defined strictly by national guidelines versus by guidelines with clinically relevant modifications.

Results

Among children aged <3 years, 52.4% attended ≥6 well-child visits by the age of 15 months; 60.8% had ≥6 visits by age 2 years. Less than 10% completed 10 vaccination series before their second birthday; with modifications, 36% were up to date. Among children aged 3 to 15 years, 63% had a BMI percentile recorded; 91% had BMI recorded within 36 months of the measurement year.

Conclusions

Applying relevant modifications to national quality measure definitions captured a substantial number of additional services. Strict adherence to measure definitions might miss the true quality of care provided, especially among populations that may have sporadic patterns of care utilization.

### A directed content analysis of discussions between mothers and pediatricians around feeding and growth topics during infant well-child visits [^b7308650]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Positive feeding behaviors during infancy are foundational for optimal growth and development. Early feeding patterns include what, when, and how much to feed; yet, not all parents are confident identifying reliable information in these domains, especially with an abundance of information and misinformation readily available. Pediatric well-child visits are an opportune time to ensure parents are well-supported with evidence-based guidance that empowers them to establish positive feeding behaviors in infancy.

Pediatricians are a trusted source of health information and develop relationships with families across frequent well-child visits in the first year of life. - Bright Futures Guidelines, by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), provides recommendations on the delivery of anticipatory guidance during well-child visits for topics including, but not limited to, infant feeding and growth.However, time is a barrier to delivering in-depth guidance on multiple topics in a typical 10- to 20-minute visit, - resulting in large variations in time spent discussing feeding (1 second to 1.6 minutes) and growth (2 seconds to 5.3 minutes),specifically. To explore this variation, cross-sectional studies have identified if general topics are discussed or not during well-child visits; yet, these studies lack depth on the diverse sub-topics that can fall within feeding and growth discussions. Furthermore, this design lacks the ability to examine if topic discussions change over time due to age, stage of development, or new caregiver questions/concerns. Research is thus needed to identify more nuanced topics discussed across multiple visits to better understand how discussions evolve and where interventions could be useful.

### "Are you available for the next 18 months? "-methods and aims of a longitudinal birth cohort study investigating a universal developmental surveillance program: the 'watch Me grow' study [^e4884e60]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

For recruitment to the community nurse arm, parents will be informed about the study by community nurses during the Universal Health Home Visit that occurs by four weeks post-birth. If the family shows interest in learning more about the study, the contact information of parents who express interest will be provided to the WMG study research team. Researchers will then contact these parents and mail study information and consent forms with reply-paid envelopes to be returned.

The retrospective arm of the study will comprise infants born in the two teaching hospitals who are in the age range of 18 to 21 months at the time of recruitment. This sample of children will serve as a ‘surveillance as usual in the community’ comparison group (i.e. a control group). This will help to determine any participation bias by ensuring that the WMG study is not influencing the help seeking and health related behaviours of study participants via a Hawthorne effect. For example, it is possible that the awareness gained through participation in the study might make the families more compliant with the developmental surveillance programs being assessed.

The total target sample for the study from all three arms is expected to be 2000 children.

Follow-up of prospective cohort

Telephone follow-up interviews for the prospective cohort (i.e. those recruited through the birth and community nurse arms of the study) will consist of a 10-minute interview that will ask about their use of universal developmental screening services using a purposively developed Prospective Developmental Surveillance Questionnaire (PDSQ). These telephone interviews will occur after the infants reach 6, 12, and 18 months of age. The key questions will include whether the child has been taken for the recommended scheduled checks, which health service(s) has been used, satisfaction level with the service, whether a PEDS had been completed, and by whom. The researcher contacting the family for the follow-up calls will complete the PEDS with any parent who has not completed a PEDS as part their child’s personal health record developmental surveillance schedule. At the 18-month telephone call, components of the NBQ will be re-administered so that it is possible to compare the sociodemographic characteristics at the child’s birth and 18 months later, as well as further questions on social capital, access to early childhood education services, and parenting. The same procedures will be followed for the retrospective cohort, but all the data will be collected in one telephone call.

### A pilot program to identify and reverse childhood obesity in a primary care clinic [^0c8cdbdf]. Clinical Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

This pilot study is an innovative approach to addressing the issue of childhood obesity that starts with the primary care physician and involves group education with peers. The primary care physician assesses the child's well-being at each interaction, whether for a scheduled well-child visit or for an acute illness. At each office visit the vital signs are taken, including the height, weight, and the calculated body mass index (BMI). The BMI is a tool that helps the provider identify children who are overweight or obese. Using the patient empowerment readiness model, the provider addresses obesity with the patient and the parent to determine if they are ready to implement behavioral changes. During a 10-month period, 68 patients were enrolled in the pilot program. The initial results after the 10 months showed that when the provider identified the issue of obesity and the child was assessed for readiness and integrated in the behavioral modification program the outcome was 63% of the group reduced their BMI. It was also noted that asthma was the most frequent comorbidity in the overweight/obese children. Whereas BMI increased in a matched control group, participants in the pilot program succeeded in reducing BMI.

### Screenings during well-child visits in primary care: a quality improvement study [^fd742238]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment visits are designed to address physical, mental, and developmental health of children enrolled in Medicaid.

Methods

We conducted a mixed methods intervention by using a quality improvement theory. We assessed preintervention and postintervention screening rates of development, anemia, lead, oral health, vision and hearing, interventions for improvement, and barriers for the well-child visits at an academic family medicine clinic. For quantitative analysis, we assessed the preintervention baseline for 183 children and postintervention outcome for 151 children. For qualitative analysis, we used group interviews and key informant interviews to develop interventions in the preintervention stage and to explore potential barriers for further improvement in the postintervention stage.

Results

Interventions based on baseline results included user-friendly materials, checklists, posters, education, and order sets. After the intervention, there were significant statistical improvements ( P < .05) for the anemia test ordered rate, serum lead test ordered rate, oral health screening and referral rates, and ordered and confirmed test rates for both vision and hearing. Despite these improvements, 3 qualitative findings indicated barriers for further improvement, including difficulties in venipuncture, medical assistant aversion to vision screening, and poor fit of equipment for hearing assessment. The procedures prompted further continuous quality improvement activities using fingerstick hemoglobin testing, a child-friendly vision screener, and manual audiometer with headphones.

Conclusions

The trial findings demonstrated potential benefits of improving screenings in an office-based intervention by using a quality improvement process. Postintervention qualitative findings illustrate additional factors that could be addressed for further improvements.

### Health supervision for children and adolescents with down syndrome [^abd67fa7]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Anticipatory guidance from 1 month to 1 year—family supports, early intervention, and counseling include reviewing availability of resources “at least once in the first year of life,” assessing “the emotional status of caregivers and intrafamilial relationships,” reviewing “connection to early intervention services,” reviewing “the family’s understanding of the chance of recurrence of Down syndrome” with referral for genetic counseling if desired, and being “prepared to discuss and answer questions about treatments that are considered complementary and alternative at each well-child visit.”

### Approach to developmental screening and surveillance in young children [^f66a21cb]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Early childhood development focuses on physical well-being, the development of motor skills and social interaction patterns, and the attainment of specific cognitive and communication skills. Developmental delay occurs when children are slow to achieve expected age-related norms for specific skills and may suggest underlying disease states. Developmental disabilities tend to be chronic conditions that affect social, physical, or cognitive development; these are reported in about 9% of children. Early intervention improves developmental outcomes with the potential for immediate and lasting effects. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends developmental surveillance at every well-child visit, using a validated developmental screening tool during the 9-, 18-, 24-, and 30-month well-child visits. The US Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to support universal developmental screening for autism spectrum disorder or speech and language disorders at these ages. Family physicians should use their best judgment when deciding whether to implement universal developmental screening. Numerous screening tools are available with comparable sensitivity and specificity profiles at varying costs. For any child with developmental concerns, referral for diagnostic evaluation is warranted with access supported by federal law. Children younger than 3 years should be referred to early intervention services. Children 3 years and older are typically referred to school-based programs, although they may not be available to children in private schools without access to these resources. Chromosomal microarray testing or exome sequencing is recommended for children who have developmental disabilities without an explainable cause. Continued surveillance and/or screening is warranted at future appointments.

### Ten steps to successful breastfeeding programme to promote early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding in DR Congo: a cluster-randomised controlled trial [^ae21ee35]. The Lancet: Global Health (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimisation of breastfeeding practices could reduce high mortality rates in children younger than 5 years, but in DR Congo, despite near-universal breastfeeding initiation and nine of ten children still breastfeeding at 1 year of age, exclusivity remains a difficulty. We assessed the effect on breastfeeding outcomes of a short-cut implementation of a programme called the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding, the key component of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI).

Methods

We did a cluster-randomised controlled trial and randomly assigned health-care clinics in Kinshasa, DR Congo, to standard care (control group), BFHI steps 1-9 (steps 1-9 group), or BFHI steps 1-9 plus additional support during well-child visits (steps 1-10 group) with computer-generated random numbers used to assign matched pairs to study groups. Mothers at these clinics who had given birth to one healthy baby during enrolment, and who expressed their intentions of visiting a well-baby session at the same clinic, were eligible and received the treatment assigned to their clinic. Mother-infant pairs were excluded if the mothers intended to attend well-baby clinic visits at a different health facility, or to travel before the child was aged at least 6 months. Participants and independent interviewers were masked to group assignment (ie, they were recruited after randomisaion and training of the clinic staff and were not informed of the study scheme), but clinical staff were unmasked. BFHI steps 1-9 and 1-10 were given by health-care staff trained with the WHO/UNICEF BFHI course. The primary outcomes were breastfeeding initiation within 1 h of birth and exclusive breastfeeding at age 14 and 24 weeks, assessed at face-to-face interviews in the clinic. Analysis was by intention to treat. Prevalence ratios (PR) were adjusted for cluster effects and baseline characteristics. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01428232, and is closed to new participants.

Findings

Between May 24, and Aug 25, 2012, we randomly assigned two eligible clinics to control, two to BFHI steps 1-9, and two to BFHI steps 1-10. We enrolled 975 eligible mother-infant pairs (304 in the control group, 363 in the steps 1-9 group, and 308 in the steps 1-10 group). 230 (76%) of infants in the control group, 263 (72%) in the steps 1-9 group, and 220 (71%) in the steps 1-10 group were breastfed within 1 h of birth; these results did not differ significantly between groups. Prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding at age 14 weeks was 89 (29%) in the control group, 237 (65%) in the steps 1-9 group (adjusted PR 2·20, 95% CI 1·73-2·77), and 129 (42%) in the steps 1-10 group (1·40, 1·13-1·74). At age 24 weeks, the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding was 36 (12%) in the control group, 131 (36%) in the steps 1-9 group (3·50, 2·76-4·43), and 43 (14%) in the steps 1-10 group (1·31, 0·91-1·89).

Interpretation

In the setting of health-care clinics in DR Congo with a high proportion of mothers initiating breastfeeding, implementation of basic training in BFHI steps 1-9 had no additional effect on initiation of breastfeeding but significantly increased exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months of age. Additional support based on the same training materials and locally available breastfeeding support materials, offered during well-child visits (ie, step 10) did not enhance this effect, and might have actually lessened it.

### A directed content analysis of discussions between mothers and pediatricians around feeding and growth topics during infant well-child visits [^04d31e0a]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatrician’s exit survey

Pediatricians completed an exit survey assessing their perception of well-child visits after all dyads completed data collection. This included sociodemographic information (eg, age, gender), years of clinical experience, and an assessment on the same feeding and growth topics presented in the mother’s survey. Pediatricians rated how often each topic was typically covered during well-child visits on a Likert scale (1 = never to 5 = always), how well each topic was typically discussed (1 = very poor to 5 = very good), and the importance of discussing these topics across the first 6 months (1 = not important at all to 5 = very important). During analysis, the scale options were collapsed into 3 categories, as previously described. Pediatricians were asked additional questions assessing their perceptions of barriers to providing optimal care and the value of offering an ancillary visit for additional guidance following each well-child visit.

### The role of well-child visits in detecting developmental delay in preschool children [^5a4c3e46]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Developmental delay (DD) is one of the most frequent disorders in early childhood, with a prevalence of about 15%. Children with DD may suffer from a variety of impairments that are likely to develop into multiple chronic and lifelong conditions, including intellectual disability, speech problems, socio-communicative deficits, sensory impairments, other physical complications, and behavioral and emotional disorders. A wide body of literature underlines the importance of early identification of affected children in order to counsel parents, enable diagnostic work-up, and initiate appropriate therapeutic support for infants with or at risk of DD. Children diagnosed with DD have better health and educational outcomes if detected and treated at younger ages. Therefore, intervening early offers substantial long-term advantages and economic benefits for society. Children who participate in a developmental screening program are more likely to be identified with DD, referred to EI, and eligible for EI services in a timelier fashion than children who received surveillance alone. However, despite improvements in rates of developmental screening, referral rates of children with developmental concerns to medical and developmental professionals and for initiation of developmental intervention remain low.

One important opportunity for detecting developmental delays, but also sensory impairments, and behavioral problems early are well-child visits, which involve systematic assessment of a child. In fact, the guidelines from pediatric and family practitioners’ associations recommend regular well-child visits. Swiss national recommendations endorse preventive well-child visits at one week, one, two, four, six, nine, and 12, 18, and 24 months, and at four years of age, performed by office-based pediatricians or general practitioners, which comprise a screening checklist, and tracking of growth and developmental milestones, which are documented in a booklet. Eight of these well-child visits before the age of 6 years are covered by mandatory health care insurance. However, no evaluation of well-child visits’ effectiveness in detecting DD in preschool children has been performed among primary care physicians (PCPs). Furthermore, it is unclear to what extent PCPs contribute to referring preschool children to EI, what proportion of such children subsequently receive therapy, and which obstacles against referral are encountered by PCPs.

### Brief maternal depression screening at well-child visits [^7b9fea61]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goals were (1) to determine the feasibility and yield of maternal depression screening during all well-child visits, (2) to understand how pediatricians and mothers respond to depression screening information, and (3) to assess the time required for discussion of screening results.

Methods

Implementation of brief depression screening of mothers at well-child visits for children of all ages was studied in 3 rural pediatric practices. Two screening trials introduced screening (1 month) and then determined whether screening could be sustained (6 months). Screening used the 2-question Patient Health Questionnaire. Practices tracked the proportions of visits screened and provided data about the screening process.

Results

Practices were able to screen in the majority of well-child visits (74% in trial 1 and 67% in trial 2). Of 1398 mothers screened, 17% had 1 of the depressive symptoms and 6% (n = 88) scored as being at risk for a major depressive disorder. During discussion, 5.7% of all mothers thought they might be depressed and 4.7% thought they were stressed but not depressed. Pediatric clinicians intervened with 62.4% of mothers who screened positive and 38.2% of mothers with lesser symptoms. Pediatrician actions included discussion of the impact on the child, a follow-up visit or call, and referral to an adult primary care provider, a mental health clinician, or community supports. Pediatrician time needed to discuss screening results decreased in the second trial. Prolonged discussion time was uncommon (5-10 minutes in 3% of all well-child visits and >10 minutes in 2%).

Conclusions

Routine, brief, maternal depression screening conducted during well-child visits was feasible and detected mothers who were willing to discuss depression and stress issues with their pediatrician. The discussion after screening revealed additional mothers who felt depressed among those with lesser symptoms. The additional discussion time was usually brief and resulted in specific pediatrician actions.

### Physical activity assessment and counseling in pediatric clinical settings [^1dd90f7e]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and Bright Futures play guidance—Given the critical importance of play in childhood, the AAP recommends that clinicians write a “prescription for play” at well-child visits in the first 2 years of life, and Bright Futures: Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children and Adolescents, Fourth Edition, encourages play as a way to decrease screen time starting at 18 months of age, promoting behavioral management and social development starting at 2 years of age, and advancing to promotion of physical activity guidelines at 5 years of age for growth and development.

### Promoting optimal development: identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through developmental surveillance and screening [^8d65defa]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) developmental surveillance and screening—schedule, implementation, and scope—is described as follows: Discrete ages for developmental screening are recommended at the 9-, 18-, and 30-month well-child visits, and developmental screening has traditionally been recommended at the 24-month wellchild visit and, since 2006, at the 30-month wellchild visit; screening for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is still recommended at the 18- and 24-month visits. The algorithm was designed to fit within the medical home model of care and with use in the screening of all children during key preventive care visits, with policy guidance on consultation and referral to other specialty physicians, other child development professionals, early intervention services, and preschool, and it recommended incorporating the principles of care for children with special health care needs in the primary care medical home. Despite increased attention, universal screening still has not been achieved, and AAP surveys of pediatricians report screening rates of 23% in 2002, 45% in 2009, and 63% in 2016; pediatricians have reported difficulties incorporating multiple new guidelines and continue to report time limitations and inadequate payment as barriers to implementation. The universal system would include the wide range of neurodevelopmental and behavioral conditions that affect the early and long-term development and achievement of children, with related guidelines including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), neuromotor disorders, early hearing detection, attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and behavioral conditions.

### Improving delivery of bright futures preventive services at the 9-and 24-month well child visit [^f0cfa55d]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine if clinicians and staff from 21 diverse primary care practice settings could implement the 2008 Bright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents, 3rd edition recommendations, at the 9- and 24-month preventive services visits.

Methods

Twenty-two practice settings from 15 states were selected from 51 applicants to participate in the Preventive Services Improvement Project (PreSIP). Practices participated in a 9-month modified Breakthrough Series Collaborative from January to November 2011. Outcome measures reflect whether the 17 components of Bright Futures recommendations were performed at the 9- and 24-month visits for at least 85% of visits. Additional measures identified which office systems were in place before and after the collaborative.

Results

There was a statistically significant increase for all 17 measures. Overall participating practices achieved an 85% completion rate for the preventive services measures except for discussion of parental strengths, which was reported in 70% of the charts. The preventive services score, a summary score for all the chart audit measures, increased significantly for both the 9-month (7 measures) and 24-month visits (8 measures).

Conclusions

Clinicians and staff from various practice settings were able to implement the majority of the Bright Futures recommended preventive services at the 9- and 24-month visits at a high level after participation in a 9-month modified Breakthrough Series collaborative.

### Incorporating recognition and management of perinatal depression into pediatric practice [^692a9b63]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Perinatal depression screening—national guideline direction and pediatric visit schedule are detailed as follows: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) provided a “grade B recommendation” for implementation and described a moderate net benefit to screening for perinatal depression, particularly when treatment such as psychotherapy or counseling is readily available. The Well-Women Task Force of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) stated that, beyond annual screening using a validated tool, additional screening for depression is specifically recommended in the postpartum period. The 2017 Bright Futures: Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents, Fourth Edition from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) include screening for maternal depression by the 1-, 2-, 4-, and 6-month well-child visits.

### Indications of missed malnutrition cases and growth monitoring challenges in a middle-income country [^550b25a0]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The most common reason for presentation was acute disease (86%), and only 1.9% of the children presented for well-child care. This is a region of low SES, and low SES is known to be associated with low attendance in well-child care, where growth monitoring is a core component. Low attendance at well-child visits can be attributed to the low level of health literacy (some families do not know of the need for well-child visits when not ill) and transport problems of families living in rural areas. Since malnutrition is more common in low SES populations, the low attendance of well-child care visits should be addressed.

Owing to low attendance at well-child visits and frequent presentations with acute disease “opportunistic growth measurement” can be applied in low SES children presenting for any reason. In the period when the current study was conducted, every child who visited the POC for any reason, including acute disease, was assessed for growth. Over a three-month period at a single medical facility, more than 100 children were diagnosed with malnutrition, and according to caregiver reports, approximately four out of five had not previously been diagnosed—underscoring the importance of opportunistic growth assessments.

Strengths and limitations

Through careful observations of a pediatrician engaged in solitary and busy practice within a modest rural hospital, this study highlights significant health and healthcare problems in the region. This study has several limitations. Due to working conditions such as time constraints, the scope of data collection was limited. Demographic variables—particularly education level, socioeconomic status, and residential location (urban vs. rural)—were not collected. One of the key limitations is the reliance on parent-reported information regarding children’s prior health monitoring, in the absence of access to medical records. This introduces a potential recall bias. Future studies should consider integrating electronic health records to improve data accuracy and reduce reliance on caregiver recall.

Additional screening at other ages—If concerns about a child’s development are raised at other times, it is appropriate to perform additional developmental screening using validated tests; this screening may require a separate visit and should be conducted as soon as possible, and if a child has missed a 9-, 18-, or 30-month visit, a developmental screen should be administered at the next opportunity.

Newborn hearing risk assessment and early follow-up—many of the risk factors for a delayed onset of changes in hearing can be identified in the newborn period from the perinatal and family history and/or on physical examination, and well-child visits during the first month of life are the opportune time to review the infant’s newborn hearing screening results.

### Statewide analysis reveals period of well-child visit attendance for earlier diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder [^b11f9aed]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To explore the relationship between well-child visit (WCV) attendance during early childhood and age at autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis using data drawn from a statewide all-payer claims database.

Study Design

We used a correlational study design with longitudinal data drawn from the Virginia All-Payer Claims Database. All children born in 2011 with a diagnosis of ASD were included (n = 253). Survival analysis determined the impact of WCV attendance on ASD diagnosis at each American Academy of Pediatrics-recommended early childhood visit, and the 5-year visit.

Results

Survival analysis revealed a significant impact of WCV attendance at the 24-month, 3-, and 4-year visits on earlier ASD diagnosis. Children who attended the 24-month visit were diagnosed nearly 10 months earlier than those who did not. Overall, children with ASD attended fewer than 50% of visits during early childhood.

Conclusions

Promoting consistent WCV attendance during early childhood is an actionable strategy for improving early identification of ASD. Further exploration is needed to determine barriers to visit attendance and the impact of patterns of early childhood WCV attendance on age of ASD diagnosis. Development and implementation of interventions to promote adherence to the American Academy of Pediatrics-recommended visits is needed.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^e15e00c9]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Obesity screening and referral—primary care and public health recommendations—state that following comprehensive systematic reviews, the USPSTF issued a Grade B recommendation that pediatricians and other PHCPs screen children and adolescents aged 6 years or older annually for obesity—defined by BMI percentile—and offer, or refer children and adolescents, to a comprehensive, intensive, family-based behavioral treatment to improve weight status; a “comprehensive, intensive behavioral treatment” was defined as a treatment of 26 hours or more over a period of 2 to 12 months. All 3 sources recommend annual screening for excess weight using BMI, with the USPSTF beginning at 6 years old and both Bright Futures and this CPG beginning at age 2 years. For children or adolescents with BMI ≥ 95th percentile for age and sex, the USPSTF provides recommendations for primary care providers to offer, or refer them to, a comprehensive, family-based weight management intervention; Bright Futures recommends that primary care providers screen for excess weight and provide dietary nutrition and physical activity counseling for all children and adolescents with either overweight or obesity (BMI ≥ 85th and <95th percentile for age and sex), and this CPG recommends referral to evidence-based weight management interventions for all children 2 years and older who have a BMI ≥ 95th percentile for age and sex. The practice of annual BMI measurement at well-child visits is recommended and central to the management and tracking of overweight and obesity in children, although limitations to this approach include missed opportunities to track and manage weight changes that occur in less than a 12-month period; other visit opportunities can be used to assess BMI outside the well-child visit.

### Evidence-based milestones for surveillance of cognitive, language, and motor development [^59c12e67]. Academic Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Fewer than half of the nation's pediatricians conduct systematic surveillance of young children's development. Because time and cost are among the barriers, our objective was to create a brief set of parent-report questions about cognitive, motor, and language milestones that is freely available and can be administered and scored quickly.

Methods

A team of experts developed candidate items after reviewing existing instruments and prior research. We selected final items based on statistical fit to a graded item response model developed and replicated in separate samples enrolled from primary care settings (n = 469 and 308, respectively). We then developed a 10-item form for each visit on the pediatric periodicity schedule. Combining our initial samples with 395 families enrolled from referral clinics, we tested these forms' concurrent validity with respect to the ASQ-3 and parent reports of developmental diagnoses.

Results

A final set of 54 items displayed adequate fit to our statistical model regardless of race/ethnicity, education level, and child gender. Beginning at 4 months, scores on 10-item forms displayed consistent associations with the ASQ-3, and all but the 60-month form detected parents' reports of developmental delay with adequate sensitivity and specificity.

Conclusions

The Milestones is one element of the Survey of Well-being of Young Children (SWYC), a brief but comprehensive screening instrument for children under 5 years. The Milestones is a set of evidence-based items with individual normative data that are appropriate for pediatric surveillance. In addition, the scoring of 10-item Milestones forms may provide many advantages of a first level developmental screening instrument.

### Resident sensitive quality measures for general pediatrics: alignment with existing care recommendations [^bb5529ad]. Academic Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Resident sensitive quality measures (RSQMs) are a new patient-focused approach to performance assessment. Their alignment with existing performance constructs is underexplored.

Objective

Develop and prioritize RSQMs for outpatient general pediatrics in the areas of well visits (0-2 months, 1, and 5 years) and compare to the existing framework of the Bright Futures recommendations.

Methods

Categorical pediatric residents, general academic pediatric fellows, and general pediatric faculty participated in nominal group technique (NGT) and Delphi processes to generate and prioritize RSQMs for 3 different well-child visits of interest. The author team then compared the content of the final RSQMs to the American Academy of Pediatrics Bright Futures recommendations.

Results

From the list of 143 potential measures from the NGT groups, 15 RSQMs were prioritized for each well-child visit. RSQMs prioritized vaccine administration, documentation of screening, and medication management. Overall, RSQMs mapped well to Bright Futures recommendations.

Conclusions

The alignment of the RSQMs with Bright Futures frameworks supports their contribution as process measures for informing resident performance. RSQMs created from this study should be used for future investigations into resident performance assessment and to drive personal improvement efforts.

### Reflections on well-child care practice: a national study of pediatric clinicians [^3d439276]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess perspectives about the practice of well-child care among pediatric clinicians, especially in the areas of child development and behavior.

Methods

Thirty-one focus groups (282 pediatricians and 41 pediatric nurse practitioners) in 13 cities addressed current practices, priorities used to determine content of well-child care visits, and changes to improve visit quality and outcomes.

Results

Although most clinicians were positive about their practice of well-child care, they reported areas of concern and suggested ideas for improvements. Establishing a therapeutic relationship and individualizing care were viewed as significant contributions to quality of care. Participants agreed about the importance of eliciting parent concerns as the first priority for all well-child care visits. Community resources outside the office setting were seen as both a major influence on and, in some communities, a limitation to pediatric care. The challenges of early recognition of developmental and behavior problems through standardized questionnaires and effective interviewing were viewed as a priority to improve pediatric effectiveness in monitoring and treatment. To enhance primary care practices in developmental and behavioral pediatrics, participants suggested innovations in practice organization, community linkages, information technology, and integration of existing innovative programs. Education for pediatricians and enhanced resident training in developmental and behavioral pediatrics were endorsed.

Conclusions

Pediatric clinicians' support a vision of preventive care that is comprehensive, family centered, and developmentally relevant, both for children with greater risk to long-term healthy development and for families with more normative child-rearing concerns.

### The prenatal visit [^da6b35bb]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Anticipatory guidance and enhanced parenting skills; social determinants of health—the prenatal visit offers an opportunity to discuss a range of concerns that may be of great interest to the expectant parents and pediatric provider, with the conversation shaped by parent concerns and time available, and it also offers an opportunity for assessment of family risk factors and connections to key evidence-based and other early learning, health, and development programs in the community.

### Assessing the value-added contributions of community health workers and communities to early child development: a longitudinal study in a low-income setting [^d1499e16]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Intervention

The government-sponsored, community-based health and nutrition programme was considered the status quo, and different nutrition and development activities were layered onto home visits in each treatment arm. In the first treatment arm (T1), 14 home visits for intensive nutrition counselling were delivered to pregnant women and children aged 0–24 months. In the second treatment arm (T2), weekly distribution of 20 g sachets of lipid-based nutrient supplementation (LNS) for daily consumption for children 6–18 months was added to the T1 home visits. In the third treatment arm (T3), 40 g sachets were given to all pregnant and lactating women weekly up to 6 months postpartum in addition to 20 g for children 6–18 months. The fourth treatment arm (T4) did not include LNS but added a structured, ECD-focused early stimulation component with fortnightly home visits for children 6–30 months old, adapted from the Reach Up and Learn curriculum for the Malagasy context.More details on the interventions are included in the published results of the main trial paper.

Added-CHWs received a 10-day training before intervention delivery, which covered listening and communication skills, problem-solving for exclusive breastfeeding, introduction of complementary feeding and food security. They also received periodic refresher training. Added-CHWs in the T4 arm received training on early stimulation and were provided with a week of on-site support by a team of ECD coaches at the beginning of the programme and 6 months thereafter.

Target population

The study recruited 750 children per arm (30 children per community) starting in the second or third trimester in utero (−6 months) to <12 months in three cohorts: cohort 1 (10 children aged −6 to <0 months), cohort 2 (10 children aged 0 to <6 months) and Cohort 3 (10 children aged 6 to 12 months). For this analysis, we only used children alive at baseline (second or third cohort) with a measure of their developmental status (using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire-Inventory, ASQ-I) in the treatment arms (ie, receiving a home visit). Target children were 24–36 months during the endline assessment (2 years after implementation). Any children who moved during the study period and returned before endline measurement were interviewed and assessed for the main trial but were not included in this analysis because their exposure to the programme was unknown.

### Improving delivery of EPSDT well-child care at acute visits in an academic pediatric practice [^45743895]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Many patients with Medicaid do not receive timely, comprehensive well-child care through the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) program. Missed opportunities for EPSDT well-child check-ups (WCCs) at acute visits contribute to this problem. The authors sought to reduce missed opportunities for WCCs at acute visits for patients overdue for those services.

Methods

A quality improvement team developed key drivers and used a people-process-technology framework to devise 3 interventions: (1) an electronic indicator based on novel definitions of EPSDT status (up-to-date, due, overdue, no EPSDT), (2) a standardized scheduling process for acute visits based on EPSDT status, and (3) a dedicated nurse practitioner to provide WCCs at acute visits. Data were collected for 1 year after full implementation.

Results

At baseline, 10.3 acute visits per month were converted to WCCs. After intervention, 86.7 acute visits per month were converted. Of 13801 acute visits during the project, 31.2% were not up-to-date. Of those overdue for WCCs, 51.4% (n = 552) were converted to a WCC in addition to the acute visit. Including all patients who were not up-to-date, a total of 1047 acute visits (7.6% of all acute visits) were converted to comprehensive WCCs. Deferring needed WCCs at acute visits resulted in few patients who scheduled or completed future WCC visits.

Conclusions

Implementation of interventions focused on people-process-technology significantly increased WCCs at acute visits within a feasible and practical model that may be replicated at other academic general pediatrics practices.

### The role of the pediatrician in primary prevention of obesity [^bad5dac2]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Early childhood growth monitoring and risk assessment—pediatricians and primary care physicians should measure weight and length or height in a standardized way and should plot them on World Health Organization growth charts (ages 0–23 months) or on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts (ages 24–59 months) as part of every well-child visit. It is recommended to use weight-for-length for children younger than 24 months; in this age range, overweight is defined as weight-for-length >95th percentile, and pediatricians should consider children’s rate of weight gain, especially as their body mass index (BMI) reaches the 85th and 95th percentiles, and parental weight status as risk factors.

### Thoughts on health supervision: learning-focused primary care [^aafbef69]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Primary care clinicians confront a long list of topics that are supposed to be covered during well-child visits, but evidence for the effectiveness of preventive counseling for most issues is limited, and it is doubtful that covering more topics confers correspondingly enhanced clinical benefits. Amid growing professional interest in rethinking primary care, 3 ideas that would facilitate constructive change are proposed. First, face-to-face time between doctors and parents should be allocated as a scarce resource, with priority given to topics that are both important and uniquely responsive to in-office intervention. Second, to maximize the educational value of anticipatory guidance, visits could focus on experiential, as opposed to merely didactic, learning. Finally, recommendations for primary care should be based on evidence, rather than expert opinion. Competing protocols for preventive care ought to be subjected to large-scale, coordinated research. The unit of analysis should be the visit or series of visits, rather than a single intervention. A crucial first step would be the definition of universal outcome measures.

### Providing car seat checks with well-child visits at an urban health center: a pilot study [^e1fc9575]. Injury Prevention (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate a pilot program of providing child restraint system (CRS) checks by certified technicians with well-child care in an urban health center serving a low-income community.

Methods

During well-child care, nationally certified child passenger safety technicians assessed CRS use, educated care givers, corrected misuse, and provided a new CRS if necessary. The program's effect was assessed at a subsequent medical visit.

Results

A total of 3650 CRS checks were performed. CRS non-use was found for 307 (17%) infants, 604 (50%) toddlers, and 593 (88%) booster seat-sized children. Exposure to the program was associated with a significant positive effect on CRS use (p<0.001) and significant improvements in the major components of misuse (p<0.05) months later.

Conclusions

This urban health center has high rates of CRS non-use and near-universal misuse. Providing CRS checks by certified technicians during well-child care is a promising means of promoting sustained and improved CRS use.

### Long term follow up of high risk children: who, why and how? [^ca612165]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Audit/research

To fill gaps in knowledge, and hence to understand short and long term outcomes more precisely, especially long-term post-discharge outcomes.
To establish the burden of illness from certain clinical groupings.
To provide data for benchmarking, which can be fed back to service providers, not only to those involved in perinatal (obstetric or paediatric) care, but also beyond, including to providers of intervention and early education services, the school system and later health providers, including behavioural health and psychiatric services.
To determine the consequences of treatments or other interventions or exposures, not only from randomised controlled trials, but also other study designs, such as cohort studies designed to monitor long-term effects of new treatments that are implemented into clinical care. Such treatments have not always been evaluated first in randomised controlled trials, and even if they have, ongoing surveillance is warranted to detect rare or long-term adverse effects that cannot be detected in the initial trials.
To establish a framework for follow up of at-risk children, including identifying targets and best timing for intervention.
To identify causal pathways, and in particular risk and resilience factors.
To generate hypotheses for further research, such as future randomised controlled trials of interventions or exposures designed to improve long-term outcomes for high-risk children and their families.

How should high-risk children be followed?

Several issues need to be addressed as part of this question. These include consideration of the important outcomes of interest, when children should be assessed, the personnel required, and what psychometrically sound, assessment tools are available.

What outcomes are of interest?

The outcomes to be assessed vary with the child’s age (Additional file 1 : Table S1). The emphasis is to identify relevant areas, from both the child’s and the family’s perspective, and how these might vary in importance at particular ages.

Child variables

Child variables can be grouped into four broad domains: physical health, mental health, learning and cognition, and quality of life. Dependent upon the resources and time available, the number of domains assessed at each time point could vary from few, such as in a busy general practice setting, to most in a well-resourced research setting, provided the outcomes were helpful in answering the clinical or research questions being proposed, and in supporting the children and their families. The method of assessment may also vary depending on the setting, from screening questionnaires, or office-based clinical assessment, to referral to specialised services such as educational psychology or cardiology.

### Baby-led introduction to solidS (BLISS) study: a randomised controlled trial of a baby-led approach to complementary feeding [^a41cb8d8]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Control group

Participants randomised to the control group will receive standard Well Child care (as described above) from the providers of their choice and no additional intervention.

BLISS group

Participants randomised to the BLISS group will receive standard Well Child care (as described above) from the providers of their choice, as well as additional parent contacts for support and education from before birth to 9 months of age delivered by the BLISS study. The intervention will be delivered by an experienced lactation consultant and trained research staff who will be supervised by a multidisciplinary team (dietitian, paediatrician, speech-language therapist) throughout the study. The intervention has three key components:

Professional lactation consultant service (third trimester of pregnancy to 6 months of age) - There will be at least five contacts with an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC):
An anticipatory guidance group session before birth (at approximately 34–35 weeks gestation) to discuss breastfeeding (benefits, challenges and developing a “breastfeeding plan”), explain the nature of the free support service on offer until their infant is 6 months of age and introduce the concept of Baby-Led Introduction to SolidS.
A home visit in the first week after the mother returns home from hospital, or during the first week following a planned homebirth; a support phone call and offer of a home visit at 3–4 weeks; a home visit at 3–4 months; and a phone call at 5 months of age, to provide support and education around breastfeeding (or formula feeding if requested), and to assess how the recommended approach of milk only until 6 months is going. Support will include encouraging: exclusive breastfeeding to 6 months, breastfeeding to at least 12 months and delaying the introduction of complementary foods until 6 months of age.
The lactation consultant will also be available to supply additional support when requested by the participant until her infant is 6 months of age. This will involve providing specific individualized advice to address problems with breastfeeding (or formula feeding) via extra home visit(s), phone or email contact. In our earlier Prevention of Overweight in Infancy study, this additional support was utilized by 36 % of families (Davies, personal communication).

### Promoting optimal development: identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through developmental surveillance and screening [^d9adec55]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Step 10—unaddressed concern from surveillance—if concerns were raised during developmental surveillance but a disorder or condition was not identified, the pediatric health care professional should document the concern in the practice’s record system and continue to monitor the child’s developmental progress, and an early return visit is recommended to provide additional developmental surveillance. If developmental screening was unable to be completed, the concern should be noted and flagged for an early return visit, and the return visit should be held as soon as possible. If concerns are significant, then direct referral to early intervention is appropriate.

### An explanatory model of factors related to well baby visits by age three years for medicaid-enrolled infants: a retrospective cohort study [^8cf34261]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Outcome measure

The outcome measure was the total number of well baby visits (WBVs) the infant had between birth to age 41 months (range: 0 to 10). WBVs were identified from each infant’s claims files using the following International Classification of Disease-Version 9-Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) Codes: V20.2, V70.0, V70.3, V70.5, V70.6, V70.8, V70.9, 99381, 99382, 99391, 99392, and 99432. The selected WBV ICD-9-CM and CPT Codes were based on Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) specifications, which are standardized outcome measures used to assess the quality of health insurance plans.

The 2000 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) WBV schedule was used to assess whether an infant had each of the following 10 recommended WBVs (no/yes): 1-month, 2-month, 4-month, 6-month, 9-month, 12-month, 15-month, 18-month, 24-month, and 36-month. We assessed whether the infant had a particular WBV by subtracting the infant’s date of birth from the date on which the infant had the WBV and applied previously published age ranges around each WBV (Table 1). For example, an infant who had a WBV between age 7 days and less than age 1 month was classified as having had the 1-month WBV. Finally, we summed the total number of WBVs that each infant had during the 41-month study period.

### Effectiveness of targeted anticipatory guidance during well-child visits: a pilot trial [^76a77bdc]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Anticipatory guidance, an important function of well-child visits, is often brief and not tailored to parents' concerns. This targeted pilot trial evaluated a new method of anticipatory guidance.

Methods

Using an experimental/control study design, we surveyed 137 parents and 31 physicians, comparing their responses to targeted anticipatory guidance (physician-provided education based on parents' concerns) versus usual anticipatory guidance (standard physician lecture on parenting, safety, and nutritional topics).

Results

Overall, physicians appeared less satisfied than parents with the educational component of well-child visits, and they desired changes in the educational aspect of these visits. While physicians believed the targeted approach was easier, control group parents appeared more satisfied with usual anticipatory guidance. The number of anticipatory guidance topics covered in the control group was less than half of that covered in the experimental group.

Conclusions

Our targeted method of anticipatory guidance during well-child visits covered more educational topics and resulted in visits that were easier for physicians, but less satisfactory for parents. Further research is needed to identify methods of anticipatory guidance that are effective and satisfactory for both parents and physicians.

### Community health workers in early childhood well-child care for medicaid-insured children: a randomized clinical trial [^3cb681b8]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

An intervention model (the Parent-focused Redesign for Encounters, Newborns to Toddlers; the PARENT intervention) for well-child care that integrates a community health worker into preventive care services may enhance early childhood well-child care.

Objective

To examine the effectiveness of the PARENT intervention vs usual care for parents with children younger than 2 years of age.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted between March 2019 and July 2022. Of the 1283 parents with a child younger than 2 years of age presenting for a well-child visit at 1 of the 10 clinic sites (2 federally qualified health centers in California and Washington) approached for trial participation, 937 were enrolled.

Intervention

Five clinics implemented the PARENT intervention, which is a team-based approach to care that uses a community health worker in the role of a coach (ie, health educator) as part of the well-child care team to provide comprehensive preventive services, and 5 clinics provided usual care.

Main Outcomes and Measures

There were 2 primary outcomes: score for parent-reported receipt of recommended anticipatory guidance during well-child visits (score range, 0-100) and emergency department (ED) use (proportion with ≥2 ED visits). The secondary outcomes included psychosocial screening, developmental screening, health care use, and parent-reported experiences of care.

Results

Of the 937 parents who were enrolled, 914 remained eligible to participate (n=438 in the intervention group and n=476 in the usual care group; 95% were mothers, 73% reported Latino ethnicity, and 63% reported an annual income <$30 000). The majority (855/914; 94%) of the children (mean age, 4.4 months at parental enrollment) were insured by Medicaid. Of the 914 parents who remained eligible and enrolled, 785 (86%) completed the 12-month follow-up interview. Parents of children treated at the intervention clinics (n=375) reported receiving more anticipatory guidance than the parents of children treated at the usual care clinics (n=407) (mean score, 73.9 [SD, 23.4] vs 63.3 [SD, 27.8], respectively; adjusted absolute difference, 11.01 [95% CI, 6.44 to 15.59]). There was no difference in ED use (proportion with ≥2 ED visits) between the intervention group (n=376) and the usual care group (n=407) (37.2% vs 36.1%, respectively; adjusted absolute difference, 1.2% [95% CI, -5.5% to 8.0%]). The effects of the intervention on the secondary outcomes included a higher amount of psychosocial assessments performed, a greater number of parents who had developmental or behavioral concerns elicited and addressed, increased attendance at well-child visits, and greater parental experiences with the care received (helpfulness of care).

Conclusions and Relevance

The intervention resulted in improvements in the receipt of preventive care services vs usual care for children insured by Medicaid by incorporating community health workers in a team-based approach to early childhood well-child care.

### Patient-centered medical homes and vision care for children: a cross-sectional analysis with data from the national survey of children's health 2018-2019 [^642bc416]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study provided a population-level understanding of associations between caregiver-reported receipt of PCMH care and vision screening tests in primary care for children 3 to 6 years in the United States receiving well-child visits from the 2018 to 2019 NSCH. Children receiving PCMH care were more likely to receive a vision screening test in primary care at a well-child visit in the previous 12 months, compared to children without PCMH care, consistent with the hypothesis for this study.

A prior study by Romaire et al. explored the association between PCMH care and ever receiving a vision test for children 3 to 6 years with data from the 2004 to 2006 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Romaire et al. did not find an association between PCMH care and receiving a vision test. There are several potential reasons for this lack of an association: Romaire et al.’s use of data from 2004 to 2006, about 17 years prior to the current study; or, differences in definitions of PCMH care. Also, the 2004 to 2006 MEPS question on vision screening did not limit the test to pediatricians or general doctors. Vision tests could be performed by a doctor or other health care provider in any setting.

Receiving family-centered care, one of three main components of the PCMH measure, was associated with receiving a vision screening test in primary care. This is not surprising as previous studies have shown a strong association between family-centered care (i.e. time spent with provider in well-child visits, caregiver-primary care provider language concordance, and cultural competency), and receiving vision care or well-child visits. Also, studies have reported time constraints as a barrier to conducting vision screening by pediatric primary care physicians [,–]. Patient-centered medical homes require providers to spend more time with patients, which is a measure of family-centered care. Well-child visits that are of short duration (10 min or less) are associated with reductions in content and quality of care.

In this study, children aged 4 years at the well-child visit were 49% more likely to get a vision screening test in primary care compared to children aged 6 years after adjusting for key variables. This result may be because of requirements for children to get vision screening tests prior to kindergarten entry in many states.

### Does trainee involvement affect anticipatory guidance in well-child care? [^6c579a70]. Clinical Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Studies demonstrate gaps in anticipatory guidance during well-child visits, but none consider academic teaching hospitals where physician trainees also provide counseling. We prospectively assessed parental perception of anticipatory guidance at the outpatient clinic of an academic teaching hospital.

Methods

Parents of patients newborn to <60 months old completed questionnaires regarding providers seen and anticipatory guidance preferences.

Results

Of 204 parents, 40% saw the child's primary attending alone. There was no association between providers seen and the number of topics covered. Seeing the child's primary attending alone increased the odds that parents' priority topics were covered compared with another attending (odds ratio [OR] = 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.11-0.90) or the addition of a resident (OR = 0.35; 95% CI = 0.16-0.77) or medical student (OR = 0.33; 95% CI = 0.12-0.90).

Conclusions

Priority anticipatory guidance is covered only one third as often when the well-child visit is not conducted by the primary attending. When involving trainees, continuity of care and parental concerns must be emphasized.

### Ten recommendations for child-friendly visiting policies in critical care [^5a79455f]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 4: Prepare, accompany, and follow-up the visit of children

The date for the visit is known to everyone involved; the patient and the room are prepared. A designated person in the medical/care team supervises the entire visit. During the visit, children are respected and supported to do what they are confident in, e.g. touching the loved one, ask questions, chat, or terminate the visit. After each visit, a short separate debriefing with the children and the team is recommended.

Exposure variable (breastfeeding duration)

KPNC members with newborn babies are strongly encouraged to attend “Well Baby/Child” visits to discuss and assess their child’s health and growth trajectory with their pediatricians from birth to adolescence. These visits are accompanied by health questionnaires asking questions on nutrition, safety, parenting behaviors, household circumstances, and other topics pertaining to the child’s health and wellbeing. Within the first year after birth, parents are encouraged to come to these well-baby checkups at the following intervals: birth-1 week, 2–4 weeks, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 9–10 months. During these checkups, parents or caregivers are asked “Do you feed your baby breastmilk?” We categorized breastfeeding practice as: “breastfed for ≥6 months” if the response was “Yes” at ≥6 months after birth; “breastfed for <6 months” if the response was “Yes” at <6 months and “No” at ≥6 months checkup; and “not breastfed” if the response was “No” to the breastfeeding questions at both <6 months and ≥ 6 months. The 6-month cutoff was selected in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) breastfeeding guidelines, which recommend that infants are breastfed for at least 6 months.

### Clinical practice guidelines: childhood hearing screening [^54f1c128]. AAA (2011). Medium credibility.

Childhood hearing screening—background and need for guidelines—highlights early identification benefits and endorsed screening intervals. Hearing loss is described as “the most prevalent developmental abnormality present at birth,” and identification “by 6 months of age” with early intervention is associated with typical language development. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) “endorses hearing screening throughout infancy, early childhood, middle childhood and adolescence,” with “all newborns are to be screened” per the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH) and additional screening “during routine well child visits at ages 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10.” The American Academy of Audiology (AAA) states that children with undetected hearing loss or middle ear disease “be identified so that appropriate audiologic and medical management can be provided,” and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) “endorses the identification of school children at risk for hearing impairment.” Evidence gaps are noted: among “9-year-olds with educationally significant hearing loss, up to 50% will have passed newborn hearing screening,” and “pediatricians typically neither recheck hearing nor refer more than half of the ten percent of children who fail their hearing screening.” The burden is underscored by the estimate that “9-10 per 1000 children will have identifiable permanent hearing loss in one or both ears by school-age.”

### Long term follow up of high risk children: who, why and how? [^6700c9c6]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical care

If the major goal of follow-up is to provide ongoing clinical care for a high-risk child, a minimal checklist of areas to cover for a health professional, such as a paediatrician, would be represented by the shaded areas in Additional file 1 : Table S1. Depending on what is found at each assessment, referral for more thorough evaluation of some areas might be required. If progress is otherwise satisfactory, then follow-up could be limited to the areas highlighted, but occasionally other issues might require assessment.

The issue of how long to follow a child who is progressing normally and whose family is coping appropriately will depend on many circumstances. Children at two years who are walking freely with no abnormal neurological signs, talking in 2–3 word sentences, with no vision or hearing problems, whose parents have no major behavioural concerns, and who have no other health problems that require ongoing care, and whose family is functioning well, can be discharged from specialist surveillance and referred back to primary care services, with a clear management and follow-up plan. Whether later assessments at preschool or early school ages are warranted could be decided on an individual basis and informed by screening during primary care visits or by family concerns. However, it must be recognised that many of the cognitive and academic problems that occur at school-age will not be predicted by progress in the first few years of life. Many high-risk children will not be able to function adequately in the preschool or school setting. They will remain undiagnosed and unassessed until they have failed and been brought to the attention of someone at an age that is usually too late for effective intervention. Ideally the highest risk children should be reassessed prior to school entry, and after the first few years at school. The reality is that resources are limited, and few centres are able to offer such assessments routinely, even though the cost of follow-up is minimal compared with the cost of providing intensive care. While the cost of follow-up needs to be acknowledged, the cost of inaction, which is more difficult to measure, may be much greater. Moreover, one of the other difficulties experienced by families is that once they are ‘out of the system’, it is hard to get back in to mobilise the resources required quickly. As a minimum, parents of high risk children, health professionals and educators need to be “alert but not alarmed” and advised that serious issues can still arise at later times. Maintaining good records of previous assessments will facilitate reassessments at later ages.

### Long term follow up of high risk children: who, why and how? [^f5643b36]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There are now approximately 300,000 babies born every year in Australia, most of who survive the newborn period, and then grow and develop normally. However, clearly identifiable groups of survivors, such as those born preterm or with ill-health, have adverse long-term outcomes, with higher than expected rates of health or developmental problems, compared with children born at term and in good health.

Usual health surveillance for the majority of children comprises regular visits to a Maternal and Child Health Nurse (or equivalent), or to a primary care doctor for checks on the child’s health, growth and development, and to organise immunisations. Follow-up rates for these services are high during infancy and steadily fall during the preschool years. Those who are at higher risk are worthy of a more structured and specialised programme of follow-up assessments, for at least two reasons. First, families want to know if their child is healthy and growing and developing normally, or if health or other problems are likely to be encountered in the future. Special concerns often arise at transition points, such as entering child care or changing school levels, thus requiring careful guidance and advice. Second, some problems can be ameliorated or prevented if detected early – identification of high-risk groups for targeted intervention can be both effective and efficient.

### Promoting optimal development: identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through developmental surveillance and screening [^5d38daf3]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Developmental surveillance and screening for infants and young children—developmental surveillance is supported at every health supervision visit, as is the administration of standardized screening tests at the 9-, 18-, and 30-month visits. Developmental concerns elicited on surveillance at any visit should be followed by standardized developmental screening testing or direct referral to intervention and specialty medical care. Special attention to surveillance is recommended at the 4- to 5-year well-child visit, prior to entry into elementary education, with screening completed if there are any concerns. Conditions targeted include autism, deafness/hard-of-hearing, intellectual and motor disabilities, behavioral conditions, and those seen in other medical conditions. Developmental surveillance includes bidirectional communication with early childhood professionals in child care, preschools, Head Start, and other programs, including home visitation and parenting, particularly around developmental screening. This policy statement was reaffirmed in April 2024 with reference and data updates.

Recommendations of others—pediatric oral health prevention: The US Department of Health and Human Services’ and National Institutes of Health reports emphasized the importance of integrating oral health into primary care medical settings, primarily focusing on counseling, coordination, and referral. The National Academy of Medicine and the Health Resources & Services Administration report recommends strategic action for prioritization of oral health within US Department of Health and Human Services agencies and in its partnerships with other stakeholders. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends pediatricians perform oral health risk assessments on all children at every routine well-child visit beginning at age 6 months, and the AAP also recommends fluoride varnish application according to the AAP/Bright Futures periodicity schedule (applied at least once every 6 months for all children and every 3 months for children at high risk for dental caries) and dietary fluoride supplements for all children who do not have an adequate supply of fluoride in their primary drinking water. The American Dental Association and American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry have issued guidelines on oral health aimed at dental professionals. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends that primary care clinicians educate patients about risks and benefits of fluoride; it recommends dietary fluoride supplements for children age 6 months through 16 years in areas where fluoride drinking water levels are suboptimal.

### Ease of administration of the cognitive adaptive test / clinical linguistic and auditory milestone scale (CAT / CLAMS) during pediatric well-child visits [^b7fd6406]. Clinical Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Barriers to early identification of children with developmental delays include time constraints during well-child visits and lack of easily administered, quantitative measures that can be used by pediatricians. This study assesses the ease of administration of the Cognitive Adaptive Test/Clinical Linguistic and Auditory Milestone Scale (CAT/CLAMS) during well-child visits from 2 to 36 months of age. During a single visit 177 children were assessed by either a developmental pediatrician (n = 121) or a third-year pediatric resident (n = 56). The mean time required to complete the CAT/CLAMS for all subjects was 6 minutes and 10 seconds (SD 2 minutes 44 seconds); less than 10 minutes was required in 92% of children assessed. There were no significant differences in the time required by the 2 examiners at any age level. Its ease of administration and psychometric properties make the CAT/CLAMS an excellent choice for the assessment of early development by primary care pediatricians.

Interventions

The GMCD early intervention package guides frontline workers through caregiver visits, using seven steps (box 1) that employ family-centred care principles, open-ended interviewing and mutual problem-solving skills. The GMCD intervention is available as a digital Android application, which will be used in this study.

Box 1 
Seven steps of the monthly Guide for Monitoring Child Development early intervention visit

Explain the importance of the early years for brain development to caregiver.
Elicit high-priority caregiver concerns about the child’s development.
Assess the child’s functioning in developmental domains using open-ended questions and standardised age-appropriate milestones.
Explore existing psychosocial risk factors and nurturing care already provided by the family, elicit and support child and family strengths.
Provide specific recommendations for nurturing care activities for the child’s level of functioning in seven domains of development.
Problem solve other opportunities to address child health and psychosocial risk factors.
Set mutual goals around interventions, referrals to community resources and plans for the next visit.

In this trial, the GMCD intervention will be integrated into existing usual care monthly home visits delivered by frontline workers. Details of usual care will differ from cluster to cluster, but typically include health promotion activities such as growth monitoring and immunisations, and nutritional support activities such as complementary feeding education and supplementation. Individuals not enrolled in the intervention will receive all usual care activities.

Frontline workers will be trained in use of the GMCD intervention through group sessions and individual practice by certified trainers. Training will consist of 30–40 contact hours with additional time between training sessions to allow for practice of new skills. Final competence will be assessed by direct observation by GMCD trainers.

Outcomes

Based on our preliminary work, we expect to observe improvements across all developmental domains but expect the largest changes to be in language.Therefore, we will use change from 0 to 12 months in the language composite score of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 3rd edition (BSID-3) as our primary developmental outcome.Our secondary outcome is improvement in nurturing care. To assess this, we will measure changes from 0 to 12 months in the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment Scale (HOME).

### A parent coach model for well-child care among low-income children: a randomized controlled trial [^d5d92ee9]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this study was to examine the effects of a new model for well-child care (WCC), the Parent-focused Redesign for Encounters, Newborns to Toddlers (PARENT), on WCC quality and health care utilization among low-income families.

Methods

PARENT includes 4 elements designed by using a stakeholder-engaged process: (1) a parent coach (ie, health educator) to provide anticipatory guidance, psychosocial screening and referral, and developmental/behavioral guidance and screening at each well-visit; (2) a Web-based tool for previsit screening; (3) an automated text message service to provide periodic, age-specific health messages to families; and (4) a brief, problem-focused encounter with the pediatric clinician. The Promoting Healthy Development Survey-PLUS was used to assess receipt of recommended WCC services at 12 months' postenrollment. Intervention effects were examined by using bivariate analyses.

Results

A total of 251 parents with a child aged ≤12 months were randomized to receive either the control (usual WCC) or the intervention (PARENT); 90% completed the 12-month assessment. Mean child age at enrollment was 4.5 months; 64% had an annual household income less than $20,000. Baseline characteristics for the intervention and control groups were similar. Intervention parents scored higher on all preventive care measures (anticipatory guidance, health information, psychosocial assessment, developmental screening, and parental developmental/behavioral concerns addressed) and experiences of care measures (family-centeredness, helpfulness, and overall rating of care). Fifty-two percent fewer intervention children had ≥2 emergency department visits over the 12-month period. There were no significant differences in WCC or sick visits/urgent care utilization.

Conclusions

A parent coach-led model for WCC may improve the receipt of comprehensive WCC for low-income families, and it may potentially lead to cost savings by reducing emergency department utilization.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^54eb7545]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Maternal smoking cessation—evidence review conclusions and pediatric provider role indicate that the Expert Panel finds that strong evidence supports a benefit for interventions directed at maternal smoking cessation during pregnancy (Grade A), while weaker evidence suggests these interventions do not prevent relapse postpartum; trials in the postpartum period are limited and suggest that for maternal smoking cessation to be sustained, specific continued support in the pediatric care setting is required, and no smoking cessation interventions reported any adverse effects related to the interventions. The Expert Panel believes that pediatric care providers can play a role in helping mothers remain smoke‑free or quit smoking in the interpregnancy interval, noting that for most women this interval extends to the early first trimester of any subsequent pregnancy, that the pediatric well‑child schedule calls for about 10 visits in the first 2 years of life with the pediatric care provider usually seeing women more than any other health care professional, and that pediatric providers and/or their staffs need to be trained to either deliver or refer to a long‑term maternal smoking cessation program.

### Identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders in the medical home: an algorithm for developmental surveillance and screening [^5dd42560]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Early identification of developmental disorders is critical to the well-being of children and their families. It is an integral function of the primary care medical home and an appropriate responsibility of all pediatric health care professionals. This statement provides an algorithm as a strategy to support health care professionals in developing a pattern and practice for addressing developmental concerns in children from birth through 3 years of age. The authors recommend that developmental surveillance be incorporated at every well-child preventive care visit. Any concerns raised during surveillance should be promptly addressed with standardized developmental screening tests. In addition, screening tests should be administered regularly at the 9-, 18-, and 30-month visits. (Because the 30-month visit is not yet a part of the preventive care system and is often not reimbursable by third-party payers at this time, developmental screening can be performed at 24 months of age. In addition, because the frequency of regular pediatric visits decreases after 24 months of age, a pediatrician who expects that his or her patients will have difficulty attending a 30-month visit should conduct screening during the 24-month visit.) The early identification of developmental problems should lead to further developmental and medical evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment, including early developmental intervention. Children diagnosed with developmental disorders should be identified as children with special health care needs, and chronic-condition management should be initiated. Identification of a developmental disorder and its underlying etiology may also drive a range of treatment planning, from medical treatment of the child to family planning for his or her parents.

### "Are you available for the next 18 months? "-methods and aims of a longitudinal birth cohort study investigating a universal developmental surveillance program: the 'watch Me grow' study [^6369f13a]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Data linkage

It is possible that we will miss some mothers in recruitment for reasons such as: delivery during weekends or public holidays, early discharge following delivery, and refusal to participate in the study. Thus it is important to ascertain the representativeness of the sample that will be recruited. This will be done through data linkage of our cohort with electronic medical records of all the mothers who delivered children during the recruitment period at the two hospitals. We will compare key socio-demographic factors such as age, education level, indigenous background, postcode of residence, country of birth, and languages spoken between the mothers recruited to the project and those who are not recruited.

Similarly, for the prospective cohort component, we will use data linkage to compare the rates of those who attend the 6-, 12-, and 18-month developmental checks from the study participant group with those who are not participants in the study. It is possible that women who agree to participate are more aware of and engaged with health services (including the surveillance program) as compared to those who are not participating in the study. Hence, relationships between various sociodemographic factors and attendance at a 6-, 12-, and 18-month health and/or developmental check with a healthcare professional will also be examined using data linkage with community nurse records. Similarly we will compare key sociodemographic factors for those who drop out of the study as compared to those who continue in the study until their infants reach 18 months of age.

Ethics

Ethical approval to perform the study has been obtained from the University of New South Wales Human Research Ethics Committee.

Promotion of the project

During the recruitment period, clinical and administrative staff will be informed about the study through clinical and research meetings as well as by displaying posters with information about the study on the wards and waiting rooms. A website has also been developed.

Management of project/governance

A Project Management Committee has been established with representatives from each of the partner organisations and quarterly meetings of this committee will provide the forum for strategic oversight, reporting and feedback. Further, a Research Implementation Committee has been formed to oversee the day-to-day operational aspects of the study. Monthly meetings will be held to discuss issues on an ongoing basis for each of the core components of the study, that is, qualitative focus groups, longitudinal follow-up, and 18-month diagnostic test accuracy components. Other stakeholders and national and international experts will be invited to participate in the policy translation phase.

Data elements shared by Pediatric PCPs with WIC nutritionists and vice versa

Given that a series of interactions is expected through the natural progression of well-child visits and WIC appointments, supplemented by the EHL assessments, there are multiple opportunities for care coordination of RP messages that can dynamically evolve with the mother-infant relationship during a rapid developmental period, i.e. the first 6 months of the infant’s life. For example, the EHL data collected at each well-child visit can be used at the following WIC visit by the nutritionist to tailor the RP messages to meet needs of the mother-infant dyad and discuss specific messages from the RP curriculum packets. WIC nutritionists discuss the needs of each mother-infant dyad using the EHL data to discuss specific RP messages from a RP curriculum packet relevant to birth to 3 month infants (to discuss at the infant intake appointment) and an additional packet relevant to 3 to 8 month old infants (to be discussed at approximately the 3 and 6 months WIC appointments).

### Postpartum depression screening: are we doing a competent job? [^8a0410fd]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Paternal depression is estimated to be about 6% with the birth of a child and increases when there is associated PPD in the partner as well. This may also lead to separation from partner, arguments, divorce and unsafe family situations with violence, substance abuse and so on. AAP recommends screening for PPD at 1-month, 2-month and 4-month infant well visits with a standardised developmental scale.Many scales have been validated for depression screen. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends using a validated tool to screen for depression in all adults aged 18 years and older as well as for PPD. It has endorsed the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) as one validated tool for assessing PPD.The EPDS is a 10 question self-reported scale, with translated versions validated in many countries. The AAP has recommended a score of 10 as a cut-off for referral to resources.

### Prevalence and variation of developmental screening and surveillance in early childhood [^2b8edc43]. JAMA Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 12% to 15% of US children experience developmental delays or disabilities, which range in severity and scope from isolated delays in achieving certain developmental milestones to functional impairments in hearing or vision, as well as diagnosable learning, emotional, and behavioral disorders. Early identification and intervention are critical to optimize language, cognitive, motor, and socioemotional development as well as educational success,,, yet only an estimated 10% of children with delays are identified and receive intervention.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) first recommended developmental screening in 2001 and later expanded guidelines in 2006 with an algorithm that included standardized developmental screening at 9-, 18-, and 30-month well-child visits or whenever a parent or clinician expresses concern through ongoing surveillance at every preventive visit, as well as autism-specific screening at 18 and 24 months of age. Subsequent randomized clinical trials of standardized developmental screening relative to surveillance alone and interventions to increase screening have bolstered these recommendations by demonstrating improvements in timely diagnosis, treatment referrals, and early intervention.

During the past decade, there have been several initiatives to improve developmental screening, including the AAP’s Developmental Surveillance and Screening Policy Implementation Project in 17 pediatric practices,Pediatric Improvement Partnerships in 12 states and Washington, DC,, and multiple iterations of the Commonwealth Fund’s Assuring Better Child Development initiative, which supported 26 states, Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico to implement policy and practice changes.Federal campaigns have included the Agency for Children and Family’s “Birth to Five, Watch me Thrive” program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s “Learn the Signs. Act Early” program. Developmental screening was included as a Healthy People 2020 objective,as part of the Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program child core set of quality measures with demonstration grants for 10 states,and, most recently, as a national performance measure for the Title V Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant,with 42 states electing to work toward improvement during the 5-year planning cycle beginning in 2015.

### Assessment of underuse and overuse of screening tests for Co-occurring conditions among children with obesity [^311c38c1]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Well-child visits for children with obesity represent important opportunities for primary care clinicians to ensure AAP-adherent screening is provided, but these visits also represent opportunities to order unnecessary testing. In this cross-sectional study, we used national claims data to identify privately and publicly insured children aged 10 to 18 years who were diagnosed with obesity at well-child visits from December 1, 2018, to November 30, 2019. Among these children, we calculated the proportion with AAP-adherent screening and potentially unnecessary insulin or thyroid testing during the 2 years before to 30 days after the visit. Among children due to receive AAP-recommended screening at visits, we assessed the proportion who received AAP-adherent screening within 30 days and the proportion who received potentially unnecessary insulin or thyroid testing within 30 days, both of which were potential signs of screening that may have been ordered by primary care clinicians. In addition, we compared rates of screening by payer type and assessed whether the tests used to achieve AAP-adherent screening were parsimonious (ie, the minimum number of tests were ordered to achieve AAP-adherent screening) or overly broad (ie, additional potentially unnecessary tests were ordered in conjunction with recommended tests). Findings from this study could inform the content of future guidelines and interventions to improve screening for co-occurring conditions among children with obesity.

### Promoting optimal development: identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through developmental surveillance and screening [^c35e95ac]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Early identification and intervention for developmental disorders are critical to the well-being of children and are the responsibility of pediatric professionals as an integral function of the medical home. This report models a universal system of developmental surveillance and screening for the early identification of conditions that affect children's early and long-term development and achievement, followed by ongoing care. These conditions include autism, deafness/hard-of-hearing, intellectual and motor disabilities, behavioral conditions, and those seen in other medical conditions. Developmental surveillance is supported at every health supervision visit, as is as the administration of standardized screening tests at the 9-, 18-, and 30-month visits. Developmental concerns elicited on surveillance at any visit should be followed by standardized developmental screening testing or direct referral to intervention and specialty medical care. Special attention to surveillance is recommended at the 4- to 5-year well-child visit, prior to entry into elementary education, with screening completed if there are any concerns. Developmental surveillance includes bidirectional communication with early childhood professionals in child care, preschools, Head Start, and other programs, including home visitation and parenting, particularly around developmental screening. The identification of problems should lead to developmental and medical evaluations, diagnosis, counseling, and treatment, in addition to early developmental intervention. Children with diagnosed developmental disorders are identified as having special health care needs, with initiation of chronic condition management in the pediatric medical home.

### The coverage of continuum of care in maternal, newborn and child health: a cross-sectional study of woman-child pairs in Ghana [^76bbe008]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The continuum of care has recently received attention in maternal, newborn and child health. It can be an effective policy framework to ensure that every woman and child receives timely and appropriate services throughout the continuum. However, a commonly used measurement does not evaluate if a pair of woman and child complies with the continuum of care. This study assessed the continuum of care based on two measurements: continuous visits to health facilities (measurement 1) and receiving key components of services (measurement 2). It also explored individual-level and area-level factors associated with the continuum of care achievement and then investigated how the continuum of care differed across areas.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study in Ghana in 2013, the continuum of care achievement and other characteristics of 1401 pairs of randomly selected women and children were collected. Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate the factors associated with the continuum of care and its divergence across 22 areas.

Results

Throughout the pregnancy, delivery and post-delivery stages, 7.9% of women and children achieved the continuum of care through continuous visits to health facilities (measurement 1). Meanwhile, 10.3% achieved the continuum of care by receiving all key components of maternal, newborn and child health services (measurement 2). Only 1.8% of them achieved it under both measurements. Women and children from wealthier households were more likely to achieve the continuum of care under both measurements. Women's education and complications were associated with higher continuum of care services-based achievement. Variance of a random intercept was larger in the continuum of care services-based model than the visit-based model.

Conclusions

Most women and children failed to achieve the continuum of care in maternal, newborn and child health. Those who consistently visited health facilities did not necessarily receive key components of services.

### Incorporating recognition and management of perinatal depression into pediatric practice [^cc635804]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Perinatal depression screening and coverage in pediatric practice—perinatal depression is described as highly prevalent and harmful, and pediatric providers are assigned a key role; coverage policies and recommended screening intervals are specified. “Perinatal depression is the most prevalent ACE and can lead to toxic stress and present challenges to essential early attachments between children and their parents.” With this context, “pediatric providers have a critical role in screening and supporting parents and their infants with concerns for perinatal depression.” “Over the past decade, multiple professional health care and regulatory bodies have recommended routine perinatal depression screening.” “Most recently, both the USPSTF and CMS have reviewed the evidence and have recommended screening consistent with those asserted by the AAP’s Bright Futures: Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents, Fourth Edition.” “These recommendations have encouraged, even mandated, many commercial insurers to pay for screening.” “Medicaid programs are now encouraged to cover and pay for screening for perinatal depression.” The recommendation for maternal depression screening is once during pregnancy and then during the infant’s well visits at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months of age. Despite advocacy, “perinatal depression screening remains far from universal in clinical practice or payment,” and the text calls for improving “collaboration and on transitions of care throughout the perinatal period” and scaling “evidence-based treatments for parents and the parent-infant dyad.”

Analysis Populations

Most analyses, including the primary ones, are modified intent-to-treat at the child level. “Modified” refers to the requirement of an 18-month follow-up visit to determine the child's anthropometric status. Loss to follow-up is anything that prevents a child's 18-month visit from being completed, including pregnancy loss, infant death, refusal for further participation, and a permanent move outside of Zimbabwe. The analyses will be conducted according to the mother's assigned study arm based on her residence at the time of her enrollment, regardless of subsequent migration.

Secondary analyses may require varying levels of contact and/or adherence with a focus on the following modified per-protocol population : 18-month length (and hemoglobin concentration) among those who participated in at least two-thirds (10 of 15) of the VHW visits, starting at 24 gestational weeks (visit defined as having contact at a scheduled visit, with 2 attempts made per visit).

### Visual system assessment in infants, children, and young adults by pediatricians [^d174137a]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement—visual system assessment in infants, children, and young adults—states that examination of the eyes and visual system should begin in the nursery and continue throughout both childhood and adolescence during routine well-child visits in the medical home. Newborn infants should be examined using inspection and red reflex testing to detect structural ocular abnormalities, such as cataract, corneal opacity, and ptosis. Instrument-based screening, if available, should be first attempted between 12 months and 3 years of age and at annual well-child visits until acuity can be tested directly. Direct testing of visual acuity can often begin by 4 years of age, using age-appropriate symbols (optotypes). Children found to have an ocular abnormality or who fail a vision assessment should be referred to a pediatric ophthalmologist or an eye care specialist appropriately trained to treat pediatric patients.

### Impact of a community-based package of interventions on child development in Zambia: a cluster-randomised controlled trial [^ba5be713]. BMJ Global Health (2016). Medium credibility.

Data were collected from two main sources: forms completed by CDAs during household visits, and household surveys conducted at baseline (August/September 2014) and endline (September/October 2015). CDA's visit forms provide key information to track the implementation of the intervention package, including the volume of CDA home visits. Caregiver attendance at group meetings was also assessed during CDA visits by asking caregivers if they attended a meeting during the previous 2 weeks; missing data on meeting attendance were imputed. Household visit forms were developed and administered using the TeleForms system, which enables hand-written text to be translated to computer readable files. The system includes a data verification system, eliminating the need for multiple data entry.Completed forms were collected from CDAs at regular intervals and immediately scanned into a computer database, and these data were quality checked each month.

Outcomes

The primary outcomes were children's physical and cognitive development. Children's height and weight were measured both at baseline and endline using standard anthropometric assessments kits. These data were converted into z-scores using the WHO's Multicentre Growth Standards.Parental reports of child gross motor function and cognition were captured using the Saving Brains Early Child Development Scale. Finally, at the endline study, children were administered the INTERGROWTH-21st NDA tool to assess cognitive and socioemotional development. The NDA is a multidimensional, mixed methodology, screening package that includes components of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, the Rapid Neurodevelopmental Assessment, the Malawi Developmental Assessment, the Griffiths Mental Development Scale and the Child Behavior Checklist. The package includes 53 items: 30 cognitive, language and motor items; 6 behavioural items and 17 items measuring attention and emotional reactivity. It was developed for use in low-resource settings like Zambia, was designed to be simple and easy to administer by trained survey staff, and has recently been validated in several developing countries.

Key secondary outcomes, measured at baseline and endline, included the prevalence of child illness symptoms—fever, diarrhoea and cough—in the previous 2 weeks; child diet in the previous 24 hours and parent–child interactions using the six-item Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey module.A standardised diet diversity score was constructed based on the number of food groups children had consumed the previous day, as an indicator of micronutrient adequacy as per the method described in Steyn et al.Household demographics and asset information, as well as caregiver mental health assessed using the 20-item WHO Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ),were also collected.

### 2017 recommendations for preventive pediatric health care [^fbdf5b4f]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

The 2017 Recommendations for Preventive Pediatric Health Care (Periodicity Schedule) have been approved by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and represents a consensus of AAP and the Bright Futures Periodicity Schedule Workgroup. Each child and family is unique; therefore, these recommendations are designed for the care of children who are receiving competent parenting, have no manifestations of any important health problems, and are growing and developing in a satisfactory fashion. Developmental, psychosocial, and chronic disease issues for children and adolescents may require frequent counseling and treatment visits separate from preventive care visits. Additional visits also may become necessary if circumstances suggest variations from normal.

### Fluoride use in caries prevention in the primary care setting [^ec9a84d7]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Suggestions for pediatricians—risk assessment, toothpaste dosing, fluoride varnish, water fluoride, and advocacy are outlined: Pediatricians should perform oral health risk assessments on all children at every routine well-child visit beginning at 6 months of age. Recommend use of fluoridated toothpaste starting at the eruption of the first tooth, with a smear or grain of rice sized amount recommended for children younger than 3 years, and a pea-sized amount appropriate for most children starting at 3 years of age. Apply fluoride varnish according to the periodicity schedule and bill using the CPT code 99188; fluoride varnish is a proven tool in early childhood caries prevention. Know how to determine the concentration of fluoride in a child's primary drinking water and determine the need for systemic supplements, and advocate for water fluoridation in your local community.

### Promoting optimal development: identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through developmental surveillance and screening [^d732855f]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Developmental screening schedule and surveillance—validated instruments and additional screening are specified. The text states that “Including developmental screening tests at targeted ages enhances the precision of the developmental surveillance process” and that “The recommended ages for developmental screening at the health supervision visit are a starting point for children who are without known identified risks and are not suspected of having a developmental concern.” Because surveillance has limits, it adds that “periodic screening with a validated instrument should occur” and specifies “Using a validated developmental screening test at the 9-, 18-, and 30-month visits is outlined in Bright Futures, Fourth Edition.” Ongoing monitoring is emphasized: “Developmental surveillance should continue through childhood, including surveillance at the 4- or 5-year visit as a child prepares to enter elementary school.” It also notes that “Any time that parents, professionals, or others involved in the care of the child raise concerns during surveillance, it is appropriate to perform additional developmental screens using validated tests.”

### A directed content analysis of discussions between mothers and pediatricians around feeding and growth topics during infant well-child visits [^b724326c]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

With limited time and a wealth of information to deliver, pediatricians must prioritize content delivery based on clinical expertise and patient needs.The information pediatricians prioritize may not cover all topics that parents desire guidance around.Currently, it is unclear who initiates discussions around each topic and how initiations change over time, which could be used to inform improvements to health care delivery by identifying common parent questions/concerns, uncover which topics are discussed infrequently or overlooked, and inform additional resources to address topics not sufficiently discussed during visits.

The aim of this study was to identify specific content discussed related to infant feeding and growth during well-child visits across the first 6 months of life. Well-child visits were audio-recorded to capture naturally occurring conversations between mothers and pediatricians. Conversations were characterized as pediatrician-initiated guidance, mother-initiated questions/concerns, or general updates to better understand the nuance of guidance delivered. The aims were to identify: (1) which specific topics around feeding and growth were discussed at 2-, 4-, and 6-month well-child visits, (2) the extent to which mothers and pediatricians initiated these conversations, and (3) mother’s and pediatrician’s perceptions of the guidance provided.

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^ee7c1a9b]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Pediatrics esotropia—follow-up evaluation guidance notes ongoing risk and monitoring intervals. It states “Periodic evaluations necessary because of high risk of developing amblyopia, losing binocular vision, and having a recurrence of strabismus,” and that “Children who are well-aligned and do not have amblyopia may be followed up every 6 to 12 months.” The “Frequency of follow-up visits can be reduced as the child matures,” though “New or changing findings may indicate need for more frequent follow-up examinations.” In recurrences, “Detection of uncorrected or undercorrected hyperopia is essential in the child with a recurrence of esotropia after successful initial treatment,” and “Repeat cycloplegic refraction should be performed before concluding that the esotropia has a nonaccommodative component.”

### The bright futures training intervention project: implementing systems to support preventive and developmental services in practice [^a9d3ee4c]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of this study were to assess the feasibility of implementing a bundle of strategies to facilitate the use of Bright Futures recommendations and to evaluate the effectiveness of a modified learning collaborative in improving preventive and developmental care.

Methods

Fifteen pediatric primary care practices from 9 states participated in a 9-month learning collaborative. Support to practices included a toolkit, 2 workshops, training in quality-improvement methods, monthly conference calls and data feedback, and a listserv moderated by faculty. Aggregated medical chart reviews and practice self-assessments on 6 key office system components were compared before and after the intervention.

Results

Office system changes most frequently adopted were use of recall/reminder systems (87%), a checklist to link to community resources (80%), and systematic identification of children with special health care needs (80%). From baseline to follow-up, increases were observed in the use of recall/reminder systems, the proportion of children's charts that had a preventive services prompting system, and the families who were asked about special health care needs. Of 21 possible office system components, the median number used increased from 10 to 15. Comparing scores between baseline and follow-up for each practice site, the change was significant. Teams reported that the implementation of office systems was facilitated by the perception that a component could be applied quickly and/or easily. Barriers to implementation included costs, the time required, and lack of agreement with the recommendations.

Conclusions

This project demonstrated the feasibility of implementing specific strategies for improving preventive and developmental care for young children in a wide variety of practices. It also confirmed the usefulness of a modified learning collaborative in achieving these results. This model may be useful for disseminating office system improvements to other settings that provide care for young children.

### Pediatricians' assessments of caries risk and need for a dental evaluation in preschool aged children [^2d31a24a]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Risk-based prioritization of dental referrals during well-child visits might improve dental access for infants and toddlers. This study identifies pediatrician-assessed risk factors for early childhood caries (ECC) and their association with the need for a dentist's evaluation.

Methods

A priority oral health risk assessment and referral tool (PORRT) for children < 36 months was developed collaboratively by physicians and dentists and used by 10 pediatricians during well-child visits. PORRT documented behavioral, clinical, and child health risks for ECC. Pediatricians also assessed overall ECC risk on an 11-point scale and determined the need for a dental evaluation. Logistic regression models calculated the odds for evaluation need for each risk factor and according to a 3-level risk classification.

Results

In total 1,288 PORRT forms were completed; 6.8% of children were identified as needing a dentist evaluation. Behavioral risk factors were prevalent but not strong predictors of the need for an evaluation. The child's overall caries risk was the strongest predictor of the need for an evaluation. Cavitated (OR = 17.5; 95% CI = 8.08, 37.97) and non-cavitated (OR = 6.9; 95% CI = 4.47, 10.82) lesions were the strongest predictors when the caries risk scale was excluded from the analysis. Few patients (6.3%) were classified as high risk, but their probability of needing an evaluation was only 0.36.

Conclusions

Low referral rates for children with disease and prior to disease onset but at elevated risk, indicate interventions are needed to help improve the dental referral rates of physicians.
