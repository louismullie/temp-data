## Question

10. Place 2 different English books, 4 different German books, and 3 different Chinese books on the same shelf of a bookcase. If books of the same language are adjacent, there are   different ways to arrange them.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many different ways there are to arrange 2 English, 4 German, and 3 Chinese books on a shelf, with the condition that books of the same language must be adjacent. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about treating each language group as a single block and arranging those blocks. Then, I should verify how to arrange the books within each language block. Next, I will multiply the block arrangements by the internal arrangements to get the total. Finally, I should double-check the arithmetic and make sure I'm not missing any constraints or overcounting anything.

> Let me first confirm the core idea: when books of the same language must be adjacent, I can treat each language as a single "super-book" or block, so the problem reduces to arranging 3 blocks (English, German, Chinese) on the shelf, and then arranging the individual books inside each block. This is a standard permutation-within-blocks approach, and I should verify that this framing captures the constraint correctly, which it does because adjacency is enforced by the block structure.

> I will now examine the block-level arrangement. There are 3 distinct language blocks, so the number of ways to order these blocks is 3 factorial, which is 3 × 2 × 1 = 6. Wait, let me verify that I'm not conflating blocks with books; yes, here the blocks are the units being permuted, so 3! is correct for the ordering of languages on the shelf.

> Next, I should review the internal arrangements within each block. For the English block, there are 2 different books, so they can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways. For the German block, there are 4 different books, so 4! = 24 ways. For the Chinese block, there are 3 different books, so 3! = 6 ways. Hold on, I should verify that I'm using factorials correctly for distinct items; yes, for n distinct objects, n! gives the number of permutations, so these internal counts are correct.

> Now, I need to multiply the block arrangements by the internal arrangements to get the total number of valid shelf arrangements. Total = (ways to arrange blocks) × (ways to arrange English) × (ways to arrange German) × (ways to arrange Chinese) = 6 × 2 × 24 × 6. Let me calculate that step-by-step: 6 × 2 = 12, 12 × 24 = 288, and 288 × 6 = 1,728. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought 288 × 6 might be 1,738, but that's off by 10; 288 × 6 is indeed 1,728, so I should correct that mental slip now.

> Final answer: 1,728 different ways to arrange the books under the adjacency constraint. I should double-check that I've accounted for all constraints and not introduced any extra assumptions; the solution treats languages as indivisible blocks for ordering and then permutes distinct books within each block, which matches the problem statement precisely, so the result should be correct.

---

The number of ways to arrange 2 English, 4 German, and 3 Chinese books on a shelf, with books of the same language adjacent, is **1,728**. This is calculated by treating each language group as a single block (3! ways to arrange the blocks), then arranging the books within each block: 2! for English, 4! for German, and 3! for Chinese. The total is 3! × 2! × 4! × 3! = 6 × 2 × 24 × 6 = **1,728**.

---

## Step-by-step solution

### Step 1: Treat each language group as a single block

Because books of the same language must be adjacent, we can treat each language group as a single "block". This reduces the problem to arranging **3 blocks** (English, German, Chinese) on the shelf.

---

### Step 2: Arrange the language blocks

The number of ways to arrange 3 distinct blocks is given by the factorial of 3:

3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6

---

### Step 3: Arrange books within each language block

Within each block, the books are distinct and can be arranged among themselves:

- **English books**: 2! = 2 × 1 = 2 ways
- **German books**: 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 ways
- **Chinese books**: 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways

---

### Step 4: Multiply the arrangements

The total number of arrangements is the product of the block arrangements and the internal arrangements within each block:

Total arrangements = 3! × 2! × 4! × 3! = 6 × 2 × 24 × 6 = 1,728

---

## Final answer

There are **1,728** different ways to arrange the books on the shelf under the given conditions.

### Translation and cultural adaptation of tools to assess diverse Asian American and Asian Canadian subgroups: the Asian cohort for Alzheimer's disease (ACAD) study [^a1c40c10]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Most cognitive assessment instruments were originally developed for use in populations of European ancestry with English as the primary language and culture. Therefore, we conducted literal translations of the test questions and then made adaptations that appropriately reflected the sociocultural background of our Asian languages. In the context of cultural adaptation, it is important to address how the structure of a language influences the way in which speakers of the language view the world. For example, most Asian languages are analytic and thus do not possess inflection morphology for nouns (e.g. foot — feet, book — books with plurality). For example, the host at a restaurant asks the guest, "For seating, how many are there in your party?" An English speaker can reply simply, "Two", but in Asian languages, the response would be "two people". Our findings have reinforced the need to culturally adapt the existing cognitive assessments to be an optimized approach for different languages and cultural contexts.

### The "Adjacent possible" and cardiac innovation [^8a237f95]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

"The adjacent possible is a kind of shadow future, hovering on the edges of the present state of things, a map of all the ways in which the present can reinvent itself".

The "adjacent possible" is a concept first introduced in evolutionary biology and complex adaptive systems by Dr Stuart Kauffman and subsequently popularized by Steven Johnson in his book "Where good ideas come from: The Natural History of Innovation". The concept proposes that the development of complex systems, in nature, culture, science, or technology, occurs by incremental changes based on sets of possible options. Each incremental change leads to new possibilities for future innovations.

In his book, Steven Johnson provides examples of the evolution and the limits of the adjacent possible. In prebiotic earth, he explains, carbon atoms could not spontaneously arrange themselves into complex life forms like a sunflower. They first had to arrange themselves into simpler structures like molecules, proteins, and cells. These first-order combinations are termed "the adjacent possible", and each step forward results in new possibilities, until, eventually, a carbon atom can become part of a more complex structure like a sunflower. However, great leaps beyond the adjacent possible will often fail because the environment is simply not ready. Steven Johnson explains how YouTube would have failed if launched in the 1990s as fast internet connections for downloading videos and software programs for viewing videos were not available on home computers. Similarly, had left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) devices been introduced in the 1990s, they would have likely flopped as device technology, interventional skillsets, cardiac imaging, and the cardiology community in general were not there yet.

### Literacy promotion: an essential component of primary care pediatric practice: technical report [^3c8d4428]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Clinic-based literacy promotion programs — language- and culture-responsive implementation in pediatric primary care emphasizes that families whose home language is not English face additional barriers, and parents should be encouraged and supported to read and tell stories with their children in the languages in which they are most comfortable, with books that support storytelling traditions. Programs need a robust and diverse supply of books to be given to children, with attention to the languages spoken by the clinic population, and, if necessary, wordless books to stimulate storytelling when the correct language is not available. A clinic can also provide multicultural book-related materials in the primary care setting, including used books in the waiting room as well as posters and book-related displays. All parents should be encouraged to look at books with their children in ways that feel most comfortable and natural to them, and because the goal is to support parental strengths and parental voices, the right language is essential. This approach helps children's language development in ways relevant for later classroom learning, strengthens early relational health, can help maintain children's proficiency in their families' primary languages, and may help families build identity and cultural pride. The availability of high-quality and truly diverse books is an essential component of a clinic-based literacy promotion program and is directly tied to the likelihood that parents will continue reading with their children on a regular basis.

### The pregnancy experiences and antenatal care services of Chinese migrants in Switzerland: a qualitative study [^f266b35f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

4 Strategies to deal with the inconveniences of accessing Swiss maternity care services To overcome the inconveniences of accessing Swiss maternity care services, Chinese mothers in this study explored alternative ways to obtain information and assistance in communication with their maternity care providers. 4.1 Strategies ways of information seeking Chinese mothers reported that they turned to websites, mobile applications, and books in Chinese when they could not gain essential knowledge and information on pregnancy and childbirth from their maternity care providers. In addition, some mothers shared that it was beneficial for them to exchange pregnancy experiences with other Chinese mothers and obtain information guidelines on their personalized needs. The knowledge and support they received through these channels were perceived to meet their information needs and largely addressed their concerns. "Mainly from Chinese websites. Some Chinese mothers also told me their experiences and knowledge. Based on the information they told me, and then I searched online and checked it by myself". (06-M) However, the reliance on the native language for information seeking sometimes further discouraged Chinese mothers from seeking essential local medical information. Some mothers in this study indeed reported that they could not understand the healthcare system and medical procedures within the Swiss healthcare system. "We didn't understand healthcare system and medical procedures here". (07-M) 4.2 Communication assistance To overcome communication difficulties, some mothers used translation services, with mixed outcomes. One mother reported that she appreciated the free-of-charge Chinese translation services for prenatal courses and important consultations with her obstetrician at a French-speaking university hospital. However, another mother shared that she did not use the translation services at a German-speaking university hospital. She explained that the multi-lingual midwife who served as the translator could not correctly understand her. "We didn't use it. It's not a professional translation service. They just found a midwife with multiple language skills responsible for taking care of the mothers who speak languages like French, German, English, Spanish" (05-M) Alternative measures included introducing assistance from women's husbands with accessing maternity care services and communicating with maternity care providers. This was often largely due to the more advanced English or local language skills of women's husbands. Fathers in this study also confirmed that when there was no professional assistance, they were the ones who could be relied on for language assistance. "When my wife was pregnant, I was basically in charge of all things, such as booking appointments and communicating with the doctors". (01-FM)

### How to write a systematic review of reasons [^3b459acb]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2012). Low credibility.

Identify all of the literature that meets the eligibility criteria

Databases and search techniques should be selected with the aim of retrieving all available literature meeting the eligibility criteria.

We used databases in science/medicine (Medline, LocatorPlus), law (Westlaw International) and ethics (ETHXWeb, JSTOR, Euroethics, Endebit) and thesis databases (Ethos-Beta Electronic Theses Online Service, WorldCat Dissertations). We recommend that, as in our review's case, the choice of databases should be guided by experts such as reference librarians.

Database-specific search strings will be needed. For each database, the controlled vocabulary (eg, Medline's MeSH terms) should first be examined to determine whether it contains the review question's keywords, for example, (in our case) PTA. If not, the use of non-controlled vocabulary will be necessary: one should identify some publications that meet the eligibility criteria; then, one should identify the database-specific controlled vocabulary used to index these publications, and keywords relevant to the review question, for example, "post-trial follow-up", and classify the resulting terms by content. Often a mixture of controlled and non-controlled vocabulary can help to adjust the sensitivity and specificity of search strings. One should next join terms in the same content class by 'OR' and all (alternatively, some) of the resulting strings by 'AND' to form database-specific search strings. (Table 1, gives key strings that we used to search Medline; see also reference). One should also: search as systematically as possible for relevant reports and books, hand-search their tables of contents and indexes, and examine the in-text references, footnotes and bibliographies of qualifying publications for further publications that possibly meet the eligibility criteria. The contents of electronic books can already be searched systematically and quickly by the search functions of PDF software. Further research is needed to construct systematic and efficient searches for books and within print-only books. Technologies such as the optical character recognition used, for example, by Google Books could provide further opportunities to search content within books systematically; the way in which an electronic book has been prepared greatly affects its searchability.

China — availability and quality of medical care — Strongly encourage travelers to invest in travel health insurance, including medical evacuation insurance coverage; many hospitals do not accept foreign medical insurance and patients are expected to pay a deposit to cover the anticipated cost of treatment before care is delivered, with many major cities including Beijing, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Shenzhen having medical facilities that meet international standards, hospitals in other cities might have "VIP wards" with English-speaking staff, the standard of care in some facilities is somewhat unpredictable and cultural and regulatory differences can cause difficulties, and in rural areas rudimentary medical care might be all that is available.

Health communication with RIM communities — plain language states that plain language is an important component of high-quality health communication materials, and the Plain Language Act requires federal agencies to use clear communication that the general public can understand and use. Common techniques include using "you" and other pronouns, using active voice rather than passive voice, writing in short sentences and paragraphs, avoiding jargon by using common words, and including layouts such as lists, headers, and tables. By using plain language, all patients can better understand health communications and make informed decisions about their healthcare needs, which benefits people who communicate in English as well as those who use other languages and makes English-language materials easier to translate into other languages.

Photographs in telemedicine — advice for travelers — emphasizes capturing key lesion features, including distribution, configuration and arrangement of lesions with respect to one another, a primary lesion, and lesions with secondary changes; if several lesions are present or if the lesion is subtle, highlight the specific lesion with a marking pen or (for digital images) editing software, and take pictures in a well-lit room or outdoors in a shaded area. High-quality image set-up includes an orientation view showing the entire body or affected body part with the lesion's location obvious, a mid-distance view centered on the lesion with an anatomical landmark for orientation and size, and a close-up view that can be physically close (under 18 inches) using the camera's macro function or from farther away if using a zoom lens; ensure the lesion is in the center and fills most of the frame with some normal skin, include a scale or size comparison using a ruler, measuring tape, or a standard object like a pencil, paper clip, or US coin, and take as many pictures as necessary and send sharply focused, well-lit photos only because blurry pictures are not helpful.

### Network structure influences the strength of learned neural representations [^3f737ddc]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Humans deftly learn the networks of interactions underlying complex phenomena such as language or music. Behavioral and neural evidence demonstrates that the way we learn and represent stimuli is modulated by the temporal structure in which we experience those stimuli. Moreover, recent studies indicate that humans may learn to represent the interaction network itself. For example, when stimuli are grouped into clusters, a phenomena commonly observed in natural settings, learner response times to those stimuli are modulated by whether adjacent stimuli are situated in the same cluster, even when all transition probabilities (and thus predictive information) are held constant. This effect is shown to be robust to types of stimuliand significant topological variation. Moreover, learners respond more swiftly to a sequence drawn from a topology with such clusters compared to a topology without such clusters. Collectively, these findings suggest that humans can learn properties of graph structure such as modular organization, and can leverage that structure to create more effective predictions. Converging neuroimaging evidence suggests that neural representations of stimuli encode properties of the interaction networks, including cluster identityand graph distance between items. To date, however, it remains unclear how such graph-induced representation structure differs when the same elements are arranged in a distinct organizational pattern.

### App-based learning for kindergarten children at home (learning4Kids): study protocol for cohort 1 and the kindergarten assessments [^d714d820]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Parental survey

As with the Plain Language Statements, parental surveys were provided in several languages addressing families with various migration and language backgrounds (see above). Parents were asked questions on the family background, children's characteristics and the HLE. The focus lay on various aspects of the HLE and the first part assessed the home literacy environment with items on linguistic activities and literacy exposure of the study child at home (example items: "how many books do you have at home", "how often is your child read to"). In the next part of the survey, parents were asked questions about the home numeracy environment (example items: "How often do you play games with your child that require him or her to count?", "How often does your child participate in counting or measuring ingredients when cooking?"). In addition, two checklists were used to get further insight into the home literacy and numeracy environment. Here, a German book title recognition test for children's books (TRT) and a German mathematical game titles recognition test (MTRT) were applied. Selected titles of children's books and math games were mixed with fake book and game titles to objectively assess parents' knowledge on these books and games.

Further, parents' expectations for their child's future school education (example item: "The education of my child in school is important to me"), children's and parents' media usage (example item: "Do you have learning apps/games for children on your tablet/smartphone? How often are these used?"), attitudes towards digital media (example item: "Digital media for preschool children are important"), and children's and parental media literacy (example item: "How would you rate your ability to find appropriate media content for children?") were assessed. Finally, parents were asked about the family background. Here, items on migration background, SES including the educational and occupational background of both parents and the family income, and on learning disabilities in the family had to be answered (see Table 2).

Working with professional medical interpreters — definition, access, and best practices — notes that "Medical interpretation is the accurate, complete, and objective transmission of oral messages between healthcare professionals and patients who do not share a language. This can be done in person, by phone, or via video", and that "Working effectively with professionally trained medical interpreters is a skill set required for timely and effective communication that can minimize poor health outcomes". Directives include "Provide patients with professional interpretation services even if they have a friend or family member with them who can help communicate. Never use a child as an interpreter", "Make patients aware of their right to professional medical interpreters free of charge with the assurance of confidentiality in the healthcare encounter", and "Always confirm the language and dialect when arranging for an interpreter". Additional practices are "Prepare for extra time. Interpreted encounters tend to take more time than when the healthcare professional and patient speak the same language. Remember that each statement is uttered twice through interpretation, and clarification may be needed", "Allow interpreters to introduce themselves and explain their role in a brief statement to both patient and provider", and "Consider creating specific resources, like glossaries, to improve cross-cultural communication of standardized health terms through a rigorous translation and cultural validation process".

### Rapid reviews methods series: guidance on literature search [^ce2b330b]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Limits and restrictions

Limits and restrictions (eg, publication dates, language) are another way to reduce the number of records retrieved but should be tailored to the topic and applied with caution. For example, if most studies about an intervention were published 10 years ago, then an arbitrary cut-off of 'the last 5 years' will miss many relevant studies. Similarly, limiting to 'English only' is acceptable for most cases, but early in the COVID-19 pandemic, a quarter of available research articles were written in Chinese. Depending on the RR topic, certain document types (eg, conference abstracts, dissertations) might be excluded if not considered relevant to the research question.

Note also that preset limiting functions in search interfaces (eg, limit to humans) often rely on subject headings (eg, MeSH) alone. They will miss eligible studies that lack or have incomplete subject indexing. Using (validated) search filters is preferable.

Updating existing reviews

One approach to RR production involves updating an existing SR. In this case, preliminary searches should be used to check if new evidence is available. If the review team decide to update the review, they should assess the original search methods and adapt these as necessary.

One option is to identify the minimum set of databases required to retrieve all the original included studies. Any reused search strategies should be validated and peer-reviewed (see below) and optimised for precision and/or sensitivity.

Additionally, it is important to assess whether the topic terminology or the relevant databases have changed since the original SR search.

In some cases, designing a new search process may be more efficient than reproducing the original search.

Clinical encounters — identifying language preferences for refugees, immigrants, and migrants — emphasize that "Providing language services for effective communication with healthcare professionals minimizes the potential for miscommunication about important information needed for diagnosis and to communicate treatment recommendations to patients". The guidance includes "Ask patients about their written and spoken language preferences and document this in their medical records so you can offer appropriate translation and interpretation services every time", and "Approach patients from RIM communities without assumptions about their level of health literacy or their comfort with and knowledge about US health care, regardless of their English-language proficiency, race, ethnicity, or education level". It advises that "When the patient is a child, the language needs of the caregivers should be determined. Avoid assumptions about English proficiency based solely on duration in the United States. Consider asking the following questions:" including "How well do you speak English? (Not at all / Not well / Well / Very well)", "In what language would you prefer to speak to your healthcare professional?", "In what language would you prefer to receive written health information?", and "Would you like to use a medical interpreter for today's visit?"

### Graphs, tables, and figures in scientific publications: the good, the bad, and how not to be the latter [^a3a1cb03]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Graphs, figures, and tables can save readers time and energy, aid their understanding of an article, and reduce the word count of the main text. However, many graphics submitted to and published in scientific journals fail to meet their potential and include mistakes that jeopardize their clarity. Many formats are available for presenting data, as well as a variety of techniques for enhancing interpretability. When the appropriate format is used to depict data, it conveys the greatest amount of information in the clearest fashion, complements the text, and deepens readers' understanding. The aims of this article are to draw attention to the necessity of well-constructed graphs, tables, and figures in scientific publications, and to show how to create them.

### Shared picture Book reading interventions for child language development: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1ee72b89]. Child Development (2020). Medium credibility.

Interventions that train parents to share picture books with children are seen as a strategy for supporting child language development. We conducted meta-analyses using robust variance estimation modeling on results from 19 RCTs (N total = 2,594; M childage = 1–6 years). Overall, book-sharing interventions had a small sized effect on both expressive language (d = 0.41) and receptive language (d = 0.26). They had a large effect on caregiver book-sharing competence (d = 1.01). The impact of the intervention on child language was moderated by intervention dosage, with lower dosage associated with a minimal impact. Child age and caregiver education level were unrelated to child outcome. This review and meta-analysis confirms the promise of book-sharing interventions for enhancing and accelerating child language development.

### When I use a word… The precautionary principle: a brief history [^431153a7]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Two ideas precede the modern Precautionary Principle. First, that prevention is better than cure, exemplified by an aphorism in an early 13th century book of Jewish aphorisms, the Sefer Hasidim: "Who is a skilled physician? He who can prevent sickness". Secondly, Thomas Sydenham's 17th century assertion that in healthcare it is important above all not to do harm, "primum est ut non nocere". These two ideas come together in the Vorsorgeprinzip, which was incorporated into German legislation for maintaining clean air in the 1960s and 1970s, and first appeared in English-language documents in 1982, which referred to taking a precautionary approach or precautionary measures, or more formally as the Precautionary Principle. The principle features in international documents such as the Rio Declaration and in many pieces of EU legislation relating to topics as diverse as genetically modified organisms, food safety, the safety of toys, and invasion of alien species of animals, plants, fungi, or microorganisms.

### Changes in semantic memory structure support successful problem-solving and analogical transfer [^5231072f]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In our daily life, we constantly deal with problems, ranging from the most mundane (e.g. what to cook for dinner given the ingredients at our disposal), to professional activities (e.g. how to reorganize our current plans to meet a new deadline), up to major societal challenges (e.g. how to find innovative solutions against global warming). How do we find new solutions to problems? While the ability to solve problems is a critical skill for adapting to new situations and innovating, the mechanisms underlying the problem-solving process remain largely unknown.

Among the new problems we face each day, some are well-defined (e.g. playing a jigsaw puzzle). The initial state (i.e. the number of independent pieces) and goal state (i.e. assembling the pieces so it looks like the picture model) are clear, and the solver can apply a set of operations (i.e. interlocking the pieces as a function of their shape) to reach the goal. However, for many of our problems (e.g. organizing work activities during the COVID-19 pandemic), the problem space is ambiguous. No heuristics or existing rules could be applied to transform the initial state into the goal state. Such "ill-defined" problemsthus require additional mental processes, which have been tightly linked to creative thinking –. Ill-defined problem-solving (or creative problem-solving) is often referred to as insight solving, where the solution comes to mind suddenly and effortlessly, with a "Eureka" phenomenon –. According to the Representational Change Theory, solving such problems involves restructuring the initial problem mental representational space, which presumably entails combining elements related to the problem in a new way. In theory, restructuring allows one to change perspective, reframe the problem, or escape its implicitly imposed constraints, leading to creative associations. For instance, consider the following problem: "A man walks into a bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender points a shotgun at the man. The man says, 'Thank you', and walks out". The problem is ill-defined because the path to finding the solution is to be discovered, and the goal state is vague. Solving this problem first requires asking the right question: in which context would a shotgun and a glass of water help somebody? Rather than relying on obvious associations (e.g. a glass of water is related to thirst), solvers must fill the missing link between the relevant elements of the problem (a shotgun induces fear, and fear can be a remedy for hiccups, as can drinking a glass of water). Hence, restructuring the initial representation of a given problem would allow one to see this link and find its solution.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

Health literacy — developing written materials for patients — Develop written materials, keep the messages simple, and limit the number of messages (the general guideline is four main messages). Focus on action with specific recommendations based on behavior (eg, "Take a warm-water bath two times a day"). Use the active voice instead of the passive voice, use familiar language and avoid jargon, and use visual aids, such as drawings or models, for key points. Use at least a 12-point type size to make the messages easy to read and leave plenty of white space around margins and between sections.

Share/STEP approach for caregiver–infant book sharing — caregivers are guided to Snuggle on the parent or caregiver's lap, Let the baby hold and/or explore the book, Show Affection during story reading, Respond to what the baby does or says, and Enjoy the process that is right for you and your baby. Suggested Ways to Respond (STEP) include Stretch word sounds (ie, child-directed Speech), Talk about pictures in the book, Explore word sounds in fun ways, and Be Patient, as reading during infancy is often messy. Examples include Snuggle on lap so child can see and touch the book to encourage engagement.

### How to write an abstract that will be accepted for presentation at a national meeting [^1da476f7]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

Preparation, submission, and presentation of an abstract are important facets of the research process, which benefit the investigator/author in several ways. Writing an abstract consists primarily of answering the questions, "Why did you start?" "What did you do?" "What did you find?" and "What does it mean?" A few practical steps in preparing to write the abstract can facilitate the process. This article discusses those steps and offers suggestions for writing each of an abstract's components (title, author list, introduction, methods, results, and conclusions); considers the advantages and disadvantages of incorporating a table or figure into the abstract; offers several general writing tips; and provides annotated examples of well-prepared abstracts: one from an original study, one from a method/device evaluation, and one from a case report.

### App-based learning for kindergarten children at home (learning4Kids): study protocol for cohort 2 and the school assessments [^639f1ac6]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Parental survey

As with the Plain Language Statements, parental surveys were provided in several languages addressing families with various migration and language backgrounds (see above). Parents were asked questions on their family background, children's characteristics, children's and parents' media competencies and media usage at home, and the HLE. Here, the focus lies for all assessments on various aspects of the HLE, including questions on informal and formal parent-child interactions that support children's literacy and mathematical learning as well as parental attitudes towards reading (e.g. "reading is an important activity in our home") and mathematics (e.g. "mathematics is considered important in our home").

In addition, two checklists were used to get further insight into the home literacy and numeracy environment. Here, a German book title recognition test for children's books (TRT-VS) and a German mathematical game titles recognition test (TRT-Mathe-K) were applied. In these checklists, selected titles of children's books and math games were mixed with fake book and game titles to objectively assess parents' knowledge of these books and games.

Further, parents' expectations for their child's future school education (example item: "The education of my child in school is important to me"), children's and parents' media usage (example item: "Do you have learning apps/games for children on your tablet/smartphone? How often are these used?"), attitudes towards digital media (example item: "Digital media for preschool children are important"), and children's and parental media literacy (example item: "How would you rate your ability to find appropriate media content for children?") were assessed at t1 and will be assessed throughout the project. Once children enter school, parents will also be surveyed about their children's school experience (e.g. "my child likes to attend school"), about the homework situation (e.g. "I explain a task to my child, if he or she does not understand it"), and about parental school involvement (e.g. "I participate in parents' evenings at my child's school").

### Assessment of language and indexing biases among Chinese-Sponsored randomized clinical trials [^49b81d0b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Indexing Bias

As the primary source for systematic reviewers, English bibliographic databases may index some non–English-language literature, but they vary in the amount and scope. The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews and the United States Institute of Medicine Guidelines for Systematic Reviews have recommended including non–English-language literature indexed in English bibliographic databases. Including non–English-language trials indexed in English bibliographic databases may not eliminate the effect of language bias but could reduce it to the scope of indexing bias.

To date, English bibliographic databases do not represent the Chinese-language literature. This is problematic because an ongoing study shows more than 10 000 clinical trials have been published out of China in 2016 (Y.J. Jun Liang, J.W. et al; unpublished data; June 2020). However, Embase only indexes 80 Chinese-language journals. Although we did not simulate actual systematic reviews, it appears plausible that, owing to language and indexing bias, drug interventions might appear more positive than they are when existing evidence is synthesized, for example in systematic reviews.

How to Eliminate the Effect of Language Bias Regarding CS-RCTs

The effect of language bias regarding CS-RCTs might be eliminated if reviews comprehensively searched Chinese bibliographic databases, if major English bibliographic databases would index all Chinese-language literature, or if all CS-RCTs would be appropriately registered with results. There are, however, layers of complexity that warrant appreciation. There has been a discussion as to whether scientists should search Chinese bibliographic databases when conducting systematic reviews. Our study tipped the scales in this proposition's direction: including Chinese-language literature may reduce bias and shrink the CIs of the estimates. Currently, the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions only recommends searching Chinese bibliographic databases for topics related to complementary medicine or Chinese medicine, but our results suggest that it might be prudent to expand recommendations to studies on drug interventions as well.

The reporting quality of Chinese CS-RCTs was low, which some may argue is a reason to not use Chinese CS-RCTs in systematic reviews. However, reporting quality may not completely represent the actual scientific quality. One study found no difference between one systematic review mainly using English-language trials and another mainly using Chinese-language trials on the same topic. It is the researchers' decision to include or not include those trials (ie, trials published in Chinese and/or indexed in Chinese bibliographic databases) based on reporting quality, but it might be too simplistic to just ignore them.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 11 popular destinations [^297b160f]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Availability and quality of medical care — China advises travelers on planning for care access. Strongly encourage travelers to invest in travel health insurance, including medical evacuation insurance coverage. Many hospitals do not accept foreign medical insurance, and patients are expected to pay a deposit to cover the anticipated cost of treatment before care is delivered. Many major cities, including Beijing, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, have medical facilities that meet international standards, and hospitals in other cities might have "VIP wards" (gaogan bingfang) with English-speaking staff. The standard of care in smaller facilities is somewhat unpredictable, and cultural and regulatory differences can cause difficulties for travelers; in rural areas, rudimentary medical care might be all that is available.

### Effective use of tables and figures in abstracts, presentations, and papers [^9d553efc]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

In some situations, tables, graphs, and figures can present certain types of information (including complicated relationships and sequences of events) more clearly and in less space than the same information would require in sentence form. However, do not use tables, graphs, and figures for small amounts of data that could be conveyed clearly and succinctly in a sentence. Also, do not reiterate in sentences the data that are shown in a table, graph, or figure: the point of creating a table or graph or figure is to eliminate that type of sentence from your manuscript. In building a data table you must balance the necessity that the table be complete with the equally important necessity that it not be too complex. Sometimes it is helpful to break a large table into several smaller ones to allow the reader to identify important information easily, but, conversely, it is a common mistake of novice authors to split up into several tables data that belong in one table. In almost all cases, only one table or graph or figure should be included in an abstract, and then only if it can convey essential information in less space and in a more easily interpretable way than the sentence form. For a poster, in almost all instances you should use only one typeface and one font in a table, graph, or figure. In general, do not use bold, italics, or color unless you are presenting a great deal of data and you need to highlight certain data values and you are certain that using bold, italics, or color will improve readability, which is rare. Do not include identical information in a table and a graph/figure. In reporting a clinical trial you will need to include a patient flow chart that identifies the number of patients initially screened for the study, the number of patients who were excluded (and why) after initial screening or in the final analysis, and how many patients entered, exited early, and completed each arm of the study. A treatment protocol should also be described with a flow chart. In preparing a graph the most common error is to include a line that suggests an unsubstantiated extrapolation between or beyond the data points. In selecting the graph's axes, avoid truncating, enlarging, or compressing the axes in ways that might make the graph confusing or misleading. To prepare clear, accurate, easily interpretable tables, graphs, and figures, rely on the rules described in authoritative guides such as the Council of Science Editors' Scientific Style and Format and the American Medical Association's Manual of Style.

### Self-regulation and comprehension in shared reading: the moderating effects of verbal interactions and E-book discussion prompts [^ffd7853a]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The study examined how children's self‐regulation skills measured by the strengths and weaknesses of ADHD symptoms and normal behavior rating are associated with story comprehension and how verbal engagement and e‐book discussion prompts moderate this relation. Children aged 3–7 (N = 111, 50% female, Chinese as first language) read an interactive Chinese–English bilingual story e‐book with or without discussion prompts twice with their parents (2020–2021). Results demonstrated that the lower children's self‐regulation skills, the more they struggled with story comprehension. Critically, our data suggest that embedding e‐book discussion prompts and more verbalization in English can mitigate this negative association for children with inattention/hyperactivity. These findings have critical implications for future e‐book design, interventions, and home reading practice for children with inattention/hyperactivity and those at risk for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

### Guidelines for composing and assessing a paper on treatment of pain [^19dff7b6]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Authors, readers, and editors share a common focus. Authors want to publish their work. Readers want to see high-quality, new information. Referees and editors serve to ensure that authors provide valid conclusions based on the quality of information that readers want. Common to each of these roles are instructions to authors. However, these are typically written in an uninspiring, legalistic style, as if they are a set of rules that authors must obey if they expect to get published. This renders the instructions boring and oppressive, if not forbidding. Yet they need not be so, if they are set in context. Instructions to authors can be cast in a way as to reflect common purpose. They can remind authors what perceptive readers want to see in a paper and, thereby, prompt authors to include all necessary information. If cast in this way, instructions to authors are not a set of rules by which to satisfy publishers; they become guidelines for the etiquette of communication between authors and their readers. Against this background, the present article has been composed to serve several purposes. Foremost, it amplifies instructions to authors beyond the conventional technicalities such as headings, layout, font size, and line spacing. It prescribes the type of information that should be communicated and explains the reasons for those recommendations. Doing so not only informs authors about what to write, but also informs readers and referees about what to look for in a good paper. Secondarily, the article publicizes examples of errors and deficiencies of manuscripts submitted to the Journal in the past that have delayed their acceptance and publication, which could have been avoided had the forthcoming recommendations been followed. The recommendations also reprise the elements taught in courses conducted by the Spine Intervention Society in their extended program on evidence-based medicine. Doing so underscores that instructions for authors are not a procedural technicality but a way to ensure that what authors write, what readers read, and what the Journal publishes comply with contemporary precepts of good evidence. Some 20years ago, the Journal of the American Medical Association published a comprehensive series of articles with a common title: "Users' Guides to the Medical Literature" [1,2]. These articles focused on the science of statistical tests and critical appraisal, and their importance for properly understanding the literature. The present article differs in that it does not presume to teach technicalities. Instead, it describes and explains, step by step, the critical components of an article, what authors should include, and what readers should look for, so that the Journal can ensure that consistent, high-quality information is shared between its authors and readers. The present article focuses on articles concerning treatment of pain, largely because this type of article is more commonly submitted than articles on reliability or validity of diagnostic procedures. Although the present article principally focuses on papers for the Spine Section of the Journal, the same principles, appropriately adapted, serve for other sections.

### Evolution of wikipedia's medical content: past, present and future [^562ef408]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2017). Low credibility.

Some background on the encyclopaedia and its relatives

Wikipedia is a massive online encyclopaedia with global reach and recognition. Its total content has grown rapidly since its inception in 2001, with 44 million articles across 295 languages, including > 5.4 million in English as of May 2017 (figure 1A, B). The English-language Wikipedia is the largest and best known project supported by the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), and will be the main focus of this article. Other projects host open-access images, education materials and structured data.

Figure 1
Wikipedia total size and editors. (A) Total number of articles in the encyclopaedia (all languages). (B) Total number of articles in the encyclopaedia (in English). (C) Total number of editors making > 100 edits per month (in English). (D) The proportion of the top 10 most spoken languages (native + secondary) compared with the size of different language versions of Wikipedia, and usage on the internet as a whole.

After initial exponential growth of key topics, the English Wikipedia has settled into a slower, linear growth, as more niche topics and current affairs are added. These articles are written and edited by a community of approximately 30 000 editors that make > 5 edits per month, and 3000 that make > 100 edits per month. This number is down from its peak in 2007, when stricter content guidelines were introduced, but has remained stable over recent years, with a minor increase as easier writing and editing and tools are introduced (figure 1C). The size of the different language versions of Wikipedia is skewed towards English, although less in proportion to the internet as a whole (figure 1D).

Common criticisms of Wikipedia include concerns over content quality, coverage, readability and vandalism. However, much has been done to make Wikipedia's open editing system remarkably robust — from editor culture and policies (eg, increased focus on reliable references)to technological improvements (eg, automated software that reverts vandalism). This has been reflected by improvements in perceived accuracy by readers. As the encyclopaedia's contents, editors and policies change over time, studies of it can quickly go out of date. This article therefore aims to give an overview of the past, present and possible future of Wikipedia's medical content.

2.1 Participants

Twenty‐six unbalanced Chinese–English bilinguals (13 males) were recruited for this study. They were 18–25 years of age and right‐handed. They had normal or corrected‐to‐normal vision, and reported no history of neurological or language learning impairments. They all had learned English as a second language for about 12 years. Their self‐reported English proficiency on a 7‐point scale (1 poor — 7 excellent) was moderate: 4.08 (SD = 0.80) in reading, 3.85 (SD = 0.67) in writing, 3.65 (SD = 0.80) in listening, and 3.38 (SD = 0.98) in speaking. All participants provided written informed consent before participation and this study was approved by Institutional Review Board of the School of Psychology at South China Normal University.

### Practical guide to choosing an appropriate data display [^63bd2040]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The primary objective of graphing research data is to communicate key information visually in a rapid, accurate, and concise way. Graphs might be considered visual take-home lessons of the major point(s) of the manuscript. In choosing a graph, it is tempting to concentrate only on ways of illustrating summary statements characterizing the group(s). However, individual patients are unique, and their characteristics or outcomes may not be predicted by a group summary. Consequently, if possible, graphs should demonstrate individual responses as well as group summaries. "Graphical literacy", "graphical excellence", and "graphical acumen" are achievable with work and collaboration. To produce a well-designed graph, a combination of by-subject detail and overall results should be the goal within the same illustration. The practice gap addressed in this article is that little attention from authors, reviewers, editors, and publishers seems to be paid to graphical literacy. The purpose of this article is to present some practical guidelines for choosing or evaluating more appropriate data displays.

Improving communication with RIM patients — language access data and legal requirements support use of professional interpretation and translated materials. Approximately 20% of the US population speaks a language other than English at home and may prefer to speak a language other than English in healthcare encounters; furthermore, 83% of the foreign-born population in the United States who are 5 years of age and older speak a language other than English at home, and 46% have limited English proficiency. Professional interpretation (translation of spoken language) and culturally validated translated materials must be provided during clinical encounters when patients request communication in their primary language and for any important document provided to patients. Federal law mandates language services in healthcare settings under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and the Affordable Care Act requires insurers and the healthcare industry to provide translation and interpreting services for individuals with limited English proficiency.

Health literacy definition and determinants — Health literacy is defined as "the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information and services they need to make appropriate health decisions". In general literacy is described as having "three components: 1) print literacy (writing and reading), 2) oral literacy (listening and speaking), and 3) numeracy (using and understanding numbers)". The abstract notes multiple contributors to understanding, including "cultural factors, a physician's health knowledge and communication skills, the demands of the situation, the environment in which the health information is being conveyed, and time constraints".

### Literacy promotion: an essential component of primary care pediatric practice: technical report [^257941c6]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Introduction — literacy promotion in pediatric primary care states that shared reading in the developmentally critical early years supports children's cognitive, language, and social-emotional development and builds early relational health and positive stable relationships. Pediatric visits can incorporate early literacy promotion as an evidence-based approach that builds on parental strengths and skills, supports parent self-efficacy, and helps families ensure that positive childhood experiences are built into children's daily routines from the beginning. Supportive evidencebased literacy promotion is sometimes confused with programs designed purely for book distribution or simple 1-way messaging; such programs can complement a primary care–based approach but not substitute for it. Studies of clinic-based strategies report that guidance and support are positively received by parents, resulting in positive feelings about books and reading together, increased shared reading, and improved language skills in young children. Stated evidence aims include that literacy promotion in the setting of pediatric primary care is an effective intervention, increasing the frequency of shared reading, promoting language development as well as social-emotional development, and supporting nurturing parent-child relationships and self-efficacy in parents and caregivers; that literacy promotion offers an avenue for supporting brain development during critical windows; that it is a strengths-based and evidence-based universal primary prevention strategy fostering healthy cognitive and social-emotional development through relationships and positive childhood experiences (PCEs), which can also buffer and mitigate toxic stress; and that it is crucial that literacy interventions be delivered at the highest possible level of quality to children and families at risk because of social drivers of health, systemic racism, socioeconomic risk, and other barriers and inequalities that perpetuate cycles of poverty and marginalization. It also states that shared reading can play a critical role in children's early development, school readiness, and educational trajectories, supporting essential skills that develop in the years before formal instruction begins in school and reflecting the home environment as an expression of foundational early relationships with parents and caregivers.

### Current state of ethics literature synthesis: a systematic review of reviews [^a4091cfb]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Results

From the initially identified 1393 references we finally included 160 reviews covering three types of ethics reviews: (1) empirical ethics (n = 76), (2) normative ethics (n = 51), and (3) mixed literature (n = 33). For the above-described reasons we further excluded the 76 reviews of empirical ethics literature from the in-depth analysis. See the flowchart in Fig. 1. The following results therefore represent the remaining 84 reviews of normative or mixed literature. Additional file 1: Tables S1–S3 present all references for the three types of ethics reviews.

Languages, publication dates, and self-labeling

Of all 84 reviews, 98% (n = 82) were in English, one in French, and one in German. The earliest reviews were published in 1997. Of the 84 reviews, 82% were published in the last ten years. See Fig. 2. In total, 31 (37%) labeled themselves as "systematic review" or used the term "systematic" in labelings such as "systematic literature review" or "systematic survey".

### Extracting accurate materials data from research papers with conversational language models and prompt engineering [^7f87a9c0]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Different types of databases can be achieved with different levels of post-processing after automated data extraction. Here we describe three types of databases that we believe cover most database use cases. At one extreme is a database that encompasses all relevant mentions of a specific property, which is useful when initiating research in a particular field to assess the extent of data available in the literature, the span of values (including outliers), and the various material groups investigated. Entries included in such database might contain ranges, limits or approximate values, families of materials, etc. This is typically what the ChatExtract directly extracts, and we will refer to this as the raw database. At the other extreme is a strict standardized database, which contains uniquely defined materials with standard format, machine-readable compositions, and discrete values (i.e. not ranges or limits) with standardized units (which also helps remove the very rare occurrence where a triplet with wrong units is extracted). A standardized database facilitates easy interpretation and usage by computer codes and might be well-suited to, e.g. machine learning analysis. A standardized database can be developed from a raw data collection and will be a subset of that raw data. A third type of dataset, which is intermediate between raw and standardized, is a cleaned database, which removes duplicate triplets derived from within a single paper from the raw data, as these are almost always the exact same entry repeated multiple, e.g. in the "Discussion and Conclusions" sections) and are obviously undesirable. While the cleaned database can be done automatically, the standardized database may require some manual post-processing of the data extracted with the ChatExtract method.

### Literacy promotion: an essential component of primary care pediatric practice: technical report [^9b2dc012]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Reach Out and Read (ROR) model — Reach Out and Read is a national, over-3-decade-old program based in primary care medical homes serving children that promotes early literacy and strong parent-child relationships. The program stresses strengths-based anticipatory guidance and modeling in the exam room, and during each health supervision visit from birth to 5 years the pediatrician offers a new, developmentally appropriate, culturally respectful, and high-quality book directly to the child with observation of interaction. Training materials emphasize using the ROR book in the examination room as a developmental surveillance tool and for modeling developmentally appropriate interactive dialogic reading strategies. Parents whose native language is not English can be supported, parents who may struggle with literacy can be encouraged to "look at books", and books in foreign languages (monolingual and bilingual) as well as wordless books are available to adjust supply to population needs. The goal is to leverage well-child visits toward improvements in the home literacy environment and daily interactive parent-child reading activities, and literacy promotion centers around books and shared reading, a bond-building 2-generation activity; the ROR model has a very strong evidence base showing efficacy when the model is followed.

### Extracting accurate materials data from research papers with conversational language models and prompt engineering [^66b29262]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Stage (A) is the first prompt given to the model. This first prompt is meant to provide information whether the sentence is relevant at all for further analysis, i.e. whether it contains the data for the property in question (value and units). This classification is crucial because, even in papers that have been extracted to be relevant by an initial keyword search, the ratio of relevant to irrelevant sentences is typically about 1:100. Therefore elimination of irrelevant sentences is a priority in the first step. Then, before starting Stage (B), we expand the text on which we are operating to a passage consisting of three sentences: the paper's title, the sentence preceding the positively classified sentence from the previous prompt, and the positive sentence itself. This expansion is primarily useful for making sure we include text with the material's name, which is sometimes not in the sentence targeted in Stage (A) but is most of the time in the preceding sentence or title. While in some cases the text passage built this way may not contain all the information to produce a complete datapoint, for example if the materials name is mentioned earlier in the text or in a subsection where samples are described, we found this to be a relatively rare occurrence. While technically expanding the passage to ensure extraction of complete datapoints is possible, we found that operating on as short of a text passage as possible results in the most accurate extraction, and the small gain in recall from expanding the text passage was not worth the cost of loss of precision of overall extraction. That said, tuning of the text selection approach to different LLMs and/or target properties could likely achieve improvements in some cases.

Travelers with underlying medical conditions — insurance disclosures and predeparture documentation steps include that travelers with underlying medical conditions should discuss any concerns with the insurer before departure, and persons over the age of 75 years should start research for specialized policies early; underlying conditions requiring hospitalization or direct medical intervention in the 90 days prior to departure are often excluded from coverage, and in a study of international travelers with travel health insurance claims, insurance companies fully paid only two-thirds of claims; beyond purchasing insurance, encourage travelers with medical conditions to take additional steps before departure: travelers should store copies of their health records with a medical assistance company, instruct travelers to obtain letters from their healthcare professionals listing all medical conditions and current medications (including generic drug names) written in the local language if possible, travelers should pack medications in the original packaging in carry-on luggage, travelers should check with the US embassy in the destination country or the International Narcotics Control Board website before departure to ensure medications are not considered illegal, and anyone with a known heart condition should carry a copy (paper or electronic) of their most recent electrocardiogram.

### Need for cognition predicts academic interest development but not the other way around: a longitudinal study of secondary school students [^6a093721]. Child Development (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3.4.2 German

German language achievement was first assessed with the predominantly speed‐based Reading Speed and Comprehension Test for Grades 5 through 12+ ("Lesegeschwindigkeits‐ und Verständnistest für die Klassen 5–12" [LGVT 5–12+]; Schneider et al.). The students were given 4 min to read a text and their word count was measured. To encourage conscientious reading, students were asked to select the word that best fit the context from a set of options at several points in time. This reading speed task was applied at T1, T2, and T4. Furthermore, two reading comprehension tests were used. For T1 and T2, the Frankfurter Reading Comprehension Test for Grades 5 through 6 was used ("Frankfurter Leseverständnistest für 5. und 6. Klassen" [FLVT 5–6]; Souvignier et al.). Students were given 15 min to complete the test. As several students had completed the test at the end of Grade 6, a second test, the Reading Test Battery for Grades 8 through 9 ("Lesetestbatterie für die Klassenstufen 8‐9" [LESEN 8–9]; Bäuerlein et al.), was used for the remaining students for T3 and T4. Both tests required students to answer multiple‐choice questions after reading a fictional and a nonfiction text. There were no indications for ceiling effects (skewness values between −0.21 and 0.22). The reliabilities of the person parameters were good (WLE‐Rel between 0.82 and 0.87; see Table S2).

2.3.4.3 English

English language achievement was assessed by four versions of the English Test for Grades 5 to 7 (Harder and Ziegler). The content was based on the English curricula and included vocabulary, comprehension, and grammar tasks. There were no indications for ceiling effects (skewness values between 0.19 and 0.58). The reliabilities of the person parameters were good (WLE‐Rel between 0.85 and 0.89; see Table S2).

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^83a0fbe4]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Guideline 6.2 communication and language — preferred language access and interpreter services are specified as follows: The IDT ensures that patient and family preferred language and style of communication are supported and facilitated in all interactions. Palliative care staff tailor their communication to the patient and family's level of health literacy. When patients and families do not speak or understand English, or prefer communicating in a language other than English, the IDT uses qualified medical interpreter services, either in person or via telephone or video. When possible, the need for medical interpreter services is assessed and addressed before the patient and family encounter to reduce the likelihood of communication issues and misunderstandings. Prior to the patient and family encounter, the medical interpreter is provided a summary of the anticipated focus of the conversation. If medical interpreter services are unavailable, bilingual clinicians provide information in the patient and family's preferred language. Family members are not placed in the role of interpreter. The IDT asks about preferred ways of receiving materials and information and uses culturally representative images and language in printed and online materials. Written materials in each patient- and family's preferred language is provided by the IDT. When accurately translated written materials are unavailable, the program utilizes medical interpreter services to facilitate patient and family understanding of program information.

China — Vaccine quality and availability in China — China is making considerable advances in vaccine production, working with established pharmaceutical companies in joint ventures or by developing and manufacturing vaccines locally, although availability of some vaccines may be limited and issues with counterfeit or improperly stored vaccines are now rare. Travelers should not assume they can complete an unfinished vaccination series once in China; thus, all travelers going to China should be up to date with all routine and recommended vaccinations before travel, and circumstances in Hong Kong are different with international vaccines, including routine childhood, COVID-19, and influenza vaccines, generally available.

### Larger and more instructable language models become less reliable [^273f6e19]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

The prevailing methods to make large language models more powerful and amenable have been based on continuous scaling up (that is, increasing their size, data volume and computational resources 1) and bespoke shaping up (including post-filtering 2,3, fine tuning or use of human feedback 4,5). However, larger and more instructable large language models may have become less reliable. By studying the relationship between difficulty concordance, task avoidance and prompting stability of several language model families, here we show that easy instances for human participants are also easy for the models, but scaled-up, shaped-up models do not secure areas of low difficulty in which either the model does not err or human supervision can spot the errors. We also find that early models often avoid user questions but scaled-up, shaped-up models tend to give an apparently sensible yet wrong answer much more often, including errors on difficult questions that human supervisors frequently overlook. Moreover, we observe that stability to different natural phrasings of the same question is improved by scaling-up and shaping-up interventions, but pockets of variability persist across difficulty levels. These findings highlight the need for a fundamental shift in the design and development of general-purpose artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes areas for which a predictable distribution of errors is paramount.

### Self-regulation and comprehension in shared reading: the moderating effects of verbal interactions and E-book discussion prompts [^5e060a43]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

The study examined how children's self-regulation skills measured by the strengths and weaknesses of ADHD symptoms and normal behavior rating are associated with story comprehension and how verbal engagement and e-book discussion prompts moderate this relation. Children aged 3–7 (N = 111, 50% female, Chinese as first language) read an interactive Chinese-English bilingual story e-book with or without discussion prompts twice with their parents (2020–2021). Results demonstrated that the lower children's self-regulation skills, the more they struggled with story comprehension. Critically, our data suggest that embedding e-book discussion prompts and more verbalization in English can mitigate this negative association for children with inattention/hyperactivity. These findings have critical implications for future e-book design, interventions, and home reading practice for children with inattention/hyperactivity and those at risk for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Pharmacies and medications in China — Pharmacies often sell prescription medications over the counter, but these can be counterfeit, substandard, or contaminated. Advise travelers to bring all their regular medications in sufficient quantity. If travelers need more or other medications, recommend that they visit a reputable clinic or hospital; the US Embassy or expatriates may be able to offer city-specific advice. China allows travelers to bring controlled medications into the country in quantities "reasonable for personal use". Especially for controlled medications, travelers are expected to carry a copy of the written prescription with them and, whenever possible, a signed note from the prescribing physician written on letterhead stationery. A copy of the prescription may be kept by customs or at tourist inspection site officials. Custom officials may hold and request high customs duties for medications sent to China from overseas, even if the medications are for personal use.

### Morell mackenzie's the hygiene of the vocal organs: a study in longevity or durability [^158253d0]. The Laryngoscope (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Morell Mackenzie's The Hygiene of the Vocal Organs: A Practical Handbook for Singers and Speakers (1886), is his only work that has been continually published into the 20th century. Why is this?

Method

The bibliographic history and details of all the editions from the first in 1886 until the ninth and last in 1928 were examined. Reviews and all other commentary about the book were ascertained though literature and library document searches.

Results

The book is still in use as the first edition is available online from the Cornell University library, and that hard copy was last taken out from that library on December 19, 1986, and returned with the fine paid on January 8, 1987. It was translated and published in Swedish, French, German, and Spanish. All of the editions are small, inexpensively bound, and printed on inexpensive paper so the cost was minimal in contradistinction to other works on the voice which are larger and expensive. To make it accessible for performers and practitioners, the contents of the earlier editions were modified by placing the technical, anatomical, and physiological information as an appendix. The book was in part criticized by Manuel Garcia in Felix Semon's German journal, Internationales Centralblatt fur Laryngologie, Rhinologie und verwandte Wissenchaften, McKenzie answered these critiques in the seventh edition and noted that Garcia did not know German and that the translator, Semon, was an antagonist. Mackenzie is emphatic in his advice to avoid singing when there's any sign of vocal difficulty.

Conclusion

The medical advice was, on the whole, good common sense and provided substantial authority for a person to decline a performance-how grateful the singers must have been for that! The Hygiene of the Vocal Organs: A Practical Handbook for Singers and Speakers was, for the professional voice users-singers, actors, speakers, and for their teachers and physicians, a useful, concise, small, inexpensive, and authoritative book. With these virtues noted, we can well understand why it remained in circulation and use for a century. In terms of the dissemination of ideas, this heretofore neglected work may be Mackenzie's most long-lasting contribution to laryngology.

### Clustering knowledge and dispersing abilities enhances collective problem solving in a network [^a4ac9110]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

NK spaces are analytically useful for agent-based models but are conceptually abstract and difficult to ground to real-world examples. Here, we can instead understand an NK problem's complexity in terms of how incremental contributions made by any subset of activities are also contingent on other activities. Thus, a solution that an agent comes up within the NK space — captured by a unique sequence of 1s and 0s — reflects a basket of activities people undertake to solve a real-world problem, where a 1 represents the presence of an activity and a 0 its absence.

There are many examples of social collectives solving a common problem that are analogous to the NK space setup. In these instances, the solutions and performances are visible at least some subset of other actors, and there are no positive or negative externalities from one actor to another (beyond the informational spillover). For instance, consider national ministries of health of various countries. They all have different approaches to healthcare (e.g. insurance markets like in Germany or Austria or a single-public option like in Canada or the U.K.). And the improvement or decline of one country's healthcare does not adversely affect or hamper the healthcare of another. The interest of some countries in the policies employed by other countries may be limited by physical adjacency or similar political systems or cultures, so their information about the "problem space" is more localized.

Emergency medical services in China — Emergency medical services are scarce in many parts of China, most acutely in rural areas. In major cities, 2 types of ambulances are available: general ambulances and ambulances that carry more advanced medical equipment. No recognized paramedic profession exists in China, and ambulances might be staffed instead with doctors or nurses with variable levels of training. In many rural areas, rather than waiting for an ambulance to arrive, injured travelers should strongly consider taking a taxi or other immediately available vehicle to the nearest major hospital.

Health communication with refugees, immigrants, and migrants (RIM) communities — interpreter use best practices include to "Position yourself physically to speak directly to the patient, not the interpreter" and "Do not use medical jargon or acronyms". Additional instructions are to "Speak in a clear, normal voice" and "Speak in short simple sentences and pause to give the interpreter time to relay the message accurately", to "Minimize gestures to convey meaning" and "Ask only 1 question at a time, and make sure only 1 person is talking at a time". Further guidance is to "Allow your interpreter to ask for a clarification" when needed and to "Confirm understanding by asking the patient to repeat key information back to you". Practical logistics include that "For phone or video interpretation, it can be helpful to provide brief background information or context" and "If speaking over the phone, using a landline rather than a cellphone will ensure you have a stable connection for the entire appointment", plus "For longer appointments, check in with your interpreter to see if they need a break", and the caution "Do not say anything in the encounter that you do not intend for the patient to hear".

### PRISMA 2020 explanation and elaboration: updated guidance and exemplars for reporting systematic reviews [^535cfb98]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

We use standardised language in the explanation and elaboration to indicate whether the reporting recommendations for each item (which we refer to as "elements" throughout) are essential or additional. Essential elements should be reported in the main report or as supplementary material for all systematic reviews (except for those preceded by "If… ", which should only be reported where applicable). These have been selected as essential because we consider their reporting important for users to assess the trustworthiness and applicability of a review's findings, or their reporting would aid in reproducing the findings. Additional elements are those which are not essential but provide supplementary information that may enhance the completeness and usability of systematic review reports. The essential and additional elements are framed in terms of reporting the "presence" of a method or result (such as reporting if individuals were contacted to identify studies) rather than reporting on their absence. In some instances, however, reporting the absence of a method may be helpful (for example, "We did not contact individuals to identify studies"). We leave these decisions to the judgment of authors. Finally, although PRISMA 2020 provides a template for where information might be located, the suggested location should not be seen as prescriptive; the guiding principle is to ensure the information is reported.

Journals and publishers might impose word and section limits, and limits on the number of tables and figures allowed in the main report. In such cases, if the relevant information for some items already appears in a publicly accessible review protocol, referring to the protocol may suffice. Alternatively, placing detailed descriptions of the methods used or additional results (such as for less critical outcomes) in supplementary files is recommended. Ideally, supplementary files should be deposited to a general-purpose or institutional open-access repository that provides free and permanent access to the material (such as Open Science Framework, Dryad, figshare). A reference or link to the additional information should be included in the main report.

We sought examples of good reporting for each checklist item from published systematic reviews and present one for each item below; more examples are available in table S1 in the data supplement on bmj.com. We have edited the examples by removing all citations within them (to avoid potential confusion with the citation for each example), and we spelled out abbreviations to aid comprehension. We encourage readers to submit evidence that informs any of the recommendations in PRISMA 2020 and any examples that could be added to our bank of examples of good reporting (via the PRISMA statement website).

### Multiple large language models versus experienced physicians in diagnosing challenging cases with gastrointestinal symptoms [^65f50948]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Dataset

The flowchart is shown in Fig. 1. From a total of 546 cases found in 11 medical case books (Supplementary Table 2), 151 challenging cases were initially selected after the first round of evaluation. Subsequently, 84 cases were excluded due to insufficient diagnostic difficulty, over-reliance on invasive examinations for diagnostic conclusions, or cases that could be retrieved online. Ultimately, 67 challenging cases were included in the dataset, comprising 25 gastrointestinal (GI) cases and 42 non-GI cases (Supplementary Table 3). The average token number (standard deviation [SD]) of the case records was 575.3 (175.4). The dataset was randomly divided into 7 questionnaires for distribution.

### Literacy promotion: an essential component of primary care pediatric practice: technical report [^edacc2ac]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Early relational health and social-emotional development — shared reading offers strategies to promote social-emotional health and family resilience with positive effects for parents and children, and shared reading fosters, scaffolds, and even "scripts" parent-child interactions. It enhances warmth and sensitivity in parent-child relationships and is associated with attachment security and is associated with reductions in parenting stress and harsh discipline. Taken together, these studies indicate that reading aloud results in reductions in behaviors that can hurt subsequent mental health and educational trajectories and in enhancements in family resilience, including reduced parenting stress, depressive symptoms, and harsh discipline, and they suggest that interactive language-rich activities before formal instruction, and most notably shared reading, have a positive effect on underlying processes related to self-regulation that represent a key pathway by which reading aloud affects cognitive and phonological processing critical for subsequent school readiness and child reading trajectories. Shared reading is also associated with social-emotional health because of the ways in which it enhances children's experience of language and supports their language development, with studies showing that parents talk more, use more complex speech and a wider range of vocabulary, and ask more questions during shared reading, and that sharing stories and picture books promotes children's social understanding and social competence through discussion of characters' emotions and mental states.

PCCL storage and in-/out-of-room logistics — storage environments for PCCL equipment are specialized spaces; they should be temperature and humidity-controlled, and regardless of the arrangement, a system to ensure specific equipment can be located rapidly (and for identifying when supplies need to be replenished before they are depleted) is vital to efficient laboratory function. Inevitably, some combination of in-room, adjacent, and more distant fixed storage is necessary, the arrangements of these items should be done in such a way so that staff leaving the laboratory during a procedure to fetch equipment is minimized (if not eliminated altogether), and ideally, all nonleaded and nonballoon equipment, all emergency equipment, and common catheters should be stored in carts located within the PCCL procedure room; for programs that share space with other services, dedicated storage space is recommended, while some durable equipment can be mounted on wheels and stored outside the laboratory to free up space and mobile carts with collections of equipment for specific procedures can increase efficiency and avoid unnecessary openings of the cath lab doors during the procedure.

Analysis plan

The data from paper coding sheets were input into a spreadsheet by trained coders. This included demographic information, trial information (e.g. trial number, word used, experiment structure), and the structures participants built and their responses to the experimenter's questions. The participant structures were drawn or explained on the sheet, and we quantified them with the total number of blocks, and the maximum number of blocks in the X, Y, and Z‐dimensions. The dimensions were defined with respect to the participant and are depicted in Figure 1c. The X‐dimension was the axis parallel to the tabletop and the participant (e.g. four blocks lined up in a row from left to right is four blocks in the X‐dimension). The Y‐dimension was defined as height (e.g. four blocks stacked on top of each other in a column is four blocks in the Y‐dimension). The Z‐dimension was defined as parallel to the tabletop, but perpendicular to the X‐dimension along the table (e.g. four blocks lined up in a flat row going away from the participant is four blocks in the Z‐dimension). Because we used comparative words, their meaning is defined with respect to a baseline reference (i.e. the structure built by Experimenter 1). Thus, we also described the participant's structure with reference to how each dimension differed from that baseline structure (i.e. whether the participant's structure decreased, did not change, or increased in each dimension). The initial baseline structure was either Long (four blocks lined up in a row; 4 blocks in the X‐dimension, 1 block in the Y‐dimension, and 1 block in the Z‐dimension) or Tall (1 block in the X‐dimension, 4 blocks in the Y‐dimension, and 1 block in the Z‐dimension; see Figure 1). Most trials (89% of the final dataset) consisted of shapes that were easy to define in terms of the number of blocks in each dimension (e.g. a series of blocks lined up in a horizontal row; a series of blocks stacked in a single column). In the remaining cases, children built more creative structures (e.g. a row of blocks horizontal with an extra column of more vertical blocks at the end; pyramids). Each trial was coded independently by at least two research assistants to ensure proper data entry and agreements of interpretation of the number of blocks in each dimension. Trials where there was uncertainty about the structure were excluded.

### The development of human social learning across seven societies [^58107284]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Experimental procedure

Children, who were naive with respect to the task, were called into a classroom one after another to partake in the experiment. Nothing at this stage was revealed about the aim of the experiment itself. Children received the following instructions in their local language: 'I have brought a box that has three openings. If one throws a ball in the correct hole, a toy is delivered from the box. I show you a movie now in which four different children will show you how to use it. Thereafter, you can use it yourself. Watch closely!'. Children then watched the video demonstrations individually. The video depicted four peers demonstrating how to use the box (Fig. 3). The demonstrators were the same gender as the observer. The video demonstrations during the experiment were non-verbal, yet a supporting narration in the child's local language was presented by the experimenter in sequence according to counterbalance condition: Minority: 'This is [x = pre-determined locally appropriate name], (s)he uses the yellow hole. This is [x] again, (s)he uses the yellow hole again. This is again [x], (s)he uses the yellow hole again' (i.e. three times same demonstrator, same hole).

Fig. 3
Experimental set-up. Illustration of the apparatus, including the a majority and b minority demonstrations. Upon dropping the ball into the pipe, a reward was automatically released from the apparatus

Majority: 'This is [y = different pre-determined locally appropriate name], (s)he uses the blue hole. This is [z = different pre-determined locally appropriate name], (s)he uses the blue hole. This is [a = different pre-determined locally appropriate name], (s)he uses the blue hole'. After the video demonstration, children received a final instruction in their local language: 'Now you can use the box. Beware; you only have this one ball'. The 'choice-box' contained three differently coloured pipes. If a ball was dropped in any one of the pipes, a reward was automatically released from the box. After the child had used the 'choice-box' and received the reward, he/she was thanked and escorted to another room (or outside) in order to minimise the chance for them to communicate with the remaining naive children.

Change of location false‐belief task (Baron‐Cohen, Leslie, & Frith, 1985; Perner, Mauer, & Hildenbrand, 2011)

The children completed two separate change of location tasks. Both tasks were administered using specially prepared picture stimuli developed by the authors that involved two sets of characters (i.e. Su and Shaun, Andy and Sally). In both stories, the children were introduced to a story character who places an object in one location (e.g. a cupboard or a drawer) before going out to play. In the character's absence, another character enters the scene and places the object in a different location. Following these events, the children were then asked three forced‐choice questions to assess their memory for the events in the story (e.g. "Where is the book now?", "Who put it there?", "Where did Sally put the book in the beginning?"). If children failed any of these three initial questions, the experimenter reread the first part of the story. If the participant continued to fail any one of these items, testing was discontinued (N = 2 in United Kingdom, N = 9 in Hong Kong). Following these three questions, the story continued with the character returning to the scene. The experimenter then asked the false belief prediction question (e.g. "Where will Sally look for her book?"). In both the English and the Cantonese versions, we chose to use the neutral verb "look" in these questions ("zaau2" in Cantonese). Children scored 1 point for a correct response and 0 points for an incorrect response. Following this question, the experimenter showed a final image of the character searching for the object in the location he or she left it in. The children were then asked the false belief explanation question (e.g. "Why did Sally look for her book in the cupboard?").

### Welcome to oncogenesis [^9a9b896a]. Oncogenesis (2012). Low credibility.

A very, very long-time ago, way back before there was email, science was communicated in two ways. We would read papers that were actually on paper, bound into journals, and sent to libraries, offices and homes by something called mail (not to be confused with the aforementioned email). To find a paper, we would scan tables of contents, and physically turn the pages to a title of potential interest. The other way was to attend meetings, which we still do of course, but then it was to hear about papers that might be 'in press', by which we meant 'being printed on an actual printing press', and it would be months, at least, before the print arrived in our 'mail boxes'.
Reading a paper, although, was trivial compared with actually preparing our work for possible publication. These had to be typed by hand, on machines called 'typewriters' (you can still see these in museums). Graphs were hand drawn and lettered, and photographs were developed in tanks of chemicals. When I started out (yes, this was all in my lifetime), photocopied papers were not acceptable — copies had to be prepared separately, although the use of carbon paper was allowed (don't ask). Yes, we were very primitive, but we could fill up the gas tanks of our cars for < 5 $ (you might say, 'petrol' and 'pounds', and oh yes, we didn't have euros then, either).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^de70aa28]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 5–3 — Poor adherence with prescribed maintenance treatment in asthma — contributing factors and clinical identification are summarized as follows: Medication/regimen factors include "Difficulties using inhaler device (e.g., arthritis)", "Burdensome regimen (e.g., several times per day)", and "Multiple different inhalers"; unintentional poor adherence includes "Misunderstanding about instructions" and "Forgetfulness"; and intentional poor adherence includes "Perception that treatment is not necessary" and "Concerns about side-effects (real or perceived)". For patients prescribed maintenance treatment, "ask an empathic question" and "Acknowledge the likelihood of incomplete adherence and encourage an open non-judgmental discussion", using example prompts such as "In the last 4 weeks, how many days a week have you been taking it – not at all, 1, 2, 3 or more days a week?" and "Do you find it easier to remember your inhaler in the morning or the evening?" Practical checks include "Check the date of the last prescription", "Check the date and dose counter on the inhaler", and, where available, electronic monitoring since "prescribing and dispensing frequency can be monitored electronically by clinicians and/or pharmacists".

### One hundred important 20th-century ophthalmic books… [^293b3bda]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 We set ourselves to this project because it promised to be interesting and enjoyable. It has, in addition, turned out to be intensely instructive for us, and we sense that the job will remain permanently unfinished because we have, finally, had to make some coin-toss decisions about rounding out the collection to exactly 100 titles. For this reason, we have found it hard to evaluate them as 20th-century monuments. By the year 2020, a general agreement may have finally been reached about the importance of these books. If our list is slightly weighted toward the first half of the century, this delay may have been a contributing factor. By the same token, some books first written in the 1890s continued, through new editions, to have a major influence into the 20th century, and we have included a few of these on our list. The result is that our definition of the 20th century is a little fuzzy at both ends. Our first answer is that we are fond of books.

Books are not only discrete, compact, and accessible, they also can be attractive because their physical qualities appeal to some of our other senses. The palpable heft of the book, the feel of the binding and the paper, the art and skill of the typography and illustrations are all part of "reading" a book. We have asked many others to give us their choices, but in the end this is our personal list, tilted inevitably by our own personal American exposure to ophthalmic books and by our inclination toward the English language. We have made no attempt to rank all 100 of these books in order of their importance: we are not that foolhardy. We have listed them chronologically within 11 areas of ophthalmology. The sequence of these subspecialty areas is, where possible, anatomical, from the front of the eye to the back of the eye.

Our belief is that there might be a fairly general agreement that most of these 100 ophthalmic titles deserve mention among the most influential of the century. The remainder will be on someone's list but not on everybody's list. Table 2 contains the same list of books, arranged alphabetically by author. Accepted for publication December 18, 2000.

### Evidence for compositional abilities in one-year-old infants [^a598848e]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

When do children use compositionality to understand language? Until recently, our understanding of when children acquire the ability to use compositionality in language was limited. However, recent research by ref.has demonstrated that 12 month-old infants can combine newly learned numerals with object labels (e.g. "two ducks"), providing the first trace of compositional understanding at this early age. Beyond this finding, there remains a scarcity of robust evidence, and the extent to which compositionality is used by young children remains an open question. While several studies indicate that children in their second year of life understand multiword sentences under some circumstances –, these results are inconclusive since they can be explained by alternative, lower-level explanations that do not involve compositionality. Most of this research uses the looking-preference comprehension task that relies on children's tendency to look at scenes that match the sentence they hear. For instance, upon hearing "the duck is gorping the bunny", 19 month-olds prefer a scene where a duck is acting on a rabbit than a scene where the animals' roles are reversed, suggesting an understanding of the English sentence structure –a case of compositional understanding. However, success in this task, and others, could stem from simpler strategies, such as interpreting the first noun as the agent, matching the number of nouns in the sentence to the number of actors in the scene, focusing on the last word of the sentence and matching it to the most salient object in the sceneand processing words sequentially rather than composing them. While studies with children over 2 years of age generally support compositional understanding, (but see ref.), studies with younger children confirm several of these alternative comprehension strategies.

### How to find answers to clinical questions [^7cb7fcd9]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Many barriers exist to finding answers to physicians' clinical questions. Lack of time, resources, and computer skills, as well as physicians' environment and attitudes about problem solving, all contribute to unanswered questions. Making use of computer-based information resources can give physicians a framework for answering questions and keeping their practice consistent with the best available evidence.
