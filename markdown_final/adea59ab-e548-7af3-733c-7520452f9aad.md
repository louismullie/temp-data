## Question

A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?

Answer Choices:
A. gp120
B. CXCR4
C. p24
D. p17

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which protein among gp120, CXCR4, p24, and p17 is the most likely target for a new, more potent antibody designed against the same HIV envelope proteins recognized by the natural humoral immune response detected in HIV diagnostic assays. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which HIV proteins are actually part of the viral envelope and therefore accessible to circulating antibodies. Then, I should verify which of these envelope proteins are routinely detected by ELISA/Western blot diagnostics. Next, I will examine whether CXCR4, p24, or p17 are plausible antibody targets in this context. Finally, I will synthesize the evidence and conclude with the most likely candidate, making sure I anchor the reasoning to diagnostic algorithms and virologic structure.

> Let me first confirm the virologic context: HIV-1 has a lipid envelope studded with glycoproteins, principally gp120 and gp41, which mediate receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively. These are the canonical envelope proteins exposed on the virion surface and accessible to humoral immunity, whereas p24 is the capsid protein internal to the virion and not surface-exposed, and p17 is the matrix protein located beneath the envelope and not part of the outer surface. CXCR4, meanwhile, is a host chemokine receptor used as a coreceptor for viral entry, not a viral protein at all, so it cannot be an envelope antigen target of anti-HIV antibodies.

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic anchor points. Standard HIV testing algorithms begin with a combination immunoassay that detects HIV-1/2 antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen, followed by supplemental assays that differentiate HIV-1 from HIV-2 antibodies. Western blot confirmation patterns classically show bands against envelope proteins (gp160/120 and gp41) alongside gag proteins (p24, p17, p55) and pol products, reflecting the breadth of the humoral response. Importantly, the envelope bands are integral to serologic confirmation, reinforcing that gp120 is a key humoral target in natural infection.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check the distractors. CXCR4 is a human GPCR used as a coreceptor with CCR5 for viral entry. It is not a viral antigen, so an anti-HIV antibody would not target CXCR4 in this context, even though therapeutic strategies may modulate coreceptor usage. p24 is the capsid protein detected in diagnostic assays because antibodies are generated against it during infection, but it is internal and not surface-accessible on intact virions, making it a poor neutralization target. p17 is the matrix protein that lines the inner face of the envelope and is likewise not exposed on the virion surface, so it is not a target for envelope-directed neutralizing antibodies, even though anti-p17 antibodies may appear in infection.

> I will now examine the primary target. gp120 is the surface-exposed envelope glycoprotein that binds CD4 and coreceptors, contains the receptor-binding domains, and is the principal target of neutralizing antibodies in natural infection. Diagnostic Western blots consistently show gp160/120 bands, and contemporary broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) strategies in clinical development overwhelmingly target epitopes within the envelope glycoprotein, including gp120 subregions, underscoring its immunogenic prominence and accessibility on the virion surface [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the question is trying to trick me into picking p24 because it is a major antigen in diagnostic assays? Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought p24 might be the answer because it is so prominent in diagnostic panels, but that would conflate detection of internal antigens with surface accessibility for neutralization. Let me reconsider: while p24 is indeed detected by ELISA/Western blot and reflects a robust gag-directed antibody response, it is not an envelope protein and is not exposed on intact virions, so it cannot be the target of an envelope-directed neutralizing antibody designed to mimic the natural humoral response to surface glycoproteins.

> Synthesizing this, the only option that is both a bona fide HIV envelope protein and a recognized target of the natural humoral response detected in standard diagnostics is gp120. Therefore, the most likely target for a new, more potent antibody designed against the same envelope proteins recognized in HIV infection is gp120.

---

The most likely target of the new antibody is **gp120**, the HIV envelope glycoprotein that mediates viral entry and is the principal target of neutralizing antibodies in natural infection [^notfound]. Antibodies to gp120 are consistently detected by ELISA and Western blot, confirming its immunogenicity and accessibility on the virion surface [^notfound]. In contrast, CXCR4 is a host receptor, not a viral protein, and p24 and p17 are internal capsid/matrix proteins that are not surface-exposed and therefore are not primary targets for neutralizing antibodies.

---

## Rationale for targeting gp120

- **Surface exposure**: gp120 is exposed on the viral envelope and is accessible to circulating antibodies, making it a prime target for neutralization [^notfound].

- **Immunogenicity**: gp120 is highly immunogenic, eliciting strong humoral responses that are consistently detected by ELISA and Western blot assays [^notfound].

- **Functional importance**: gp120 mediates viral entry by binding to CD4 and coreceptors (CCR5/CXCR4), so antibodies targeting gp120 can block infection at the entry step [^notfound].

- **Clinical relevance**: Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeting gp120 epitopes are in clinical development and have shown promise in preventing and treating HIV infection [^notfound].

---

## Why other options are less suitable

| **Option** | **Reason for exclusion** |
|-|-|
| CXCR4 | Host chemokine receptor, not a viral protein; not a target of anti-HIV antibodies [^notfound] |
| p24 | Internal capsid protein; not surface-exposed; not a neutralization target [^notfound] |
| p17 | Internal matrix protein; not surface-exposed; not a neutralization target [^notfound] |

---

## Conclusion

The most likely target for the new antibody is **gp120**, given its surface exposure, immunogenicity, and central role in viral entry. Targeting gp120 aligns with the natural humoral response and current antibody-based therapeutic strategies.

### A 33-residue peptide tag increases solubility and stability of Escherichia coli produced single-chain antibody fragments [^116M3CPU]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Both N- and C-proximal sequences in the P17 tag contribute to scFv solubility enhancement

The 33-aa P17 tag is highly hydrophilic due to the presence of eight basic aa (R, K), five acidic aa (D, E), and twelve polar aa (e.g. N, Q, S, T), all of which may contribute to the tag's solubility-enhancing property. As these hydrophilic residues are scattered throughout the sequence (Fig. 6a), we truncated the P17 tag from either terminus (Fig. 6a) to define the relevant sequence element(s).

P17 mutants P17-C8del and P17-C15del lack 8 and 15 aa from the C-terminus to partly and completely delete the sequence forming the predicted α-helix. Attached to the C-terminus of MA18/7-scFv both improved solubility significantly by 7.3- and 5.9-fold, respectively (Fig. 6 b– d), only slightly less than the wt P17 tag (Fig. 6d). P17 mutants P17-N8del, P17-N14del, and P17-N18del lacking 8, 14, and 18 aa from the N terminus also increased solubility of MA18/7-scFv significantly by 6.2-, 8.3-, and 8.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 6 e– g). Notably, P17-N18del maintains only 15 aa of the P17 tag but promoted scFv solubility as strongly as the wt tag (Fig. 6g). Taken together, both N- and C-terminal sequences of the P17 tag can independently improve scFv's solubility in the SHuffle T7 strain.

Plasma p217+tau correlates moderately with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p217+tau. A, Matching CSF and plasma from a pilot cohort of 16 amyloid‐positive subjects with dementia were measured with the respective p217+tau assays, revealing a moderate positive correlation (r² = 0.43). B, Matching CSF and plasma from the validation cohort (n = 227 subjects; 69% mild‐to‐moderate dementia, 31% cognitively normal) was measured with the respective p217+tau assays, confirming the moderate positive correlation (r² = 0.35). The validation cohort data was separated into subjects that were amyloid (C) positive (n = 160) or (D) negative (n = 50), revealing that the CSF:plasma correlation was only seen in amyloid‐positive subjects (r² = 0.27 versus 0.01 for A+ vs. A– subjects). CSF amyloid data was not available for the remaining 17 subjects in the validation cohort so are not present in panels C or D

3.8 Plasma p217+tau assay predicts CSF tau status with high accuracy

To evaluate the utility of the plasma p217+tau assay to predict central tau status we used CSF p181tau as the standard of truth. In the ATN framework Innotest p181tau can be used as the T assay, with p181tau concentration of ≥ 52 pg/mL = T positive as cutoff. 27, 28 To establish a CSF p217+tau cutoff, CSF from a cohort of 286 samples (89% A+/mild‐to‐moderate dementia patients) was measured with p181tau and p217+tau assays, determining that Innotest p181tau of 52 pg/ml = Janssen p217+tau "long" of 11.4 pg/mL (Figure S1).

The solubility-enhancing ability of the P17 tag correlated with the number of charged residues

Polyanionic and polycationic protein tags have been reported to improve the solubility of some recombinant proteins. As 15-aa P17-N18del retained wt-like solubility-enhancing ability, it was used for subsequent point-mutation analysis. Because two anionic residues (D23, E24) and two cationic residues (K26, R27) are clustered in the central region of P17-N18del (Fig. 7a), we investigated their potential roles by site-directed mutants (P17-N18del-KR, P17-N18del-DE, and P17-N18del-DEKR) with D23/E24 and/or K26/R27 replaced alone or in combination by alanine (Fig. 7a) were fused to the C-terminus of MA18/7-scFv. In the context of the P17 tag, all mutants were predicted to maintain a wt-like α-helix propensity between residues R22-K29 (Supplementary Fig. S 1a, there named P17 DE23,24AA and KR26,27AA). Hence, these variants would also test for the importance of positive and negative charges in the putative α-helix, even if its formation was unlikely (see above). All these point mutants still increased solubility of MA18/7-scFv significantly, though to variable extents (Fig. 7 b– d). Compared to the parental P17-N18del tag, the solubility-enhancing abilities of P17-N18del-KR, P17-N18del-DE, and P17-N18del-DEKR mutants were reduced by 12%, 42%, and 58%, respectively (Fig. 7d). Therefore, the clustered charged residues have the strongest impact on the solubility-enhancing ability of the P17 tag.

### A HSP60-targeting peptide for cell apoptosis imaging [^112QukbM]. Oncogenesis (2016). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Peptide P17

In the current study, we tested a collection of chemically synthesized peptides based on the fragments of various proteins which were assembled in our previous studies for unraveling various interaction, hydrogen bond, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between side chains, in the peptide assemblies using scanning probe microscopy. Cell-based selection process was performed for screening of the peptide ligands with high binding affinity. A peptide P17 (GDQNLQGPMLQGDPGFQRCIDGNVRLVFLFRGKKKKKKG) was identified by the cell-based selection. For the further verification of P17, a scrambled P17 (P17S) was synthesized (GNLDQMQGLGDPQPGRQCFIVRLFGDNLFRVGKKKKKKG). The molecular weight of P17 or P17S is 4375.14 Da. The N terminal of P17 or P17S was conjugated with FITC or biotin according to the requirement of experiments. The molecular weight of FITC-P17 is 4875.25 Da and the molecular weight of Biotin-P17/P17S is 4601.48 Da. Peptides used in this study were purchased from GL Biochem (Shanghai) Ltd. (Shanghai, China). P17 or P17S is stored at −20 °C. Before use, the peptides were defrosted at room temperature. For cell-based binding assays, P17 or P17S was dissolved in the culture medium at indicated concentrations. For in vivo experiments, P17 was dissolved in saline at indicated concentrations.

### Efficacy and safety of switching from reference adalimumab to CT-P17 (100 mg / ml): 52-week randomized, double-blind study in rheumatoid arthritis [^115PXJ2U]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the safety and efficacy of switching from reference adalimumab to adalimumab biosimilar CT-P17 with continuing reference adalimumab/CT-P17 in active RA.

Methods

This double-blind, phase III study randomized (1:1) subjects with active RA to receive 40mg (100mg/ml) CT-P17 or European Union-sourced reference adalimumab subcutaneously every 2weeks (Q2W) until week (W) 24 [treatment period (TP) 1]. Thereafter, subjects receiving reference adalimumab were randomized (1:1) to continue reference adalimumab or switch to CT-P17 from W26 (both Q2W until W48; TP2). Subjects receiving CT-P17 in TP1 continued CT-P17. W0-W24 results were previously reported; we present W26-W52 findings. End points were efficacy (including joint damage progression), pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity.

Results

Of 607 subjects who initiated TP2 treatment, 303 continued CT-P17, 153 continued reference adalimumab and 151 switched to CT-P17. Efficacy improvements up to W24 were maintained during TP2; efficacy was comparable among groups. At W52, 20% improvement in ACR response rates were 80.5% (continued CT-P17), 77.8% (continued reference adalimumab) and 82.2% (switched to CT-P17). Joint damage progression was minimal. Mean trough serum adalimumab concentrations were similar among groups. CT-P17 and reference adalimumab safety profiles were numerically similar and switching did not affect immunogenicity. At W52, 28.4% (continued CT-P17), 27.0% (continued reference adalimumab) and 28.3% (switched to CT-P17) of subjects were anti-drug antibody-positive.

Conclusion

Efficacy, pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of CT-P17 and reference adalimumab were comparable after 1year of treatment, including after switching from reference adalimumab to CT-P17.

### A CXCR1 haplotype hampers HIV-1 matrix protein p17 biological activity [^111aFKx5]. AIDS (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Monocyte inflammatory processes are fundamental events in AIDS pathogenesis. HIV-1 matrix protein p17, released from infected cells, was found to exert an interleukin (IL)-8 chemokine-like activity on human monocytes, promoting their trafficking and sustaining inflammatory processes, after binding to CXCR1. A haplotype of the CXCR1 gene (CXCR1_300_142) has been associated with slow HIV disease progression. Here, we determine how CXCR1 genetic variations impact on p17 biological activity.

Design/Methods/Results

Our results show that Jurkat cells overexpressing CXCR1 or the receptor carrying single polymorphism CXCR1_300 or CXCR1_142 are able to adhere and migrate in response to both IL-8 and p17. On the contrary, Jurkat cells overexpressing CXCR1_300_142 and monocytes of individuals with such CXCR1 polymorphisms lose the capacity to adhere and migrate in response to p17, but not to their physiological ligand IL-8. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and multispectral imaging flow cytometry showed that p17 bound with similar affinity to CXCR1 and CXCR1_300_142. Moreover, whereas p17 was able to activate CXCR1, it was incapable of functionally interacting with CXCR1_300_142 by phosphorylating extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, which regulates chemokine-induced cellular responses. Finally, mutagenesis studies showed that, unlike IL-8, p17 does not use Glu-Leu-Arg-like motifs to activate CXCR1.

Conclusions

Our results, showing the inability of p17 to activate CXCR1_300_142, a receptor found to be expressed on immune cells of patients with a low progression of HIV disease, point to a crucial role of p17 in AIDS pathogenesis. Our findings herein call for an exploration of the therapeutic potential of blocking the p17/CXCR1 axis in HIV infection.

### A HSP60-targeting peptide for cell apoptosis imaging [^113eqHAm]. Oncogenesis (2016). Low credibility.

P17 binds to HSP60 in the cytoplasma

On the basis of the confocal microscopy observation (Figures 1d and 3b), we found that P17 localized in the cytoplasm of apoptotic cells. As there were several cytoplasmic proteins with obvious upregulation during apoptosis, including Bax, p53, cleaved caspase-3 and HSPs, P17 might bind to one of the apoptosis-related proteins mentioned above. To identify the specific binding partners of P17, the pull-down assay was used in TRAIL-treated Jurkat cells (Figure 5a). Absent from TRAIL-untreated or bead-control sample, a specific protein band was observed in the sample of TRAIL-treated cells (Figure 5b). By mass spectrometry analysis, the P17-binding protein was identified to be HSP60 with 37% sequence coverage, a mitochondrial chaperonin accumulating in the cytoplasm during apoptosis (Figure 5c). Some unexpected bands were also observed in TRAIL-treated samples. We considered that in P17 there might be some segments that were possibly bound with other cytoplasmic proteins. It could be noticed that these unexpected bands were also observed in the TRAIL-untreated sample, while the HSP60 band was observed only in the TRAIL-treated sample, which suggested that the unspecified bands are not directly relevant with the cell apoptosis. These bands are worth investigating in our future effort.

To further confirm the interaction between P17 and HSP60, we synthesized a scrambled P17 (named P17S) and used it as a control in two pull-down assays. One protocol is the same as that used for the mass spectrometry analysis; biotinylated P17 was incubated with streptavidin-beads to obtain P17-conjugated beads that was subsequently used to catch the target protein. The other protocol is to pre-incubate biotinylated P17 with TRAIL-treated cells, and then streptavidin-conjugated beads were used to catch the biotin-P17-protein complex. These two protocols have been schematically illustrated in Figure 5e. Results showed that in both protocols, P17S could not bind HSP60 in the apoptotic cells, while P17 bound to HSP60 clearly (Figure 5f).

This result was further confirmed by colocalization with anti-HSP60 antibody. After treatment with TRAIL, Jurkat cells were incubated with FITC-P17 and then stained with anti-HSP60 antibody. It was observed in confocal microscopy that P17 and anti-HSP60 antibody were approximately localized in the same region in the cytoplasm (Figure 5d), indicating the P17 accumulation in apoptotic cells by binding with HSP60.

We then examined the concentration effect of FITC-P17 on the cellular fluorescent intensity with TRAIL-induced Jurkat cells. As the concentration of FITC-P17 was changed from 1 μto 20 μ, control cells remained a constant and very low level of fluorescent intensity, while the TRAIL-treated cells showed proportionally elevated fluorescent intensity with the P17 concentration increased and reached the binding platform at 10 μ(Figure 2a). In addition, the fluorescence intensity can be associated to the apoptosis degree within the concentration range of P17: at each tested concentration of P17, the elevated level of apoptosis induced by TRAIL led to increased uptake of P17 in Jurkat cells. Next, Jurkat cells were induced to various degrees of apoptosis through different incubation time with TRAIL and quantified both by FITC-P17 binding as well as by annexin V/PI staining, showing a positive correlation between the binding amount of P17 and the apoptosis degree (Figure 2b). The time course of P17 binding exhibited multiple phases: increased sharply within 2 min of the incubation, remained constant within 2–10 min, and increased fast from 10 min to 15 min followed with the other plateau within 15–60 min of incubation and a slowly elevation within 1–4 h of incubation (Figure 2c). This finding further validated the potential of P17 as an apoptosis probe.

### RNA-binding properties of dendrolimus punctatus tetravirus p17 protein [^1171bbt3]. Virus Research (2008). Low credibility.

The RNA-binding properties of the p17 protein of Dendrolimus punctatus tetravirus were analysed. We have demonstrated that p17 protein, a nonstructural protein with a potentially important role in viral replication, is a RNA-binding protein, which has not been previously described for any member of the family Tetraviridae. P17 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and was used in UV cross-linking analysis, using a digoxigenin-UTP-labeled RNA probe and chemical cross-linking analysis. The analyses demonstrated that p17 protein could bind to RNA. When analysed for capacity of p17 to form oligomers, the protein could form dimers and tetramers. Furthermore, the circular dichroism spectrums of viral RNA 3'-UTR proved that their secondary structures were consistent with yeast tRNA.

### Development and validation of a high-sensitivity assay for measuring p217 + tau in plasma [^1134yUDW]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2021). Medium credibility.

Using CSF p217+tau 11.4 pg/mL as standard of truth cutoff for tau positivity in the validation cohort (Figure 8B) the plasma p217+tau data predicted CSF T status with high accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.9469; Figure 9A). A Youden index analysis of the ROC curve resulted in optimal plasma p217+tau cutoff point of 124.6 fg/mL, which yielded good performance (sensitivity = 96.43%; specificity = 79.13%; positive predictive value [PPV] = 81.81%; negative predictive value [NPV] 95.79%) and very low false +/– rates [10% and 2%, respectively]; Figure 9B). Separating the cohort into cognitively normal (n = 70) versus mild‐to‐moderate dementia (n = 157) subjects revealed similar predictive power in each subset (CN: AUC = 0.9046, cutoff = 100.9 fg/mL; sensitivity = 80%; specificity = 89.23%; PPV = 36.36%; NPV = 98.31%; false +/– rates = 10% and 1%, respectively; Dementia: AUC = 0.9254, cutoff = 148.6 fg/mL; sensitivity = 93.46%; specificity = 72%; PPV = 87.72%; NPV 83.72%; false +/– rates = 9% and 4%, respectively; Figures 9C‐F).

Plasma p217+tau predicts central tau positivity with high accuracy. A, Using a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p217+tau cutoff of 11.4 pg/mL for central tau positivity (based on equivalency to Innotest p181 cutoff of 52 pg/mL; Figure S1) the data in Figure 5B was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, revealing that the plasma p217+tau data predicted central tau status with high accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.9419). B, Youden index analysis of the ROC curve resulted in optimal plasma p217+tau cutoff point of124.6 fg/mL. This cutoff achieved low false positive (10%) and false negative (2%) rates for predicting CSF p217+tau status.

### A 33-residue peptide tag increases solubility and stability of Escherichia coli produced single-chain antibody fragments [^116GJS7j]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), composed of variable domains of heavy and light chains of an antibody joined by a linker, share antigen binding capacity with their parental antibody. Due to intrinsically low solubility and stability, only two Escherichia coli-produced scFvs have been approved for therapy. Here we report that a 33-residue peptide, termed P17 tag, increases the solubility of multiple scFvs produced in Escherichia coli SHuffle strain by up to 11.6 fold. Hydrophilic sequence, especially charged residues, but not the predicted α-helical secondary structure of P17 tag, contribute to the solubility enhancement. Notably, the P17 tag elevates the thermostability of scFv as efficiently as intra-domain disulfide bonds. Moreover, a P17-tagged scFv targeting hepatitis B virus surface proteins shows over two-fold higher antigen-binding affinity and virus-neutralizing activity than the untagged version. These data strongly suggest a type I intramolecular chaperone-like activity of the P17 tag. Hence, the P17 tag could benefit the research, production, and application of scFv.

### HIV-1 matrix protein p17 binds to the IL-8 receptor CXCR1 and shows IL-8-like chemokine activity on monocytes through rho / ROCK activation [^116yKzZa]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Exogenous HIV-1 matrix protein p17 was found to deregulate biologic activities of many different immune cells that are directly or indirectly involved in AIDS pathogenesis after binding to unknown cellular receptor(s). In particular, p17 was found to induce a functional program in monocytes related to activation and inflammation. In the present study, we demonstrate that CXCR1 is the receptor molecule responsible for p17 chemokine-like activity on monocytes. After CXCR1 binding, p17 was capable of triggering rapid adhesion and chemotaxis of monocytes through a pathway that involved Rho/ROCK. Moreover, CXCR1-silenced primary monocytes lost responsiveness to p17 chemoattraction, whereas CXCR1-transfected Jurkat cells acquired responsiveness. Surface plasmon resonance studies confirmed the capacity of p17 to bind CXCR1 and showed that the p17/CXCR1 interaction occurred with a low affinity compared with that measured for IL-8, the physiologic CXCR1 ligand. In all of its activities, p17 mimicked IL-8, the natural high-affinity ligand of CXCR1. Recent studies have highlighted the role of IL-8 and CXCR1 in HIV-1 replication and AIDS pathogenesis. Our findings herein call for an exploration of the therapeutic potential of blocking the p17/IL-8/CXCR1 axis in HIV-1 infection.

### HIV-1 p17 binds heparan sulfate proteoglycans to activated CD4 (+) T cells [^117XRCyy]. Virus Research (2008). Low credibility.

We have previously shown that HIV-1 p17 binds to activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and enhances secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but we were unable to define a ligand on activated cells. In this work we evaluate the hypothesis that HIV-1 p17 may be a heparin/heparan sulfate-binding protein. HIV-1 p17 contains C- and N-terminal sequences with positively charged residues and a consensus cluster for heparin binding. We demonstrated by affinity chromatography that HIV-1 p17 binds strongly to heparin-agarose at physiological pH. Soluble heparins and heparan sulfate but not chondroitin 4-sulfate and dextran sulfate inhibit binding of HIV-1 p17 to heparin solid phase and to activated CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore the inhibition of cell sulfatation by chlorate treatment completely counteracts HIV-1 p17 binding to activated cells. These results indicate for the first time that HIV-1 p17 can be ascribed to the heparin binding protein family and suggest that this interaction might play a key role in the ability of the protein to induce an inflammatory effect on activated cells.

### P17 induces chemotaxis and differentiation of monocytes via MRGPRX2-mediated mast cell-line activation [^115L7Ydp]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

P17, a peptide isolated from Tetramorium bicarinatum ant venom, is known to induce an alternative phenotype of human monocyte-derived macrophages via activation of an unknown G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR).

Objective

We sought to investigate the mechanism of action and the immunomodulatory effects of P17 mediated through MRGPRX2 (Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2).

Methods

To identify the GPCR for P17, we screened 314 GPCRs. Upon identification of MRGPRX2, a battery of in silico, in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo assays along with the receptor mutation studies were performed. In particular, to investigate the immunomodulatory actions, we used β-hexosaminidase release assay, cytokine releases, quantification of mRNA expression, cell migration and differentiation assays, immunohistochemical labeling, hematoxylin and eosin, and immunofluorescence staining.

Results

P17 activated MRGPRX2 in a dose-dependent manner in β-arrestin recruitment assay. In LAD2 cells, P17 induced calcium and β-hexosaminidase release. Quercetin- and short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of MRGPRX2 reduced P17-evoked β-hexosaminidase release. In silico and in vitro mutagenesis studies showed that residue Lys 8 of P17 formed a cation-π interaction with the Phe 172 of MRGPRX2 and [Ala 8]P17 lost its activity partially. P17 activated LAD2 cells to recruit THP-1 and human monocytes in Transwell migration assay, whereas MRGPRX2-impaired LAD2 cells cannot. In addition, P17-treated LAD2 cells stimulated differentiation of THP-1 and human monocytes, as indicated by the enhanced expression of macrophage markers cluster of differentiation 11b and TNF-α by quantitative RT-PCR. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining suggested monocyte recruitment in mice ears injected with P17.

Conclusions

Our data provide novel structural information regarding the interaction of P17 with MRGPRX2 and intracellular pathways for its immunomodulatory action.

### A HSP60-targeting peptide for cell apoptosis imaging [^114WBFAA]. Oncogenesis (2016). Low credibility.

Apoptosis has a critical role in both physiological and pathological processes, and therefore probes that enable direct and fast visualization for apoptosis in vitro and in vivo have great significance for evaluation of therapeutic effects, disease monitoring and drug screening. We report here a novel apoptotic marker heat shock protein 60 (HSP60)-based apoptosis imaging probe, P17. In this study, we show that P17 can label multiple drug-induced apoptotic cells in vitro, and the difference in binding intensities between apoptotic and viable cells by fluorescent P17 is more than 10-fold in six cell lines measured by flow cytometry and proportional to the apoptotic level of the cells. We further visualized the apoptosis in the subcutaneous tumor of mice by vein injection of P17 using in vivo fluorescent imaging. P17 was identified to bind specifically to HSP60 accumulated in apoptotic cells by pull-down experiments and mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the P17 binding was correlated with the apoptotic feature of phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure and caspase-3 activation. We also clarify that P17 labels the cells in late stage apoptosis by double staining with different stage markers, unveiling that HSP60 may be involved with late stage of apoptosis. Overall, this study has demonstrated that P17 is a novel apoptosis probe targeting HSP60 and promising for the detection of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.

### Expression of ASFV p17 in CHO cells and identification of one novel epitope using a monoclonal antibody [^11651wXC]. Virus Research (2023). Medium credibility.

As a highly pathogenic large DNA virus, African swine fever virus (ASFV) has huge particles and numerous encoded proteins. At present, few of the existing studies on ASFV proteins have investigated the function of p17. Specific antibodies against p17 to promote the development of prevention techniques against African swine fever (ASF) are urgently needed. Herein, we successfully expressed ASFV p17 in CHO cells using a suspension culture system and generated a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against p17. The mAb recognized a novel linear epitope (8 LLSHNLSTREGIK 20) and exhibited specific reactivity, which was conducive to the identification of ectopically expressed p17, the recombinant porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus expressing p17, and the ASFV-SY18. The epitope was conservative among genotype I and genotype II ASFV strains. Overall, the mAb against p17 revealed efficient detection and promising application prospects, making it a useful tool for future vaccine research on ASF. Determination of the conserved linear epitope of p17 would contribute to the in-depth exploration of the biological function of ASFV antigen protein.

### HIV p17 reverses the anti-inflammatory activity of IL-4 on IL-15 stimulated monocytes and modulates their ability to secrete MIP-1 alpha [^114RLUoT]. Virus Research (2006). Low credibility.

Monocytes play a central role in the immune system by producing and reacting to different soluble factors. Cytokine dysregulation is an hallmark in HIV-infected individuals and it is one of the most significant factors leading to impaired immunity in HIV/AIDS disease. This study investigates the possibility of modulation in the secretion of some inflammatory cytokines and chemokines induced by HIV p17 in monocytes. The results show that p17, while ineffective on resting monocytes, exerts an inflammatory action on IL-4 mediated inhibition of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma production induced by IL-15 stimulation. In addition, p17 is able to reduce MIP-1alpha secretion, but unable to influence IL-6 production. The ability of HIV p17 to contribute to an altered pattern of secreted soluble factors might imply a key role for this viral protein in the development of AIDS pathogenesis.

### HIV-1 matrix protein p17 promotes lymphangiogenesis and activates the endothelin-1 / endothelin B receptor axis [^112bEkGp]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

AIDS-related lymphomas are high grade and aggressively metastatic with poor prognosis. Lymphangiogenesis is essential in supporting proliferation and survival of lymphoma, as well as tumor dissemination. Data suggest that aberrant lymphangiogenesis relies on action of HIV-1 proteins rather than on a direct effect of the virus itself. HIV-1 matrix protein p17 was found to accumulate and persist in lymph nodes of patients even under highly active antiretroviral therapy. Because p17 was recently found to exert a potent proangiogenic activity by interacting with chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptors 1 and 2, we tested the prolymphangiogenic activity of the viral protein.

Approach and Results

Human primary lymph node-derived lymphatic endothelial cells were used to perform capillary-like structure formation, wound healing, spheroids, and Western blot assays after stimulation with or without p17. Here, we show that p17 promotes lymphangiogenesis by binding to chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor-1 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor-2 expressed on lymph node-derived lymphatic endothelial cells and activating the Akt/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway. In particular, it was found to induce capillary-like structure formation, sprout formation from spheroids, and increase lymph node-derived lymphatic endothelial cells motility. The p17 lymphangiogenic activity was, in part, sustained by activation of the endothelin-1/endothelin receptor B axis. A Matrigel plug assay showed that p17 was able to promote the outgrowth of lymphatic vessels in vivo, demonstrating that p17 directly regulates lymphatic vessel formation.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that p17 may generate a prolymphangiogenic microenvironment and plays a role in predisposing the lymph node to lymphoma growth and metastasis. This finding offers new opportunities to identify treatment strategies in combating AIDS-related lymphomas.

### Therapeutic effect of a peptide inhibitor of TGF-β on pulmonary fibrosis [^115GcBPx]. Cytokine (2011). Low credibility.

Pulmonary fibrosis encompasses several respiratory diseases characterized by epithelial cell injury, inflammation and fibrosis. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 is one of the main profibrogenic cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis. It induces fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts, which produce high levels of collagen and concomitantly loss of lung elasticity and reduction of the respiratory function. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of P17 (a TGF-β inhibitor peptide) on IMR-90 lung fibroblast differentiation in vitro, as well as on the inhibition of the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. It was found that in IMR-90 cells, P17 inhibited TGF-β1-induced expression of connective tissue growth factor and α-smooth muscle actin. In vivo, treatment of mice with P17 2days after bleomycin administration decreased lung fibrosis, areas of myofibroblast-like cells and lymphocyte infiltrate. P17 also reduced mRNA expression of collagen type I, fibronectin and the fibronectin splice isoform EDA in the lung, and increased the expression of IFN-γ mRNA. Finally, therapeutic treatment with P17 in mice with already established fibrosis was able to significantly attenuate the progression of lung fibrosis. These results suggest that P17 may be useful in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.

### PQBP1 regulates the cellular inflammation induced by avian reovirus and interacts with the viral p17 protein [^116irsLB]. Virus Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Avian reovirus (ARV) can commonly infect a flock and cause immunosuppressive diseases in poultry. The nonstructural protein p17 is involved in viral replication, and significant progress has been made in showing its ability to regulate cellular signaling pathways. In our previous study, to further investigate the effect of ARV p17 protein on viral replication, the host protein polyglu-tamine binding protein 1 (PQBP1) was identified to interact with p17 by a yeast two-hybrid system. In the current study, the interaction between PQBP1 and p17 protein was further confirmed by laser confocal microscopy and coimmunoprecipitation assays. In addition, the N-terminal WWD of PQBP1 was found to mediate the process of binding to the p17 protein. Interestingly, we found that ARV infection significantly inhibited PQBP1 expression. While the quantity of ARV replication was largely influenced by PQBP1, PQBP1 overexpression decreased ARV replication. In contrast, upon PQBP1 knockdown, the quantity of ARV was notably increased. ARV infection and p17 protein expression were both proven to induce PQBP1 to mediate cellular inflammation. In the current study, we revealed through qRT‒PCR, ELISA and Western blotting methods that PQBP1 plays a positive role in ARV-induced inflammation. Furthermore, the mechanism of this process was shown to involve the NFκB-dependent transcription of inflammatory genes. In addition, PQBP1 was shown to regulate the phosphorylation of p65 protein. In conclusion, this research provides clues to elucidating the function of the p17 protein and the pathogenic mechanism of ARV, especially the cause of the inflammatory response. It also provides new ideas for the study of therapeutic targets of ARV.

### Testing for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus… [^111ju5SN]. CDC (1998). Low credibility.

This article provides CDC recommendations for the diagnosis of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections in persons being tested in settings other than blood centers and CDC/FDA guidelines for serologic testing with combination HIV-1/HIV-2 screening enzyme immunoassays. Epidemiologic data indicate that the prevalence of HIV-2 infections in persons in the United States is extremely low. Therefore, CDC does not recommend routine testing for HIV-2 in settings other than blood centers. However, when HIV testing is indicated, tests for antibodies to both HIV-1 and HIV-2 should be obtained if epidemiologic risk factors for HIV-2 infection are present, if clinical evidence exists for HIV disease in the absence of a positive test for antibodies to HIV-1, or if HIV-1 Western blot results exhibit the unusual indeterminate pattern of gag plus pol bands in the absence of env bands.

The following procedures are recommended if testing for both HIV-1 and HIV-2 is performed by means of a combination HIV-1/HIV-2 EIA. A repeatedly reactive specimen by HIV-1/HIV-2 EIA should be tested by HIV-1 Western blot. A positive result by HIV-1 Western blot confirms the presence of antibodies to HIV, and testing for HIV-2 is recommended only if HIV-2 risk factors are present. If the HIV-1 Western blot result is negative or indeterminate, an HIV-2 EIA should be performed. If the HIV-2 EIA is positive, an HIV-2 supplemental test should be performed. Because HIV-2 infections are not always detected by HIV-1 antibody tests, antibody tests for HIV-2 have been developed. On April 25, 1990, the Food and Drug Administration licensed an enzyme immunoassay test kit for detection of antibodies to HIV-2 in human serum or plasma. The test, Genetic Systems HIV-2 EIA, manufactured and distributed by Genetic Systems Corp, Redmond, WA, is based on a disrupted whole-virus antigen obtained by purification of HIV-2 grown in cell culture. Licensure of the HIV-2 EIA raised the possibility of routine donor screening for HIV-2. These tests permit simultaneous testing for both HIV-1 and HIV-2 without increasing the number of screening tests performed by blood banks. In accordance with FDA recommendations effective June 1, 1992, blood centers have begun testing all donated whole blood, blood components, and source plasma for antibodies to HIV-2. Blood centers can accomplish this either by the use of a single combination test for HIV-1/HIV-2 or by the use of two independent tests, one for HIV-1 and one for HIV-2.

Screening donated blood and plasma for HIV-2 infection raises issues concerning appropriate strategies for testing for both viruses, HIV-2 testing in other settings, and notification of HIV-1 and HIV-2 test results. This article provides CDC recommendations for the diagnosis of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections in persons being tested in settings other than blood centers and CDC/FDA guidelines for serologic testing with combination HIV-1/HIV-2 screening EIAs. From 60% to 91% of HIV-2-infected persons will test repeatedly reactive by HIV-1 whole-virus lysate EIA. According to data provided to FDA by the test manufacturers, HIV-2 antibodies are detected with > 99% sensitivity by FDA-licensed HIV-1/HIV-2 EIAs and the FDA-licensed HIV-2 EIA. However, analogous to the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, diagnosis of HIV-2 infection requires more specific supplemental tests, such as an HIV-2 Western blot. Although no licensed supplemental tests exist for HIV-2 infection, research tests are available.

### Divergent HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus surveillance, zaire [^1114H2EA]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Of the 70 WB-indeterminate serum specimens, 69 showed a broad range of HIV-1 WB-indeterminate band patterns, and 1 had an HIV-2 WB-indeterminate pattern with weak reactivity against gp36, p68, and gp80 proteins. Analysis of HIV-1 WB-indeterminate patterns provided several important observations. First, most of the specimens (41/69, 59%) showed reactivity to multiple viral proteins (Figure), whereas the remaining specimens (28/69, 41%) demonstrated reactivity against single HIV-1 proteins, including p24 (13/69, 18.8%), p17 (n = 8, 11.6%), gp160w (w = weak) (n = 4, 5.8%), and p51, p66, and gp41w (n = 1 each; 1.4% each). Second, in all but 3 specimens the WB-indeterminate patterns with reactivity to multiple viral proteins combined proteins of p24 or p17 gag or both with others, giving the following 21 profiles: p17/p24 (14/69, 20.3%); p24/p66 and p17/p24/p66 (n = 3 each, 4.3% each); p24/p51, p17/p24/p51, and p17/p24/gp41w (n = 2 each, 2.9% each); p17/p66, p17/gp160, p24/gp160, p24/p51/gp41w, p17/p51/p66, p17/p31/gp41w, p24/p51/p55, p24/p51/p66, p17/p24/p51/p66, p17/p24/p51/p55, p17/p24/p55/p66, p24/p31/p51/p55, p31/p66, p51/gp41w, and p31/p66/gp41w (n = 1 each, 1.4% each). Overall, this analysis indicated reactivity to 8 HIV-1 proteins that occurred as single bands or multiple combinations. Whereas reactivity to p24 might represent either early infection with HIV or reaction to nonspecific antigens, reactivity to other HIV-1 proteins (p17, p31, p51, p55, p66, gp41, or gp160) could reflect at least exposure to HIV-1, HIV-2, or SIV variants as well as cross-reactivity with yet unidentified HIV- or SIV-like strains.

### Comparison of novel PSMA-targeting [Lu] Lu-P17-087 with its albumin binding derivative [Lu] Lu-P17-088 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients: a first-in-human study [^113CjmDT]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a promising target for diagnosis and radioligand therapy (RLT) of prostate cancer. Two novel PSMA-targeting radionuclide therapy agents, [177 Lu]Lu-P17-087, and its albumin binder modified derivative, [177 Lu]Lu-P17-088, were evaluated in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients. The primary endpoint was dosimetry evaluation, the second endpoint was radiation toxicity assessment (CTCAE 5.0) and PSA response (PCWG3).

Methods

Patients with PSMA-positive tumors were enrolled after [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan. Five mCRPC patients received [177 Lu]Lu-P17-087 and four other patients received [177 Lu]Lu-P17-088 (1.2 GBq/patient). Multiple whole body planar scintigraphy was performed at 1.5, 4, 24, 48, 72, 120 and 168 h after injection and one SPECT/CT imaging was performed at 24 h post-injection for each patient. Dosimetry evaluation was compared in both patient groups.

Results

Patients showed no major clinical side-effects under this low dose treatment. As expected [177 Lu]Lu-P17-088 with longer blood circulation (due to its albumin binding) exhibited higher effective doses than [177 Lu]Lu-P17-087 (0.151 ± 0.036 vs. 0.056 ± 0.019 mGy/MBq, P = 0.001). Similarly, red marrow received 0.119 ± 0.068 and 0.048 ± 0.020 mGy/MBq, while kidney doses were 0.119 ± 0.068 and 0.046 ± 0.022 mGy/MBq, respectively. [177 Lu]Lu-P17-087 demonstrated excellent tumor uptake and faster kinetics; while [177 Lu]Lu-P17-088 displayed a slower washout and higher average dose (7.75 ± 4.18 vs. 4.72 ± 2.29 mGy/MBq, P = 0.018). After administration of [177 Lu]Lu-P17-087 and [177 Lu]Lu-P17-088, 3/5 and 3/4 patients showed reducing PSA values, respectively.

Conclusion

[177 Lu]Lu-P17-088 and [177 Lu]Lu-P17-087 displayed different pharmacokinetics but excellent PSMA-targeting dose delivery in mCRPC patients. These two agents are promising RLT agents for personalized treatment of mCRPC. Further studies with increased dose and frequency of RLT are warranted to evaluate the potential therapeutic efficacy.

### HIV-1 matrix protein p17 enhances the proliferative activity of natural killer cells and increases their ability to secrete proinflammatory cytokines [^112JChjU]. British Journal of Haematology (2003). Low credibility.

We investigated the effects of human immunodeficiency type-1 virus (HIV-1) matrix protein p17 on freshly isolated and purified human natural killer (NK) cells. HIV-1 p17 increased the cytokines interleukin (IL) 2, IL-12 and IL-15, and induced natural killer cell proliferation, but not cytotoxicity. This effect was specific because it was abrogated by anti-p17 monoclonal antibody. Moreover, HIV-1 p17 enhanced the cytokine-induced production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma by NK cells. IL-4 downregulated IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha secretion in IL-2- and IL-15-treated NK cells. HIV-1 p17 restored the ability of NK cells to produce both cytokines when added to the cultures simultaneously with IL-4. The property of p17 to increase the production of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma might be a mechanism used by HIV-1 to modulate the immune system to support its replication and spreading.

### Replication-deficient mutant herpes simplex virus-1 targets professional antigen presenting cells and induces efficient CD4 + T helper responses [^111L2vUr]. Microbes and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Both neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic T-cells are necessary to control a viral infection. However, vigorous T helper responses are essential for their elicitation and maintenance. Here we show that a recombinant replication-deficient Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)-1 vector encoding the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 matrix protein p17 (T0-p17) was capable of infecting professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) in vitro and in vivo. The injection of T0-p17 in the mouse dermis generated a strong p17-specific CD4+ T helper response preceding both p17-specific humoral and effector T cell responses. Moreover, we show that T0-p17 infection did not interfere with the endogenous processing of the transgene encoded antigen, since infected APCs were able to evoke a strong recall response in vitro. Our results demonstrate that replication-deficient HSV vectors can be appealing candidates for the development of vaccines able to trigger T helper responses.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection… [^1146Mm75]. stacks.cdc.gov (2014). Low credibility.

Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations Current Public Domain June 27, 2014 By Branson, Bernard M.; Owen, S. Michele; Wesolowski, Laura G. ;. File Language: English. Details Personal Author: Corporate Authors: Description: This document updates recommendations for HIV testing by laboratories in the United States and offers approaches for reporting test results to persons ordering HIV tests and to public health authorities. The recommended algorithm is a sequence of tests used in combination to improve the accuracy of the laboratory diagnosis of HIV based on testing of serum or plasma specimens. In brief, testing begins with a combination immunoassay that detects HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen. All specimens reactive on this initial assay undergo supplemental testing with an immunoassay that differentiates HIV-1 from HIV-2 antibodies.

Specimens that are reactive on the initial immunoassay and nonreactive or indeterminate on the antibody differentiation assay proceed to HIV-1 nucleic acid testing for resolution. CDC and the Association of Public Health Laboratories have issued these recommendations based on HIV tests approved by the Food and Drug Administration as of December 2012 and scientific evidence, laboratory experience, and expert opinion collected from 2007 through December 2013. These recommendations do not include the rapid HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody combination test approved by the FDA in August 2013 or HIV-2 nucleic acid tests, which lack FDA approval.

Because none of the assays in the recommended algorithm are FDA-approved for use with oral fluid or dried blood spot specimens, these updated recommendations do not supersede previous recommendations for testing of dried blood spots or oral fluid for HIV-1 using the FDA-approved immunoassay and HIV-1 Western blot for these specimen types.

### A 33-residue peptide tag increases solubility and stability of Escherichia coli produced single-chain antibody fragments [^116A3ej1]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

To construct pET28a-his-G12-scFv-MBP expressing G12-scFv-MBP fusion protein with MBP tag attaching at C-terminus, MBP gene released from pET28-miniDP-MBPH6 plasmid by digestion with KpnI and XbaI was used to replace HA tag gene of pET28a-His-G12-scFv-HA.

pET28a-His-MA18/7-scFv-2×P17 plasmid was constructed by ligation of BamHI-digested pET28a-His-MA18/7-scFv-P17 vector with BamHI/BglII-digested P17 gene amplified by PCR using pET28a-His-MA18/7-scFv-P17 as the template and two primers: P17-BamHI-fwd: 5'-cttacggatccggaggtggcggtagcaagaacgagtccagtacc-3' and P17-BglII-rev: 5'-gtaagagatctaccagccgtattcttgaac-3'.

pET28a-His-MA18/7-scFv-3×P17 plasmid was then obtained by ligation of another copy of BamHI/BglII-digested P17 gene into BamHI-cleavaged pET28a-His-MA18/7-scFv-2×P17 vector. To construct pET28a-His-MA18/7-scFv-HA-P17-A25P plasmid expressing MA18/7-scFv-HA protein attached by a mutated P17 tag with alanine (A) at position 25 substituted by proline (P) at C-terminus, DNA encoding MA18/7-scFv-HA-P17-A25P protein was amplified by PCR using pET28a-His-MA18/7-scFv-HA-P17 plasmid as the template and two primers: G12-VL-NdeI-fwd and P17-A25P-XhoI-rev: 5'-tggaacctcgagtcaaccagccgtattcttgaaccgcttcggttcgtctcg-3', and inserted into pET28a vector by digestion with NdeI and XhoI endonucleases.

### A 33-residue peptide tag increases solubility and stability of Escherichia coli produced single-chain antibody fragments [^113bTJpt]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Plasmid constructs

pET28a-His-G12-scFv-HA, pET28a-His-MA18/7-scFv-HA, and pET28a-His-VRC01-scFv-HA plasmids expressing G12-scFv, MA18/7-scFv, and VRC01-scFv with N and C termini attached respectively by hexahistidine and HA tags have been described. pET28a-His-ADRI-scFv-HA was constructed by replacing the G12-scFv open reading frame (ORF) of pET28a-His-G12-scFv-HA with a customized ADRI-scFv ORFvia digestion with NdeI and BamHI restriction endonucleases.

To construct pET28a-His-G12-scFv-P17 and pET28a-His-MA18/7-scFv-P17 plasmids expressing G12-scFv-P17 and MA18/7-scFv-P17 proteins with the P17 tag directly fused to their termini, the complete G12-scFv-P17 and MA18/7-scFv-P17 ORFs were separately amplified by two runs of PCR. Using pET28a-His-G12-scFv-HA and pET28a-His-MA18/7-scFv-HA as the templates, the first-run PCR products were amplified separately by two pairs of primers: G12-VL-NdeI-fwd: 5'-ggcagccatatggacatcgagctgacccagag-3' plus P17-rev1: 5'-aaacccttggtctcatcgcgccactgctttgtgttcgtagcgttggtactggactcgttcttgctaccgccacctccggat-3' and 18/7-VL-NdeI-fwd: 5'-ggcagccatatggacattgtgatgacccagt-3' plus P17-rev1, and used as the templates for the second run of PCR. Full-length G12-scFv-P17 and MA18/7-scFv-P17 genes were then amplified by two other pairs of primers: G12-VL-NdeI-fwd plus P17-XhoI-rev2: tggaacctcgagtcaaccagccgtattcttgaaccgcttggcttcgtctcggaaacccttggtctcatcgcg-3' and 18/7-VL-NdeI-fwd plus P17-XhoI-rev2 and inserted into pET28a vector by digestion with NdeI and XhoI endonucleases.

### Alzheimer's disease biological PET staging using plasma p217 + tau [^114wCwnX]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The pairwise discrimination of each pair of AD biological PET stages — Initial vs. Early, Early vs. Intermediate, and Intermediate vs. Advanced — yielded lower AUC values than grouped comparisons. The AUC of 0.64 for Initial vs. Early, suggested that p217+tau did not have adequate discriminatory performance for these two stages. The AUC of 0.76, observed in the discrimination between Early and Intermediate stages, falls within an acceptable yet relatively lower range. This highlights that the higher AUC of 0.92 reported for the A-T-/Initial/Early vs. Intermediate/Advanced discrimination is strongly influenced by the inclusion of all lower stages. The same reasoning applies to the AUC of 0.77 for Intermediate vs. Advanced compared to the AUC of 0.91 for Advanced vs. all others.

### Ara h 7 isoforms share many linear epitopes: are 3D epitopes crucial to elucidate divergent abilities? [^1153zzrx]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

3.3 Similar epitope recognition resulted in divergent ability to induce basophil degranulation

In a previous study, the ability to induce basophil degranulation was studied for all Ara h 7 isoforms. 6 Patients D‐23, V‐01, and D‐13 correspond to the patients N07, N12, and N14, respectively, in that study. Even though IgE antibodies from patients D‐23 and V‐01 recognize only epitope E, patient D‐23 having high IgE titres to all full‐length proteins showed overall low degranulation, whereas patient V‐01, also having high IgE titre, showed strong basophil degranulation after stimulation with Ara h 7.0201. Patient D‐13 had a more diverse sIgE recognition profile (epitopes E + D which are present on all Ara h 7 isoforms), and degranulation was induced by Ara h 7.0201 and Ara h 7.0301, although sIgE levels to Ara h 7.0301 were low. These data indicate that IgE recognition patterns of peptides alone cannot elucidate the divergent ability in inducing basophil degranulation.

### Multidisciplinary studies with mutated HIV-1 capsid proteins reveal structural mechanisms of lattice stabilization [^112FqRoL]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Unexpectedly, E45A CA crystallized in two different forms under very similar crystallization conditions. While the overall fold of E45A in both structures is essentially the same, their inter- and intra-hexamer interactions differ; the E45A a structure appears to be stabilized by a novel 3-fold inter-hexamer interface formed between N-terminal domains of the E45A CA (residue R82 in Fig. 2). To our knowledge, this is the first report of C NTD -C NTD inter-hexamer interactions that may be a major factor in the increased stability of the E45A capsid. The differences in intra-hexamer interactions are caused by changes at multiple sites. Loss of interactions between E45 and D51 from the neighboring subunit (Supplementary Fig. 3b vs. e, and f, Supplementary Tables 4 and 5) enables D51 to form H-bonds with either P1 or H12 residue, while remaining virtually unmoved (Fig. 3b). The two different conformations (E45A a and E45A b) are likely the result of differences in the protonation state of H12 (crystals were set at pH ~6.5, near the pKa of H12), which in turn affected the H12-D51 interactions (Supplementary Fig. 3e, f). This is consistent with the proposed effect of pH on the conformation of the β-hairpin. Remarkably, the differences in H12-D51 interactions directly result in significant changes at the top of the pore at the 6-fold symmetry axis, where the β-hairpin was observed in an "open" conformation in E45A a and a "closed" conformation in E45A b (Fig. 3). Likely connected to these rearrangements at the top of the pore, we also observe changes deeper in that channel: specifically, the six R18 side chains are in the "up" conformation in E45A a where the β-hairpin is "open", and in the "down" conformation in E45A b where the β-hairpin is "closed" (Fig. 3c, d). The ring of R18s forms a pore of variable size (~ 11 Å diameter in E45A a), which has been proposed to facilitate transit of negatively charged small molecules (including deoxynucleoside triphosphates, dNTPs) to the interior of HIV-1 E45A capsid. The two solved E45A structures confirm maximum pore flexibility under near physiological conditions. Of note, the E45A structures can only be structurally studied with our crystallographic system of native CA, as the cross-linkable crystallographic system, relies on an engineered disulfide bond between E45C and A14C.

### Update on interleukin-17: a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis and implication for clinical practice [^1147oiqW]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Drug development is complex and takes time. It took 20 years between the discovery of IL-17A in 1995 and the registration of the first IL-17A inhibitor in 2015! This story of IL-17 discovery to IL-17 targeting is a nice example of translational medicine. Some of the clinical results are as anticipated, while others are not as simple. New pathways and molecules have been discovered during these years. More is to come soon and later.

### The induction and function of the anti-inflammatory fate of T17 cells [^115ojfTk]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The consequences of dysfunctional immune adaptation are clear: the immune cells either fail to mount a protective response to lethal infections, or they overreact to non-harmful antigens and in doing so, induce disparate immune mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). It is therefore both fundamentally and clinically relevant to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon of immune adaptation.

T H 17 cells — a subset of CD4 + T cells — exemplify immune adaptation. On the one hand, T H 17 cells can have a full effector function protecting the host from pathogens with the associated risk of developing IMIDs –. On the other hand, T H 17 cells can also acquire an anti-inflammatory fate characterized by secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 –. However, the relevance of this T H 17 anti-inflammatory fate and the consequences of its impairment have not yet been fully explored. T H 17 cells are abundant in the intestine, but it remains to be tested whether by acquiring an anti-inflammatory fate, they contribute to intestinal immune homeostasis by blocking the development of a pathological response and preserving the tissue integrity. Furthermore, whether this anti-inflammatory fate negatively impacts T H 17 mediated immunity to pathogens is also unknown.

### Human T17 cells engage gasdermin E pores to release IL-1 α on NLRP3 inflammasome activation [^117CYDeD]. Nature Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Main

Helper T cells (T H cells) are important enactors of antigen-specific effector responses via their secretion of distinct cytokines. Helper type 17 T cells (T H 17 cells), in particular, are recognized for their antifungal functions through the secretion of their signature cytokine IL-17A, which is regulated by the transcription factor RAR-related orphan receptor (ROR)-γt. They are also the main culprits in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. T H 17 cells have previously been recognized to display functional heterogeneity. Pro- or anti-inflammatory functions are exerted via the differential coexpression of IL-17 with either interferon (IFN)-γ or IL-10, respectively –. Overall, this has shaped the concept of a T H 17 cell dualism and has stimulated investigation into the signals and molecular targets that control the dichotomy between the two functional T H 17 cell outcomes for therapeutic applications. However, a deep understanding of the identity and mechanistic basis of pathogenic versus immunoregulatory T H 17 cell fates remains elusive. Additional, yet-to-be-found effector mechanisms that go beyond IL-17 production might also operate in T H 17 cells with antifungal or antibacterial target specificities.

### An intestinal T17 cell-derived subset can initiate cancer [^115CTNyp]. Nature Immunology (2024). High credibility.

In summary, our work shows a mechanism that protects against intestinal cancer initiation. This mechanism is based on an interplay between IECs and differentiated T H 17 cells, which blocks the continuum of differentiation of pretumorigenic T H 17 cells to a tumorigenic state, protecting IECs against malignant transformation. By identifying TGFβ1 in this preventive mechanism against cancer, this study questions the suitability of cancer immunotherapy strategies that are based on systemic TGFβ1 targeting to restore efficient T cell cytotoxic functions against cancer cells.

### An international multicenter randomized controlled trial of G17DT in patients with pancreatic cancer [^114RGjfU]. Pancreas (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to investigate G17DT, an immunogen producing neutralizing antibodies against the tumor growth factors amidated and glycine-extended forms of gastrin-17, in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, group-sequential multicenter trial of G17DT in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer unsuitable for or unwilling to take chemotherapy. Inclusion criteria were a Karnofsky performance score of 60 or higher and a life expectancy of more than 2 months. Patients received G17DT or placebo emulsion at weeks 0, 1, 3, 24, and 52. The primary end point was survival, and secondary end points were tolerability, Karnofsky performance.

Results

A total of 154 patients were recruited: 79 G17DT and 75 placebo. A final analysis of the intention-to-treat population, using a proportional hazards model, stratifying by disease stage and adjusting for interim analysis, gave a hazard ratio for mortality of 0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.51–1.10, P = 0.138; G17DT/placebo). A conventional analysis without adjustment for disease stage or interim analysis, censoring for chemotherapy and excluding protocol violators, gave median survival periods of 151 (G17DT) and 82 days (placebo) (log-rank test, P = 0.03). Patients developing anti-G17DT responses (73.8%) survived longer than nonresponders or those on placebo (median survival, 176 vs 63 vs 83; log-rank test, P = 0.003). G17DT was well tolerated.

### Drosophila innate immunity: an evolutionary perspective [^115KxwGd]. Nature Immunology (2002). Medium credibility.

In response to microbial infections, Drosophila mounts a multifaceted immune response involving humoral reactions that culminate in the destruction of invading organisms by lytic peptides. These defense mechanisms are activated via two distinct signaling pathways. One of these, the Toll pathway, controls resistance to fungal and Gram-positive bacterial infections, whereas the Imd pathway is responsible for defense against Gram-negative bacterial infections. Current evidence indicates that recognition of infectious nonself agents results from interactions between microbial wall components and extracellular pattern recognition proteins. We discuss here evolutionary perspectives on our present understanding of the antimicrobial defenses of Drosophila.

Specific Virus Antibody Responses and Auto-Antibody Profiling

No specific antibodies against the spike (S) or the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in the blood at day 2 of hospitalization using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. We next performed PhIP-Seq to investigate the historical humoral immune response against other viral and a smaller number of bacterial infections in the patient and observed presence of specific IgG antibodies toward Herpesviridae families (including Epstein-Barr virus and Cytomegalovirus), human respiratory syncytial virus, and cross-reactivity with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) but not with SARS-CoV antigens (Fig. S4). Of note, cross-reactive antibodies to MERS-CoV were similar to our previous observation in adult patients with severe COVID-19. We also measured selected cytokines in the plasma sample from the patient and observed higher levels of TNF and sIL2 as compared to the healthy controls, a pattern that is distinct from patients with typical MIS-C, KD, severe adult COVID-19, or toxic shock syndrome (Fig. S5). Finally, we screened our patient for plasma autoantibodies against multiple IFN species and more than 9000 additional human proteins. No autoantibodies against type I IFNs or IL17 were detected (nor any blocking activity of anti-IFN-α2 and anti-IFN-ω auto-Abs, Table S6–7, Fig. S6), whereas several other putative autoantibody targets were identified, including KLK7 (kallikrein 7), PLAUR (urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor), and S100A1 (S100 calcium binding protein A1, Fig. S7).

### Dissecting the oncogenic roles of keratin 17 in the hallmarks of cancer [^116AUtKm]. Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

There is an unmet need to identify and validate tumor-specific therapeutic targets to enable more effective treatments for cancer. Heterogeneity in patient clinical characteristics as well as biological and genetic features of tumors present major challenges for the optimization of therapeutic interventions, including the development of novel and more effective precision medicine. The expression of keratin 17 (K17) is a hallmark of the most aggressive forms of cancer across a wide range of anatomical sites and histological types. K17 correlates with shorter patient survival, predicts resistance to specific chemotherapeutic agents, and harbors functional domains that suggest it could be therapeutically targeted. Here, we explore the role of K17 in the hallmarks of cancer and summarize evidence to date for K17-mediated mechanisms involved in each hallmark, elucidating functional roles that warrant further investigation to guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

### T17 cell immune adaptation [^117Nuwci]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

At mucosal barriers, the T helper 17 (T H 17) cell population plays a fundamental role in controlling tissue homeostasis. The adaptability of this population to a more pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory function - that is, their functional plasticity and consequently heterogeneity - primarily depends on the environment. We would like to term this process environmental immune adaptation. Interfering with T H 17 cell adaptation leads to pathological consequences, including development of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases or even cancer. Several molecular mechanisms have been shown to participate in this process and recently, a better understanding of the transcriptional and metabolic profiling of T H 17 cells has shed light on a new level of complexity. Here, we offer a summary on the role of T H 17 cell plasticity in inflammatory diseases and cancer as well as the latest discoveries and controversies regarding the mechanisms that control the adaptability of the T H 17 cell population.

### A quantitative modeling and simulation framework to support candidate and dose selection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies to advance bamlanivimab into a first-in-human clinical trial [^116XBUAy]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

To combat this pandemic at the onset and to get treatment to patients as soon as possible, unprecedented pandemic‐ready efforts were taken chronologically for a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of COVID‐19:
Team formation: assembly of expert scientists across functions, including pharmacometric expertise and therapeutic area consultants.
Establishment of criteria for dose selection (rapid reduction in viral load) including mitigation strategy for translational uncertainty for safety and efficacy.
Developing PK/PD models and conducting simulations to determine efficacious doses and doses that would result in maximum reduction in viral load.
A starting dose of 700 mg was used in the first in human study in patients based on the PK/PD modeling presented in this paper. Higher doses were included as additional study arms for further evaluation of safety and to account for translational uncertainty.
Learn and confirm approach throughout the remainder of drug development between 2020 and 2021. Clinical trial data was subsequently obtained (and is still being collected) to further inform and develop the PK/PD model to inform future dose selection to build on the current models that we built with no clinical data of bamlanivimab.
Apply learning to next generation antibody development.

### Structures, functions and adaptations of the human LINE-1 ORF2 protein [^114HTQoc]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

We next compared ORF2p and other proteins with the intention of identifying shared structural features and inferring evolutionary relationships. First, we manually curated a set of 50 experimental protein structures that represented main families: RTs, RdRps, DdDps (DNA-dependent DNA polymerases) and DdDps/RdRps, as well as 'negative controls' that should have little resemblance to the other proteins (Supplementary Table 3). We then sought to represent structural similarity in a manner that would faithfully account for differences in protein length, account for inherent alignment quantity/quality trade-offs, and address a limitation of other methods, such as RMSD, in which different relative orientations of otherwise identical domains result in poor scores. We developed a new information-theoretic algorithm, named 'Plexy', which represents a high-quality alignment as one that reduces the structural perplexity between their coordinates (Supplementary Methods). The smaller this value, the more likely it is that one can 'guess' the coordinates of one structure knowing the coordinates of the other. Plotting structural perplexity from ORF2p RT for this set (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Figs. 12 b, c and 13) showed that it recapitulates close relationships between ORF2p, R2Bm and group II introns, and that 'negative control' proteins have extremely high perplexities from ORF2p. To better understand relationships between full-length ORF2p and other proteins, we computed the pairwise structural distances across all pairs of proteins and normalized them with respect to the size of the two proteins and their alignment, anchoring the plot on the ORF2p crystal structure (Supplementary Methods, Fig. 5e). Across both datasets, proteins in the same functional class typically clustered together in an unsupervised manner, with R2Bm and group II introns again closest to ORF2p. Group IIB introns are thought to be evolutionarily closer to L1 than group IIC, but intriguingly both have similar perplexities from ORF2p with subtle differences in subdomains, highlighting structural conservation (Supplementary Fig. 13). Domesticated cellular RTs were next closest to ORF2p RT, but normalized distances between full-length ORF2p and Prp8 and TERT were larger owing to the incorporation of unrelated structural elements (Supplementary Fig. 12b). Viral RdRps such as HCV and influenza B have remarkable similarity to ORF2p RT; non-LTR and viral RTs are more distant. Notably, the inactive p51 HIV-1/2 RT subunit was predicted to be far more distant to ORF2p than the active p66 HIV-1/2 RT, despite identical amino acid sequence (up to a deletion). Therefore, this analytical framework quantifies conformational similarity in a manner that is sensitive to function.

### Food allergy: a practice parameter update-2014 [^1133Mmy3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Classification of major food allergens (Summary Statement 1) — "Summary Statement 1: Evaluate the patient for possible food allergy with the understanding that a relatively small number of allergens cause a high proportion of food allergy (eg, cow's milk, hen's egg, soy, wheat, peanut, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish). [Strength of recommendation: Strong; B Evidence]". It is generally believed that virtually any food can elicit an IgE-mediated allergic reaction in a predisposed subject, and more than 170 foods have been reported to be allergenic; in order of prevalence, the most common food allergens are milk, egg, peanut, tree nuts, crustacean shellfish, fish, wheat, and soy. The distribution of allergens is highly restricted, representing 2% to 5% of all known structural protein families.
