## Question

What could be the cause of the blood clots?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of blood clots, organized by Virchow's triad and enriched with mechanistic and clinical context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching framework of Virchow's triad to anchor causation. Then, I should verify the key drivers within each pillar: endothelial injury or dysfunction, altered blood flow or stasis, and hypercoagulability of blood constituents. Next, I will integrate special contexts such as cancer, COVID-19, and hormonal therapy, and finally synthesize how these factors converge in arterial versus venous thrombosis and what that implies for prevention and management.

> Let me first confirm the foundational framework. Virchow's triad remains the most robust scaffold for explaining thrombosis risk: endothelial injury/dysfunction, abnormal blood flow/stasis, and hypercoagulability of blood constituents; modern reviews extend this to include inflammation and immunothrombosis, which I should keep in mind as I proceed [^111ShxqZ] [^1152jCTb].

> I will now examine endothelial injury and dysfunction as a primary driver. Atherosclerotic plaque rupture or erosion exposes subendothelial matrix and tissue factor, triggering platelet adhesion and activation and the coagulation cascade; this is the dominant mechanism in arterial thrombosis such as MI and most ischemic strokes, and it aligns with the first element of Virchow's triad [^112tJxkf] [^111ShxqZ]. Hold on, I should verify the role of inflammation here: inflammatory cytokines amplify endothelial activation, upregulate adhesion molecules, and destabilize plaques, reinforcing thrombogenicity at the vessel wall interface [^115HbnVD]. In COVID-19, direct and indirect endothelial injury, ACE2 dysregulation, and cytokine storms create a prothrombotic milieu that explains the high burden of macro- and microvascular thrombosis, which fits the endothelial injury plus hypercoagulability model [^112wS2Uc] [^113huu4T].

> Next, I should review altered blood flow or stasis. Venous stasis from immobilization, surgery, trauma, or atrial fibrillation reduces shear and promotes fibrin-rich thrombi; this is classic for DVT and PE and is well captured by Virchow's stasis component [^113mb6vF] [^114N8BWu]. Wait, let me verify the AF link: loss of atrial systole and chamber dilation in AF create blood stasis and endothelial dysfunction, synergistically elevating thromboembolic risk, which is why anticoagulation is foundational in AF management [^114N8BWu]. I should also note that in COVID-19, ICU immobilization and microvascular sludging contribute to stasis and compound thrombotic risk, again integrating triad elements in a single disease state [^112wS2Uc] [^1134dVkU].

> Now, I need to consider hypercoagulability of blood constituents. Inherited thrombophilias such as factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A increase baseline VTE risk, while acquired states like cancer, pregnancy, nephrotic syndrome, and antiphospholipid syndrome tilt the balance toward thrombosis via increased thrombin generation, impaired fibrinolysis, or endothelial activation [^113wtiL7] [^115vmNyw]. Hold on, I should verify cancer-specific mechanisms: tumor-derived tissue factor, platelet activation, and endothelial injury create a persistent prothrombotic state, explaining the high VTE incidence in malignancy and the rationale for risk-stratified thromboprophylaxis [^112eaxaR] [^1157NvPg]. I also need to check hormonal therapy: estrogen-containing combined oral contraceptives increase VTE risk, especially in the first year of use and in the presence of additional risk factors like smoking or obesity, reflecting shifts in hepatic synthesis of coagulation factors and endothelial function [^113mb6vF] [^115bbbqY].

> Let me integrate how these pillars converge differently in arterial versus venous thrombosis. Arterial thrombosis is typically platelet-rich and driven by endothelial injury from plaque rupture or erosion, with shear-dependent platelet activation and fibrin generation; antiplatelet therapy is therefore central to prevention and treatment in this domain [^112tJxkf] [^111ShxqZ]. In contrast, venous thrombosis is classically fibrin- and RBC-rich and arises from stasis and hypercoagulability; anticoagulation is the mainstay here, though I should acknowledge emerging evidence that platelets and innate immune effectors, including NETs, also participate in venous thrombogenesis, blurring the historical dichotomy [^114G1k6q] [^1152jCTb]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied platelets are irrelevant in venous thrombosis; that would be outdated — platelets and NETs can propagate venous thrombi, so I should correct that and keep a systems view [^1152jCTb].

> I should double-check special contexts that exemplify multi-hit causation. In COVID-19, endothelial injury, stasis from immobility, and marked hypercoagulability with NET-driven immunothrombosis converge, explaining the disproportionate thrombotic burden and the aggressive prophylaxis strategies used in severe disease [^112wS2Uc] [^113huu4T]. In cancer, tissue factor expression, chemotherapy effects, and immobility similarly fulfill all triad elements, necessitating individualized thromboprophylaxis and vigilance for recurrent events [^1118AG1P] [^1157NvPg]. For combined oral contraceptives, estrogen-driven changes in coagulation factors plus behavioral contributors like smoking and immobility create additive risk, which is why risk assessment and counseling are essential before prescribing [^112cLiMm] [^115bbbqY].

> But wait, what if clot structure and biomechanics alter risk and treatment response? Dense fibrin networks with small pores resist lysis and confer mechanical stability, which is clinically relevant in both arterial and venous thrombosis; this structural dimension links upstream drivers to downstream thrombus behavior and informs strategies like catheter-directed thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy in selected patients [^113MUhuT] [^114G1k6q]. I should confirm that ex vivo and in vivo thrombus composition studies corroborate these distinctions: arterial thrombi are more platelet-rich, whereas venous thrombi are RBC- and fibrin-rich, supporting tailored interventional approaches [^114G1k6q].

> Let me reconsider the practical implications for prevention and management, keeping the triad front and center. For arterial thrombosis, prioritize endothelial health and antiplatelet strategies, including risk factor modification and guideline-directed antithrombotic therapy; for venous thrombosis, mitigate stasis and hypercoagulability with mechanical and pharmacologic prophylaxis, and treat with anticoagulation, extending duration based on provocation status and recurrence risk [^111ShxqZ] [^113wtiL7]. Hold on, I should verify that risk stratification tools and biomarkers are increasingly used to personalize prevention and treatment intensity, especially in cancer-associated thrombosis and high-risk surgical populations, aligning interventions with underlying causal pathways [^1118AG1P] [^112G6TaU].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis remains coherent: blood clots arise when endothelial injury, stasis, and hypercoagulability converge, with inflammation and immunothrombosis amplifying risk; the relative contribution of each element determines whether thrombosis manifests as arterial platelet-rich or venous fibrin/RBC-rich disease, and effective care requires mapping interventions to the dominant causal axis in each patient [^111ShxqZ] [^1152jCTb].

Blood clots form when the balance of hemostasis shifts toward thrombosis, driven by **endothelial injury** [^1152jCTb], **altered blood flow** (stasis or turbulence) [^112AzP2g], and **hypercoagulability** (inherited or acquired) [^1133SRy8]. Common triggers include **plaque rupture** in arteries [^112tJxkf], venous stasis from immobility or surgery [^113mb6vF], and systemic hypercoagulability from cancer [^1157NvPg], pregnancy, estrogen therapy [^112cLiMm], or inherited thrombophilias [^1133SRy8]. Additional contributors include inflammation [^115HbnVD], platelet activation [^111XhtQd], and dysregulated fibrinolysis [^117MjPJW]; COVID-19 [^112wS2Uc] and antiphospholipid syndrome [^116ALR4n] are notable causes. Management targets the underlying cause and uses anticoagulants or antiplatelets to restore hemostatic balance [^114vdtBL].

## Virchow's triad: the foundational framework

Virchow's triad explains thrombosis through three interrelated factors: **endothelial injury**, **altered blood flow**, and **hypercoagulability** [^112qWQsk] [^1152jCTb].

---

### Endothelial injury

- **Plaque rupture**: In arteries, atherosclerotic plaque rupture exposes subendothelial tissue factor, activating the coagulation cascade and platelets, causing arterial thrombosis (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke) [^112tJxkf] [^111ShxqZ].

- **Endothelial dysfunction**: Chronic endothelial dysfunction from hypertension, diabetes, smoking, or inflammation increases thrombotic risk [^115BFmmt] [^115HbnVD].

- **Direct injury**: Trauma, surgery, or invasive procedures can directly injure vessels, triggering thrombosis [^113mb6vF].

---

### Altered blood flow

- **Venous stasis**: Immobility, prolonged bed rest, or surgery cause venous stasis, promoting venous thromboembolism (VTE) [^113mb6vF] [^113wtiL7].

- **Atrial fibrillation**: Loss of atrial contraction causes blood stasis in the atria, increasing thromboembolic risk [^114N8BWu].

- **Turbulence**: Arterial turbulence from atherosclerosis or aneurysms promotes thrombosis [^notfound].

---

### Hypercoagulability

- **Inherited thrombophilias**: Factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, antithrombin III deficiency, protein C/S deficiency increase thrombotic risk [^113wtiL7].

- **Acquired hypercoagulability**: Cancer [^112eaxaR], pregnancy, estrogen therapy [^113mb6vF], and antiphospholipid syndrome [^116ALR4n] elevate thrombotic risk.

- **Inflammation and infection**: COVID-19 [^112wS2Uc] and other infections cause hypercoagulability via cytokines and endothelial activation [^117SbM6M].

## Specific causes of blood clots

---

### Arterial thrombosis

Arterial thrombosis is platelet-rich and typically results from **endothelial injury and platelet activation** [^116YjGN2].

| **Cause** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Atherosclerotic plaque rupture | Exposes tissue factor and activates coagulation cascade [^1134dVkU] |
| Atrial fibrillation | Blood stasis in atria promoting thrombus formation [^114N8BWu] |
| Smoking | Endothelial injury and inflammation [^notfound] |
| Hypertension | Endothelial dysfunction and injury [^notfound] |
| Diabetes mellitus | Endothelial dysfunction and inflammation [^notfound] |

---

### Venous thrombosis

Venous thrombosis is fibrin-rich and driven by **stasis and hypercoagulability** [^114G1k6q].

| **Cause** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Immobility or prolonged bed rest | Venous stasis [^113mb6vF] |
| Surgery (especially orthopedic) | Endothelial injury and stasis [^113mb6vF] |
| Cancer | Hypercoagulability and endothelial activation [^1157NvPg] |
| Pregnancy and postpartum | Hypercoagulability and stasis [^113mb6vF] |
| Estrogen therapy (oral contraceptives, hormone replacement) | Hypercoagulability [^113mb6vF] |
| Inherited thrombophilias | Hypercoagulability [^1133SRy8] |
| Obesity | Stasis and inflammation [^1152jCTb] |

---

### Special considerations

- **COVID-19**: Marked hypercoagulability with endothelial injury and stasis causes high thrombotic risk [^112wS2Uc] [^113huu4T].

- **Antiphospholipid syndrome**: Autoantibodies cause hypercoagulability and thrombosis [^116ALR4n].

- **Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)**: Widespread activation of coagulation causes microvascular thrombosis and bleeding [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Understanding causation guides therapy: **antiplatelet agents** for arterial thrombosis and **anticoagulants** for venous thrombosis [^notfound]. Risk-factor modification — treating hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia; smoking cessation; and weight management — reduces thrombotic risk [^115BFmmt]. In high-risk settings (e.g. surgery, immobility, cancer), prophylactic anticoagulation prevents VTE [^1118AG1P].

---

Blood clots result from the interplay of endothelial injury, altered blood flow, and hypercoagulability; specific causes include atherosclerosis, immobility, surgery, cancer, pregnancy, estrogen therapy, inherited thrombophilias, and inflammation. Management targets the cause and restores hemostatic balance with antithrombotic therapy and risk-factor modification [^114vdtBL].

### Advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms that maintain normal haemostasis [^112HoNCw]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Blood clot formation to stem bleeding from an injured blood vessel arises from a complex series of cellular and biochemical events, which, when dysregulated, predispose to an increased risk of thrombosis or bleeding. Similarly, haemostatic regulation of clot growth and size is exquisitely controlled by a series of anticoagulant 'checkpoints', that exert their inhibitory activity at distinct stages in the steps leading to clot formation. Although the major plasma protein constituents required for haemostasis have now been largely elucidated and the molecular events that lead to clot formation are well understood, defining a fuller appreciation of the importance, location and regulation of each haemostatic process remains a fertile area of ongoing research. In this review article, we first provide an overview of the original 'waterfall' or 'cascade' hypothesis of blood coagulation as it was defined in the 1960s. We subsequently discuss how this original model has been refined over time to incorporate accumulating data that has enabled a more nuanced consideration of the role of specific proteins, receptors and lipids in dictating the spatial and temporal development of a blood clot.

Both hyperlipidemia and thrombosis contribute to the risks of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, which are the leading cause of death and reduced quality of life in survivors worldwide. The accumulation of lipid-rich plaques on arterial walls eventually leads to the rupture or erosion of vulnerable lesions, triggering excessive blood clotting and leading to adverse thrombotic events. Lipoproteins are highly dynamic particles that circulate in blood, carry insoluble lipids, and are associated with proteins, many of which are involved in blood clotting. A growing body of evidence suggests a reciprocal regulatory relationship between blood clotting and lipid metabolism. In this review article, we summarize the observations that lipoproteins and lipids impact the hemostatic system, and the clotting-related proteins influence lipid metabolism. We also highlight the gaps that need to be filled in this area of research.

### Arterial thrombosis – insidious, unpredictable and deadly [^112tJxkf]. Nature Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

The formation of blood clots — thrombosis — at sites of atherosclerotic plaque rupture is a major clinical problem despite ongoing improvements in antithrombotic therapy. Progress in identifying the pathogenic mechanisms regulating arterial thrombosis has led to the development of newer therapeutics, and there is general anticipation that these treatments will have greater efficacy and improved safety. However, major advances in this field require the identification of specific risk factors for arterial thrombosis in affected individuals and a rethink of the 'one size fits all' approach to antithrombotic therapy.

### Structure of fibrin: impact on clot stability [^113MUhuT]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2007). Low credibility.

Information on the structural origins of clot stability is necessary for understanding the functions and pathology of fibrin clots and thrombi, but is also important for interpreting correctly the results of a variety of clinical diagnostic systems and technologies used daily to assess the hemostatic potential in patients. Fibrin polymerizes to make clots with a great diversity of structural, biological, physical and chemical properties, depending on the conditions of formation, and correlations have been established between these clot properties and many pathophysiological conditions. Clot stability refers to both viscoelastic properties, which are important because the clot essentially fulfills mechanical functions, and fibrinolytic properties, because the clot must be efficiently dissolved in a timely manner. The structure of the fibrin clot, which can be characterized in terms of a branched network, directly affects the clot's fibrinolytic and viscoelastic properties, which are remarkable and unique among polymers. Basic mechanisms underlying both the mechanical and fibrinolytic characteristics of fibrin are described. Some of the known correlations between clot structure and mechanical and fibrinolytic properties are summarized.

### Triggers, targets and treatments for thrombosis [^111ShxqZ]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

Thrombosis — localized clotting of the blood — can occur in the arterial or the venous circulation and has a major medical impact. Acute arterial thrombosis is the proximal cause of most cases of myocardial infarction (heart attack) and of about 80% of strokes, collectively the most common cause of death in the developed world. Venous thromboembolism is the third leading cause of cardiovascular-associated death. The pathogenic changes that occur in the blood vessel wall and in the blood itself resulting in thrombosis are not fully understood. Understanding these processes is crucial for developing safer and more effective antithrombotic drugs.

Key Points

- RBCs suspended in platelet-depleted plasma undergo aggregation within a thrombin-induced clot and cause platelet-independent clot shrinkage.
- RBC-induced clot shrinkage may reinforce blood clot contraction, especially in thrombocytopenia and/or impaired platelet contractility.

Discussion

Incorporation of RBCs into fibrin clots has important biological consequences, including alterations in fibrin network structure and clot mechanical properties, predisposition to fracture, lytic resistance, and more. Here, we establish a hitherto unknown ability of RBCs embedded into a fibrin network to induce clot shrinkage or contraction.

In the presence of platelet inhibitors applied at highly effective concentrations, there is incomplete inhibition of the contraction process when clots are formed in whole blood, whereas the same inhibitors applied in PRP clots almost fully suppress contraction (Figure 1; supplemental Table 1). These observations have led us to the assumption that RBCs can play a mechanically active role in contraction of blood clots. To test this hypothesis, we have studied macroscopic thrombin-induced clots from reconstituted human blood samples made of PFP and platelet-depleted RBCs. These clots have no detectable platelets, yet they are seen to experience substantial clot shrinkage, exceeding 20% of the initial clot volume within an hour (Figure 2 A). However, any active contractility of RBCs or other cells has been excluded because the clot shrinkage is insensitive to the inhibitors of nonmuscle myosin IIa (blebbistatin) and actin polymerization (latrunculin A) (Figure 3; supplemental Table 2), known to generate traction forces. An alternative explanation for the mechanical activity of RBCs is their aggregation, which was confirmed morphologically in the shrunken clots containing RBCs (Figure 4). Moreover, we have shown directly the mechanical potential of aggregating RBCs and quantified the tensile force generated by the aggregated RBCs within a clot, which was found to be ∼120 pN per 1 RBC, when the steady state is reached (Figure 5). Notably, this number is based on a unidirectional bulk force measurement and does not account for potential redistribution of tensile forces across the 3D structure of the clot. Nevertheless, this rough evaluation is consistent with an earlier study where the adhesion force between 2 RBCs was found to be in the range of 43 to 169 pN. In addition, the mean adhesion force between 2 RBCs in the presence of lipopolysaccharide was determined to be 100 ± 84 pN. Therefore, we have uncovered and quantified the mechanical interactions between aggregating RBCs that generate the forces driving the process of blood clot shrinkage. Theoretically, the fibrin gel may undergo spontaneous shrinkage known as gel syneresis, but this pure physicochemical reaction can be excluded here, because there has been no fibrin clot shrinkage in the absence of RBCs (Figure 6 A).

### Advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of venous thrombosis [^111CFN7Y]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) represents a leading cause of global mortality, however, the determinants that contribute to thrombus development remain incompletely understood. In this review, we discuss the role of inherited abnormalities of blood coagulation in VTE pathogenesis. In addition, we also consider recent emerging data suggesting other molecular and cellular determinants may also contribute. Specifically, we describe the role played by the inflamed endothelium, and the dysregulated responses to inflammatory stimuli that create a platform for pathological clot formation. We review the accumulating evidence that blood cells, contact pathway factors and protein disulphide isomerases all play key roles in VTE development. Finally, we discuss new insights into the role of metabolites arising from commensal gut bacteria and their potential role in facilitating VTE. This overview provides an update on these state-of-the-art developments and the opportunities they provide for new antithrombotic therapies with enhanced efficacy and improved safety profiles.

### Contraction of blood clots is impaired in acute ischemic stroke [^115es4Zr]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Obstructive thrombi or thrombotic emboli are the pathogenic basis of ischemic stroke. In vitro blood clots and in vivo thrombi can undergo platelet-driven contraction (retraction), resulting in volume shrinkage. Clot contraction can potentially reduce vessel occlusion and improve blood flow past emboli or thrombi. The aim of this work was to examine a potential pathogenic role of clot contraction in ischemic stroke.

Approach and Results

We used a novel automated method that enabled us to quantify time of initiation and extent and rate of clot contraction in vitro. The main finding is that clot contraction from the blood of stroke patients was reduced compared with healthy subjects. Reduced clot contraction correlated with a lower platelet count and their dysfunction, higher levels of fibrinogen and hematocrit, leukocytosis, and other changes in blood composition that may affect platelet function and properties of blood clots. Platelets from stroke patents were spontaneously activated and displayed reduced responsiveness to additional stimulation. Clinical correlations with respect to severity and stroke pathogenesis suggest that the impaired clot contraction has the potential to be a pathogenic factor in ischemic stroke.

Conclusions

The changeable ability of clots and thrombi to shrink in volume may be a novel unappreciated mechanism that aggravates or alleviates the course and outcomes of ischemic stroke. The clinical importance of clot or thrombus transformations in vivo and the diagnostic and prognostic value of this blood test for clot contraction need further exploration.

### Guidelines for the use of echocardiography in the evaluation of a cardiac source of embolism [^113uXbsm]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

Type and relative embolic potential of cardiac sources of embolism — echocardiography role: In patients who are at risk for or have already had potentially embolic strokes, the primary role of echocardiography is to establish the existence of a source of embolism, determine the likelihood that such a source is a plausible cause of stroke or systemic embolism, and guide therapy in an individual patient. Cardiac sources of embolism include blood clots, tumor fragments, infected and bland (noninfected) vegetations, calcified particles, and atherosclerotic debris. Conditions that are known to lead to systemic embolization are listed in Table 1 and subdivided into a high-risk and a low-risk group on the basis of their embolic potential. Echocardiography is essential for the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of stroke and systemic embolism.

### Fibrinogen levels and clot properties identify patients who benefit from catheter-directed thrombolysis after DVT [^116yZMXo]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Extensive research by others has revealed numerous determinants of fibrin clot formation and lysis, including genetic and acquired factors (reviewed in Zabczyk et al). Recently, neutrophil extracellular traps, in particular, have emerged as key players in the acute phase of DVT and were shown to affect clot structure and lysis, making them potential determinant of our turbidity parameters. The focus in this study, however, was not on causes of fibrin clot formation and lysis but on its potential diagnostic impact. We recognize the need for further and more extensive studies addressing both mechanistic and diagnostic elements to improve selection of patients who benefit the most from reperfusion therapy.

Our study has some limitations that need to be mentioned. First, this is a substudy, and therefore, it might not have been sufficiently powered for these additional analyses. Second, a substantial number of patients had to be excluded from analysis because of the absence of either the ultrasound assessment or the blood samples, which might have introduced bias because it further deceased our sample size, and we cannot be sure if these missing procedures were selective. Third, fibrin clots could not be formed in some of the blood samples at baseline, due to LMWH use, which is known to affect this assay whereas other anticoagulants do not. Most patient in the CAVA trial used vitamin K antagonists (ie, 82%), which was always initiated together with LMWH until adequate anticoagulation was reached, and some patients had not yet stopped LMWH at the time of blood withdrawal. Moreover, we did not adjust for multiple testing, which could have resulted in false positive results due to random chance (eg, by within-subgroup comparisons in a small study population), implying that our results require further confirmation. Finally, our study did not register various comorbidities or comedications that might influence fibrin clot properties.

### Thrombophilia: common questions on laboratory assessment and management [^1133SRy8]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

Thrombophilia is an inherited or acquired predisposition to thrombosis. This article reviews the clinical manifestations of thrombophilia and addresses common questions on laboratory assessment and management: what are the potential indications for thrombophilia testing, who should be tested, what tests should be requested, when should testing be performed, and how should the test results affect primary prevention, acute therapy, and secondary prophylaxis of thrombosis.

RISKS OF TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

1. Risk of Developing Blood Clots

Blood clots and blockage of blood vessels are one of the most serious side effects of taking oral contraceptives and can cause death or serious disability. Serious blood clots can happen especially if you smoke, are obese, or are older than 35 years of age. Serious blood clots are more likely to happen when you:

First start taking birth control pills
Restart the same or different birth control pills after not using them for a month or more

In particular, a clot in the legs can cause thrombophlebitis and a clot that travels to the lungs can cause a sudden blocking of the vessel carrying blood to the lungs. The risks of these side effects may be greater with desogestrel-containing oral contraceptives, such as Cyred EQ®, than with certain other low-dose pills. Rarely, clots occur in the blood vessels of the eye and may cause blindness, double vision, or impaired vision.

If you take oral contraceptives and need elective surgery, need to stay in bed for a prolonged illness or injury or have recently delivered a baby, you may be at risk of developing blood clots. You should consult your healthcare professional about stopping oral contraceptives three to four weeks before surgery and not taking oral contraceptives for two weeks after surgery or during bed rest. You should also not take oral contraceptives soon after delivery of a baby. It is advisable to wait for at least four weeks after delivery if you are not breastfeeding. If you are breastfeeding, you should wait until you have weaned your child before using the pill. (See also the section on Breastfeeding in GENERAL PRECAUTIONS.)

### Progesterone (Crinone) [^113L4BpV]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Who should not use Crinone?

Do not start using Crinone if you:

Are allergic to progesterone, progesterone-like drugs, or any of the inactive ingredients in the gel (ask a pharmacist if you are not sure about the inactive ingredients in Crinone).
Have unusual vaginal bleeding which has not been evaluated by a doctor.
Have or have had a liver disease.
Have or have had cancer of the breast or genital organs.
Have had a miscarriage and your physician suspects some tissue is still in the uterus.
Have or have had blood clots in the legs, lungs, eyes, or elsewhere.

What are the possible side effects of Crinone? Serious side effects include:

Blood clots. Progestational drug products may increase your chance of having blood clots in your blood vessels. Blood clots can cause:

♦ blood vessel problems (thrombophlebitis)

♦ stroke

♦ loss of your arm or leg

♦ blood clot in your lungs (pulmonary embolus)

♦ heart attack

♦ death
Birth defects. Abdominal wall defect and cleft palate have been reported with Crinone use in early pregnancy. It is not known if these defects were caused by Crinone.

### Red blood cell aggregation within a blood clot causes platelet-independent clot shrinkage [^117TDBAF]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Contraction or retraction of blood clots is the process of clot shrinkage and structural remodeling, that occurs both in vitro and in vivo. It affects the course and outcomes of thrombosis, and is also important in hemostasis. Contraction of blood clots occurs by activated platelets attached to fibrin fibers. Platelet contractility is driven by the interaction of nonmuscle myosin IIA with actin. The intracellular force is transmitted to fibrin via the integrin αIIbβ3, resulting in compaction of the clot. During contraction, a blood clot undergoes redistribution of components, such that the platelet-fibrin meshwork is accumulated at the clot periphery, whereas red blood cells (RBCs) are condensed within the clot coreand become tightly packed to a polyhedral shape, hence named "polyhedrocytes" or "piezocytes".,

The role of RBCs in clot contraction remains poorly understood. The extent and rate of clot shrinkage are inversely related to the volume fraction of RBCs in blood (hematocrit). At the same time, the deformation of RBCs activates the mechanosensitive membrane cationic channels Piezo1, followed by reduction of RBCs in size and surface exposure of phosphatidylserine, increasing the generation of endogenous thrombin, and increased thrombin activity further augments platelet contractility. Notably, blood clot contraction depends not only on the quantity but also on the quality of RBCs, such that RBCs with increased rigidity reduce clot contraction compared with normal softer RBCs.

Analysis of in vitro blood clots and in vivo thrombi has shown that often RBCs comprise the main constituent, sometimes reaching > 80% of the clot volume fraction, although after clot contraction the RBC packing is extremely tight, owing to platelet-induced compression. It is unknown whether RBC aggregation can play a role in blood clot formation and structural rearrangements.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (vienva) [^115bbbqY]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The risk of blood clots is greater in users of combination oral contraceptives compared to nonusers. The risk of abnormal blood clotting increases with age in both users and nonusers of combination oral contraceptives, but the increased risk from the oral contraceptive appears to be present at all ages.

The excess risk of blood clots is highest during the first year a woman ever uses a combined oral contraceptive. This increased risk is lower than blood clots associated with pregnancy. The use of combination oral contraceptives also increases the risk of other clotting disorders, including heart attack and stroke. Blood clots in veins cause death in 1% to 2% of cases. The risk of clotting is further increased in women with other conditions. Examples include: smoking, high blood pressure, abnormal lipid levels, certain inherited or acquired clotting disorders, obesity, surgery or injury with prolonged inactivity or bedrest, recent delivery or second trimester abortion. Discuss with your healthcare provider whether combination oral contraceptives should be stopped before surgery with prolonged inactivity or bedrest.

Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from COC use. This risk increases with age and amount of smoking and is quite pronounced in women over 35. Women who use combination oral contraceptives should be strongly advised not to smoke. If you smoke you should not use combination oral contraceptives.

Statement 6 — anterior rhinoscopy to identify bleeding site: "The clinician should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present) for patients with nosebleeds. Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm". The Action Statement Profile lists "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on observational studies", "Level of confidence in evidence: Medium", "Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm", and "Policy level: Recommendation". Listed benefits include to "Identify a bleeding site that could expedite and focus treatment" and to diagnose other causes, differentiate anterior from posterior nosebleeds, and determine laterality; risks are "Potential trauma to the nose, patient discomfort, cause bleeding with clot removal or manipulation".

The excess risk of blood clots is highest during the first year a woman ever uses a combined oral contraceptive. This increased risk is lower than blood clots associated with pregnancy. The use of combination oral contraceptives also increases the risk of other clotting disorders, including heart attack and stroke. Blood clots in veins cause death in 1% to 2% of cases. The risk of clotting is further increased in women with other conditions. Examples include: smoking, high blood pressure, abnormal lipid levels, certain inherited or acquired clotting disorders, obesity, surgery or injury, recent delivery or second trimester abortion, prolonged inactivity or bed rest. If possible, combination oral contraceptives should be stopped before surgery and during prolonged inactivity or bedrest.

Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events. This risk increases with age and amount of smoking and is quite pronounced in women over 35. Women who use combination oral contraceptives should be strongly advised not to smoke. If you smoke you should talk to your health care professional before taking combination oral contraceptives.

2. Heart attacks and Strokes

Oral contraceptives may increase the tendency to develop strokes or transient ischemic attacks (blockage or rupture of blood vessels in the brain) and angina pectoris and heart attacks (blockage of blood vessels in the heart). Any of these conditions can cause death or serious disability.

Material and methods

For detailed methods, see Section 1 of the supplemental Material.

Platelet-depleted blood clots and dynamics of RBC-induced clot shrinkage

The mixtures of washed RBCs and platelet-free plasma (PFP) from the same donor referred to as platelet-depleted reconstituted blood samples (supplemental Figures 1–3) were clotted to follow subsequent clot shrinkage. Briefly, clot formation and further compaction either in the blood (natural or reconstituted) or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) samples were induced by adding 2 mM CaCl₂ and 1 U/mL human thrombin. The thrombin-activated blood or plasma samples were transferred to cuvettes prelubricated with a residual layer of a detergent to prevent fibrin sticking to the walls. The cuvette was placed into a chamber (37°C) of the thrombodynamics analyzer (HemaCore), and the clot size was tracked for 60 minutes. The serial clot images were converted computationally into kinetic curves (relative extent of clot shrinkage vs time) that were analyzed for the extent of clot contraction/shrinkage at the end point (60 minutes), area under the curve, average velocity of clot contraction/shrinkage, and the lag time (supplemental Figure 4).

Measurement of tension generated by platelet-depleted blood clots

Clots from reconstituted platelet-depleted blood samples were formed between horizontal rheometer plates, and the clot tension was measured continuously as a negative normal (vertical) pulling force. The RBC-related tension was determined as the difference between the maximal normal forces generated by the clots in the presence and absence of RBCs.

### Novel mechanisms that regulate clot structure / function [^117MjPJW]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

The structure and function of the blood clot has been associated with altered risk of thrombosis. Dense fibrin structures with small pores increase the risk of thrombosis, and have major functional consequences by increasing the resistance to fibrinolysis and altering the visco-elastic properties of the clot. However, while the structural changes to the overall fibrin network have been extensively characterised, little is known regarding the intrafibrillar structure of fibrin, the way protofibrils are arranged inside the fibrin fibers and the functional consequences of this. This brief paper aims to review recent findings regarding novel mechanisms that regulate fibrin intrafibrillar structure, including the degree of protofibril packing, their functional consequences, and the effects of FXIII activation on clot structure and thrombosis. It is concluded that fibrin intrafibrillar structure represents a major novel mechanism that influences clot structure and stability. Future studies are required to investigate the role of fibrin intrafibrillar structure in the functional characteristics of the blood clot, and in diseases of bleeding and thrombosis.

### Dynamic imaging of blood coagulation within the hematoma of patients with acute hemorrhagic stroke [^112w3rf1]. Stroke (2024). Medium credibility.

The rate of blood coagulation plays a critical role in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). ICH causes brain injury directly by tissue compression and mass effect. The components of extravasated blood also pose injury to surrounding tissue. – Beyond direct cellular injury, perihematomal edema (PHE) also causes tissue compression.– Animal studies have demonstrated that the formation of a blood clot within the hematoma is directly linked to the formation of cerebral edema. – Thus, there is a dynamic interaction involving coagulation. On the one hand, nonclotted blood results in less pronounced edema and thus a potentially better outcome. On the other hand, noncoagulated blood may lead to hematoma expansion (HE) that can worsen outcomes. Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are routinely used in the evaluation of hematoma location, size, and PHE expansion but have not been used to evaluate clot formation within the hematoma. The ability to evaluate clot formation in ICH could accelerate clinical intervention in these patients.

Recent progress in quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) — an advanced MRI image-processing technique — enabled accurate estimation of iron-induced magnetic susceptibility (χ). – A blood clot is a combination of aggregated red blood cells (RBCs), Hb (hemoglobin), fibrin, platelets, hemosiderin, leukocytes, platelets, and other damage-associated cellular debris. After RBC lysis, the heme iron oxidation state changes from oxyhemoglobin to deoxyhemoglobin followed by an intracellular or extracellular methemoglobin, and finally, hemosiderin results in a dynamic signal heterogeneity as hematoma evolves. – The unpaired iron electrons present in an aggregated RBC's deoxyhemoglobin induce magnetic susceptibility. Therefore, a region with a higher number of aggregated deoxyhemoglobin molecules of the retracted clot will exhibit a higher positive susceptibility in comparison to the regions with fewer deoxyhemoglobin molecules. We hypothesized that coagulated blood exhibits a higher positive susceptibility than liquid blood within the hematoma and the surrounding PHE (which is made of predominantly a diamagnetic water molecule) exhibits negative susceptibility. Furthermore, voxels with coagulated blood will increase localized diffusion hindrance that is consistent with increase in susceptibility. Previously, both in vivo and in vitro imaging of hematoma and animal blood clot phantom has reported a significantly higher susceptibility. – In this prospective serial MRI study, we aimed to evaluate the progression of coagulation within the hematomas of patients with acute ICH to develop a noninvasive imaging biomarker for coagulopathy.

American Society of Hematology 2019 sickle cell disease — evidence and benefit–harm profile for hydroxyurea plus erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in chronic kidney disease: Safety was examined in 3 studies (total n = 56), with only 1 of 56 patients (1.8%) experiencing worsening SCD-related symptoms or other adverse events, while hemoglobin improvement was reported in 5 observational studies (total n = 29), including an increase in tagged red blood cell mass in 2 patients and increased hemoglobin in 3 patients. Potential benefits are described as moderate based on a case series (n = 52), and 1 case report showed reduced transfusion needs. Potential harms are probably minimal, with no observed blood clots, adverse cardiovascular outcomes, or hypertension, and the panel notes hemoglobin treatment thresholds may need to be lower in SCD. Despite these signals, the panel concludes the overall certainty in the evidence of effects is very low, emphasizing hydroxyurea's importance while weighing theoretical hyperviscosity risks with careful monitoring.

### Ubiquitous clot contraction blockers hit ubiquitin and more [^113zDTTq]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The benefits of inhibition of blood clot contraction in vivo are that therapeutic thrombolysis will be more effective, because thrombi will be more permeable and accessible to thrombolytic enzymes and other drugs, and thrombi will be less stiff, stable, and potentially easier to remove via mechanical thrombectomy. The success of these studies suggests that, in the future, it may also be worth considering a screen for drugs to increase blood clot contraction, which would make thrombi less obstructive and less likely to embolize.

Overall, the results of the assay are not only of great potential practical importance, but they are quite thought provoking. Most importantly, the authors found a long list of candidate inhibitors that could form the basis for many years of further research on platelet function, including contractility and mechanotransduction. Some compounds in the list that are not even mentioned in the text are intriguing. For example, one hit has as its target calpain, which appears to play a role in clot contraction by releasing the connection between the cytoskeleton and platelet integrins to allow more cycles of contractility, similar to what it does in cell motility. After a period of relative inactivity in research on blood clot contraction, this process has become an intensely studied aspect of hemostasis and thrombosis, and the future of investigation in this area is bright.

### Mechanistic view of risk factors for venous thromboembolism [^112AzP2g]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2012). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism is an episodic disease with an annual incidence of 2 to 3/1000 per year that is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Risk factors for venous thromboembolism come in many guises. They fit into an extended version of Virchow's triad and they tilt the hemostatic balance toward clot formation. This can be achieved by decreasing blood flow and lowering oxygen tension, by activating the endothelium, by activating innate or acquired immune responses, by activating blood platelets, or by increasing the number of platelets and red blood cells or modifying the concentrations of pro- and anticoagulant proteins in the blood. In this narrative review we will discuss the known common risk factors within this pathophysiological framework.

### Basic science research opportunities in thrombosis and hemostasis: communication from the SSC of the ISTH [^1152jCTb]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

3.2.3 Venous thrombosis

Venous thromboembolism is a multifactorial, chronic disorder associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, resulting in a major burden to health care and the economy (Table 2). Every year, there are approximately 10 million cases of VTE worldwide, with approximately 60% of VTE cases manifesting during or after hospitalization. A recent report from the American Heart Association and the ISTH highlights the future research priorities in VTE.VTE increases exponentially with age, and is dramatically elevated in individuals over 55 years.VTE is also associated with several disease states, with active cancer accounting for approximately 20% of the overall incidence of VTE. Importantly, cancer is a major cause of death in VTE patients and vice versa. Obesity is associated with a 2‐ to 5‐fold increase in VTE compared to individuals within the normal body mass index range, and similar significant increases in VTE are noted in metabolic syndrome, and diabetic patients. The relationship between VTE and pathogenic infections has been an area of interest for some years but has jostled to the forefront by way of the COVID‐19 pandemic. VTE is now largely considered an immunothrombotic condition that may arise from changes associated with pathogenic infection or during sterile inflammatory states. To manage the burden of VTE in our society, it is imperative that we acquire a solid understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie this condition.

Elucidating the pathophysiology of VTE has been challenging due to the lack of models and tools available to replicate the complex underlying mechanisms. The German clinician Rudolf Virchow first described three key factors that predispose an individual to VTE, including venous stasis, a hypercoagulable state, and endothelial dysfunction, collectively known as "Virchow's triad". Virchow recognized that most diseases are caused by changes at the cellular level, underscoring the importance of fundamental research in this area. Blood rheology very much determines the fate of a (venous) clot, and the strength of the thrombus. With structure–function research of proteins involved in the thrombotic process, novel targets for treatment may be identified. The involvement of platelets in venous thrombosis has gained traction recently. Similarly, the participation of other cells in the venous thrombotic process has received renewed interest, particularly perturbations in the endothelial layer, interactions between RBCs and the fibrin, and the role of NETs.

### Clinical aspects of platelet inhibitors and thrombus formation [^111XhtQd]. Circulation Research (2007). Low credibility.

The platelet, once thought to be solely involved in clot formation, is now known to be a key mediator in various others processes such as inflammation, thrombosis, and atherosclerosis. Supported by the wealth of evidence from clinical trials demonstrating their benefits in patient outcomes, antiplatelet agents have become paramount in the prevention and management of various diseases involving the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial systems. Despite being among the most widely used and studied classes of medical therapies, new discoveries regarding important clinical aspects and properties of these agents continue to be made. As our understanding of platelet biology expands, more effective and safer novel therapies continue to be developed. The use of more refined agents in conjunction with a better understanding of their effects will further the ability to provide more optimized care on an individual basis.

### COVID-19 and respiratory system disorders: current knowledge, future clinical and translational research questions [^112wS2Uc]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

It is not surprising that overwhelming viral infection results in increased clot formation. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are immobilized, have endothelial injury perhaps in part due to direct viral infection, and are hypercoagulable (see above), thus meeting all criteria of Virchow's triad. Viral PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular pattern) trigger pathways involving pattern recognition receptors.DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns) and cytokines promote an increase in the number of circulating neutrophils and monocytes, which induces hypercoagulability. In a mouse model of venous thrombosis due to reduced flow, the coagulation system generates clot in cooperation with platelets, leukocyte-derived TF (tissue factor), and NETs (neutrophil extracellular traps). The apparent unusually high incidence of macroscopic and microvascular thrombosis may be due to a perfect storm of excessive immobility, endothelial damage from both direct viral infection and indirect effects of cytokines and leukocyte activation, and a markedly hypercoagulable state of blood due to intense stimulation of endothelium and mononuclear cells to increase release of factors, such as vWF, factor VIII, and TF.

The extent of macrovascular and microvascular thrombosis in COVID-19 is striking, suggesting that in addition to the factors noted above, there may be other SARS-CoV-2–specific mechanisms at play. Direct infection of endothelium might be such a factor. ACE2 is detected by immunohistochemistry on vascular endothelium; however, single-cell sequencing does not confirm ACE2 or TMPRSS2 expression in endothelium. Ex vivo experiments on explants do not demonstrate endothelial infection.SARS-CoV-2 infection causes downregulation of ACE2, a negative regulator of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II upregulates platelet activator inhibitor 1 expression and increased angiotensin II causes microvascular thrombosis. – There is evidence that NET formation is increased in patients with COVID-19, and several preclinical and approved drugs (such as colchicine) might reduce NET formation. NETs can increase coagulation in several ways, including thrombin generation and platelet adhesion. SARS-CoV-2 increases NET formation as evidenced by increased concentrations of myeloperoxidase-DNA and citrullinated histone H3. The prothrombotic state in inflammation can be worsened both by oxidative stress and hypoxia-inducible factors.

RISKS OF TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

1. Risk of developing blood clots

Blood clots and blockage of blood vessels are one of the most serious side effects of taking oral contraceptives and can cause death or serious disability. In particular, a clot in the legs can cause thrombophlebitis and a clot that travels to the lungs can cause a sudden blocking of the vessel carrying blood to the lungs. Rarely, clots occur in the blood vessels of the eye and may cause blindness, double vision, or impaired vision.

If you take oral contraceptives and need elective surgery, need to stay in bed for a prolonged illness or injury or have recently delivered a baby, you may be at risk of developing blood clots. You should consult your healthcare professional about stopping oral contraceptives three to four weeks before surgery and not taking oral contraceptives for two weeks after surgery or during bed rest. You should also not take oral contraceptives soon after delivery of a baby. It is advisable to wait for at least four weeks after delivery if you are not breastfeeding or four weeks after a second trimester abortion. If you are breastfeeding, you should wait until you have weaned your child before using the pill. (See also the section on Breastfeeding in General Precautions.)

When you should not use Prochieve

If you are allergic to progesterone, progesterone-like drugs, or any of the inactive ingredients in the gel (ask a pharmacist if you are not sure about the inactive ingredients in Prochieve®).
If you have unusual vaginal bleeding which has not been evaluated by a doctor.
If you have a liver disease.
If you have known or suspected cancer of the breast or genital organs.
If you have a miscarriage and your physician suspects some tissue is still in the uterus.
If you have or have had blood clots in the legs, lungs, eyes, or elsewhere.

Risks of Prochieve

Risk to the fetus. Birth defects have been reported in the offspring of women who were using Prochieve® during early pregnancy. These included an abdominal wall defect and a cleft palate. A causal association has been neither confirmed nor refuted. You should check with your doctor about the risks to your unborn child of any medication used during pregnancy.
Blood clots and related health problems. Blood clots have been reported with the use of estrogens and progestational drugs (alone or in combination). If blood clots do form in your bloodstream, they can cut off the blood supply to vital organs, causing serious problems. These problems may include a stroke (by cutting off blood to part of the brain), a heart attack (by cutting off blood to part of the heart), a pulmonary embolus (by cutting off blood to part of the lungs), or other problems. Any of these conditions may cause death or serious long-term disability. Call your doctor immediately if you suspect you have any of these conditions. He or she may advise you to stop using this drug.

### Investigation of outpatients referred to a chemical pathologist with potential pseudohyperkalaemia [^1116kX2n]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Pseudohyperkalaemia is when the in vitro blood potassium concentration is artefactually raised while the in vivo concentration is normal. With unexplained hyperkalaemia, pseudohyperkalaemia needs to be excluded to avoid unnecessary and potentially detrimental therapy. There are numerous causes, but no systematic approach for the investigation of outpatients with potential pseudohyperkalaemia exists in the literature.

Aims

To evaluate the in-house protocol.

Methods

Patients referred for investigation of potential pseudohyperkalaemia underwent an outpatient based protocol which is designed to determine whether the cause was due to delayed blood separation, clotting, centrifugation or a haematological abnormality.

Results

32 patients with serum potassium of 5.5–7.1 mmol/l were referred. All patients had pseudohyperkalaemia; the most frequent causes were full blood count (FBC) abnormalities (28%), time > 4 hours from sampling to centrifugation (28%) and sample clotting (25%). Anaemia was more likely to be found in male patients.

Conclusion

Before a problem can be treated, it must be confirmed and its aetiology identified. A systematic approach to investigate potential pseudohyperkalaemia has been presented. This confirmed the clinician's suspicion of pseudohyperkalaemia and in the majority of patients the aetiology was also identified. The use of serum and plasma potassium with an FBC in the initial investigation will identify whether clotting or a haematological abnormality is the cause in about half of the cases. Assay of whole-blood potassium is less important as centrifugation is a rare cause. Time to centrifugation is likely to play a major part in the majority of the remaining cases.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome in pregnancy: a comprehensive literature review [^116ALR4n]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 1983, it was described for the very first time as an acquired type of thrombophilia, a new pathology mediated by autoantibodies, the so-called antiphospholipid syndrome. APS may manifest as a primary, isolated condition or as a secondary disorder in conjunction with other autoimmune diseases, notably systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Besides the dysfunction of the immune system which is one of its main causes, by producing pathogenic antibodies, the dysregulation of the complement also appears to be involved.

Later, a less common and extremely severe form of this pathology was described, known as catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS). In these critical cases, the dysfunction of small vessels supplying vital organs leads to widespread organ damage and potentially multiorgan failure. However, this form is very rare, affecting less than 1% of the patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, but one of its possible triggers is pregnancy. Recent research shows that rare mutations in complement regulatory genes may play an important role in driving CAPS. These genetic changes seem to trigger excessive complement activation, which, together with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), creates a vulnerability to the sudden, widespread clotting events that define CAPS.

The syndrome presents in two primary forms: thrombotic APS, marked by blood clots in both venous and arterial vessels, and obstetric APS (OAPS). Obstetric APS affects pregnancy outcomes at different stages. Santacruz et al. describe early complications, such as recurrent miscarriage in the first trimester, due to antiphospholipid antibodies disrupting trophoblast function. In later stages, placental dysfunction leads to risks like preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction, premature birth, and perinatal mortality may also occur.

The underlying pathophysiology of APS is commonly explained through the "two-hit" model, in which antiphospholipid antibodies initially cause endothelial dysfunction, while a secondary environmental factor precipitates clinical symptoms ​. While the criteria for APS diagnosis emphasize specific clinical and laboratory findings, recent research highlights the variability in antibody profiles and the potential for seronegative APS cases, complicating both diagnosis and management. This underscores the need to investigate non-traditional antibodies to improve the diagnosis and management of complex APS cases.

### Exploring opportunities for primary prevention of unprovoked venous thromboembolism: ready for prime time? [^113wtiL7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a major health burden. Annually in the United States there are an estimated 857 000 deaths from deep vein thrombosis, 370 000 from pulmonary embolisms, and 52 000 with VTE among the listed causes of death. 1 The lifetime VTE risk is 1 in 12 US adults. 2 Care of each VTE costs $18 000 to $23 000, 3 for $7 to $10 billion in US total annual cost.

Depending on the population and definition, 4 approximately one half to two thirds of VTEs have strong triggering or persistent risk factors and are classified as "provoked". 1 The remaining one third to one half are classified as "unprovoked", as they occur without warning or identifiable causes, typically outside of a medical setting. Major identified causes of VTE include inherited traits (eg, thrombophilias, such as factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A mutation), acquired long‐term risk factors (eg, relative immobility, cancer, inflammatory conditions, obesity), and acute triggers (eg, hospitalization, surgery, immobilization, pregnancy/puerperium, long distance travel). 5, 6 Lifestyle factors have generally been considered minor contributors to VTE.

### Pathophysiology of venous thrombosis [^117N4it6]. Thrombosis Research (2009). Low credibility.

Using Virchow's triad as framework, it is clear that alterations in any of its components (blood composition, the vessel wall, and blood flow) can influence the propensity for the development of venous thromboembolism. Each can also influence the others in ways that enhance or reduce thrombotic propensity. While past work has concentrated on blood components that influence thrombogenicity, their influences generally are manifest only after the thrombotic process has begun, and it is initiation of thrombosis on the vessel wall that is the least well understood. This brief review attempts to link risk factors such as stasis and cancer to the mechanisms that initiate thrombosis.

Rarely, clots occur in the blood vessels of the eye and may cause blindness, double vision, or impaired vision.

If you take oral contraceptives and need elective surgery, need to stay in bed for a prolonged illness, or have recently delivered a baby, you may be at risk of developing blood clots. You should consult your doctor about stopping oral contraceptives three to four weeks before surgery and not taking oral contraceptives for two weeks after surgery or during bed rest. You should also not take oral contraceptives soon after delivery of a baby. It is advisable to wait for at least four weeks after delivery if you are not breastfeeding. If you are breastfeeding, you should wait until you have weaned your child before using the pill. (See also the section on Breastfeeding in GENERAL PRECAUTIONS .)

2. Heart Attacks and Strokes

Oral contraceptives may increase the tendency to develop strokes (stoppage or rupture of blood vessels in the brain) and angina pectoris and heart attacks (blockage of blood vessels in the heart). Any of these conditions can cause death or disability.

### Extent of intravital contraction of arterial and venous thrombi and pulmonary emboli [^116KrZ8E]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Formation of blood clots is followed by their volumetric shrinkage, known as contraction or retraction, driven by forces generated by the platelet cytoskeleton that are transmitted to fibrin fibers. The contraction of blood clots and thrombi can occur not only in vitro but also in vivo as a pathophysiologic process that improves hemostasis, increases blood flow past otherwise obstructive thrombi, prevents thrombotic embolization, alters clot susceptibility to fibrinolysis, and has other clinical implications.

In the course of contraction, blood clots undergo structural changes, including 2 major morphological consequences. First, the contractile forces compress RBCs, resulting in their deformation from initially biconcave to a polyhedral shape (polyhedrocytes). Second, clot contraction is followed by spatial redistribution of components, such that RBCs are packed tightly in the interior part while a meshwork of fibrin and platelets accumulates at the exterior. The unusual structural features of blood clots undergoing contraction were first revealed with clots formed in vitro, but later, similar changes were found in ex vivo thrombi of various origins.

Despite these studies of the structural changes of blood clots and thrombi during contraction, some important questions remain unanswered. What is the actual extent of shrinkage of in vivo blood clots and thrombi? How do the structural changes relate to the degree of blood clot contraction? Is it possible to estimate the extent of intravital contraction of thrombi based on their composition and structure? Answering these questions would help to better understand the pathophysiology of thrombosis and have great clinical significance.

In this study, we have conducted a quantitative analysis of the structure and composition of in vitro clots at different known degrees of contraction. Based on these data, we created a graphic "ruler" that allows converting the results of cellular morphometry to the degree of contraction for a blood clot or thrombus. Then, we applied this "contraction ruler" to ex vivo arterial and venous thrombi and thrombotic emboli to assess the extent of their intravital contraction. A comparative analysis of the data obtained enabled us to propose associations between the extent of contraction of entire thrombi or thrombus parts with their age, embologenicity, and origins.

### Red blood cell aggregation within a blood clot causes platelet-independent clot shrinkage [^114jT3PW]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Comparative kinetic curves of platelet-driven clot contraction in whole blood (black) vs PRP (red) in the absence (control) and presence of the following platelet inhibitors. 1 μM PGE 1 (A), 200 μM blebbistatin (B), 100 μg/mL abciximab (C), 4 μM latrunculin A (D), 10 μM atopaxar (E), and 25 μM tirofiban (F). Note that the inhibitory effects on clot contraction in whole blood are only partial, whereas in PRP the inhibition is complete. The citrated blood or plasma samples were preincubated with the inhibitors at 37°C for 3 minutes before the initiation of clotting and clot contraction by thrombin (1 U/mL). The averaged curves from 4 or 5 experiments with blood samples from independent donors are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean.

These results suggest that blood clot compaction may be caused by RBCs and that this effect, unlike the platelet-driven clot compression, is unrelated to the intracellular contractile actomyosin machinery associated with αIIbβ3-mediated transmission of the traction force to the extracellular fibrin network.

To rule out the possibility that the difference in the inhibitors' efficacy between whole blood and PRP was because of absorbance by RBCs, requiring higher concentrations, we performed experiments on whole blood clot contraction at various concentrations of the inhibitors and plotted the dose-response data (supplemental Figure 6). The results show that at the final concentrations > 100 μM for blebbistatin, > 2 μM for latrunculin A, > 50 μg/mL for abciximab, > 5 μM for atopaxar, and > 10 μM tirofiban, the final extent of contraction remained constant at a level of ∼20% to 25%. Therefore, the results obtained confirm that the distinct difference in sensitivity to the inhibitors between whole blood and PRP is real and not because of a concentration shift.

The results obtained confirm the key role of platelet contractility, but they also suggest that there are noncontractile cellular reactions, likely related to the presence of RBCs, that can also contribute to the fibrin clot shrinkage.

### Management of dyslipidemia for cardiovascular disease risk reduction: synopsis of the 2020 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^115BFmmt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Dyslipidemia is defined by risk for cardiovascular disease — cardiovascular disease (CVD) is described as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and globally, with most CVD caused by atherosclerosis that builds plaque in arterial walls, narrowing the lumen and increasing the risk of chronic and acute ischemia; if a plaque ruptures, a blood clot may obstruct oxygenated blood flow to the heart or brain, resulting in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke, with potentially irreversible tissue damage; control and reduction of CVD risk factors, including high cholesterol levels, elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance, elevated blood glucose levels, smoking, poor dietary habits, and a sedentary lifestyle, can contribute to a reduction in CVD morbidity and mortality, and for the purposes of this guideline, CVD includes atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

### Reducing inappropriately suspended VTE prophylaxis through a multidisciplinary shared learning programme and electronic prompting [^112qWQsk]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Background

VTE describes the formation of blood clots within the venous system, which can subsequently dislodge and travel to other areas of the body. A potentially life-threatening sequelae is pulmonary embolus — occlusion part of the arterial supply to the lung. The risk of thrombus formation is described by Virchow's triad — blood stasis, hypercoagulability and endothelial injury — each of which can be augmented during hospital admission.

There has been considerable effort to prevent VTE cases in hospital, predominantly through prescribing of mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis. The most widely used method is low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) — a subcutaneous one time per day injection that does not require routing haematological monitoring. Its mechanism of action involves potentiating antithrombin — a protease inhibitor which impedes the function of factor Xa in the clotting pathway.

Each patient admitted should be risk assessed for VTE and bleeding concordantly before pharmacological prophylaxis is administered. While different trusts use their own scoring criteria, they are based on national guidelines produced by the department of health.

Several initiatives have been employed to try and increase VTE risk assessment and prescribing uptake for hospital inpatients on admission, including patient education, visual prescribing aids, electronic promptsand real time audit/feedback(for extensive review, see Lau and Haut). However, there has been relatively little focus on the monitoring of VTE prophylaxis after admission. Of particular concern is the cohort of patients that have their LMWH periodically suspended due to bleeding risk, but this risk is not reviewed again in a timely manner resulting in thromboembolic risk. While some of the aforementioned methods may help to reduce this problem, to our knowledge there is no study which evaluates their efficacy in this regard.

Coagulopathy is inextricably linked to the field of hemostasis and thrombosis. In the same manner hemostasis and thrombosis may deal with bleeding and clot formation, coagulopathy also may be connected to bleeding or thrombosis, depending on the circumstances. However, when the same designation, "coagulopathy", may represent two clinically distinct presentations, it can create confusion. It is our obligation as hemostasis and thrombosis specialists to scotch this dubiety and direct the correct usage of coagulopathy.

### Thrombosis, translational medicine, and biomarker research: moving the needle [^112G6TaU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Thrombosis and thromboembolism are the principal causes of acute cardiovascular disease, including ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and venous thromboembolism (VTE)‐related organ damage. Worldwide, thrombotic diseases are leading contributors to long‐term morbidity and death.

Tremendous progress has been made over the past 30 years with respect to the diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment of VTE. Advanced imaging techniques, numerous risk prediction models (RPMs), enhanced risk stratification, a shift toward outpatient management and an ever‐expanding armamentarium of antithrombotic treatments have yielded real progress with respect to patient‐centered care and tangible improvements in clinically relevant outcomes. Likewise, advances in the cardiovascular sciences have improved our understanding of the mechanisms underlying atherothrombosis, as well as its diagnosis and management. State‐of‐the‐art imaging modalities enable the early detection of atherothrombotic lesions, while personalized preventive measures are more easily implemented through improved risk stratification. Breakthroughs in antithrombotic therapy have substantially reduced the incidence of arterial thrombotic events. With proof of principle for dual pathway inhibition as a therapeutic strategytargeting both platelet activation and fibrin formation, cardiovascular medicine has refocused its attention on the molecular mechanisms underpinning these pathways, aiming to improve patient outcomes using biomarker‐directed approaches.

The National Institutes of Health Definitions Working Group defines a biomarker as "a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological responses to a therapeutic intervention". To be sure, biomarker research and translational science have played a foundational role in advancing our understanding of physiology, pathobiology, treatment, and disease management as it relates to both VTE and arterial thromboembolism (ATE). Yet the path from bench to bedside is laden with obstacles. The number of biomarkers that have made their way from in vitro biological research–based tools to that of a validated, standardized and clinically actionable assay is concerningly small. Herein, we sought to summarize and discuss the status of biomarker‐based ATE‐ and VTE‐directed research and outline barriers to future discovery. We also aimed to highlight new approaches geared toward revolutionizing the uptake of biomarker research and optimizing implementation in practice.

### Thrombogenic potential of picomolar coagulation factor XIa is mediated by thrombin wave propagation [^111zvgf8]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we showed that picomolar quantities of exogenous FXIa (1 pM equivalent to 1.7 mIU/mL) may not be able to initiate coagulation in vitro, in circulating blood or living mice. However, when coagulation is triggered by TF or thrombin, the thrombogenic potential of these FXIa doses is revealed through increased TG, accelerated growth of fibrin clots and thrombi in circulating blood, and formation of a spatio-temporal wave of thrombin inside the growing clots. Our results are in agreement with data presented by Grundmann et al, who also observed the procoagulant activity of subpicomolar FXIa concentrations with a modified TG method in diluted plasma supplemented with excess lipids.

Our study was inspired by earlier investigations on unexpected TAEs in patients receiving IG products, which established a connection between FXIa administration (in the form of impurities in the administered pharmaceutical product) and thrombosis in humans. Although it was not possible to measure the amount of FXIa that is definitively responsible for TAEs, our analysis of TAE-associated IG lots pointed to picomolar levels of FXIa. In this study, we demonstrated that subpicomolar levels (∼ 1 mIU/mL) of FXIa can promote clot growth. The thrombogenicity of these small traces of FXIa is likely driven by (1) the relative persistence of FXIa activity, as observed in in vitro and mouse experiments and (2) FXIa's ability to facilitate the initial TG (as triggered by either TF or thrombin existing inside the clot) and expand it into a sustained wave of thrombin that moves within the clot, ultimately potentiating clot growth.

Recommendation-specific supportive text for epistaxis — Technique emphasizes sustained pressure and positioning: "The treatment of nosebleeds (epistaxis) involves having the person sit down and continuously hold the lower third or soft portion of the nose pinched closed to help the blood clot". "Leaning forward stops blood from entering the airway (which can cause trouble breathing) or the stomach (which can cause vomiting)". "The bleeding person should be instructed to breathe through their mouth and spit out any blood". Effectiveness and potential complications are noted: "Nasal pressure alone is the only intervention required in the vast majority of cases, including 20% of cases managed in EDs". and "Ongoing epistaxis can lead to anemia and shock due to blood loss". Trauma considerations are highlighted: "Traumatic epistaxis is a form of craniofacial trauma and may be associated with traumatic brain injury and facial bone fractures". and "Signs of traumatic brain injury, including loss of consciousness, altered mental status, repeated vomiting, change in vision, difficulty moving or walking, or severe headache, indicate the potential for a medical emergency requiring activation of the emergency response system". Medication-related risk is described: "Patients taking either anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy, including aspirin, are at increased risk of severe epistaxis and hospital admission compared with patients not on these medications, and often have multiple comorbidities". and "Nosebleed in these patients is more likely to require intervention from a health care professional than those not taking anticoagulant medication".

### Clotting problems: diagnosis and management of underlying coagulopathies [^113KrS4Z]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Vessel wall injury, stasis, and blood hypercoagulable state are major predisposing factors of thrombosis. Although, a procoagulable factor is found in half of patients with venous thromboembolism, relatively little is known about coagulopathies that predispose to arterial thromboembolism or unexplained arterial revascularization thrombosis. Those hypercoagulable states can be inherited or acquired and related to either an increase of a procoagulable factor or a decrease of an anticoagulation agent. However, most thrombotic episodes seem to occur with additive combination of acquired and inherited predisposing factors. Therefore, controversy exists as to which patients and family members to test for thrombophilia and which patients to treat with life-long anticoagulation. The aim of this review is to provide a practical overview with guidelines for detecting, and treatment of, the principal underlying coagulopathies that a vascular surgeon should be aware of in his/her practice and for the care of patients with vascular disease.

Results

Differential effects of platelet inhibitors on the contraction of clots formed in whole blood and PRP

While studying the effects of various platelet inhibitors on blood clot contraction, we discovered that their efficacy was different in whole blood and PRP. To suppress platelet contractility, we applied a number of inhibitors at highly effective concentrations (see the supplemental Methods): PGE 1 (increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate level), latrunculin A (an inhibitor of actin polymerization), blebbistatin (an inhibitor of nonmuscle myosin IIa), abciximab (a Fab-antibody fragment, inhibitor of fibrin interaction with the integrin αIIbβ3), atopaxar (PAR1 antagonist), and tirofiban (synthetic integrin αIIbβ3 inhibitor). Expectedly, the inhibitors suppressed all the parameters of clot contraction (Figure 1; supplemental Table 1). The only exception was the effect of PGE 1, which prolonged the lag time and reduced the area under the kinetic curve, but did not significantly reduce the average velocity and final extent of clot contraction. However, in whole blood, none of the inhibitors suppressed clot contraction completely, allowing for the residual 70% to 85% of the initial clot size (except for PGE 1). When the same platelet inhibitors at the same concentrations were added to PRP, the contraction of PRP clots was almost completely prevented compared with whole blood, that is, retaining almost 100% of the initial clot size after 1 hour (Figure 1; supplemental Table 1). In particular, the inhibitors completely abolished clot contraction in PRP from normal ∼90% down to 0, whereas in whole blood the inhibitors reduced the extent of contraction from normal 45% to 51% down to 15% to 23%, that is, twofold to threefold (with the exception of PGE 1) (supplemental Table 1). The inhibitory effect of ticagrelor on clot contraction was moderate, although ticagrelor was still more efficient in PRP than whole blood (supplemental Figure 5; supplemental Table 1).

### Blood-induced interference of glucose sensor function in vitro: implications for in vivo sensor function [^1174bCxd]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Although tissue hemorrhages, with resulting blood clots, are associated with glucose sensor implantation, virtually nothing known is about the impact of red blood cells and red blood cell clots on sensor function in vitro or in vivo. In these studies, we tested the hypothesis that blood can directly interfere with glucose sensor function in vitro.

Methods

To test this hypothesis, heparinized human whole blood (HWB) and nonheparinized human whole blood (WB) were obtained from normal individuals. Aliquots of HWB and WB samples were also fractionated into plasma, serum, and total leukocyte (TL) components. Resulting HWB, WB, and WB components were incubated in vitro with an amperometric glucose sensor for 24 hours at 37 degrees C. During incubation, blood glucose levels were determined periodically using a glucose monitor, and glucose sensor function (GSF) was monitored continuously as nanoampere output.

Results

Heparinized human whole blood had no significant effect on GSF in vitro, nor did TL, serum, or plasmaderived clots from WB. Sensors incubated with WB displayed a rapid signal loss associated with clot formation at 37 degrees C. The half-life was 0.8 ± 0.2 hours (n = 16) for sensors incubated with WB compared to 3.2 ± 0.5 (n = 12) for sensors incubated with HWB with a blood glucose level of approximately 100 mg/dl.

Conclusions

These studies demonstrated that human whole blood interfered with GSF in vitro. These studies further demonstrated that this interference was related to blood clot formation, as HWB, serum, plasma-derived clots, or TL did not interfere with GSF in vitro in the same way that WB did. These in vitro studies supported the concept that the formation of blood clots at sites of glucose sensor implantation could have a negative impact on GSF in vivo.

The authors summarize the current knowledge in the area of novel risk factors for venous thrombosis, both genetic and acquired causes of hypercoagulability. Because the list of genetic defects that predispose carriers to develop thrombosis has increased significantly in recent years, along with the available assays to test for them, hypercoagulability has been a subject of much discussion. This review highlights the issues on hypercoagulability that pathologists who are not specialists in coagulation should be familiar with, in order to provide consultation to other physicians. An educated approach to the diagnosis of this newly described group of disorders will ensure more cost-effective and efficient care to patients at risk.

Results

The formation of new bone heavily relies on the crucial involvement of blood clots

To investigate the correlation between osteogenesis and blood clots, a comprehensive Meta-analysis was conducted on 312 articles sourced from the web of science using specific keywords related to osteogenesis and blood clots. Out of these articles, only 5 addressed this particular relationship (I² = 89%, τ² = 95.4633), encompassing a total of 46 animal research samples. The Meta results depicted in Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table 1 demonstrate a statistically significant (p < 0.01) decrease of 15.78% in newly formed bone volume in cases where physical blood clots were absent, as compared to cases with complete blood clot formation, suggesting the indispensable involvement of blood clots in osteogenesis. By causing maxillary tooth extraction injury in hypertensive rats with systolic and diastolic blood pressures exceeding 150/120 mmHg, blood clot defect (BCD) model was established to provide further evidence (Supplementary Fig. 1A). The rat's right incisors were extracted by complete removal from the roots to create a meticulously crafted C-shaped wound of tooth extraction (Supplementary Fig. 1B). In the presence of hypertension, elevated bleeding velocity due to high blood pressure tends to result in increased bleeding volume and prolonged bleeding time, leading to partial impairments in blood clot formation. According to this theory, hypertensive rats exhibited a 47% longer blood clotting time and a 137% increase in blood loss compared to the control group of healthy rats (Ctrl) (Fig. 1B), while both groups showed similar static clotting ability (Supplementary Fig. 1C). Furthermore, histological examination of blood clots using fibrin staining consistently demonstrated the formation of complete blood clots within the extraction socket after tooth removal in healthy rats (Fig. 1C). Conversely, in hypertensive rats, the blood clot size was reduced by 41%, 37%, 30%, and 43% at 3 h, 6 h, 24 h, and one week post tooth extraction respectively (Fig. 1C, D). The above data demonstrate the successful establishment of a bone defect models with blood clot defect (BCD) in hypertensive rats through tooth extraction injury.

### Dysfibrinogenemia and thrombosis [^113uuGzJ]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the state of the art relating to congenital dysfibrinogenemia as a potential risk factor for thrombosis, as reflected by the medical literature and the consensus opinion of recognized experts in the field, and to make recommendations for the use of laboratory assays for assessing this thrombotic risk in individual patients.

Data Sources

Review of the medical literature, primarily from the last 10 years.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

After an initial assessment of the literature, key points were identified. Experts were assigned to do an in-depth review of the literature and to prepare a summary of their findings and recommendations. A draft manuscript was prepared and circulated to every participant in the College of American Pathologists Conference on Diagnostic Issues in Thrombophilia. Each of the key points and associated recommendations were then presented for discussion at the conference. Recommendations were accepted if a consensus of experts attending the conference was reached. The results of the discussion were used to revise the manuscript into its final form.

Conclusions

Consensus was reached on 5 conclusions and 2 recommendations concerning the use of testing for dysfibrinogens in the assessment of thrombotic risk in individual patients. Detailed discussion of the rationale for each of these recommendations is found in the text of this article. Compared with the other, more common hereditary thrombophilias, dysfibrinogenemia encompasses a diverse group of defects with varied clinical expressions. Congenital dysfibrinogenemia is a relatively rare cause of thrombophilia. Therefore, routine testing for this disorder is not recommended as part of the laboratory evaluation of a thrombophilic patient. This is an evolving area of research, and further clinical studies may change these recommendations in the future.

### Thrombus structural composition in cardiovascular disease [^114G1k6q]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2021). Medium credibility.

Highlights

Thrombosis occurs when a thrombus forms inside blood vessels disrupting blood flow.
Thrombi obtained from myocardial infarction are composed of mainly fibrin and other components, including platelets, red blood cells, leukocytes, and cholesterol crystals.
Thrombi from patients with acute ischemic stroke are characterized by red blood cell- and platelet-rich regions.
Thrombi from patients with venous thromboembolism contain mainly red blood cells and fibrin with some platelets and leukocytes.
Thrombus structure and composition are important for risk of thrombosis and thrombus removal.

Changes in clot structure are of key interest due to associations with risk of myocardial infarction (MI), acute ischemic stroke (AIS), and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Most studies explored links between in vitro clot structure and thrombosis. Recent literature exceeds 1000 publications, with > 400 in the past 5 years alone. – However, studies into the structure and components of thrombi formed in vivo remain limited. With the advent of new methodologies and imaging techniques, in vivo or ex vivo thrombi obtained by thrombectomy can be studied in much greater detail than ever before. Recent studies have been taking this approach to shed light on how in vivo thrombus structures relate to thrombosis in different vascular beds. In this review, we will summarize the main findings from these studies, their technological aspects, associations with disease, insights from animal models, and highlight key areas for future research.

### Thrombosis and platelets: an update [^116JPRn5]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Haemostasis and thrombosis are complex, multifactorial processes. There is an evolving understanding of the mechanisms influencing vascular occlusion and the role of inflammation and immunity. Despite major advances in elucidating the mechanistic pathways mediating platelet function and thrombosis, challenges in the treatment of vascular occlusive diseases persist. Pharmacological advances have greatly affected thrombotic outcomes, but this has led to the unwanted side effect of bleeding. Detailed assessment of the impact of non-thrombotic diseases on haemostasis and thrombosis is necessary to better evaluate thrombotic risk and establish optimal treatment. This review will focus on recent advances in understanding the contribution of evolving risk factors to thrombosis.

### COVID-19, thromboembolic risk, and virchow's triad: lesson from the past [^113huu4T]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

On balance, COVID‐19, the pandemic disease caused by SARS‐CoV‐2, is increasingly being recognized as a systemic thrombotic illness with systemic activation of the coagulation cascade and secondary DIC as well. It causes multi‐organ involvement, which dramatically worsen patients' outcome.

Hypercoagulability is probably the reason why many investigators worldwide are suggesting prophylactic use of pharmacological agents against thrombosis — at a very high‐dose — in COVID‐19 patients especially those who are very sick, even in the absence of evidence from randomized clinical trials. 34

We suggest that the three components of the classic Virchow's triad are the basis of thrombosis in COVID‐19 patients.

Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by edema, proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia. Minimal change disease, the most common cause in childhood, generally responds to corticosteroids, although most patients experience disease relapses. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is usually resistant to corticosteroids and carries a significant risk of kidney failure, necessitating renal transplantation. Nephrotic syndrome may also be secondary to gene mutations and systemic diseases such as lupus. Clinical evaluation involves distinguishing primary and secondary causes and monitoring for disease complications, including blood clots and serious infections such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Immunosuppressive medications are used to prevent relapses and treat corticosteroid-resistant disease.

### Block-like and cast-like hyperdense areas in the right heart cavities on post-mortem CT strongly suggest the presence of intracardiac blood clots at autopsy [^114oyjZb]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To classify the types of hyperdense areas in the heart cavities on post-mortem CT (PMCT) and compare them according to the presence of blood clots in the heart cavities at forensic autopsy.

Methods

One hundred and twelve cases with CT images taken before forensic autopsy were evaluated. The presence and shape of hyperdense areas in the right or left heart cavities were retrospectively evaluated on PMCT images and were classified into four types (block-like, cast-like, fluid level-like, and unclear). The presence of blood clots was confirmed when there were clots in the heart cavities at forensic autopsy.

Results

Of the 112 cases, 57 exhibited blood clots in the heart cavities at forensic autopsy. The hyperdense areas in the right heart cavities on PMCT in 57 cases exhibiting blood clots at forensic autopsy were classified as follows: block-like, 32; fluid level-like, 4; cast-like, 17; and unclear, 4. The sensitivity of block-like and cast-like hyperdense areas in the right heart cavities on PMCT for the presence of clots in the heart cavities at forensic autopsy was 86% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 74–94%); the corresponding specificity, PPV, and NPV were 95% (95% CI: 85–99%), 94% (95% CI: 84–99%), and 87% (95% CI: 75–94%), respectively.

Conclusion

Block-like and cast-like hyperdense areas in the right heart cavities on PMCT predicted the presence of intracardiac blood clots at forensic autopsy.

Key Points

- Clinical radiologists likely have no experience of interpreting findings of blood clots on post-mortem CT (PMCT).
- The appearance of blood clots on PMCT provides important clues for diagnosing the cause and process of death.
- The shapes of the hyperdense areas in the heart cavities were classified into four types, and two of these types could be used to predict the presence of blood clots in the heart cavities at forensic autopsy.

### Case report: a ball valve blood clot in the airways-life-saving whole tube suction [^117M9X74]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Respiratory tract obstruction due to a blood clot may result in life threatening ventilatory impairment. Ball valve blood clot obstructions of the airways are rare. A ball valve blood clot acts as a one-way valve, allowing (near) normal air entry into the airways, but (completely) blocking expiration. In a near fatal case of obstruction of the airways by a ball valve blood clot, we performed 'whole tube suction' to resolve the airway problem.

### COVID-19, thromboembolic risk, and virchow's triad: lesson from the past [^1134dVkU]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Finally, the third component of Virchow's triad, that is, blood stasis, comes from prolonged bedrest and immobilization in intensive care unit, strict isolation, and limited physiotherapy. These concepts are shown in the Figure 1.

FIGURE 1
Virchow's Triad and COVID‐19. Three cardinal component of Virchow's Triad — endothelial injury, clotting and blood flow stasis — are often observed in COVID‐19 resulting in systemic and venous thrombosis and their manifestations — such as stroke, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), primary thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

One may certainly argue that Virchow's triad explains venous thromboembolic events (venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) better than the arterial (ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, acute limb ischaemia), but this is not completely true. In fact, the majority of arterial thromboembolic events share the same origin, that is, the formation of a clot over an underlying atherosclerotic plaque. In most cases, the thrombus overlies a ruptured plaque or an intact plaque with superficial endothelial erosion. 23 In this respect, the first element of Virchow's triad is still in place, since SARS‐CoV‐2 can infect arterial endothelial cells directly, thus causing endothelial injury. For example, viral particles have been detected in endothelial cells of injured artery in a patient with past medical history of renal transplantation who passed away from COVID‐19‐induced multi‐organ failure. 19 As soon as arterial wall is damaged, the innate immune system is activated. In particular, macrophages begin to secrete collagenases which in turn degrade collagen, a major constituent of the fibrous cap on atherosclerotic plaques, thus causing plaque rupture. Activated macrophages also release tissue factor, a potent procoagulant factor which triggers clot formation when the plaque is broken. 24 Patients with COVID‐19 often have comorbidities leading to atherosclerosis, like hypertension and diabetes, and arterial plaques constitute a major risk factor for platelet adhesion leading to arterial thrombosis. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is associated with platelets hyperreactivity in terms of increased aggregation, which can partially be attributed to increased mitogen‐activated protein kinase activation and thromboxane generation 25 (hypercoagulability). While venous thrombi mainly consist of fibrin and red blood cells, and less by platelets, the latter are essential in arterial thrombus formation in an attempt to repair the damaged endothelium, which in turn is the main stimulus triggering platelets activation and arterial hypercoagulability. 26 As to the third element of Virchow's triad (blood stasis), there is no doubt that, when an arterial lumen is occluded partially or in entirety by an atherosclerotic plaque, blood flow at that levels slows down or is completely shut down. 27

### Novel risk factors for venous thromboembolism [^113sTwCu]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

VTE can be considered as a multicausal disease involving various inherited and acquired prothrombotic conditions. Although greater emphasis has classically been given to traditional thrombophilic risk factors, there is increasing recognition of less typical precipitating conditions and events. In this article, the authors focus on the most promising, persistent, and potentially treatable novel risk factors.

### Neuroendoscopic aspiration of blood clots in the cerebral aqueduct and third ventricle during posterior fossa surgery in the prone position [^115Yojth]. Operative Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

During surgery in the posterior fossa in the prone position, blood can sometimes fill the surgical field, due both to the less efficient venous drainage compared to the sitting position and the horizontally positioned surgical field itself. In some cases, blood clots can wedge into the cerebral aqueduct and the third ventricle, and potentially cause acute hydrocephalus during the postoperative course.

Objective

To illustrate a technique that can be used in these cases: the use of a flexible scope introduced through the opened roof of the fourth ventricle with a freehand technique allows the navigation of the fourth ventricle, the cerebral aqueduct, and the third ventricle in order to explore the cerebrospinal fluid pathways and eventually aspirate blood clots and surgical debris.

Methods

We report on one patient affected by an ependymoma of the fourth ventricle, for whom we used a flexible neuroendoscope to explore and clear blood clots from the cerebral aqueduct and the third ventricle after the resection of the tumor in the prone position. Blood is aspirated with a syringe using the working channel of the scope as a sucker.

Results

A large blood clot that was lying on the roof of the third ventricle was aspirated, setting the ventricle completely free. Other clots were aspirated from the right foramen of Monro and from the optic recess.

Conclusion

We describe this novel technique, which represents a safe and efficient way to clear the surgical field at the end of posterior fossa surgery in the prone position. The unusual endoscopic visual perspective and instrument maneuvers are easily handled with proper neuroendoscopic training.

Adverse effects of dialysis — potential risks: early concerns included inflammatory response and depletion of blood constituents such as platelets and clotting factors, as well as removal of low-molecular-weight hormones, vitamins, and other vital molecules; membranes were developed to be "biocompatible"; more recently, concern has been raised about transient intra- and postdialysis reductions in blood pressure, serum potassium, and serum phosphorus with other electrolyte and protein changes that may amount to a "perfect storm" of stress with potential acute cardiac and long-term brain and cardiovascular effects; frequent and more prolonged dialysis, while improving solute and volume removal, could enhance blood-membrane interaction, increase burden on patients and caregivers, and even accelerate loss of native kidney function and vascular access damage.

### Pharmacological interventions for the prevention of bleeding in people undergoing elective hip or knee surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^117DR1mG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

How the intervention might work

When blood loss from hip or knee surgery results in a haemoglobin level below a certain threshold and the onset of associated symptoms, patients are often transfused with red blood cells, even though this procedure is associated with significant risk. All of the interventions described above aim to reduce bleeding and minimise blood loss. Each intervention and its mode of action, along with any limitations or potential risks, is described below.

Antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid, aprotinin and epsilon‐aminocaproic acid)

During surgery, the clotting mechanism is activated. Antifibrinolytic drugs block the process of blood clot breakdown (fibrinolysis), therefore increasing clot strength and stability, which prevents excessive bleeding (Okamoto 1997). The most commonly used antifibrinolytic agents include tranexamic acid, aprotinin and epsilon‐aminocaproic acid (Henry 2011). In the UK, tranexamic acid is used in 42% of planned surgical cases (NCABT 2017). These medicines may be given orally, intravenous or topically (BNF 2022). Most have few side effects, however there is a theoretical increased risk of venous thromboembolism with their use (Levy 2018; Myers 2019).

Desmopressin

Desmopressin functions as a vasopressin analogue that increases the levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII (Pearson 2016). Von Willebrand factor and factor VIII enable platelets to adhere to wound sites and form clots to prevent bleeding. Desmopressin may be administered intravenously, subcutaneously or intranasally (BNF 2022). Side effects include facial flushing and possibly low blood sodium levels, especially with repeated doses (Desborough 2017a; Desborough 2017b).

Recombinant factor VIIa and factor XIII

Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is an intervention licensed for use in people with haemophilia, congenital factor VII deficiency and inhibitory alloantibodies. However, it has also been used off‐license to prevent bleeding in surgery where the potential for blood loss is expected to be high (Simpson 2012). Despite its use, the efficacy of the drug in people without haemophilia remains uncertain. Factor XIII protects a developing clot from fibrinolysis and improves clot strength. Recombinant factor XIII (rFXIII) has been shown to mediate clot formation in a dose‐dependent manner, and it has been suggested that maintaining higher levels of rFXIII levels may prevent bleeding (Aleman 2014).

### Superhydrophobic hemostatic nanofiber composites for fast clotting and minimal adhesion [^115ZeewR]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Hemostatic materials are of great importance in medicine. However, their successful implementation is still challenging as it depends on two, often counteracting, attributes; achieving blood coagulation rapidly, before significant blood loss, and enabling subsequent facile wound-dressing removal, without clot tears and secondary bleeding. Here we illustrate an approach for achieving hemostasis, rationally targeting both attributes, via a superhydrophobic surface with immobilized carbon nanofibers (CNFs). We find that CNFs promote quick fibrin growth and cause rapid clotting, and due to their superhydrophobic nature they severely limit blood wetting to prevent blood loss and drastically reduce bacteria attachment. Furthermore, minimal contact between the clot and the superhydrophobic CNF surface yields an unforced clot detachment after clot shrinkage. All these important attributes are verified in vitro and in vivo with rat experiments. Our work thereby demonstrates that this strategy for designing hemostatic patch materials has great potential.

### Basic science research opportunities in thrombosis and hemostasis: communication from the SSC of the ISTH [^117SbM6M]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

3.2.2 Innate immunity and thrombosis

Thrombosis, inflammation, and innate immune responses are closely linked. Various effectors of the hemostatic system are also potent pro‐inflammatory mediators, and several innate immune responses promote the formation of a blood clot. Consequently, the terms "thromboinflammation" and "immunothrombosis" have been coined, emphasizing the close relationship between inflammation and thrombosis and the immune system and thrombosis, respectively. For example, fibrin can stabilize hemostatic plugs to prevent blood loss after vascular injury, while also forming a physical barrier against invading pathogens. Similarly, both platelets and leukocytes actively bridge thrombotic and inflammatory pathways via common molecular amplification loops. Although the concept of immunothrombosis indicates that thrombus formation may have a role in immune defense, uncontrolled escalation of the interplay between immune responses, inflammation, and hemostasis can trigger or aggravate typical immunothrombotic or thromboinflammatory complications, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in sepsis and acute thrombotic events in patients with atherosclerosis. Thrombotic complications in COVID‐19 are another recent example that has been thrown into the limelight.

Research opportunities in the field of innate immunity and thrombosis include understanding the fundamental role of neutrophils, particularly NETs; the cellular and molecular mechanisms of platelet–leukocyte interactions; and the involvement of the complement system. Generated by neutrophils that release their decondensed chromatin as a network of extracellular fibers, NETs form a scaffold that is an important immune strategy against pathogens and is implicated in thrombosis. Platelets and leukocytes can exert thromboinflammatory effects via direct binding of platelets to innate immune cells (neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages) or via secretion of cytokines/chemokines. Multiple bidirectional interactions between the complement system and coagulation have been described. The challenge is now to extract those interactions that occur in vivo and are of (patho)‐physiological relevance to identify potential therapeutic targets. Increasing our fundamental understanding of the cellular and molecular aspects constituting the link between innate immunity and thrombosis can be complemented via other opportunity areas, including assessing and visualizing hemostasis, the structure–function relationships of hemostatic proteins, and the development of safe anticoagulants (Table 2).

A better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying immunothrombosis will help to identify new antithrombotic drug targets that do not interfere with normal hemostasis or immune response. Such insights could also become relevant for novel translational research lines that focus on new pharmacological antithrombotic approaches, such as pathogen‐induced effects (such as COVID‐19 and sepsis), obesity‐related thrombotic complications, or rare thrombotic diseases.

### Inflammation and thrombosis [^115HbnVD]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2003). Low credibility.

Systemic inflammation is a potent prothrombotic stimulus. Inflammatory mechanisms upregulate procoagulant factors, downregulate natural anticoagulants and inhibit fibrinolytic activity. In addition to modulating plasma coagulation mechanisms, inflammatory mediators appear to increase platelet reactivity. In vivo, however, natural anticoagulants not only prevent thrombosis, but they also dampen inflammatory activity. Some insights into the evolution and linkages between inflammatory mechanisms and the coagulation/anticoagulation mechanisms have become evident from recent structural studies. This review will summarize the interactions between inflammation and coagulation.

### Therapeutic strategies for thrombosis: new targets and approaches [^114vdtBL]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2020). High credibility.

Antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants are a mainstay for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis. However, despite advances in antithrombotic therapy, a fundamental challenge is the side effect of bleeding. Improved understanding of the mechanisms of haemostasis and thrombosis has revealed new targets for attenuating thrombosis with the potential for less bleeding, including glycoprotein VI on platelets and factor XIa of the coagulation system. The efficacy and safety of new agents are currently being evaluated in phase III trials. This Review provides an overview of haemostasis and thrombosis, details the current landscape of antithrombotic agents, addresses challenges with preventing thromboembolic events in patients at high risk and describes the emerging therapeutic strategies that may break the inexorable link between antithrombotic therapy and bleeding risk.

### Covalently reactive microparticles imbibe blood to form fortified clots for rapid hemostasis and prevention of rebleeding [^111QAP3x]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Owing to the inherently gradual nature of coagulation, the body fails in covalently crosslinking to stabilize clots rapidly, even with the aid of topical hemostats, thus inducing hemostatic failure and potential rebleeding. Although recently developed adhesives confer sealing bleeding sites independently of coagulation, interfacial blood hampers their adhesion and practical applications. Here, we report a covalently reactive hemostat based on blood-imbibing and -crosslinking microparticles. Once contacting blood, the microparticles automatically mix with blood via imbibition and covalently crosslink with blood proteins and the tissue matrix before natural coagulation operates, rapidly forming a fortified clot with enhanced mechanical strength and tissue adhesion. In contrast to commercial hemostats, the microparticles achieve rapid hemostasis (within 30seconds) and less blood loss (approximately 35mg and 1g in the rat and coagulopathic pig models, respectively), while effectively preventing blood-pressure-elevation-induced rebleeding in a rabbit model. This work advances the development and clinical translation of hemostats for rapid hemostasis and rebleeding prevention.

Of course this must also be monitored (e.g. via Thromboelastography) lest the disease enters its later phase in which bleeding rather than clotting is the greater danger. Although not shown here, an important consideration is that TEG ® can be used to study the clotting parameters of both whole blood and PPP. Whole blood TEG ® gives information on the clotting potential affected by the presence of both platelets and fibrinogen, while PPP TEG ® only presents evidence of the clotting potential of the plasma proteins.

Point-of-care devices and diagnostics like TEG ® are also particularly useful to assess fibrinolysis. In COVID-19 patients, Wright and co-workers reported fibrinolysis shutdown, confirmed by complete failure of clot lysis at 30 min on the TEG ®. Thus TEG ® can therefore predict thromboembolic events in patients with COVID-19.

### Gas generation and clot formation during electrolytic detachment of guglielmi detachable coils: in vitro observations and animal experiment [^1114HnUg]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Recent reports describe a high rate of thromboembolic events related to Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC) use in the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. The purpose of this study was to investigate electrolysis-related changes of blood as a potential cause of thromboembolic complications associated with GDC use.

Methods

For in vitro observations, 15 GDCs (10 conventional coils and five insulated coils) were experimentally detached under microscopic observation. Three coils were detached in normal saline, five in human serum, and seven in heparinized human blood. For animal experiments, two coils were detached in two canine normal common carotid arteries with systemic heparinization. Immediately after detachment, the arteries were exposed, and clot formations were observed.

Results

Significant amounts of gas bubbles were observed in all in vitro observations; more were seen in conventional coils, which required longer detachment times, than in insulated coils. Gas generation started with the growth of tiny bubbles into larger ones. In insulated coils, gas was generated only at the detachment zone, and no difference between saline, serum, and blood environments was observed. During detachment within heparinized blood, clot formations of 2–3-mm diameter were observed at the detachment zones of insulated coils. Animal experiments showed clot formation at the detachment zone, and bubble entrapments around the clots were also found.

Conclusion

The electrolytic detachment mechanism of the platinum coil can generate gas bubbles during the application of electric current. In association with electrothrombosis, this phenomenon may be a potential cause of thromboembolic complications during the treatment of cerebral aneurysms by use of GDCs.

### Atrial fibrillation and the prothrombotic state: revisiting virchow's triad in 2020 [^114N8BWu]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is characterised by an increased risk of pathological thrombus formation due to a disruption of physiological haemostatic mechanisms that are better understood by reference to Virchow's triad of 'abnormal blood constituents', 'vessel wall abnormalities' and 'abnormal blood flow'. First, there is increased activation of the coagulation cascade, platelet reactivity and impaired fibrinolysis as a result of AF per se, and these processes are amplified with pre-existing comorbidities. Several prothrombotic biomarkers including platelet factor 4, von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, β-thromboglobulin and D-dimer have been implicated in this process. Second, structural changes such as atrial fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction are linked to the development of AF which promote further atrial remodelling, thereby providing a suitable platform for clot formation and subsequent embolisation. Third, these factors are compounded by the presence of reduced blood flow secondary to dilatation of cardiac chambers and loss of atrial systole which have been confirmed using various imaging techniques. Overall, an improved understanding of the various factors involved in thrombus formation will allow better clinical risk stratification and targeted therapies in AF.

Recently, many groups have explored the role of transmission electron microscopy in evaluating the efficacy of thrombolysis. For example, in a study evaluating alteplase versus TNK for in vitro clots, Fruhwald et al found that clots treated with TNK had significant reductions in fibrin fibre density than those treated with alteplase.

### Rational and timely haemostatic interventions following cardiac surgery-coagulation factor concentrates or blood bank products [^115EvicP]. Thrombosis Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac surgery may cause a serious coagulopathy leading to increased risk of bleeding and transfusion demands. Blood bank products are commonly first line haemostatic intervention, but has been associated with hazardous side effect. Coagulation factor concentrates may be a more efficient, predictable, and potentially a safer treatment, although prospective clinical trials are needed to further explore these hypotheses. This study investigated the haemostatic potential of ex vivo supplementation of coagulation factor concentrates versus blood bank products on blood samples drawn from patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

Methods

30 adults were prospectively enrolled (mean age = 63.9, females = 27%). Ex vivo haemostatic interventions (monotherapy or combinations) were performed in whole blood taken immediately after surgery and two hours postoperatively. Fresh-frozen plasma, platelets, cryoprecipitate, fibrinogen concentrate, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), and recombinant FVIIa (rFVIIa) were investigated. The haemostatic effect was evaluated using whole blood thromboelastometry parameters, as well as by thrombin generation.

Results

Immediately after surgery the compromised maximum clot firmness was corrected by monotherapy with fibrinogen or platelets or combination therapy with fibrinogen. At two hours postoperatively the coagulation profile was further deranged as illustrated by a prolonged clotting time, a reduced maximum velocity and further diminished maximum clot firmness. The thrombin lagtime was progressively prolonged and both peak thrombin and endogenous thrombin potential were compromised. No monotherapy effectively corrected all haemostatic abnormalities. The most effective combinations were: fibrinogen+rFVIIa or fibrinogen+PCC. Blood bank products were not as effective in the correction of the coagulopathy.

Conclusion

Coagulation factor concentrates appear to provide a more optimal haemostasis profile following cardiac surgery compared to blood bank products.

### Risk assessment for cancer-associated thrombosis: what is the best approach? [^1118AG1P]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an increasingly frequent complication of cancer and its treatments. One in five cancer patients are estimated to develop venous and arterial events during the natural history of their illness. However, the risk for VTE varies widely between various subgroups of cancer patients and even in the same cancer patient over time. This narrative review focuses on risk factors, biomarkers and risk assessment tools and attempts to clarify approaches to risk stratification. Clinical risk factors include primary site of cancer, chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic therapy, surgery and hospitalization. Predictive and candidate biomarkers include platelet and leukocyte counts, hemoglobin, D-dimer and tissue factor. However, single risk factors or biomarkers have not, in general, been able to identify sufficiently high-risk populations. A clinical risk score, incorporating 5 simple clinical and laboratory variables, has now been studied in over 10,000 patients and can successfully categorize patients at low- and high-risk for VTE. Recent trials have shown that outpatient prophylactic anticoagulation is both safe and effective, but event rates have been highly variable. Targeted thromboprophylaxis provides an optimal risk-benefit ratio and the best opportunity to reduce the burden of VTE and its consequences for patients with cancer.

### Activation of piezo1 channels in compressed red blood cells augments platelet-driven contraction of blood clots [^1149PXRC]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Piezo1 is a mechanosensitive cationic channel that boosts intracellular [Ca²⁺]ᵢ. Compression of red blood cells (RBCs) during platelet-driven contraction of blood clots may cause the activation of Piezo1.

Objectives

To establish relationships between Piezo1 activity and blood clot contraction.

Methods

Effects of a Piezo1 agonist, Yoda1, and antagonist, GsMTx-4, on clot contraction in vitro were studied in human blood containing physiological [Ca²⁺]. Clot contraction was induced by exogenous thrombin. Activation of Piezo1 was assessed by Ca²⁺ influx in RBCs and with other functional and morphologic features.

Results

Piezo1 channels in compressed RBCs are activated naturally during blood clot contraction and induce an upsurge in the intracellular [Ca²⁺]ᵢ, followed by phosphatidylserine exposure. Adding the Piezo1 agonist Yoda1 to whole blood increased the extent of clot contraction due to Ca²⁺-dependent volumetric shrinkage of RBCs and increased platelet contractility due to their hyperactivation by the enhanced generation of endogenous thrombin on activated RBCs. Addition of rivaroxaban, the inhibitor of thrombin formation, or elimination of Ca²⁺ from the extracellular space abrogated the stimulating effect of Yoda1 on clot contraction. The Piezo1 antagonist, GsMTx-4, caused a decrease in the extent of clot contraction relative to the control both in whole blood and in platelet-rich plasma. Activated Piezo1 in compressed and deformed RBCs amplified the platelet contractility as a positive feedback mechanism during clot contraction.

Conclusion

The results obtained demonstrate that the Piezo1 channel expressed on RBCs comprises a mechanochemical modulator of blood clotting that may be considered a potential therapeutic target to correct hemostatic disorders.

### Cancer and the prothrombotic state [^1157NvPg]. The Lancet: Oncology (2002). Medium credibility.

Thrombosis is a frequent complication of cancer, so it follows that the presence of a tumour confers a prothrombotic state. Indeed, in patients with cancer, each of the three components of Virchow's triad that predispose for thrombus formation have abnormalities, thus fulfilling the requirement for a prothrombotic or hypercoagulable state. The many signs and symptoms of the prothrombotic state in cancer range from asymptomatic basic abnormal coagulation tests to massive clinical thromboembolism, when the patient may be gravely ill. Many procoagulant factors, such as tissue factor and cancer procoagulant, are secreted by or are expressed at the cell surface of many tumours. Platelet turnover and activity are also increased. Damaged endothelium and abnormalities of blood flow in cancer also seem to play a part, as does abnormal tumour angiogenesis. Some studies have even suggested that these abnormalities may be related to long-term prognosis and treatment. We briefly describe the various clinical manifestations of thrombosis in cancer and discuss the evidence for the existence of a prothrombotic or hypercoagulable state associated with this disease. Further work is needed to examine the mechanisms leading to the prothrombotic state in cancer, the potential prognostic and treatment implications, and the possible value of quantifying indices of hypercoagulability in clinical practice.

### Interplay between platelets and coagulation: from protective haemostasis to pathological arterial thrombosis [^116YjGN2]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Haemostasis refers to the physiological process aimed at repairing vessel injury and preventing bleeding. It involves four interlinked stages culminating in the formation of a platelet-fibrin haemostatic plug that is eventually dissolved once the vessel heals. In contrast, arterial thrombosis is a pathological condition resulting from atheroma exposure, triggering the formation of a platelet-rich thrombus that may obstruct blood flow, leading to the clinical manifestations of ischaemic cardiovascular disease. The following review will provide a comprehensive overview of the finely regulated endogenous antithrombotic mechanisms responsible for maintaining the haemostatic balance and preventing intravascular thrombosis. Thereafter, it will further detail the different stages and mechanisms governing the intricate interplay between the vessel, platelets, and the coagulation cascade in haemostasis, highlighting the most recent advances in platelet biology and function, to further elucidate the differential traits and players contributing to pathological arterial thrombus growth. The review will also delve into the impact of emerging cardiovascular risk factors on tilting the haemostatic balance towards a pro-thrombotic state, thereby increasing the patient's vulnerability to thrombotic events. Finally, it will underscore the importance of early screening for subclinical atherosclerosis through advanced imaging technologies capable of quantifying plaque burden and metabolic activity since they may set the stage for an increased thrombotic risk. Implementing proactive interventions to halt atherosclerosis progression or inducing its regression at early stages is crucial for preserving haemostasis and reducing the likelihood of ischaemic atherothrombotic disease.

### Methodology for the American Society of Hematology VTE guidelines: current best practice, innovations, and experiences [^114r5RD6]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) health-outcome descriptors — upper leg severe, moderate, and mild presentations are defined across symptoms, time horizon, testing and treatment, and consequences. Severe DVT notes symptoms in the entire leg, a time horizon that will persist for months and will slowly improve, and consequences that often include long‑lasting pain and swelling, and sometimes a blood clot travelling to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) and death; treatment may be administered in the hospital or at home and typically includes administration of blood thinners using a small tube inserted in your vein, injections or pills, with long‑lasting treatment often required. Moderate DVT will persist for months but improve over that time, and consequences may include long‑lasting pain and swelling in the leg, and rarely a blood clot travelling to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) and death. Mild DVT will persist for weeks but improve over that time, and consequences rarely include long‑lasting pain and swelling in the leg, and very rarely a blood clot travelling to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) and death.

### Extent of intravital contraction of arterial and venous thrombi and pulmonary emboli [^117E1E6V]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study has 2 interdependent specific aims: (1) quantifying structural rearrangements of in vitro blood clots as a function of the controlled extent of contraction and (2) using these established relationships for determination of the extent of intravital contraction of ex vivo thrombi and pulmonary emboli based on their composition.

During contraction, in vitro blood clots undergo segregation into the outer, intermediate, and inner spatial compartments. Although nonuniformity was described both for in vitroand in vivocontracted blood clots, here we have demonstrated the progressive reduction of the outer layer with a corresponding increase of the inner portion size during contraction. Remarkably, the beginning spatial redistribution of clot components was revealed as early as at 20% extent of contraction (Figures 2 and 4; supplemental Figures 4, 7, and 8). The sorting of blood clot components is propelled by the complex mechanochemical machinery, but redistribution of clot components remains an understudied and unexplained structural feature of the contracted clots. Pathophysiological implications of the spatial nonuniformity of contracted clots and thrombi may be important to modulate permeability, mechanical stability, and susceptibility of thrombi to fibrinolysis.

Another prominent structural alteration induced by contraction of blood clots is formation of deformed RBCs, resulting from compression of the RBC-rich inner portion by the platelet-fibrin meshwork pressing from outside. The novelty of our study is that the content of compressed RBCs in blood clots and thrombi has been quantified and correlated with the controlled time-dependent volume shrinkage. We have established numerical relationships between the increasing extent of blood clot contraction and gradual transformation of uncompressed biconcave RBCs to fully deformed polyhedrocytes. Beginning at 10% contraction, the volume fraction of polyhedral and intermediate mainly polyhedral RBCs in a clot become the prevailing structures in the clot at 20% contraction and higher (Figure 4C; supplemental Figure 7B). The content of polyhedral and intermediate mainly polyhedral RBCs in individual clots ranges from 0% to 99% and reaches a maximum at 50% to 60% shrinkage (supplemental Table 1), which is limited by hematocrit. The numbers characterizing blood clot composition and the extent of contraction may depend on clot geometry, which is a limitation of this study.

blood clotListen to pronunciationA mass of blood that forms when blood platelets, proteins, and cells stick together. When a blood clot is attached to the wall of a blood vessel, it is called a thrombus. When it moves through the bloodstream and blocks the flow of blood in another part of the body, it is called an embolus.

Key points
- Almost anyone can have a DVT/PE. However, certain factors can increase the chance of having this condition.
- The chance increases even more for someone who has more than one of these factors at the same time.
- Risk factors include injury to a vein, slow blood flow, increased estrogen, certain chronic medical illnesses, and several other factors. Risk Factors for DVT/PE Almost anyone can have a DVT/PE. However, certain factors can increase the chance of having this condition. The chance increases even more for someone who has more than one of these factors at the same time. Following is a list of factors that increase the risk of developing DVT/PE: Injury to a vein, often caused by:

- Fractures
- Severe muscle injury
- **Major surgery Slow blood flow, often caused by**:

- Confinement to bed
- Limited movement
- Sitting for a long time, especially with crossed legs
- Paralysis. Increased estrogen, often caused by:

- Estrogen-containing contraceptives
