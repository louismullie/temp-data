## Question

Mangment of ankle sprain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of ankle sprain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classification and prognosis to frame expectations. Then, I should verify the acute-phase priorities and whether supervised physiotherapy adds value. Next, I will examine functional rehabilitation, bracing, and manual therapy. After that, I need to check pharmacologic options and what to avoid. Finally, I will consider special populations, return-to-play testing, and prevention, and close with a concise, severity-based algorithm and key takeaways, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and classification, because management hinges on severity and chronicity. Most ankle sprains are lateral and graded I–III, with grade I–II being stable and grade III representing complete tears; chronic ankle instability is typically defined by persistent symptoms beyond 12 months, and the natural course shows that 5–33% still have pain at 1 year and 36–85% report full recovery by 3 years, with reinjury rates of 3–34% over varying follow-up periods, which underscores the need for structured rehabilitation and prevention planning [^111EUuEX] [^114MRXtU].

> Wait, let me verify the acute-phase priorities before jumping to advanced interventions. Protection, rest, ice, compression, and elevation remain foundational to control pain and swelling, with cryotherapy for the first 3–7 days and compression and elevation to limit edema; early protected motion and progressive weight bearing are encouraged as tolerated, and NSAIDs can be used judiciously for pain and swelling while acknowledging potential suppression of healing if overused, so I should counsel on limited duration and monitoring for GI or renal risks [^112Njbyu] [^116P3brS] [^115VYsZm] [^116yb8TZ] [^115TLhic].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about supervised physiotherapy in the acute setting. I initially thought early supervised therapy would clearly accelerate recovery, but I need to check the highest-quality evidence. The largest RCT to date found that adding supervised physiotherapy to usual care did not produce clinically important improvements in functional recovery at 1, 3, or 6 months in grade 1–2 sprains, suggesting that a home-based program with education and gradual loading may suffice for many; however, earlier systematic reviews suggest limited to moderate benefit of supervised exercises for faster return to sport in specific populations, so I should tailor referral to severity, goals, and access, and consider that underdosing or low-intensity programs may explain null results in some trials [^116Qrbv4] [^111GXGqH] [^113M6K1J] [^115QjYyW].

> I will now examine functional rehabilitation principles, because even without routine supervised therapy, structured progression matters. Early mobilization with protected range of motion, progressive strengthening, neuromuscular and balance training, and gait normalization are recommended, with external supports facilitating protected loading; for more severe injuries, brief immobilization up to about 10 days with a semi-rigid brace or boot may be appropriate before transitioning to functional rehabilitation, and I should confirm that the plan aligns with tissue-healing phases and patient tolerance [^1126Pv9z] [^114bwrR2] [^113jyVBu].

> Next, I should review bracing and taping, since device choice affects both protection and function. Semi-rigid braces or lace-up supports outperform elastic bandages for pain, swelling, and time to return, and they reduce reinjury risk, particularly in those with prior sprains; I need to ensure patients understand that bracing is adjunctive to rehabilitation, not a substitute, and that prophylactic bracing during sports is reasonable for those with a history of sprains [^115xHrPy] [^113jyVBu] [^111wPtnN] [^116Qo8Ft].

> Let me consider manual therapy, because I recall conflicting evidence and need to be precise. For acute lateral sprains, manual therapy such as joint mobilization and soft-tissue techniques can be offered alongside exercise to reduce swelling, restore dorsiflexion, and normalize gait; in chronic instability, manual therapy can improve short-term dorsiflexion and dynamic balance, but it should not be used in isolation for balance deficits, so I should integrate it within a comprehensive program and set expectations about modest, short-term gains [^116zDFZP] [^117VSPYB] [^111wyDAQ].

> I should double-check pharmacologic nuances. NSAIDs are reasonable for short-term pain and swelling control, but prolonged use may impair healing; acetaminophen is an alternative when NSAIDs are contraindicated, and I need to screen for GI, renal, and cardiovascular risks before prescribing, aligning with guideline cautions and patient-specific risk profiles [^116yb8TZ] [^112cuTtF].

> But wait, what if this is not a simple lateral sprain? I need to ensure I screen for syndesmotic injury, medial deltoid involvement, and fractures. High ankle sprains present with proximal pain, prolonged recovery, and higher risks of chronic instability; management is more conservative with immobilization and slower rehabilitation, and surgical fixation is considered when there is diastasis greater than 2 mm or joint incongruity on stress radiographs; deltoid injuries are less common but can be associated with eversion mechanisms and may require targeted rehabilitation and, in select cases, surgical consultation [^113mDPHC] [^116HGkxf] [^112GxD5j] [^111wrH8o].

> Next, I should review return-to-play and functional testing, because reinjury risk remains substantial without objective milestones. Functional performance tests such as the single-leg hop for distance and the Star Excursion Balance Test, along with patient-reported function tools like the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool, help guide decisions; a commonly used threshold is achieving at least 80% of the uninjured limb's performance, but I need to integrate sport-specific demands and the athlete's confidence before clearance [^116Cid2W] [^112y193D].

> I need to ensure prevention is addressed, especially after a first sprain, given recurrence rates. Prophylactic bracing and balance/neuromuscular training reduce reinjury, with bracing showing a larger effect in some trials; multimodal programs of at least 3 months targeting balance, strength, and dynamic control are recommended, and I should emphasize adherence and progressive overload to realize benefit [^112JRDAJ] [^116Qo8Ft] [^115Lqobw].

> Let me synthesize a practical, severity-based algorithm, and I will sanity-check each step against guidelines. For grade I–II lateral sprains, use PRICE for 3–7 days, initiate protected ROM and progressive weight bearing by day 3–5, advance to strengthening and balance training by week 2, and consider a semi-rigid brace for protection and confidence; for grade III or unstable injuries, immobilize for up to 10 days with a boot or cast, then follow a structured rehabilitation pathway with delayed return to sport; throughout, escalate to supervised therapy if recovery lags, functional deficits persist, or the patient is high risk or high demand, and refer for surgical evaluation if instability persists beyond 3–6 months despite comprehensive conservative care [^1126Pv9z] [^114bwrR2] [^112cuTtF].

> Finally, I should confirm key takeaways and highlight uncertainties. Functional rehabilitation is superior to prolonged immobilization for most acute lateral sprains, supervised physiotherapy may not add benefit in low-risk, first-time cases but can be valuable for severe injuries, athletes, or those with persistent deficits, bracing and balance training reduce reinjury, and prevention must be explicit given the high risk of recurrence and long-term morbidity; I need to document shared decision-making, especially when deviating from guidelines, and adjust the plan based on patient goals and response [^112K593h] [^116Qrbv4] [^112JRDAJ] [^117M4RZ3].

---

Ankle sprain management centers on **early functional rehabilitation** with protected weight-bearing, bracing, and progressive exercises, which accelerates recovery and reduces reinjury risk compared to immobilization [^112K593h] [^112cuTtF]. NSAIDs are appropriate for short-term pain and swelling control, but **should be used cautiously** due to potential effects on healing [^116yb8TZ] [^112cuTtF]. Surgery is reserved for chronic instability or failure of conservative care after 3–6 months [^112cuTtF] [^115TLhic]. Prevention focuses on balance and neuromuscular training, with bracing for athletes with prior sprains to lower recurrence [^112JRDAJ] [^111wPtnN].

---

## Initial assessment and diagnosis

- **History and physical examination**: Assess mechanism, prior sprains, instability, and neurovascular status [^1123kkJN].

- **Ottawa ankle rules**: Use to decide on radiography for suspected fractures [^113Mon8s].

- **Classification**: Grade I (stretch), II (partial tear), III (complete tear) guides management [^117QJ6eR].

---

## Acute phase management (first 48–72 hours)

- **Protection, rest, ice, compression, elevation (PRICE)**: Reduces pain and swelling; ice for 20 minutes every 2–3 hours [^115cmrKR] [^112Njbyu].

- **Compression and elevation**: Minimize swelling and support healing [^115VYsZm] [^116P3brS].

- **NSAIDs**: Short-term use for pain and swelling; monitor for GI/renal risks [^116yb8TZ] [^114cpHcz].

---

## Functional rehabilitation

- **Early mobilization**: Protected weight-bearing and ROM exercises improve outcomes [^1112QuB3] [^1126Pv9z].

- **Bracing**: Semi-rigid or lace-up braces support ligaments and allow early motion [^115xHrPy] [^113jyVBu].

- **Progressive exercises**: Strengthening, balance, and proprioceptive training are essential [^1126Pv9z] [^111ThSEX].

---

## Advanced rehabilitation and return-to-activity

- **Functional testing**: Use hop tests and balance assessments before return [^116Cid2W].

- **Gradual return**: Sport-specific drills and progressive loading reduce reinjury [^notfound].

- **Patient education**: Teach self-management and injury recognition [^1137ViZH].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgery is considered for **chronic instability** — persistent instability after 3–6 months of conservative care — or for **high-grade injuries** with complete tears and marked instability [^112cuTtF] [^115TLhic].

---

## Prevention of recurrence

- **Balance and neuromuscular training**: Reduces reinjury risk [^112JRDAJ] [^115Lqobw].

- **Bracing**: Effective in athletes with prior sprains [^111wPtnN] [^116Qo8Ft].

- **Footwear**: Use sport-specific shoes with adequate support [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

Syndesmotic (**high ankle**) sprains require longer immobilization and cautious rehabilitation [^113mDPHC] [^112GxD5j]. Chronic ankle instability benefits from structured rehabilitation and bracing; surgery is reserved for refractory cases [^111wyDAQ] [^112cuTtF].

---

Ankle sprain management emphasizes **early functional rehabilitation** with protected motion, bracing, and progressive exercises, reserving surgery for persistent instability. Prevention through balance training and bracing reduces recurrence.

### What is the clinical course of acute ankle sprains? A systematic literature review [^114MRXtU]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Ankle sprains are one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions and to guide management decisions, it is important to have clear insight of the course of recovery after an acute lateral ankle injury and to evaluate potential factors for nonrecovery and re-sprains.

Methods

A database search was conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, PEDro, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled trial register. Included were observational studies and controlled trials with adult subjects who suffered from an acute lateral ankle sprain that was conventionally treated. One of the following outcomes had to be described: pain, re-sprains, instability, or recovery. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of each included study. One reviewer extracted relevant data.

Results

In total, 31 studies were included, from which 24 studies were of high quality. There was a rapid decrease in pain reporting within the first 2 weeks. Five percent to 33% of patients still experienced pain after 1 year, while 36% to 85% reported full recovery within a period of 3 years. The risk of re-sprains ranged from 3% to 34% of the patients, and re-sprain was registered in periods ranging from 2 weeks to 96 months postinjury. There was a wide variation in subjective instability, ranging from 0% to 33% in the high-quality studies and from 7% to 53% in the low-quality studies. One study described prognostic factors and indicated that training more than 3 times a week is a prognostic factor for residual symptoms.

Conclusions

After 1 year of follow-up, a high percentage of patients still experienced pain and subjective instability, while within a period of 3 years, as much as 34% of the patients reported at least 1 re-sprain. From 36% up to 85% of the patients reported full recovery within a period of 3 years.

### Diagnosis, treatment and prevention of ankle sprains: an evidence-based clinical guideline [^117Dy9YW]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Ankle injuries are a huge medical and socioeconomic problem. Many people have a traumatic injury of the ankle, most of which are a result of sports. Total costs of treatment and work absenteeism due to ankle injuries are high. The prevention of recurrences can result in large savings on medical costs. A multidisciplinary clinical practice guideline was developed with the aim to prevent further health impairment of patients with acute lateral ankle ligament injuries by giving recommendations with respect to improved diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities. The recommendations are based on evidence from published scientific research, which was extensively discussed by the guideline committee. This clinical guideline is helpful for healthcare providers who are involved in the management of patients with ankle injuries.

### Functional management of ankle sprains: what volume and intensity of walking is undertaken in the first week postinjury [^113JVpiy]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute ankle sprains are usually managed functionally, with advice to undertake progressive weight-bearing and walking. Mechanical loading is an important modular of tissue repair; therefore, the clinical effectiveness of walking after ankle sprain may be dose dependent. The intensity, magnitude and duration of load associated with current functional treatments for ankle sprain are unclear.

Aim

To describe physical activity (PA) in the first week after ankle sprain and to compare results with a healthy control group.

Methods

Participants (16–65 years) with an acute ankle sprain were randomised into two groups (standard or exercise). Both groups were advised to apply ice and compression, and walk within the limits of pain. The exercise group undertook additional therapeutic exercises. PA was measured using an activPAL accelerometer, worn for 7 days after injury. Comparisons were made with a non-injured control group.

Results

The standard group were significantly less active (1.2 ± 0.4 h activity/day; 5621 ± 2294 steps/day) than the exercise (1.7 ± 0.7 h/day, p = 0.04; 7886 ± 3075 steps/day, p = 0.03) and non-injured control groups (1.7 ± 0.4 h/day, p = 0.02; 8844 ± 2185 steps/day, p = 0.002). Also, compared with the non-injured control group, the standard and exercise groups spent less time in moderate (38.3 ± 12.7 min/day vs 14.5 ± 11.4 min/day, p = 0.001 and 22.5 ± 15.9 min/day, p = 0.003) and high-intensity activity (4.1 ± 6.9 min/day vs 0.1 ± 0.1 min/day, p = 0.001 and 0.62 ± 1.0 min/day p = 0.005).

Conclusion

PA patterns are reduced in the first week after ankle sprain, which is partly ameliorated with addition of therapeutic exercises. This study represents the first step towards developing evidence-based walking prescription after acute ankle sprain.

### Management of sports injuries of the foot and ankle: an update [^11548MZD]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Sporting injuries around the ankle vary from simple sprains that will resolve spontaneously within a few days to severe injuries which may never fully recover and may threaten the career of a professional athlete. Some of these injuries can be easily overlooked altogether or misdiagnosed with potentially devastating effects on future performance. In this review article, we cover some of the common and important sporting injuries involving the ankle including updates on their management and outcomes.

### 2016 consensus statement of the international ankle consortium: prevalence, impact and long-term consequences of lateral ankle sprains [^111p1iLz]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The Executive Committee of the International Ankle Consortium presents this 2016 position paper with recommendations for information implementation and continued research based on the paradigm that lateral ankle sprain (LAS), and the development of chronic ankle instability (CAI), serve as a conduit to a significant global healthcare burden. We intend our recommendations to serve as a mechanism to promote efforts to improve prevention and early management of LAS. We believe this will reduce the prevalence of CAI and associated sequelae that have led to the broader public health burdens of decreased physical activity and early onset ankle joint post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Ultimately, this can contribute to healthier lifestyles and promotion of physical activity.

### Diagnosis, treatment and prevention of ankle sprains: update of an evidence-based clinical guideline [^112cuTtF]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

This guideline aimed to advance current understandings regarding the diagnosis, prevention and therapeutic interventions for ankle sprains by updating the existing guideline and incorporate new research. A secondary objective was to provide an update related to the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic procedures, therapeutic interventions and prevention strategies. It was posited that subsequent interaction of clinicians with this guideline could help reduce health impairments and patient burden associated with this prevalent musculoskeletal injury. The previous guideline provided evidence that the severity of ligament damage can be assessed most reliably by delayed physical examination (4–5 days post trauma). After correct diagnosis, it can be stated that even though a short time of immobilisation may be helpful in relieving pain and swelling, the patient with an acute lateral ankle ligament rupture benefits most from use of tape or a brace in combination with an exercise programme. New in this update: Participation in certain sports is associated with a heightened risk of sustaining a lateral ankle sprain. Care should be taken with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) usage after an ankle sprain. They may be used to reduce pain and swelling, but usage is not without complications and NSAIDs may suppress the natural healing process. Concerning treatment, supervised exercise-based programmes preferred over passive modalities as it stimulates the recovery of functional joint stability. Surgery should be reserved for cases that do not respond to thorough and comprehensive exercise-based treatment. For the prevention of recurrent lateral ankle sprains, ankle braces should be considered as an efficacious option.

### Ankle sprains [^116SNpqe]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Ankle sprains are the most common foot-ankle and sports-related injury for which people seek medical care. People of all ages sprain their ankles. Four in every 10 first-time ankle sprains occur when playing sports. Acute ankle sprains are usually accompanied by swelling, pain, and difficulty walking. Chronic ankle instability is diagnosed when a person continues to have problems with tasks like walking or playing sports 1 year after the original injury. People with chronic ankle instability say their ankle feels unstable or like it "gives way". The JOSPT published updated clinical practice guidelines on diagnosing, managing, and preventing acute ankle sprains and chronic ankle instability in the April 2021 issue. We share what the experts found and what it means for you or for someone for whom you may be caring. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2021;51(4):161. doi:10.2519/jospt.2021.0504.

### Effect of early supervised physiotherapy on recovery from acute ankle sprain: randomised controlled trial [^115N4MiC]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Ankle sprains are one of the most common and burdensome musculoskeletal injuries and are associated with a high rate of visits to the emergency department. In our own setting of Kingston, Canada, ankle sprains account for 7.5% of injury related visits, about 725 cases annually, which represents an annual rate of presentation to an emergency department of five per 1000 people. Nearly all ankle sprains are simple grade 1 (mechanically stable) or grade 2 (some joint laxity) ligament sprains. Grade 3 sprains (clinical and/or radiological evidence of instability) represent a small minority. Although the prevalence of grade 3 sprains is low, there is good evidence to support the use of immobilisation and, occasionally, surgical correction in the management of these injuries. Yet clinical standards for the acute management of grade 1 and 2 ankle sprains are not well defined.

The absence of high quality evidence to inform effective management of ankle sprains in acute care settings is related largely to perceptions that grade 1 and 2 ankle sprains are relatively benign injuries. Short and long term morbidity from simple ankle sprains, however, has been documented among 30–70% of patients, ranging from six months to seven years after injury. Morbidity is reflected in lost time from school, work, leisure, and sports activities; impairment in activities of daily living; and multiple medical contacts in the time after injury.

In an effort to reduce the likelihood of short and long term morbidity, several trials have been undertaken in recent years to evaluate the efficacy of supervised programmes of physiotherapy in improving outcomes of ankle sprains and accelerating return to activity. A recent systematic review of these trials identified considerable potential for bias related to methods of randomisation, concealment, and outcome measurement and concluded that current evidence for early implementation of supervised exercise is limited in terms of breadth and quality. We carried out a randomised clinical trial to address the findings of systematic reviews, including a 2002 Cochrane review, of persisting controversy as to the role of supervised physiotherapy in the management of acute ankle sprains and their call for sufficiently powered trials designed to limit bias.

### Management of ankle sprains [^115XXtbV]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Without adequate care, acute ankle trauma can result in chronic joint instability. Use of a standardized protocol enhances the management of ankle sprains. In patients with grades I or II sprains, emphasis should be placed on accurate diagnosis, early use of RICE (rest, ice, compression and elevation), maintenance of range of motion and use of an ankle support. Sprains with complete ligament tears (grade III) may require surgical intervention. Although early motion and mobility are recommended, ligamentous strength does not return until months after an ankle sprain.

### Does multimodal rehabilitation for ankle instability improve patients' self-assessed functional outcomes? A network meta-analysis [^115PzWiq]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Although there are many nonsurgical treatment options for the primary management of chronic ankle instability, the most effective nonoperative intervention has not been defined.

Questions/Purposes

The purpose of this study was to perform a network meta-analysis to compare the results of different standalone and/or combined nonsurgical interventions on chronic ankle instability as measured by (1) the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) at 0 to 6 months after treatment and (2) treatment-related complications.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Scopus in August 2017 for completed studies published between 2005 and 2016. We conducted random-effects pairwise and network meta-analysis considering randomized trials, which compared the effects of various nonoperative therapies for ankle instability. Studies assessing patients with functional ankle instability and/or mechanical ankle instability and/or recurrent ankle sprains were eligible for inclusion. After combining data from self-administered questionnaires, we analyzed patient self-reported outcomes of function at the end of the rehabilitation period and 1 to 6 months after treatment. We thereafter reexpressed standardized mean differences to mean differences with CAIT. For this instrument, scores vary between 0 and 30, and higher scores indicate better ankle stability. We included 21 trials involving 789 chronically unstable ankles. The rehabilitation interventions included, but were not limited to, balance training, strengthening exercises, a combination of the balance and strengthening exercises, manual therapy, and multimodal treatment. The implemented multistation protocols were targeted at four main areas of rehabilitation (ROM, balance, strength, and overall activity). Control was defined as placebo and/or wait and see. Treatment-related complications were defined as any major or minor adverse event observed after rehabilitation as reported by the source studies. Statistically, we did not detect significant inconsistency in the network meta-analysis. We also assessed the quality of the trials using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and judged 12, eight, and one studies to be at a low, unclear, and high risk of bias, respectively. We also considered the quality of evidence to be of moderate strength utilizing the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. We defined the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) in the CAIT to be 3 points.

Results

A 4-week supervised rehabilitation program, which included balance training, strengthening, functional tasks, and ROM exercises, was favored over control according to the results of four trials by a clinically important margin (mean difference between multimodal and control groups in the CAIT was -10; 95% confidence interval [CI] -16 to -3; p = 0.001). Among the standalone interventions, only balance training was better than control according to the findings of seven trials (mean difference between balance training and control in the CAIT was -5; 95% CI, -10 to -0.03; p = 0.049); this difference likewise exceeded the MCID and so is believed to be a clinically important difference. Adverse events associated with the enrolled rehabilitation protocols were transient, mild, and uncommon.

Conclusions

Although a supervised impairment-based program after chronic ankle instability was superior to control, we note that followup in the included trials tended to be short and inconsistent, although the effect size exceeded the MCID and so likely would be identified as clinically important by patients. Future randomized trials should determine whether the short-term benefits of these interventions are sustained over time.

### National Athletic Trainers' Association position statement: conservative management and prevention of ankle sprains in athletes [^113mDPHC]. Journal of Athletic Training (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for ankle sprain, more specifically with respect to patients with syndesmotic ankle sprain, NATA 2013 guidelines recommend to offer more conservative management in patients with syndesmotic ankle sprains than in lateral ankle sprains. Offer immobilization (non-weight bearing, walking boot, casting, or bracing) for a time period sufficient to allow healing and functional return.

### Manual physical therapy and exercise versus supervised home exercise in the management of patients with inversion ankle sprain: a multicenter randomized clinical trial [^111Mx3HG]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Randomized clinical trial.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of manual therapy and exercise (MTEX) to a home exercise program (HEP) in the management of individuals with an inversion ankle sprain.

Background

An in-clinic exercise program has been found to yield similar outcomes as an HEP for individuals with an inversion ankle sprain. However, no studies have compared an MTEX approach to an HEP.

Methods

Patients with an inversion ankle sprain completed the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) activities of daily living subscale, the FAAM sports subscale, the Lower Extremity Functional Scale, and the numeric pain rating scale. Patients were randomly assigned to either an MTEX or an HEP treatment group. Outcomes were collected at baseline, 4 weeks, and 6 months. The primary aim (effects of treatment on pain and disability) was examined with a mixed-model analysis of variance. The hypothesis of interest was the 2-way interaction (group by time).

Results

Seventy-four patients (mean ± SD age, 35.1 ± 11.0 years; 48.6% female) were randomized into the MTEX group (n = 37) or the HEP group (n = 37). The overall group-by-time interaction for the mixed-model analysis of variance was statistically significant for the FAAM activities of daily living subscale (P < .001), FAAM sports subscale (P < .001), Lower Extremity Functional Scale (P < .001), and pain (P ≤ .001). Improvements in all functional outcome measures and pain were significantly greater at both the 4-week and 6-month follow-up periods in favor of the MTEX group.

Conclusion

The results suggest that an MTEX approach is superior to an HEP in the treatment of inversion ankle sprains. Registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00797368).

### Treatment… [^11359KXP]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

The immediate goals of treating acute ankle sprain are to decrease pain and swelling and protect ankle ligaments from further injury. 14 The PRICE treatment protocol for acute ankle injury is commonly used. The protocol includes elevating the ankle and protecting it with a compressive device. Ice is applied to the injured ankle, and the patient is advised to rest for up to 72 hours to allow the ligaments to heal. FUNCTIONAL TREATMENT Although the overall quality of studies on functional treatment is somewhat limited, a systematic review of 21 trials showed that functional treatment is superior to immobilization for treatment of ankle sprains. 22 The review identified nine trials that evaluated different methods of ankle support.

22 When compared with the elastic bandage, the semirigid ankle support resulted in a shorter time to return to sports 23 and to work 22 and less ankle instability. 24 The lace-up ankle support significantly decreased persistent swelling at short-term follow-up compared with the semirigid ankle support, taping, or bandaging. 22 More skin irritation was reported with taping than with the other methods.
22. 25 Surgery was more favorable than conservative treatment in time to return to sports, pain, and functional instability. However, these differences were not seen when adjustments were made for the quality of studies. 25 Overall pooled results of 11 clinical trials from the review showed no difference between surgery and conservative treatment in recurrence of ankle sprains; however, time to return to work was longer after surgery. 25 Direct comparisons between treatment methods were difficult because of the variations in the quality of the trials.

A prospective trial followed patients with ankle ligament ruptures who were randomized to receive functional or surgical treatment. 26 After eight years, fewer patients who had surgery reported residual pain, chronic ankle instability, and recurrent sprains. Prevention Exercise regimens and external ankle supports usually are recommended to prevent ankle sprain. A Cochrane review identified 14 trials that evaluated exercise training regimens and a variety of support devices.

### Syndesmotic ankle sprains in athletes [^112GxD5j]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Ankle sprains are among the most common athletic injuries and represent a significant source of persistent pain and disability. Despite the high incidence of ankle sprains in athletes, syndesmosis injuries have historically been underdiagnosed, and assessment in terms of severity and optimal treatment has not been determined. More recently, a heightened awareness in sports medicine has resulted in more frequent diagnoses of syndesmosis injuries. However, there is a low level of evidence and a paucity of literature on this topic compared with lateral ankle sprains. As a result, no clear guidelines are available to help the clinician assess the severity of injury, choose an imaging modality to visualize the injury, make a decision in terms of operative versus nonoperative treatment, or decide when the athlete may return to play. Increased knowledge and understanding of these injuries by clinicians and researchers are essential to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of this significant condition. This review will discuss the anatomy, mechanism of injury, diagnosis, and treatment of syndesmosis sprains of the ankle while identifying controversies in management and topics for future research.

### Supervised physiotherapy for mild or moderate ankle sprain [^115QjYyW]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Patients and practitioners should also consider that many other exercise dose parameters can influence treatment success. Manipulating the magnitude, nature, intensity, and frequency of exercise can have profound effects on the structure and function of the neuromusculoskeletal system. Important details of these parameters, however, are often missing from trials of exercise treatments for ankle sprain (including this one), making it difficult for readers to judge the clinical appropriateness of trial interventions. A related limitation is that most exercise interventions for lateral ankle sprain tend to focus entirely on the ankle joint. But there is increasing evidence that these sprains also affect movement patterns in joints proximal to the ankle, such as the knee, hip, and in the torso. As many of these movement deficits are thought to be implicated in the development of long term problems such as chronic ankle instability, there is an urgent need for practitioners and researchers to diversify the exercise content of treatments beyond the ankle.

An interesting finding was that just under 60% (299/503) of participants reported a previous injury to their ankle at the start of the study. This further highlights the propensity for poor recovery after a lateral ankle sprain and the high rate of recurrence. Recurrent injury is a characteristic symptom of chronic ankle instability, a potentially important variable moderating the effectiveness of therapeutic exercise. Only a small number of studieshave successfully controlled for any confounding effects of chronic instability by limiting recruitment to participants with a first ankle sprain. Future researchers might usefully prioritise this element of trial design.

This new randomised study is an important addition to the evidence base. Strengths include a robust design incorporating adequate randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinded assessment of outcomes. Future research, however, must do more to identify the optimal dose and intensity of therapeutic exercise in the management of mild or moderate lateral ankle sprain.

### Immobilisation and functional treatment for acute lateral ankle ligament injuries in adults [^112K593h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Acute lateral ankle ligament injuries (ankle sprains) are common problems in acute medical care. The treatment variation observed for the acutely injured lateral ankle ligament complex suggests a lack of evidence-based management strategies for this problem.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of methods of immobilisation for acute lateral ankle ligament injuries and to compare immobilisation with functional treatment methods.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group specialised register (December 2001); the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2001), MEDLINE (1966-May 2000), EMBASE (1988-May 2000), reference lists of articles, and contacted organisations and researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing either different types of immobilisation or immobilisation versus functional treatments for injuries to the lateral ligament complex of the ankle in adults were included. Trials which investigated the treatment of chronic instability or post-surgical treatment were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted by two authors. Where appropriate, results of comparable studies were pooled using fixed effects models. Individual and pooled statistics were reported as relative risks with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes and weighted (WMD) or standardised (SMD) mean differences and 95% confidence intervals for continuous outcome measures. Heterogeneity between trials was tested using a standard chi-squared test.

Main Results

Twenty-one trials involving 2184 participants were included. The mean validity score of the included trials increased from 9.1 (SD 3.0) to 10 (SD 2.9) after retrieving further information (maximum 18 points). Statistically significant differences in favour of functional treatment when compared with immobilisation were found for seven outcome measures: more patients returned to sport in the long term (relative risk (RR) 1.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 2.86); the time taken to return to sport was shorter (WMD 4.88 (days), 95% CI 1.50 to 8.25); more patients had returned to work at short term follow-up (RR 5.75, 95% CI 1.01 to 32.71); the time taken to return to work was shorter (WMD 8.23 days, 95% CI 6.31 to 10.16); fewer patients suffered from persistent swelling at short term follow-up (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.59); fewer patients suffered from objective instability as tested by stress X-ray (WMD 2.60, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.96); and patients treated functionally were more satisfied with their treatment (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.07). A separate analysis of trials that scored 50 per cent or more in quality assessment found a similar result for time to return to work only (WMD (days) 12.89, 95% CI 7.10 to 18.67). No significant differences between varying types of immobilisation, immobilisation and physiotherapy or no treatment were found, apart from one trial where patients returned to work sooner after treatment with a soft cast. In all analyses performed, no results were significantly in favour of immobilisation.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Functional treatment appears to be the favourable strategy for treating acute ankle sprains when compared with immobilisation. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, as most of the differences are not significant after exclusion of the low quality trials. Many trials were poorly reported and there was variety amongst the functional treatments evaluated.

### Acute ankle sprain: an update [^113Mon8s]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Acute ankle injury, a common musculoskeletal injury, can cause ankle sprains. Some evidence suggests that previous injuries or limited joint flexibility may contribute to ankle sprains. The initial assessment of an acute ankle injury should include questions about the timing and mechanism of the injury. The Ottawa Ankle and Foot Rules provide clinical guidelines for excluding a fracture in adults and children and determining if radiography is indicated at the time of injury. Reexamination three to five days after injury, when pain and swelling have improved, may help with the diagnosis. Therapy for ankle sprains focuses on controlling pain and swelling. PRICE (Protection, Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation) is a well-established protocol for the treatment of ankle injury. There is some evidence that applying ice and using nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs improves healing and speeds recovery. Functional rehabilitation (e.g., motion restoration and strengthening exercises) is preferred over immobilization. Superiority of surgical repair versus functional rehabilitation for severe lateral ligament rupture is controversial. Treatment using semirigid supports is superior to using elastic bandages. Support devices provide some protection against future ankle sprains, particularly in persons with a history of recurrent sprains. Ankle disk or proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation exercise regimens also may be helpful, although the literature supporting this is limited.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ankle sprain, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, general principles, APTA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider including the following during the initial assessment because of their role in influencing the clinical course and estimation of time to accomplish the goals in patients with chronic ankle instability:

- previous treatment

- number of sprains

- pain level

- self-report of function

- assessment of the sensorimotor movement systems of the foot, ankle, knee, and hip during dynamic postural control and functional movements.

### Advances in diagnosis and management of lateral ankle instability: a review of current literature [^115CnBBm]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Lateral ankle sprains and instability are an increasingly identified pain point for patients, accounting for 20 to 25% of musculoskeletal injuries. Lateral ankle injuries are especially concerning given the propensity for patients to develop chronic lateral ankle instability and for the high risk of reinjury on an unstable ankle. With the complex articulation of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, subtalar, and talocrural joints, pinpointing ankle dysfunction remains difficult. Multiple reviews have evaluated management and diagnosis of lateral ankle instability, but with newer treatment options available, a more comprehensive assessment of the current literature was conducted. Although multiple surgical options exist, many nonsurgical functional options have also been developed for patients that may help patients prevent the development of chronic lateral ankle instability. In recent times, many new options have come up, including in-office needle arthroscopy and continual advancements in diagnosis and our understanding of this difficult topic. Multiple reviews have evaluated the management and diagnosis of lateral ankle instability, but with newer treatment options available, a more comprehensive assessment of the current literature was conducted. Given this, this review will help to highlight new diagnostic and nonsurgical therapeutic options for the management of lateral ankle instability.

### Effect of early supervised physiotherapy on recovery from acute ankle sprain: randomised controlled trial [^116Qrbv4]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and implications for practice

Our trial provides level I evidence that supervised physiotherapy, as described, does not provide clinically important benefit in the management of simple ankle sprains in a general population of patients seeking care in an acute care setting. Our comparator of usual care was the provision of written recommendations for initial rest, cryotherapy, compression, and limb elevation, with graduated mobility being encouraged as tolerated. These recommendations stem from basic principles of physiotherapy, which, to our knowledge, are commonly provided in emergency departments. This format of usual care is associated with minimal cost and is unlikely to ever be assessed against no care. We do note that 43% of participants in the physiotherapy arm and 38% in the control arm had not reached excellent recovery by six months; this being lower than anticipated. This suggests that while there was not a clinically important effect with the standardised physiotherapy regimen provided to our participants, there is potential for the investigation of alternative interventions that would reduce morbidity in patients with these injuries.

### Ankle stability and movement coordination impairments: ankle ligament sprains [^1114wP7k]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2013). Medium credibility.

Ankle ligament sprain clinical practice guidelines — statement of intent — clarify that these guidelines are not intended to be construed or to serve as a standard of medical care and that these parameters of practice should be considered guidelines only. Adherence to them will not ensure a successful outcome in every patient, nor should they be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care aimed at the same results, and the ultimate judgment regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made in light of the clinical data presented by the patient; the diagnostic and treatment options available; and the patient's values, expectations, and preferences. However, we suggest that significant departures from accepted guidelines should be documented in the patient's medical records at the time the relevant clinical decision is made.

### Surgical versus conservative treatment for acute injuries of the lateral ligament complex of the ankle in adults [^114pXeXQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Ankle sprains are one of the most commonly treated musculoskeletal injuries. The three main treatment modalities for acute lateral ankle ligament injuries are immobilisation with plaster cast or splint, 'functional treatment' comprising early mobilisation and use of an external support (e.g. ankle brace), and surgical repair or reconstruction.

Objectives

We aimed to compare surgical versus conservative treatment for acute injuries of the lateral ligament complex of the ankle in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (January 2006), the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2005, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2005), EMBASE, CINAHL and reference lists of articles, and contacted researchers in the field. This review is considered updated to January 2006.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing surgical with conservative interventions for treating ankle sprains in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two authors independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Where appropriate, results of comparable studies were pooled. We performed sensitivity analyses to explore the robustness of the findings.

Main Results

Twenty trials were included. These involved a total of 2562 mostly young active adult males. All trials had methodological weaknesses. Specifically, concealment of allocation was confirmed in only one trial. Data for pooling individual outcomes were only available for a maximum of 12 trials and under 60% of participants. The findings of statistically significant differences in favour of the surgical treatment group for the four primary outcomes (non-return to pre-injury level of sports; ankle sprain recurrence; long-term pain; subjective or functional instability) when using the fixed-effect model were not robust when using the random-effects model, nor on the removal of one low quality (quasi-randomised) trial that had more extreme results. A corresponding drop in the I(2) statistics showed the remaining trials to be more homogeneous. The functional implications of the statistically significantly higher incidence of objective instability in conservatively treated trial participants are uncertain. There was some limited evidence for longer recovery times, and higher incidences of ankle stiffness, impaired ankle mobility and complications in the surgical treatment group.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence available from randomised controlled trials to determine the relative effectiveness of surgical and conservative treatment for acute injuries of the lateral ligament complex of the ankle. High quality randomised controlled trials of primary surgical repair versus the best available conservative treatment for well-defined injuries are required.

### Surgical versus conservative treatment for acute injuries of the lateral ligament complex of the ankle in adults [^116rymsF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Inversion injuries, primarily sprains, of the ankle are one of the most commonly treated injuries. The three main treatment modalities for acute lateral ankle ligament injuries are immobilisation with plaster cast or splint, 'functional treatment' comprising early mobilisation and the use of an external support (e.g. ankle brace or taping), and surgical repair or reconstruction.

Objectives

We aimed to compare surgical versus conservative treatment for acute injuries of the lateral ligament complex of the ankle in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group specialised register (December 2001), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2001), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2000), EMBASE (1980 to May 2000), CURRENT CONTENTS (1993 to 1999), BIOSIS (to 1999), reference lists of articles, and contacted organisations and researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing surgical with conservative interventions for treating acute injuries to the lateral ligament complex of the ankle in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two, usually three, reviewers independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Where appropriate, results of comparable studies were pooled using fixed and random effects models and relative risks with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes calculated. Heterogeneity between trials was tested using a standard chi-squared test. We undertook sensitivity analyses to explore the effects of inclusion of quasi-randomised trials and subgroup analyses by the two main methods of conservative treatment.

Main Results

Seventeen studies, involving a total of 1950 mostly young active adult males, were included. All trials had methodological flaws. In particular, allocation was rated as effectively concealed in only one trial and there was no report of masking outcome assessors to the interventions in any trial. Outcome measures were variously defined and data for pooling for individual outcomes were only available for a maximum of 11 studies. While there were statistically significant differences for three primary outcomes (non-return to pre-injury level of sports; undefined pain or pain on activity; and subjective or functional instability) in favour of the surgical treatment group using the fixed effects model, these findings failed to demonstrate robustness in sensitivity analyses. Exclusion of the data from explicitly quasi-randomised trials or, given the highly statistically significant heterogeneity, analyses using the random effects model modified these findings to non-statistically significant differences. There was no statistically significant difference in ankle sprain recurrence, the other primary outcome measure. Though there was a statistically significantly higher incidence of objective instability in conservatively treated patients, the functional implications of this are uncertain. There was some evidence for a lower incidence of long-term ankle swelling in surgically treated patients. However, as well as tending to take longer to resume normal activities, including work, there was some limited evidence from a few trials for a higher incidence of ankle stiffness, impaired ankle mobility and complications in the surgical treatment group. Subgroup analyses by type of conservative treatment (plaster cast or functional treatment) revealed no statistically significant differences in effect for any of the six outcomes examined.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence available from randomised controlled trials to determine the relative effectiveness of surgical and conservative treatment for acute injuries of the lateral ligament complex of the ankle. Sufficiently powered, good quality and adequately reported randomised trials of primary surgical repair versus the best available conservative treatment for well-defined injuries are required.

### Nonoperative management of high ankle sprains: a case series with ≥ 18-year follow-up [^117YWYMc]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

High ankle sprains are common athletic injuries and can be associated with long-term sequelae. Regardless of operative or nonoperative treatment, there is a paucity of data in the literature about the long-term outcomes of high ankle sprains.

Hypothesis

Nonoperative treatment of high ankle sprains utilizing a standardized protocol will result in good long-term outcomes.

Study Design

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

Patients who experienced a high ankle sprain without radiographic diastasis of the syndesmosis were identified from a previous study database and contacted for long-term follow-up. All patients were high school or National Collegiate Athletic Association Division IA athletes at initial injury and were treated nonoperatively with the same standardized protocol. Patients completed a questionnaire that included documentation of any interim ankle injuries, 2 different patient-reported outcome scores, and ankle radiographs to conduct Kellgren-Lawrence scoring for ankle osteoarthritis.

Results

In total, 76 cases in 74 patients were identified in the database. A total of 40 patients were successfully contacted, and 31 patients (24 collegiate and 7 high school athletes) with 33 high ankle sprains completed the survey (31/40; 77.5%). The mean age at follow-up was 45 years (range, 34–50 years), with a mean time from injury to follow-up of 25 years. Overall, 93.5% (n = 29) of the respondents were male, and 42% (n = 13) of the respondents reported an ipsilateral ankle injury since their initial injury, with 16% (n = 5) having ankle or Achilles surgery. The mean Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-10 score was 53.4 (SD, 8.3; range, 37.4–67.7), PROMIS median (IQR), 54.1 (39.9, 68.3), and the mean Self-reported Foot and Ankle Score score was 42.7 (SD, 5.86). Follow-up ankle radiographs were obtained in 11 (35%) of the respondents; 27% had Kellgren-Lawrence grade > 2 osteoarthritis, and 36% had signs of heterotopic ossification on imaging. The mean tibiofibular clear space was 4.5 mm, and the mean tibiofibular overlap was 7.15 mm, with 27% of patients demonstrating some tibiotalar narrowing.

Conclusion

At long-term follow-up, nonoperative management of high ankle sprains without diastasis on imaging was associated with acceptable patient-reported functional outcomes and low rates of subsequent ankle injuries. There was a high incidence of arthritis, but most cases were not clinically significant. This case series shows the natural history of nonoperatively treated high ankle sprains and may serve as a comparison for different management techniques in the future.

### Treatment and prevention of acute and recurrent ankle sprain: an overview of systematic reviews with meta-analysis [^115yeb25]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Ankle sprains are highly prevalent with high risk of recurrence. Consequently, there are a significant number of research reports examining strategies for treating and preventing acute and recurrent sprains (otherwise known as chronic ankle instability (CAI)), with a coinciding proliferation of review articles summarising these reports.

Objective

To provide a systematic overview of the systematic reviews evaluating treatment strategies for acute ankle sprain and CAI.

Design

Overview of intervention systematic reviews.

Participants

Individuals with acute ankle sprain/CAI.

Main Outcome Measurements

The primary outcomes were injury/reinjury incidence and function.

Results

46 papers were included in this systematic review. The reviews had a mean score of 6.5/11 on the AMSTAR quality assessment tool. There was strong evidence for bracing and moderate evidence for neuromuscular training in preventing recurrence of an ankle sprain. For the combined outcomes of pain, swelling and function after an acute sprain, there was strong evidence for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and early mobilisation, with moderate evidence supporting exercise and manual therapy techniques. There was conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of surgery and acupuncture for the treatment of acute ankle sprains. There was insufficient evidence to support the use of ultrasound in the treatment of acute ankle sprains.

Conclusions

For the treatment of acute ankle sprain, there is strong evidence for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and early mobilisation, with moderate evidence supporting exercise and manual therapy techniques, for pain, swelling and function. Exercise therapy and bracing are supported in the prevention of CAI.

Ankle ligament sprain clinical practice guidelines — methods and levels of evidence — state that content experts were organized by the Orthopaedic Section of the APTA and that the authors of this guideline independently performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (1967 through April 2012) for relevant articles, with reference lists hand searched; the guideline was issued in 2013 based on publications prior to April 2012 and will be considered for review in 2017, or sooner if new evidence becomes available. Individual clinical research articles were graded according to criteria described by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, Oxford, UK for diagnostic, prospective, and therapeutic studies, and if the 2 content experts did not agree on a grade of evidence for a particular article, a third content expert was used to resolve the issue.

### Effect of early supervised physiotherapy on recovery from acute ankle sprain: randomised controlled trial [^111GXGqH]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

With the participation of 503 patients, our trial is the largest randomised controlled trial to have evaluated the therapeutic benefits of supervised physiotherapy in the treatment of acute ankle sprains. Based on our outcomes, we conclude that among patients aged 16–79 presenting to an emergency department with a simple grade 1 or 2 ankle sprain within 72 hours of their injury, the addition of early supervised physiotherapy to usual care does not lead to clinically important improvements in functional recovery up to six months after injury, compared with usual care alone. The absence of a therapeutic benefit of supervised exercise was confirmed for our primary outcome of excellent functional recovery as assessed by the FAOS at three months, as well as for the FAOS (using both excellent recovery and continuous scores) and objective clinical and biomechanical measures at one, three, and six months after injury. Our finding is clinically important as the recommendation of physiotherapy for the management of acute ankle sprains comes with substantial economic costs.

Strengths of the trial

Our trial conformed to the CONSORT guidelines. Our main findings are unlikely to be explained by imbalances in confounding factors, both known and unknown, between the trial arms. Baseline group comparisons essentially showed equivalence on such factors, suggesting that the approach to randomisation and its administration were effective. Although participants were volunteers, the study population was large and heterogeneous, and, because of the use and effectiveness of randomisation, it is unlikely that any forces of selection resulted in bias in the observed effect estimates. A participation rate of 88% at the three month primary endpoint and 80% at six months was maintained. Subgroup analyses suggested a benefit of physiotherapy at three months in younger patients (aged < 30). The direction of effect was not consistent, however, and favoured the usual care group at one and six months. There were no significant differences between study arms in subgroup analyses by sex, cause of injury (such as sports related or not), and grade of injury (grade 1 or 2) at one, three, and six months after injury.

### Ankle stability and movement coordination impairments: ankle ligament sprains [^1166NhMn]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute lateral ankle sprain — surgery versus conservative or functional management evidence is summarized: When nonsurgical intervention is ineffective to address symptoms and disablement following lateral ankle sprain, surgical intervention may be indicated. A review comparing conservative versus surgical interventions was able to pool outcomes from 12 trials and identified a statistically significantly higher incidence of instability in conservatively treated patients, but the overall conclusion was that there was insufficient evidence available from randomized controlled trials to determine the effectiveness of surgical intervention for lateral ligament sprains. In a study of physically active males (mean age, 20.4 years) with acute grade III injuries who were randomly allocated to surgical (n = 25) or functional (n = 26) treatment, long-term follow-up (mean, 14 years) found both groups had recovered to preinjury activity level; the prevalence of reinjury was 1 of 15 in the surgical group and 7 of 18 in the functional treatment group, and grade III osteoarthritis was observed on magnetic resonance images in 4 of the 15 surgically treated patients. The study concluded that the long-term results of surgical treatment of acute lateral ligament rupture of the ankle are comparable with functional treatment, and surgery appeared to decrease the prevalence of reinjury, potentially at the expense of increasing the risk of developing posttraumatic osteoarthritis.

### Efficacy of thrust and nonthrust manipulation and exercise with or without the addition of myofascial therapy for the management of acute inversion ankle sprain: a randomized clinical trial [^114EG5nN]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Randomized clinical trial.

Objective

To compare the effects of thrust and nonthrust manipulation and exercises with and without the addition of myofascial therapy for the treatment of acute inversion ankle sprain.

Background

Studies have reported that thrust and nonthrust manipulations of the ankle joint are effective for the management of patients post-ankle sprain. However, it is not known whether the inclusion of soft tissue myofascial therapy could further improve clinical and functional outcomes.

Methods

Fifty patients (37 men and 13 women; mean ± SD age, 33 ± 10 years) post-acute inversion ankle sprain were randomly assigned to 2 groups: a comparison group that received a thrust and nonthrust manipulation and exercise intervention, and an experimental group that received the same protocol and myofascial therapy. The primary outcomes were ankle pain at rest and functional ability. Additionally, ankle mobility and pressure pain threshold over the ankle were assessed by a clinician who was blinded to the treatment allocation. Outcomes of interest were captured at baseline, immediately after the treatment period, and at a 1-month follow-up. The primary analysis was the group-by-time interaction.

Results

The 2-by-3 mixed-model analyses of variance revealed a significant group-by-time interaction for ankle pain (P < .001) and functional score (P = 0.002), with the patients who received the combination of nonthrust and thrust manipulation and myofascial intervention experiencing a greater improvement in pain and function than those who received the nonthrust and thrust manipulation intervention alone. Significant group-by-time interactions were also observed for ankle mobility (P < .001) and pressure pain thresholds (all, P < .01), with those in the experimental group experiencing greater increases in ankle mobility and pressure pain thresholds. Between-group effect sizes were large (d > 0.85) for all outcomes.

Conclusion

This study provides evidence that, in the treatment of individuals post-inversion ankle sprain, the addition of myofascial therapy to a plan of care consisting of thrust and nonthrust manipulation and exercise may further improve outcomes compared to a plan of care solely consisting of thrust and nonthrust manipulation and exercise. However, though statistically significant, the difference in improvement in the primary outcome between groups was not greater than what would be considered a minimal clinically important difference. Future studies should examine the long-term effects of these interventions in this population.

### Chronic complaints after ankle sprains: a systematic review on effectiveness of treatments [^116GrZnM]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review. Objective To determine the effectiveness of treatments for patients with chronic complaints after ankle sprain.

Background

Though most people recover completely after a lateral inversion ankle injury, a considerable percentage have persistent complaints. Currently, it is still unclear which treatment options are best for these patients.

Methods

Major databases, including PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and PEDro, were searched for randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials conducted from 1966 to October 2012. Due to clinical heterogeneity, the data were analyzed using a best-evidence synthesis.

Results

A total of 20 randomized controlled trials and 1 controlled clinical trial were included in the analysis. The included studies compared different treatments (training programs, physiotherapy, chiropractic/manual therapy, surgery, postoperative training, and functional treatment). For pain and function outcomes, limited to moderate evidence was found for effectiveness of a training program compared to conservative treatment. Two studies found a decrease of recurrences after a proprioceptive training program. Four studies showed good results for different surgical methods but did not include a nonsurgical control group for comparison. Limited evidence was found for the effectiveness of an early mobilization program after surgery.

Conclusion

In chronic ankle complaints after an ankle sprain, a training program gives better results for pain and function, and a decrease of recurrent ankle sprains, than a wait-and-see policy. There was insufficient evidence to determine the most effective surgical treatment, but limited evidence suggests that postoperative, early mobilization was more effective than a plaster cast.

### Management of acute ankle sprain with sodium hyaluronate… [^117QJ6eR]. ClinicalTrials (2013). Low credibility.

It is expected that the Hyaluronic acid injections will decrease pain and swelling, promote healing, improve time to return to sport and increase mobility. Ankle sprains most commonly affect the lateral ligament complex. The lateral ligament complex of the ankle consists of three separate ligaments: anterior talofibular, posterior talofibular and calcaneofibular. The anterior talofibular ligament is usually the ligament affected although in more severe injuries the calcaneofibular ligament may also be involved. Varus or inversion sprains include a spectrum of severity. Symptoms may include pain, swelling, tenderness and functional loss. Ankle sprains are classified as first-, second- or third-degree ankle sprains.

A first-degree sprain represents a partial tear of a ligament with mild tenderness and swelling, a second-degree sprain represents incomplete tear of a ligament with moderate functional impairment, pain and swelling, and a third-degree sprain represents a complete tear and loss of integrity of a ligament and presents with severe swelling, ecchymosis, loss of function and mechanical instability. The emphasis of therapy in ankle sprains is centered on reducing the inflammation and pain rapidly following injury. Guidelines for the treatment of acute ankle sprain from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons recommend initial rehabilitation program with NSAIDs, RICE as well as protected weight bearing, early mobilization and isometrics. The aim of this non-controlled study is to evaluate the efficacy and of hyaluronic acid in the treatment of acute ankle sprain.

It is expected to decrease pain and swelling, promote healing, improve time to return to pain and disability-free sport and not increase adverse events compared to standard care and placebo.
4. 0 STUDY DESIGN This is a single-site, open-label, non-controlled trial on the efficacy and safety of Adant in patients with acute ankle sprain. The study will include a screening phase where patients will be assessed based on selected inclusion and exclusion criteria. Prior to enrollment, patients will undergo a screening assessment that will include a physical exam. A diagnosis of first or second-degree ankle sprain will be made. Pain severity will be assessed using a Pain Visual Analogue Scale. After enrollment, patients will be administered Adant.

### WITHDRAWN: immobilisation and functional treatment for acute lateral ankle ligament injuries in adults [^113LTca2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acute lateral ankle ligament injuries (ankle sprains) are common problems in acute medical care. The treatment variation observed for the acutely injured lateral ankle ligament complex suggests a lack of evidence-based management strategies for this problem.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of methods of immobilisation for acute lateral ankle ligament injuries and to compare immobilisation with functional treatment methods.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group specialised register (December 2001); the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2001), MEDLINE (1966-May 2000), EMBASE (1988-May 2000), reference lists of articles, and contacted organisations and researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing either different types of immobilisation or immobilisation versus functional treatments for injuries to the lateral ligament complex of the ankle in adults were included. Trials which investigated the treatment of chronic instability or post-surgical treatment were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted by two authors. Where appropriate, results of comparable studies were pooled using fixed effects models. Individual and pooled statistics were reported as relative risks with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes and weighted (WMD) or standardised (SMD) mean differences and 95% confidence intervals for continuous outcome measures. Heterogeneity between trials was tested using a standard chi-squared test.

Main Results

Twenty-one trials involving 2184 participants were included. The mean validity score of the included trials increased from 9.1 (SD 3.0) to 10 (SD 2.9) after retrieving further information (maximum 18 points). Statistically significant differences in favour of functional treatment when compared with immobilisation were found for seven outcome measures: more patients returned to sport in the long term (relative risk (RR) 1.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 2.86); the time taken to return to sport was shorter (WMD 4.88 (days), 95% CI 1.50 to 8.25); more patients had returned to work at short term follow-up (RR 5.75, 95% CI 1.01 to 32.71); the time taken to return to work was shorter (WMD 8.23 days, 95% CI 6.31 to 10.16); fewer patients suffered from persistent swelling at short term follow-up (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.59); fewer patients suffered from objective instability as tested by stress X-ray (WMD 2.60, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.96); and patients treated functionally were more satisfied with their treatment (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.07). A separate analysis of trials that scored 50 per cent or more in quality assessment found a similar result for time to return to work only (WMD (days) 12.89, 95% CI 7.10 to 18.67). No significant differences between varying types of immobilisation, immobilisation and physiotherapy or no treatment were found, apart from one trial where patients returned to work sooner after treatment with a soft cast. In all analyses performed, no results were significantly in favour of immobilisation.

Authors' Conclusions

Functional treatment appears to be the favourable strategy for treating acute ankle sprains when compared with immobilisation. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, as most of the differences are not significant after exclusion of the low quality trials. Many trials were poorly reported and there was variety amongst the functional treatments evaluated.

Ankle ligament sprain — acute/protected motion phase interventions: In more severe injuries, immobilization ranging from semi-rigid bracing to below-knee casting may be indicated (Recommendation based on strong evidence.). Clinicians should use manual therapy procedures, such as lymphatic drainage, active and passive soft tissue and joint mobilization, and anterior-to-posterior talar mobilization procedures, within pain-free movement to reduce swelling, improve pain-free ankle and foot mobility, and normalize gait parameters in individuals with an acute lateral ankle sprain (Recommendation based on moderate evidence.). Clinicians should implement rehabilitation programs that include therapeutic exercises for patients with severe lateral ankle sprains (Recommendation based on strong evidence.). For physical agents, clinicians should use repeated intermittent applications of ice to reduce pain, decrease the need for pain medication, and improve weight bearing following an acute ankle sprain (Recommendation based on strong evidence.); clinicians can utilize pulsed shortwave diathermy for reducing edema and gait deviations associated with acute ankle sprains (Recommendation based on weak evidence.); there is moderate evidence both for and against the use of electrotherapy for the management of acute ankle sprains (Recommendation based on conflicting evidence.); there is moderate evidence both for and against the use of low-level laser therapy for the management of acute ankle sprains (Recommendation based on conflicting evidence.); and clinicians should not use ultrasound for the management of acute ankle sprains (Recommendation based on strong evidence.).

### Management and return to play of the elite athlete for common sports-related injuries about the ankle [^112fZrBJ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Ankle injuries are among the common injuries seen in many collegiate and professional sports. The wide range of pathology, pathophysiology, mechanisms of injury, differences in sport demands, evolution of treatment, and variable return to play (RTP) timelines make it difficult, at times, for physicians to treat these injuries. Modern diagnostic tools, surgical treatment devices, and rehabilitation protocols have allowed for more accurate and rapid diagnosis, an improved ability to reestablish normal anatomy, and accelerated RTP for many ankle sports-related injuries. This summary will provide up-to-date, evidence-based, treatment options for common sports-related ankle injuries along with the authors preferred method of treatment and RTP algorithms for the elite athlete.

### Evidence review for the 2016 international ankle consortium consensus statement on the prevalence, impact and long-term consequences of lateral ankle sprains [^113Q76UQ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Lateral ankle sprains (LASs) are the most prevalent musculoskeletal injury in physically active populations. They also have a high prevalence in the general population and pose a substantial healthcare burden. The recurrence rates of LASs are high, leading to a large percentage of patients with LAS developing chronic ankle instability. This chronicity is associated with decreased physical activity levels and quality of life and associates with increasing rates of post-traumatic ankle osteoarthritis, all of which generate financial costs that are larger than many have realised. The literature review that follows expands this paradigm and introduces emerging areas that should be prioritised for continued research, supporting a companion position statement paper that proposes recommendations for using this summary of information, and needs for specific future research.

### Bone bruises associated with acute ankle ligament injury: do they need treatment? [^113ma8ma]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this systematic review is to analyse the current knowledge, incidence, relevance, and need for treatment of bone bruises associated with acute ankle ligament injury.

Methods

A search was made of PubMed, OVID/Medline, Cochrane databases using the keyword "bone bruises" in combination with "ankle", "sprain", "management", "surgery", and "conservative treatment".

Results

No randomized controlled trials or prospective cohort studies were found. Only case series were retrieved. A critical appraisal for validity and usefulness of the studies revealed that the best level of evidence on this topic is represented by retrospective comparative studies. Nine studies evaluating the management of bone bruises associated with acute ankle ligament injuries were found.

Conclusion

The clinical prognosis of bone bruises is generally good, with a normalization of MRI appearance usually within 6–12 months after trauma. Currently, there is no evidence that these lesions need specific treatment. Thus, the management of the concomitant ligament lesions is sufficient. Further research is necessary to successfully address the management of bone bruises, and more evidence is required to decide if these lesions need to be treated at all.

### Supervised physiotherapy for mild or moderate ankle sprain [^115ah3QR]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Lateral ankle sprains are the most common musculoskeletal injuries in physically active populations. Incidence rates in the general population are also high, at an estimated five to seven injuries per 1000 people per year. More than 40% of patients fail to recover because of persistent pain, recurrent injury, and instability. These symptoms, which are characteristic of chronic ankle instability, result in long term constraints to levels of physical activity and could be a key mediator for post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Despite this, many patients regard ankle sprains as being innocuous with fewer than half seeking formal medical care. This generally occurs in an emergency care facility and is based on advice for self management. While supervised rehabilitation represents a more comprehensive approach, there is ongoing controversy around its cost benefit ratio.

The randomised controlled study by Brison and colleagues (doi:) is one of the largest to assess the therapeutic benefits of supervised physiotherapy after acute ankle sprain. The authors recruited 503 patients, aged 16–79, presenting with mild or moderate ankle sprains to two acute care settings in Canada. Participants were randomised to receive usual care (based on protection, rest, ice, compression, and elevation) or usual care plus a regimen of supervised rehabilitation. Ankle function reported by patients, re-injury, clinical measures, and laboratory based assessments of ankle strength were recorded at one, three, and six months. Stratification was used to ensure that baseline function was similar across each of the intervention groups, and retention was 80% at the six month follow-up.

The findings showed few differences between groups, suggesting that the addition of supervised rehabilitation to usual care results in little clinical benefit. This conflicts with the current evidence base. In a recent meta-analysis, pooled data from 23 randomised controlled studies involving participants with a history of ankle sprains found that rehabilitative exercises were associated with significant improvements in self reported function and reduced risk of recurrent injury (odds ratio 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.49, 0.66). Sensitivity analyses suggested that the risk of recurrent injury was lowest in studies that used a higher cumulative duration of therapeutic exercise (more than 900 minutes) (0.48, 0.37 to 0.63). Brison and colleaguesused a maximum of seven lots of 30 minutes of supervised exercise interventions (total 210 minutes), which, though supplemented by a home based exercise regimen, might be a "lower dose" than other studies.

Lateral ankle ligament sprains — statement of intent clarifies guideline use: These parameters of practice should be considered guidelines only, and adherence to them will not ensure a successful outcome in every patient nor should they be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care aimed at the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made based on clinical experience and expertise in light of the clinical presentation of the patient, the available evidence, available diagnostic and treatment options, and the patient's values, expectations, and preferences, and we suggest that significant departures from accepted guidelines should be documented in the patient's medical records at the time the relevant clinical decision is made.

Ankle ligament sprain — evidence levels and recommendation grades are defined as follows: Level I is "Evidence obtained from high-quality diagnostic studies, prospective studies, or randomized controlled trials"; Level II is "Evidence obtained from lesser-quality diagnostic studies, prospective studies, or randomized controlled trials (eg, weaker diagnostic criteria and reference standards, improper randomization, no blinding, less than 80% follow-up)"; Level III is "Case-control studies or retrospective studies"; Level IV is "Case series"; and Level V is "Expert opinion". Recommendation grades are defined as A "A preponderance of level I and/or level II studies support the recommendation. This must include at least 1 level I study", B "A single high-quality randomized controlled trial or a preponderance of level II studies support the recommendation", C "A single level II study or a preponderance of level III and IV studies, including statements of consensus by content experts, support the recommendation", D "Higher-quality studies conducted on this topic disagree with respect to their conclusions. The recommendation is based on these conflicting studies", E "A preponderance of evidence from animal or cadaver studies, from conceptual models/principles, or from basic science/bench research supports this conclusion", and F "Best practice based on the clinical experience of the guidelines development team". The guideline explains that "the typical A, B, C, and D grades of evidence have been modified to include the role of consensus expert opinion and basic science research to demonstrate biological or biomechanical plausibility".

Foot and ankle injuries are a frequent cause for a visit to the Emergency Department. A thorough evaluation and treatment of these injuries needs to be an area of in-depth familiarity for the Emergency Medicine physician. The key to proper evaluation is first a history and physical examination that focuses on determining what, if any, imaging is required. Subsequently, a focused history, physical examination, and imaging will then determine if an injury is stable or unstable, requiring operative intervention.

Nonsurgical

Many principles in nonsurgical treatment of lateral ankle instability exist, but the primary goal of all therapies is to improve the function of the dynamic stabilizers of the ankle and is always indicated for purely ligamentous injuries before surgery. Aggressive functional rehabilitation with range of motion and advancing weight-bearing status should be delayed in cases that present with bony abnormalities, such as lateral process fractures or anterior process fractures. In addition, suspected syndesmotic injuries or avulsion fractures may respond better to a more conservative treatment with prolonged use of a LAI walker as opposed to the rapid functional rehab that is used for a lateral ankle sprain.

When conservative therapy is identified as an option, it is important to identify signs of treatment failure based on patient-specific factors and goals of care to identify the need to advance treatment to surgical options. No firm end points have been established to label the failure of conservative management, although traditionally 3 to 6 months without improvement is widely used. Among the external stabilizing devices used to facilitate this, popular options include ankle orthoses and ankle taping. Although these orthoses do not directly rectify the issue, they do prevent the negative consequences of ankle laxity by providing the external support needed to correct ankle motion as shown by some studies, especially when custom-molded orthoses are used. In fact, when evaluating inversion angles and velocity at the ankle, there was a significant reduction in both parameters with the use of bracing treatment.

### Effect of early supervised physiotherapy on recovery from acute ankle sprain: randomised controlled trial [^115Za3cZ]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We undertook a parallel group randomised controlled trial of adults attending the emergency department with ankle injuries. We evaluated the efficacy of a standardised intervention of supervised physiotherapy plus usual emergency medical care versus usual emergency care alone in augmenting functional recovery from grade 1 or 2 ankle sprains at one, three, and six months. Recovery was assessed with a standardised patient assessed outcome score of ankle function — the foot and ankle outcome score (FAOS), as well as clinical and biomechanical measures of ankle function. The primary outcome of efficacy was defined, a priori, as "excellent" recovery (a total score ≥ 450/500) at three months. We hypothesised that a standardised evidence based programme of supervised physiotherapywould improve the near term functional outcomes of ankle sprains. In terms of clinical relevance, high quality evidence regarding the efficacy of physiotherapy would assist acute and primary care physicians in providing recommendations for treatment to patients with ankle sprains.

Participants

Prospective participants were patients presenting for acute medical treatment of an ankle sprain to one of two acute care settings affiliated with Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The Kingston General Hospital is a 450 bed tertiary care facility providing full emergency department care and the Hotel Dieu Hospital is an ambulatory care hospital with an urgent care setting. Together, these partner facilities manage 95 000–100 000 encounters with acute care patients each year, of which 20% are injury related.

We adopted broad inclusion criteria so that our trial cohort was representative of a general adult population presenting for assessment and treatment of ankle sprains. Eligibility criteria were age ≥ 16; clinical diagnosis of grade 1 or 2 ankle sprain, which could include clinically unimportant avulsion fractures (< 3 mm of displacement), with injury sustained less than 72 hours before presentation for assessment; fluency in spoken English; competent to provide informed consent, based on clinical judgment during interview with the patient; willingness to participate in the assessments in the Queen's University motor performance laboratory as per protocol at baseline and at one, three, and six months after injury; and a total FAOS < 450 measured at the baseline visit in the motor performance laboratory. The exclusion criteria were injury mechanisms that were inconsistent with a ligamentous sprain (such as direct impact); the attending emergency physician determining the need for immobilisation of the injured ankle or surgery based on clinical findings; presentation with concomitant injuries; other mobility limiting conditions; inability to accommodate the time intensive study protocol; and a declared plan to seek physiotherapy for treatment outside the study protocol.

### Bracing superior to neuromuscular training for the prevention of self-reported recurrent ankle sprains: a three-arm randomised controlled trial [^116Qo8Ft]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Implications

Practitioners treating athletes progressively rely on evidence-based guidelines for advice not only on treatment, but also on prevention of ankle sprains. While during the last decade various studies emphasised the effectiveness of neuromuscular training and bracing for the secondary prevention of ankle sprains, the clinical guidelines are still vague on their actual implementation. In this trial, bracing was superior to neuromuscular training in reducing the incidence but not the severity of self-reported recurrent ankle sprains after usual care. We encourage future studies to investigate the effects of bracing and neuromuscular training on patient-reported outcomes such as pain and instability, and to quantify the clinical relevance of self-reported ankle sprains.

What are the new findings?

Bracing is superior to neuromuscular training for the prevention of self-reported ankle sprain recurrences.
Bracing is associated with an added 47% reduction in risk of recurrence versus neuromuscular training.
Full compliance to neuromuscular training and bracing as individual home-based interventions was 45% and 48%, respectively, in the first 2 months, but when the interventions were combined the compliance dropped to 28%.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the near future?

Although the current clinical guidelines are vague on the prescription of neuromuscular training and bracing, the study results support the prescription of bracing as single secondary preventive measure for the prevention of self-reported recurrences.
As in our study bracing was proven effective when prescribed during sports for 12 months, the prescription period of brace use in athletes needs to be extended, instead of being phased out.

### Economic evaluations of diagnostic tests, treatment and prevention for lateral ankle sprains: a systematic review [^117EfRAp]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess and summarise the economic evidence regarding diagnostic tests, treatment and prevention for lateral ankle sprains.

Methods

Potential studies were identified from electronic databases and trial registries and by scanning reference lists. Risk of bias and methodological quality were evaluated. Two independent reviewers screened, assessed studies and extracted data. Data were synthesised descriptively due to study heterogeneity.

Results

A total of 230 records were identified; 10 studies were included. Five studies conducted a full economic evaluation and five studies involved cost analyses. Lack of blinding was the main risk of bias. The methodological quality of the full economic evaluations was fairly good. Valuation of costs, measurement of outcomes and sensitivity analysis were points for improvement. Single studies showed that the Ottawa ankle rules (OAR) was cost effective for diagnosing lateral ankle sprains in the emergency setting compared with existing hospital protocols; acute treatment with anti-inflammatory medication and the plaster cast for severe sprains appeared cost effective; and neuromuscular training was cost effective in preventing ankle re-injury.

Conclusions

Results of this current systematic review supplements the evidence provided by reviews of effectiveness. There is evidence to support the implementation of OAR in the emergency setting, the use of anti-inflammatory medication and the plaster cast in the acute phase, and the prescription of neuromuscular exercises to prevent re-injury. Although the evidence is limited due to the low number of studies, shortcomings in methodological quality and small sample sizes, the findings may be used to inform clinical practice and practice guidelines.

### Effectiveness of additional supervised exercises compared with conventional treatment alone in patients with acute lateral ankle sprains: systematic review [^113M6K1J]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To summarise the effectiveness of adding supervised exercises to conventional treatment compared with conventional treatment alone in patients with acute lateral ankle sprains.

Design

Systematic review. Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cinahl, and reference screening.

Study Selection

Included studies were randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised controlled trials, or clinical trials. Patients were adolescents or adults with an acute lateral ankle sprain. The treatment options were conventional treatment alone or conventional treatment combined with supervised exercises. Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias, and one reviewer extracted data. Because of clinical heterogeneity we analysed the data using a best evidence synthesis. Follow-up was classified as short term (up to two weeks), intermediate (two weeks to three months), and long term (more than three months).

Results

11 studies were included. There was limited to moderate evidence to suggest that the addition of supervised exercises to conventional treatment leads to faster and better recovery and a faster return to sport at short term follow-up than conventional treatment alone. In specific populations (athletes, soldiers, and patients with severe injuries) this evidence was restricted to a faster return to work and sport only. There was no strong evidence of effectiveness for any of the outcome measures. Most of the included studies had a high risk of bias, with few having adequate statistical power to detect clinically relevant differences.

Conclusion

Additional supervised exercises compared with conventional treatment alone have some benefit for recovery and return to sport in patients with ankle sprain, though the evidence is limited or moderate and many studies are subject to bias.

### Comparison of conventional treatment and supervised rehabilitation for treatment of acute lateral ankle sprains: a systematic review of the literature [^112LH2Gm]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic literature review.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of conventional treatment complemented by supervised rehabilitation training (supervised exercises) with conventional treatment alone for the rehabilitation of acute lateral ankle sprains.

Background

Conventional treatment is advocated as a preferable treatment strategy. Whether supervised exercises should complement conventional treatment is unclear.

Methods and Measures

We searched 5 computerized databases from 1966 to March 2004, checked the reference lists of all studies that fulfilled our eligibility criteria, and searched for nonindexed journals available on the Internet. Three reviewers independently selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and controlled clinical trials (CCTs), comparing conventional treatment alone with conventional treatment combined with supervised exercises for treating patients with an acute lateral ankle sprain. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of each included study. Two reviewers extracted data regarding outcomes, interventions, and results. Follow-up measurements were grouped as (a) immediate term, (b) short term, (c) intermediate term, and (d) long term. A best-evidence synthesis was conducted, weighting the studies with respect to their internal validity and statistical significance of the outcomes.

Results

Seven RCTs were included. The quality assessment resulted in 1 high-quality and 6 low-quality studies. There is limited evidence that the addition of supervised exercises to a conventional treatment approach results in greater reduction in swelling and faster return to work. Studies reporting a lack of difference between treatment approach did not report statistical power, making interpretation of those results difficult.

Conclusions

The retrieved data failed to demonstrate a clearly superior treatment approach, although preliminary support exists for supervised exercises. Additional high-quality RCTs are needed that are appropriately designed and reported.

### Deltoid ligament injuries: a review of the anatomy, diagnosis and treatments [^111wrH8o]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Ankle sprains and injuries are common, with an incidence of 52.7–60.9 per 10,000 in the UK population. An estimated prevalence of 302,000 new ankle sprains present to Accident & Emergency in the United Kingdom each year, with 42,000 of these being classified as 'severe'. The majority of ankle sprains involve injuries to the lateral ligament complex, with some authors estimating only 5% of ankle sprains affect the deltoid ligament. However, there is increasing recognition that medial ligamentous injuries may be more frequently associated with ankle sprains and fractures than previously reported. Medial ankle instability has been associated with eversion‐type injuries to the ankle, and 3%–4% of all ankle ligament injuries are isolated to the deltoid ligament.

Although the precise anatomy of the deltoid has become better described over time, both the incidence and significance of partial and complete tears to the superficial and deep components are not well understood. Therefore, there are inconsistent recommendations in the literature as to the management and need for surgical repair following deltoid ligament injury.

The purpose of this review is to critically assess the literature with regard to the patho‐anatomy of deltoid ligament injuries, the clinical findings, diagnostic imaging and the rationale for treatment strategies.

### Population based epidemiology of ankle sprains attending accident and emergency units in the west midlands of england, and a survey of UK practice for severe ankle sprains [^116NkxyZ]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To estimate the incidence of ankle sprains and severe ankle sprains attending accident and emergency (A&E) units; to describe current practice for severe ankle sprains in A&E units in the United Kingdom.

Methods

Crude age and sex specific incidence rates were calculated for four health districts from cases ascertained from data on seven A&E clinical information systems. Case records of patients with ankle sprains at an A&E unit in another health district were audited and the proportion of severe ankle sprains calculated. UK A&E units were surveyed about their usual treatment of patients with severe ankle sprains.

Results

The estimate of the crude incidence rate of ankle sprains was a minimum of 52.7 per 10 000, rising to 60.9 (95% CI 59.4 to 62.4) when figures were adjusted for the proportion of patients without a diagnostic code (13.7%). There were important age-sex differences with unadjusted rates observed from 127.8 per 10 000 (CI 115.5 to 140.0) in girls aged 10–14 years to 8.2 (CI 4.2 to 12.3) in men aged 70–74 years. As 14% of ankle sprains attending A&E were classed as severe, this would equate to 42 000 severe ankle sprains per year in the UK. In the UK wide survey, there was a response rate of 79% (211 of 266). Among the responders, Tubigrip was used routinely in 55%, below knee casts in 3%, and braces in 2%. Boots were not used routinely in any unit.

Conclusion

While there is considerable variation in severe ankle sprain management in UK A&E units, most are treated with the minimal mechanical support of Tubigrip.
