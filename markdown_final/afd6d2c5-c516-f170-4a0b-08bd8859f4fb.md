## Question

What is the management of small bowel obstruction?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of small bowel obstruction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and identifying red flags that mandate emergent surgery. Then, I should verify the optimal diagnostic imaging strategy and how CT findings change management. Next, I will consider nonoperative management, including fluids, decompression, and water-soluble contrast, and define the safe window and triggers to escalate. After that, I need to review surgical indications, timing, and approach, including laparoscopy versus laparotomy. Finally, I should address special populations, recurrence prevention, and quality metrics that track outcomes and adherence to guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the priorities in the first hour: airway, breathing, circulation, and rapid identification of strangulation or peritonitis, because these override everything else. I need to check for peritoneal signs, systemic toxicity, or CT evidence of ischemia, and if present, proceed to emergent exploration without delay, as delays increase resection rates and mortality [^bb3805c5] [^1269fbf0].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging strategy before jumping to conclusions. Plain radiographs are insensitive and cannot exclude SBO, so I should not rely on them to decide operative status. CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is the diagnostic test of choice in suspected SBO because it defines level, severity, transition point, and ischemia with high accuracy and can change management, and ultrasound can be a useful adjunct at the bedside when CT is unavailable or contraindicated [^949896a7] [^ee340ab9] [^d354f535].

> Hold on, I should verify the nonoperative management protocol. In the absence of peritonitis, strangulation, or ischemia, a trial of nonoperative management is appropriate and successful in roughly 70–90% of adhesive SBOs. Core elements include NPO, nasogastric decompression, IV crystalloid resuscitation with electrolyte correction, and close monitoring for deterioration, ideally on a surgical service to reduce length of stay and mortality [^1269fbf0] [^1269fbf0] [^eabac0b5].

> I need to ensure I get the timing right. Most patients who will resolve do so within 48–72 hours, so a 72-hour window is reasonable, but I should double-check for warning signs at any point. If there is no improvement by 72 hours or if high-output NG drainage persists, I should escalate to surgery or a water-soluble contrast challenge to both predict resolution and potentially hasten it [^1269fbf0] [^b7c6e94e].

> Let me consider the role of water-soluble contrast. Administering Gastrografin via NG tube and obtaining an abdominal X-ray at 24 hours to document contrast reaching the colon predicts resolution with high accuracy and is associated with reduced need for surgery and shorter hospital stay. I should confirm that this is safe even in partial obstructions and that it does not mask ischemia when used alongside clinical monitoring [^fb8b0e19] [^7105c3cc].

> Next, I should review when to operate. Indications include generalized peritonitis, suspected or confirmed strangulation or ischemia, complete obstruction with failure to improve by 72 hours, or clinical deterioration such as fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, or continuous pain. I need to remember that CT signs like mesenteric edema, free fluid, absent small-bowel feces sign, or reduced enhancement increase the likelihood of ischemia and should lower my threshold for surgery [^4dd4bf33] [^7105c3cc] [^4636251d].

> I will now examine surgical approach. Laparoscopy is feasible and may reduce morbidity and length of stay in selected patients, but I should confirm patient selection: fewer prior operations, less distension, proximal obstruction, and anticipated single-band adhesions favor success, whereas massive distension, multiple prior midline incisions, or peritonitis push me toward open laparotomy. Importantly, conversion is not a failure and should be embraced early when visualization is poor or adhesions are dense [^2278ad00] [^ca38a651] [^913d2fa4].

> But wait, what if the patient has a virgin abdomen? I initially thought surgery was mandatory in this scenario, but let me reconsider. Recent data suggest adhesions account for about half of SBOs in patients without prior surgery, and nonoperative management can be successful in a substantial proportion, so I should not jump straight to the operating room if the patient is stable and there are no signs of ischemia; instead, I should apply the same principles with vigilance for alternative etiologies like hernia, malignancy, or volvulus [^12487729] [^730a88be] [^cda79973].

> I should double-check special populations. In the elderly or frail, atypical presentations and limited physiologic reserve increase risks with both delay and surgery, so I need to integrate geriatric assessment, frailty scoring, and goals-of-care discussions early, and consider a lower threshold for timely intervention when deterioration is likely, balancing quality-of-life priorities [^ea773694] [^83280de9] [^03cf0344].

> Let me verify recurrence prevention. Adhesions drive recurrence, and adhesion barriers can reduce recurrence risk after operative management, though they do not eliminate it. Minimally invasive techniques and meticulous adhesion prevention strategies should be emphasized when appropriate, and patients should be counseled about recurrence risk and early recognition of symptoms [^cf5fabb6] [^e228d1cc].

> Next, I should review quality metrics and guideline adherence. Prospective data show that care aligned with Bologna guidelines yields shorter length of stay and more optimal outcomes, yet full compliance is uncommon, highlighting a persistent evidence-to-practice gap. Tracking time to resolution, time to surgery when indicated, use of contrast, and 30-day readmissions can help close this gap [^9257f5c7] [^31eb0494] [^669ec289].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical algorithm to ensure nothing is missing. Stabilize and screen for peritonitis or ischemia; obtain CT with IV contrast if not emergent; initiate nonoperative management with NGT, fluids, and monitoring for up to 72 hours; use water-soluble contrast at 48–72 hours if not resolving to predict outcome; escalate to surgery for refractory cases, suspected ischemia, or clinical deterioration; choose laparoscopic versus open based on anatomy and expertise; and embed prevention, nutrition assessment, and follow-up planning into discharge [^1269fbf0] [^1269fbf0] [^fb8b0e19].

---

The management of small bowel obstruction (SBO) centers on **early recognition of strangulation** and **timely intervention** [^2278ad00]. Most patients without peritonitis or ischemia can be managed nonoperatively with nasogastric decompression, IV fluids, and close monitoring for 48–72 hours [^1269fbf0]; **water-soluble contrast** can both predict resolution and reduce the need for surgery [^fb8b0e19]. Surgery is indicated for peritonitis, suspected ischemia, or failure of nonoperative management, with laparoscopy favored in selected patients [^2278ad00]. Early CT with IV contrast is essential to guide management and detect complications [^949896a7]. Elderly or frail patients require individualized decisions and early surgical consultation due to higher risk of deterioration [^ea773694].

---

## Initial assessment and diagnosis

### Clinical evaluation

Clinical evaluation should assess for **classic features** — colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, distension, and obstipation — and identify **red flags** such as peritonitis, fever, tachycardia, continuous pain, or metabolic acidosis that suggest strangulation or ischemia [^1cf6cb5c].

---

### Imaging

- **Plain radiography**: Initial, but limited sensitivity/specificity; cannot exclude SBO or detect ischemia [^d354f535].
- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Gold standard; defines level, severity, cause, and detects ischemia/strangulation; recommended with IV contrast when stable [^949896a7] [^ee340ab9].
- **Ultrasound**: Useful adjunct, especially when CT is contraindicated or unavailable [^d354f535].

---

## Nonoperative management

Nonoperative management is appropriate for **partial SBO** or **complete SBO without peritonitis or ischemia** [^535e90e9].

---

### Core elements

- **Nasogastric decompression**: Reduces distension, vomiting, and aspiration risk [^1cf6cb5c].
- **Intravenous fluids**: Correct dehydration and electrolyte disturbances [^1269fbf0].
- **Monitoring**: Frequent reassessment for clinical deterioration or resolution [^51d57739].

---

### Role of water-soluble contrast

Water-soluble contrast (e.g. Gastrografin) is both **diagnostic and therapeutic**; passage into the colon within 24 hours predicts resolution and reduces the need for surgery and length of stay [^fb8b0b19] [^7105c3cc].

---

### Duration and indications for escalation

A trial of 48–72 hours is reasonable; persistent obstruction or deterioration warrants **surgical consultation** [^cb8b5a82] [^b7c6e94e].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgery is indicated for:

| **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Generalized peritonitis or suspected strangulation/ischemia | Immediate exploration to prevent bowel loss and mortality [^4dd4bf33] [^2278ad00] |
| Failure of nonoperative management after 48–72 hours | Persistent obstruction increases risk of complications [^cb8b5a82] [^b7c6e94e] |
| Virgin abdomen or nonadhesive etiologies (e.g. hernia, malignancy) | Likely require definitive surgical correction [^notfound] |

---

## Surgical approach

- **Laparotomy**: Standard for unstable patients, extensive adhesions, or suspected strangulation [^fb8b0b19].
- **Laparoscopy**: Feasible in selected patients with single-band adhesions, minimal distension, and stable hemodynamics; lower morbidity and faster recovery [^6fc67a7a] [^ca38a651].
- **Adhesiolysis**: Primary goal; bowel resection if ischemic/necrotic segments are present [^fb8b0b19].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Elderly/frail patients**: Higher risk of complications; lower threshold for early surgery and geriatric co-management [^ea773694] [^83280de9].
- **Virgin abdomen**: Adhesions still common; nonoperative management may be attempted if stable, but surgical exploration is often needed [^12487729] [^730a88be].
- **Pregnancy**: Ultrasound first-line; MRI if needed; conservative management preferred unless ischemia is suspected [^notfound].

---

## Postoperative care and recurrence prevention

Postoperative care emphasizes **early mobilization**, **gradual diet advancement**, and **electrolyte monitoring**. Recurrence prevention includes **minimally invasive techniques**, **adhesion barriers**, and **patient education** [^cf5fabb6] [^e228d1cc].

---

## Summary algorithm

- **Initial assessment**: History, exam, labs, plain radiography.
- **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast**: If stable and diagnosis uncertain or complications suspected [^949896a7].
- **Nonoperative management**: NG decompression, IV fluids, close monitoring for 48–72 hours [^535e90e9].
- **Water-soluble contrast**: Consider at 48–72 hours if no resolution [^fb8b0b19].
- **Surgical intervention**: For peritonitis, ischemia, or failure of nonoperative management [^4dd4bf33].
- **Postoperative care**: Mobilization, diet, electrolyte monitoring, recurrence prevention [^notfound].

---

Effective SBO management balances **nonoperative care** with **early surgery** when indicated, guided by CT and clinical judgment. Adherence to guidelines and individualized care — especially in high-risk groups — improves outcomes and reduces recurrence [^9257f5c7].

Methods

- Consensus Development

In the Consensus Conference on July 2 nd 2010, the expert panel had two meetings and a further plenary session. The aim was to focus and clarify the diagnostic and therapeutic issues of the complex management of ASBO, leading to new clinical guidelines, updated and including a wide range of recommendations, for diagnosis, non operative management, timing for surgery, type of surgery and prevention strategies of peritoneal post-operative adhesions causing small bowel obstruction. Based on the review of the current literature, a panel of worldwide experts were invited to participate in the development of the new guidelines. All members of the expert panel were asked to define ASBO. For each step of diagnosis, treatment (conservative and surgical) and prevention of ASBO, one expert summarized the current state of the art. From the evidence based presentations and the reported statements as well as from the results of the relevant literature review, a preliminary document with the resume of the Consensus Statements and Recommendations was compiled. For every key statement, the discussion within the expert panel with the involvement of the audience, took place until a 100% consensus within the group and the audience was achieved. Comments from the audience were collected and partly included in the manuscript. In September 2010 the expert panel had further contacts for discussing and finalize the final version of the text of the guidelines recommendations. The final version of the guidelines was approved by all experts in the panel as well as the experts from the audience who played an active role in the discussion during the Consensus Conference. Each "chapter" consists of a key statement with a grade of recommendation (GoR) followed by a commentary to explain the rationale and evidence behind the statement.

- Literature Searches and Appraisal

We have used the Oxford hierarchy for grading clinical studies according to levels of evidence. Literature searches were aimed at finding randomized (i.e. level 1b evidence) or nonrandomized controlled clinical trials (i.e. level 2b evidence). Alternatively, low-level evidence (mainly case series and case reports; i.e. level 4 evidence) was reviewed. Studies containing severe methodological flaws were downgraded. For each intervention, we considered the validity and homogeneity of study results, effect sizes, safety, and economic consequences.

Systematic literature searches were conducted on Medline and the Cochrane Library until December 2010. There were no restrictions regarding the language of publication. We also paid attention to studies that were referenced in systematic reviews or previous guidelines.

### Small bowel obstruction in the elderly: a plea for comprehensive acute geriatric care [^ea773694]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

There is few evidence regarding diagnosis and treatment of the elderly patient with small bowel obstruction. The scarce literature available demonstrates that elderly patients have an increased risk for complications and mortality and might benefit from earlier surgical intervention. It is important to take patients' preferences into account starting treatment in general and offering surgery specifically, because an operation may significantly affect quality of life. An assessment of frailty and a comprehensive geriatric approach to the elderly with small bowel obstruction with multidisciplinary specialist care is required from the start and preferably in the ED. More research on management of small bowel obstruction in elderly patients is urgently needed considering the rise in this age group (Table 1).

Table 1
Overview of known and unknown facts concerning small bowel obstruction in elderly patients

We conclude that management of small bowel obstruction requires more than just a 'copy and paste' of treatment recommendations and guidelines based on studies in younger adults. Based on current knowledge about frail elderly and small bowel obstruction, a flowchart has been developed that offers an approach to diagnosis and treatment of elderly patients with a small bowel obstruction (Fig. 2).

### Small bowel obstruction: what to look for… [^305083a9]. Radiographics (2009). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common clinical syndrome for which effective treatment depends on a rapid and accurate diagnosis. Despite advances in imaging and a better understanding of small bowel pathophysiology, SBO is often diagnosed late or misdiagnosed, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. A comprehensive approach that includes clinical findings, patient history, and triage examinations such as plain abdominal radiography will help the clinician develop an individualized treatment plan. When an SBO is accompanied by signs of strangulation, emergent surgical treatment is advised. If surgery cannot be performed immediately or if a partial obstruction is suspected, then a more detailed radiologic work-up is needed. The imaging techniques used subsequently vary according to the initial findings. If a low-grade partial obstruction is suspected, volume-challenge enteral examinations such as enteroclysis and computed tomographic (CT) enteroclysis are preferred. If a complete or high-grade obstruction is suspected, cross-sectional studies such as ultrasonography or multidetector CT are used to exclude strangulation. An algorithmic approach to imaging is proposed for the management of SBO to achieve accurate diagnosis of the obstruction; determine its severity, site, and cause; and assess the presence of strangulation. Radiologists have a pivotal role in clinical decision making in cases of SBO by providing answers to specific questions that significantly affect management.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® suspected small-bowel obstruction [^ee340ab9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Small-bowel obstruction is a common cause of abdominal pain and accounts for a significant proportion of hospital admissions. Radiologic imaging plays the key role in the diagnosis and management of small-bowel obstruction as neither patient presentation, the clinical examination, nor laboratory testing are sufficiently sensitive or specific enough to diagnose or guide management. This document focuses on the imaging evaluation of the two most commonly encountered clinical scenarios related to small-bowel obstruction: the acute presentation and the more indolent, low-grade, or intermittent presentation. This document hopes to clarify the appropriate utilization of the many imaging procedures that are available and commonly employed in these clinical settings. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Evaluation of the management strategies for adhesive small-bowel obstruction [^717cdf39]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The management of adhesive small-bowel obstruction (aSBO) continues to have wide variation, with no one management strategy accepted as the optimal. The first objective was to evaluate the methods of management and the variations in the management of aSBO at our institution and evaluate the outcomes of those management strategies. The second objective was to compare our outcomes to those of a published study by which patients were managed using an institutional protocol for aSBO.

Methods

A retrospective review of 465 patient encounters with a diagnosis of small-bowel obstruction from January 2019 to December 2020 was done. Data regarding implementation of nasogastric decompression, oral contrast administration, operative intervention, time to operation, length of stay, readmission, and mortality were collected and analyzed. These data were compared to a published protocol with outcomes of hospital length of stay, time to operation, and mortality. For comparative purposes, patient encounters were separated into one of four groups based on the administration of oral contrast and surgical intervention.

Results

Among patients managed at our institution without protocol, 77% had nasogastric decompression, and 49% had oral contrast administration, with an average time to contrast of 34 hs. The operative rate was 23% at our institution without protocol compared to 56% at the institution with protocol. A decreased time to surgery was demonstrated in patients managed per institution protocol. Hospital length of stay was longer in three of four of the patient subgroups at the institution with protocol compared to our institution without protocol; however, a greater admission range was observed in patients managed without protocol. Overall mortality was less in patients managed without protocol at 1.3% compared to 2.9% in patients managed per protocol.

Conclusions

The implementation of clinical practice guidelines for aSBO could improve the uniformity of patient care, implement data-driven methods such as contrast administration, time to contrast administration, and decrease the length of time to operating room when patients are initially managed nonoperatively.

### Small bowel obstruction in the elderly: a plea for comprehensive acute geriatric care [^03cf0344]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction is one of the most frequent emergencies in general surgery, commonly affecting elderly patients. Morbidity and mortality from small bowel obstruction in elderly is high. Significant progress has been made in the diagnosis and management of bowel obstruction in recent years. But little is known whether this progress has benefitted outcomes in elderly patients, particularly those who are frail or have a malignancy as cause of the obstruction, and when considering quality of life and functioning as outcomes. In this review, we discuss the specific challenges and needs of elderly in diagnosis and treatment of small bowel obstruction. We address quality of life aspects and explore how the concept of geriatric assessment can be utilized to improve decision-making and outcomes for elderly patients with a small bowel obstruction.

### Small-bowel obstruction: state-of-the-art imaging and its role in clinical management [^2a151c21]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Small-bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common clinical condition with signs and symptoms similar to other acute abdominal disorders. The radiologic investigation of patients with SBO as well as the indications and timing of surgical intervention have changed over the past 2 decades. This review focuses on modern imaging techniques and their role in both the diagnosis and treatment of patients with SBO.

### Small bowel obstruction outcomes according to compliance with the World Society of Emergency Surgery bologna guidelines [^45accc30]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common cause of surgical admission and is associated with significant morbidity, healthcare cost, and resource utilization. Adhesions are the most common aetiology in high-income settings, whereas malignancy and hernia are more globally represented. Despite diagnostic, therapeutic, and technical advances, patients continue to face delayed symptom resolution, high complication rates, and frequent recurrence of obstruction.

Evidence-informed expert consensus guidelines aim to reduce practice variability, enhance treatment effectiveness, and improve clinical and patient-reported outcomes. The World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) Bologna guidelines offer recommendations encompassing diagnosis, non-operative management (NOM), surgery, and postoperative care for patients with adhesive SBO. See Table 1.

Table 1
Summary of key recommendations from the WSES Bologna guidelines (2017 update) for the management of adhesive SBO

Resource limitations, regional healthcare delivery differences, and competing clinical priorities may hinder guideline adoption. While deviations from guideline-based care may contribute to population-level outcome disparities, the causes and effects of non-compliance for an individual patient remain poorly characterized. Furthermore, evaluating concordance with guideline-informed care helps shape future guideline development to detail new knowledge, highlight evidence-to-practice gaps, identify implementation barriers, and refine deployment strategies that improve adoption and utilization.

Prospective, multicentre, time-bound observational studies, termed snapshot audits, are well suited to assess guideline adherence in heterogeneous real-world environments, identifying specific evidence-to-practice gaps and barriers to implementation. This study, SnapSBO, examines whether and how full or partial guideline compliance influences patient outcomes, including complications and hospital length of stay (LOS).

### Can small bowel obstruction during pregnancy be treated with conservative management? A review [^6fb0e40e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Small bowel obstruction can occur during pregnancy, which, if missed, can lead to dire consequences for both the mother and foetus. Management of this condition usually requires surgical intervention. However, only a small number of patients are treated conservatively.

Objective

The objective was to review the literature to determine the feasibility of conservative management for small bowel obstruction.

Methods

A systematic search of the PubMed and Embase databases was performed using the keywords [small bowel obstruction AND pregnancy]. All original articles were then reviewed and included in this review if deemed suitable.

Conclusion

Conservative management of small bowel obstruction in pregnant women is feasible if the patient is clinically stable and after ruling out bowel ischaemia and closed-loop obstruction.

### Evaluation and management of small-bowel obstruction: an Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma practice management guideline [^2278ad00]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Small-bowel obstruction (SBO) represents as many as 16% of surgical admissions and more than 300,000 operations annually in the United States. The optimal strategies for the diagnosis and management of SBO continue to evolve secondary to advances in imaging techniques, critical care, and surgical techniques. This updated systematic literature review was developed by the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma to provide up-to-date evidence-based recommendations for SBO.

Methods

A search of the National Library of Medicine MEDLINE database was performed using PubMed interface for articles published from 2007 to 2011.

Results

The search identified 53 new articles that were then combined with the 131 studies previously reviewed by the 2007 guidelines. The updated guidelines were then presented at the 2012 annual EAST meeting.

Conclusion

Level I evidence now exists to recommend the use of computed tomographic scan, especially multidetector computed tomography with multiplanar reconstructions, in the evaluation of patients with SBO because it can provide incremental clinically relevant information over plains films that may lead to changes in management. Patients with evidence of generalized peritonitis, other evidence of clinical deterioration, such as fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, and continuous pain, or patients with evidence of ischemia on imaging should undergo timely exploration. The remainder of patients can safely undergo initial nonoperative management for both partial and complete SBO. Water-soluble contrast studies should be considered in patients who do not clinically resolve after 48 to 72 hours for both diagnostic and potential therapeutic purposes. Laparoscopic treatment of SBO has been demonstrated to be a viable alternative to laparotomy in selected cases.

### Surgical management of malignant bowel obstruction: strategies toward palliation of patients with advanced cancer [^cd10edf1]. Current Oncology Reports (2009). Low credibility.

The management of malignant bowel obstruction is a challenging problem because of the poor definition of malignant bowel obstruction compounded by its myriad clinical presentations. Surgeons are called upon to perform invasive procedures designed to alleviate symptoms or correct the underlying obstruction. Unfortunately, interventions may carry a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Balancing these risks and potential benefits is complicated, and there is a paucity of data to help guide these difficult decisions. The surgeon is further handicapped when he or she is not understanding of the patient's disease status, prognosis, or long-term goals. Diligent discussion with the primary team and frank discussions with the patient and his or her family are essential to formulate an appropriate plan. It is also essential that the surgeon have a thorough understanding of the surgical options to relieve or palliate malignant bowel obstruction as well as effective nonsurgical interventions. The best approach may be appropriate surgical intervention coupled with aggressive medical management.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2013 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^b7f34601]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Notes on the use of the guidelines

The Guidelines are evidence-based, with the grade of recommendation also based on the evidence. The Guidelines present the diagnostic and therapeutic methods for optimal management and prevention of ASBO.

The practice Guidelines promulgated in this work do not represent a standard of practice. They are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and the consensus of experts, but they do not exclude other approaches as being within the standard of practice. For example, they should not be used to compel adherence to a given method of medical management, which method should be finally determined after taking account of the conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. However, responsibility for the results of treatment rests with those who are directly engaged therein, and not with the consensus group.

Definition

Abdominal adhesions, which can begin forming within a few hours after an operation, represent the most common cause of intestinal obstruction being responsible for 60% to 70% of SBO. Adhesional postoperative small bowel obstruction is characterized by the presence of abdominal pain, vomiting, distention, and obstipation, in conjunction of confirmatory imaging.

### Emergency medicine evaluation and management of small bowel obstruction: evidence-based recommendations [^1cf6cb5c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a commonly diagnosed disease in the emergency department (ED). Recent literature has evaluated the ED investigation and management of SBO.

Objective

This review evaluates the ED investigation and management of adult SBO based on the current literature.

Discussion

SBO is most commonly due to occlusion of the small intestine, resulting in fluid and gas accumulation. This may progress to mucosal ischemia, necrosis, and perforation. A variety of etiologies are present, but in adults, adhesions are the most common cause. Several classification systems are present. However, the most important distinction is complete vs. partial and complicated vs. simple obstruction, as complete complicated SBO more commonly requires surgical intervention. History and physical examination can vary, but the most reliable findings include prior abdominal surgery, history of constipation, abdominal distension, and abnormal bowel sounds. Signs of strangulation include fever, hypotension, diffuse abdominal pain, peritonitis, and several others. Diagnosis typically requires imaging, and though plain radiographs are often ordered, they cannot exclude the diagnosis. Computed tomography and ultrasound are reliable diagnostic methods. Management includes intravenous fluid resuscitation, analgesia, and determining need for operative vs. nonoperative therapy. Nasogastric tube is useful for patients with significant distension and vomiting by removing contents proximal to the site of obstruction. Surgery is needed for strangulation and those that fail nonoperative therapy. Surgical service evaluation and admission are recommended.

Conclusion

SBO is a common reason for admission from the ED. Knowledge of recent literature can optimize diagnosis and management.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^e228d1cc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is a common surgical emergency, causing high morbidity and even some mortality. The adhesions causing such bowel obstructions are typically the footprints of previous abdominal surgical procedures. The present paper presents a revised version of the Bologna guidelines to evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of ASBO. The working group has added paragraphs on prevention of ASBO and special patient groups.

Methods

The guideline was written under the auspices of the World Society of Emergency Surgery by the ASBO working group. A systematic literature search was performed prior to the update of the guidelines to identify relevant new papers on epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ASBO. Literature was critically appraised according to an evidence-based guideline development method. Final recommendations were approved by the workgroup, taking into account the level of evidence of the conclusion.

Recommendations

Adhesion formation might be reduced by minimally invasive surgical techniques and the use of adhesion barriers. Non-operative treatment is effective in most patients with ASBO. Contraindications for non-operative treatment include peritonitis, strangulation, and ischemia. When the adhesive etiology of obstruction is unsure, or when contraindications for non-operative management might be present, CT is the diagnostic technique of choice. The principles of non-operative treatment are nil per os, naso-gastric, or long-tube decompression, and intravenous supplementation with fluids and electrolytes. When operative treatment is required, a laparoscopic approach may be beneficial for selected cases of simple ASBO. Younger patients have a higher lifetime risk for recurrent ASBO and might therefore benefit from application of adhesion barriers as both primary and secondary prevention.

Discussion

This guideline presents recommendations that can be used by surgeons who treat patients with ASBO. Scientific evidence for some aspects of ASBO management is scarce, in particular aspects relating to special patient groups. Results of a randomized trial of laparoscopic versus open surgery for ASBO are awaited.

Table 3
Thematic analysis of potential gaps in guideline adoption and proposed implementation strategies

System-level challenges, such as resource limitations and inconsistent multidisciplinary collaboration (when of benefit), further hinder guideline adherence. Resource limitations may necessitate deviation from or adaptation of clinical guidelines to embrace feasible alternatives, such as less resource-intensive diagnostics or therapies. It may be ideal to couple adaptations with telemedicine support from tertiary centres, to bridge resource gaps (including specialists) and create opportunities for collaboration around patient care. Additionally, promoting structured care pathways that integrate surgeons, radiologists, and intensivists into interdisciplinary teams can enhance decision-making consistency and quality, as well as improve adherence to evidence-informed practices. Collectively, addressing these barriers requires a tailored implementation strategy. Efforts to educate clinicians, inform and enable patients, and integrate standardized approaches into healthcare systems represent major areas for targeted interventions for healthcare systems that are not limited to the management of SBO. These approaches can be extrapolated to nearly every clinical condition requiring acute inpatient care.

### Small bowel obstruction in the elderly: a plea for comprehensive acute geriatric care [^83280de9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

It is questionable if elderly patients with small bowel obstruction benefit from the progress in the management in small bowel obstruction because of specific challenges and demands in diagnosis and treatment in this patient population. They represent a diverse group consisting of vital elderly patients who have enough resilience to cope with a 'second hit' like surgery compared to frail elderly patients with limited reserve capacity and high risk of complications even without surgery. Elderly patients often present with atypical clinical features, causing a delay in diagnosis and progressed disease at first presentation. Most elderly patients have reduced renal function increasing the risk of contrast nephropathy from contrast-enhanced CT. This risk is higher when fluid intake is diminished as in small bowel obstruction. The limited physiological reserves and frailty contribute to worse outcomes in the elderly patient in terms of functional decline, more complications and prolonged stay in hospital, regardless of treatment. High age and common co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus have been shown to be independent risk factors for mortality in small bowel obstruction. Little is known about the interference of starvation treatment with necessity to continue medication for chronic disease and pre-existing nutritional deficiencies, which all seem a challenge in managing elderly patients with small bowel obstruction.

Regarding goal settings, frail elderly patients judge quality of life to be more important than prolongation of life, which implies a more balanced decision-making from the start (at the emergency department) taking into account psychosocial aspects of life in addition to clinical aspects. Conceivably, a standard approach based on guidelines may not suffice for appropriate decision-making in diagnosis and treatment of the elderly with small bowel obstruction.

In this review, we will discuss the specific challenges and demands elderly patients have in diagnosis and treatment of small bowel obstruction and, if literature data are available, we compare these with younger patients. We will discuss quality of life aspects and explore how the concept of geriatric assessment can be utilized to improve decision-making and outcomes for elderly patients with small bowel obstruction. The results presented may contribute to the development of algorithms and guidelines for management of small bowel obstruction in elderly patients.

### Small bowel obstruction: a practical step-by-step evidence-based approach to evaluation, decision making, and management [^e1325bdf]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The initial goal of evaluating a patient with SBO is to immediately identify strangulation and need for urgent operative intervention, concurrent with rapid resuscitation. This relies on a combination of traditional clinical signs and CT findings. In patients without signs of strangulation, a protocol for administration of Gastrografin immediately in the emergency department efficiently sorts patients into those who will resolve their obstructions and those who will fail nonoperative management. Furthermore, because of the unique ability of Gastrografin to draw water into the bowel lumen, it expedites resolution of partial obstructions, shortening time to removal of nasogastric tube liberalization of diet, and discharge from the hospital. Implementation of such a protocol is a complex, multidisciplinary, and time-consuming endeavor. As such, we cannot over emphasize the importance of clear, open communication with everyone involved. If surgical management is warranted, we encourage an initial laparoscopic approach with open access. Even if this results in immediate conversion to laparotomy after assessment of the intra-abdominal status, we encourage this approach with a goal of 30% conversion rate or higher. This will attest that patients will have been given the highest likelihood of a successful laparoscopic LOA.

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: systematic review [^9cbe9bd1]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is common: It accounts for 20% of abdominal surgery in patients presenting with acute abdominal pain, and around one-quarter of SBO admissions culminate in surgery. In the developed world, adhesions remain the most common cause. The limitations of plain abdominal radiography are now appreciated widely, and a seminal 1991 paper transitioned diagnosis towards CT scanning, which determines both the cause and level of obstruction more accurately. With improved diagnosis by CT, the pivotal clinical question then becomes whether surgery is necessary or not? The old surgical maxim of, "Never let the sun set on a small bowel obstruction", has been replaced by a shift towards more conservative management, with around 75% of patients now avoiding an operation. Nevertheless, untreated obstruction can culminate in irreversible mural ischaemia and intestinal perforation, a surgical catastrophe with considerable morbidity and mortality. The dilemma familiar to every general surgeon is thus: Operate too soon and expose the patient to unnecessary surgical risk; too late, and the patient is in extremis.

It is surprising that SBO prognostication still adopts a "try it and see" approach, bolstered by surgical experience. Failed conservative treatment, signs of peritonism, and clinical concerns for ischaemia may precipitate surgery. While it is seemingly intuitive that a multivariable prognostic model incorporating clinical, laboratory, and imaging factors could predict surgical requirement, no models are used widely. While some authors have investigated radiological predictors of surgery, they have largely excluded clinical and laboratory predictors. However, it is highly unlikely that surgeons will adopt a model that ignores fundamental clinical factors. Accordingly, we performed a systematic review of clinical, laboratory, and imaging factors that might predict SBO resolution without the need for surgery. We then meta-analysed potential predictors to identify those most likely to contribute usefully to model development.

### Small bowel obstruction [^92a6fd68]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Identifying patients with small bowel obstruction who need operative intervention and those who will fail nonoperative management is a challenge. Without indications for urgent intervention, a computed tomography scan with/without intravenous contrast should be obtained to identify location, grade, and etiology of the obstruction. Most small bowel obstructions resolve with nonoperative management. Open and laparoscopic operative management are acceptable approaches. Malnutrition needs to be identified early and managed, especially if the patient is to undergo operative management. Confounding conditions include age greater than 65, post Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, virgin abdomen, pregnancy, hernia, and early postoperative state.

### Considerations in the management of malignant bowel obstruction [^eeedd92c]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Malignant bowel obstruction is a challenging clinical problem encountered in patients with advanced abdominal and pelvic malignancies. Although medical therapies form the foundation of management, some patients may be suitable candidates for surgical and procedural interventions. The literature is composed primarily of retrospective single-institution experiences and the results of prospective trials are pending. Given the high symptom burden and limited life expectancy of these patients, management may be best informed by multidisciplinary teams with relevant expertise.

Background

Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is one of the leading causes of surgical emergencies and in particular of surgical emergencies that require an emergent operations. In the UK, small bowel obstruction was the indication for 51% of all emergency laparotomies. Scott et al. reported on seven emergency surgical procedures that account for 80% of all general surgery emergency admissions, morbidity, deaths, and healthcare expenditures in the USA. Adhesive small bowel obstruction was the most common diagnosis for both the top 2 (small bowel resection) and top 5 (adhesiolysis) procedures. Post-operative adhesions are the leading cause of small bowel obstructions, accounting for 60% of cases.

ASBO causes considerable harm, resulting in 8 days of hospitalization on average and an in-hospital mortality rate of 3% per episode. Between 20 and 30% of patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction require operative treatment. Length of hospitalization and morbidity depend on the need for surgical intervention. Average hospitalization after surgical treatment of ASBO is 16 days, compared to 5 days following non-operative treatment. Associated costs in a Dutch study in 2016 were estimated at €16,305 for surgical and €2227 for non-operative treatment.

Although adhesive small bowel obstruction is a common condition, the prevention and treatment is often characterized by surgeons' personal preferences rather than standardized evidence-based protocols. There is a large amount of conflicting and low-quality evidence in publications regarding treatment of adhesive small bowel obstruction.

Therefore, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) working group on ASBO has developed evidence-based guidelines to support clinical decision making in diagnosis and management of ASBO. In the present revision of these guidelines, all recommendations were updated according to the latest evidence available from the medical literature. Further, we have introduced two new sections: prevention of ASBO and special patient groups.

### Small bowel obstruction in the elderly: a plea for comprehensive acute geriatric care [^c5a5ed06]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

This is a narrative review with scoping aspects. A formal systematic review and meta-analysis was not feasible due to paucity of studies addressing the relevant topics of small bowel obstruction in elderly patients mentioned above.

Search strategy

PubMed, the Cochrane database and EMBASE database were searched from inception to January 2018. The search strategy was verified by a senior medical librarian for completeness. PubMed studies were identified using Mesh terms 'intestinal obstruction', 'small intestine', 'ileum', 'jejunum' and 'aged' and free text 'small bowel obstruction', 'elderly', 'old', 'eldest' and 'geriatric'. A same search strategy was performed in Embase, after which duplicates were identified and deleted. Thereafter, the Cochrane database was searched for reviews concerning small bowel obstruction, resulting in three studies that focused on small bowel obstruction.

One hundred twenty studies from Embase and PubMed were eligible for full-text screening (Fig. 1). Thirteen studies were included for qualitative analysis, whereof two studies were specifically aimed at elderly patients. The Cochrane database search did not reveal a relevant paper. Main reasons for exclusion were as follows: studies did not include elderly patients and studies did not include small bowel obstruction. To ensure our review contained important geriatric themes/considerations that affect diagnosis and treatment of small bowel obstruction, we expanded our search after the systematic search by including more general studies on elderly patients.

Fig. 1
Flow chart of search in PubMed and Embase databases; 120 studies were selected and searched with elderly patients as focus. Exclusion criteria: not focused on older adults, case reports, laparotomy vs laparoscopy, non-English/Dutch/German studies and studies focusing on phytobezoars

This narrative review is divided in two sections; in the first more general section frailty and geriatric assessments are discussed, the second section encompasses the diagnosis and therapy for small bowel obstruction in elderly, decision-making and recommendations for practice or further research. For each section, we summarize and conclude the existing evidence in the literature on small bowel obstruction in the elderly followed by discussing the differences with small bowel obstruction management in the general population.

### Small bowel obstruction outcomes according to compliance with the World Society of Emergency Surgery bologna guidelines [^53d3b3be]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Adhesive SBO has a high recurrence rate and remains a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality that increases healthcare cost. Clinical guidelines are generally derived using two principal approaches: using evidence synthesized from prospective RCTs or using expert consensus groups that integrate physiology, existing data, and experience to craft recommendations. The WSES Bologna guidelines for adhesive SBO exemplify the latter, providing a pragmatic diagnostic and management framework. Bologna guideline adherence offers the potential to improve morbidity and mortality metrics, reduce healthcare resource utilization, and decrease recurrence of obstruction by promoting consistent and timely interventions. However, such opportunities rely on guideline adoption and utilization.

Other guidelines address patient-specific factors, rather than management approaches. Elderly patients with multi-morbidity, with or without frailty, benefit from individualized risk stratification and goals-of-care determinations that may direct early intervention, NOM, or comfort care. Of note, geriatric patient outcomes are not often comprehensively assessed, leaving occurrence rates uncertain. Despite care advances, gaps remain in ensuring goal-concordant care for elderly patients across the panoply of interventions for adhesive SBO. Evidence-informed — as opposed to evidence-based — recommendations, in concert with knowledge and process gaps, underscore the complexity of managing patients with adhesive SBO; surgeons must balance recommendations against individualized and patient-centred care.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^84754691]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

The guideline was written under the auspices of the WSES by the ASBO working group. Systematic searches of the MEDLINE and Embase databases were carried out in October 2016 using the keywords relevant to each section. Terms relevant to each section of the guideline were mapped to MEDLINE Medical Subjects Headings (MeSH) terms, as well as searched for as text items. Articles describing randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews were searched for using the methodological filters of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. The bibliographies of included articles were subsequently hand-searched for other relevant references, and experts in the field were asked if they found any relevant reports missing.

Critical appraisal

Articles selected to support recommendations were assessed using the levels of evidence as published by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford (Table 1). Articles were classified according to the type of article and individually assessed for methodological quality using the GRADE method as proposed by the GRADE working group. That working group has developed a common, sensible, and transparent approach to grading the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. The main literature on which the conclusion for each relevant topic is based is stated with the conclusion, accompanied by the level of evidence (Table 2).

Table 1
Classification of evidence per article

Table 2
Grading of the conclusions and recommendations according to the level of evidence and strength of recommendation

Conclusion and recommendations are graded according to the level of evidence from strong ("there is strong evidence for", level A) to weak ("we cannot be confident", level D). Recommendations were graded as strong recommendations (level I) or weak recommendation or suggestions (level II). Recommendations were considered strong recommendations if there is sufficient evidence (level A or B) demonstrating that the benefits of an intervention are of clinical importance and clearly outweigh the harm of the intervention. A concept guideline was sent to all involved for comment and approval after which internal consensus was reached between the members of the working group. Amendments were made based upon these comments, leading to the final version of this updated guideline.

### Small bowel obstruction: the role of computed tomography in its diagnosis and management with reference to other imaging modalities [^e944bfc5]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction is a leading cause of acute surgical admissions for abdominal pain. There is an increasing tendency for initial conservative management rather than immediate operative intervention, as a proportion of cases will resolve spontaneously. This has resulted in a growing reliance on radiological investigations to reassure the surgeon that medical therapy can be safely instituted. The onus therefore rests with radiologists to guide their surgical colleagues by correctly interpreting the plain abdominal radiograph and suggesting appropriate further investigation if warranted. Recently, computed tomography (CT) has been proposed as the test of choice to define the level and cause of acute small bowel obstruction and to identify complications such as ischaemia and perforation which will prompt surgical intervention. This review will discuss the utility of early CT in the diagnosis of acute small bowel obstruction and outline its impact on patient management.

### Current management of small bowel obstruction in the UK: results from the national audit of small bowel obstruction clinical practice survey [^b97b7cef]. Colorectal Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. The National Audit of Small Bowel Obstruction (NASBO) is a collaboration between trainees and specialty associations to improve the care of patients with SBO through national clinical audit. The aim of this study was to define current consultant practice preferences in the management of SBO in the UK.

Method

A survey was designed to assess practice preferences of consultant surgeons. The anonymous survey captured demographics, indications for surgery or conservative management, use of investigations including water-soluble contrast agents (WSCA), use of laparoscopy and nutritional support strategies. The questionnaire underwent two pilot rounds prior to dissemination via the NASBO network.

Results

A total of 384 responses were received from 131 NASBO participating units (overall response rate 29.2%). Abdominal CT and serum urea and electrolytes were considered essential initial investigations by more than 80% of consultants. Consensus was demonstrated on indications for early surgery and conservative management. Three hundred and thirty-eight (88%) respondents would consider use of WSCA; of these, 328 (97.1%) would use it in adhesive SBO. Two hundred (52.1%) consultants considered a laparoscopic approach when operating for SBO. Oral nutritional supplements were favoured in operatively managed patients by 259 (67.4%) respondents compared with conservatively managed patients (186 respondents, 48.4%).

Conclusion

This survey demonstrates consensus on imaging requirements and indications for early surgery in the management of SBO. Significant variation exists around awareness of the need for nutritional support in patients with SBO, and on strategies to achieve this support.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2010 evidence-based guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^938bd6ad]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background of Bologna Guidelines

Adhesive small bowel obstruction require appropriate management with a proper diagnostic and therapeutic pathway. Indication and length of Non Operative treatment and appropriate timing for surgery may represent an insidious issue.

Delay in surgical treatment may cause a substantial increase of morbidity and mortality. However repeated laparotomy and adhesiolysis may worsen the process of adhesion formation and their severity. Furthermore the introduction and widespread of laparoscopy has raised the question of selection of appropriate patients with ASBO good candidate for laparoscopic approach. On the other hand, several adjuncts for improving the success rate of NOM and clarifying indications and timing for surgery are currently available, such as hyperosmolar water soluble contrast medium.

No consensus has been reached in diagnosing and managing the patients with ASBO and specific and updated guidelines are lacking.

We carried out an extensive review of the English-language literature and found that there was little high-level evidence in this field, and no systematically described practical manual for the field. Most importantly, there are no standardized diagnostic criteria and therapeutic management guidelines for ASBO, therefore, we would like to establish standards for these items. The Bologna Guidelines include evidence-based medicine and reflect the international consensus obtained through earnest discussions among professionals in the field on 1–3 July, 2010, at the Belmeloro Convention Center, Bologna, Italy.

Notes on the use of the Guidelines

The Guidelines are evidence-based, with the grade of recommendation also based on the evidence. The Guidelines present the diagnostic and therapeutic methods for optimal management and prevention of ASBO.

The practice Guidelines promulgated in this work do not represent a standard of practice. They are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and the consensus of experts, but they do not exclude other approaches as being within the standard of practice. For example, they should not be used to compel adherence to a given method of medical management, which method should be finally determined after taking account of the conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. However, responsibility for the results of treatment rests with those who are directly engaged therein, and not with the consensus group.

### Non-operative management of small bowel obstruction in patients with No previous abdominal surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^cda79973]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

While the contemporary management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (SBO) often includes a trial of non-operative management (NOM), surgical dogma dictates urgent operative exploration in patients without previous abdominal surgery. This dogma has been challenged by recent evidence suggesting most obstructions in this population are adhesive in nature. The objectives of this review were to evaluate the feasibility of NOM in patients with SBO and no history of previous abdominal surgery, to examine the etiologies of SBO in this population, and to explore the rate of adverse events seen following NOM. Embase, Medline, Cochrane, and Google Scholar were searched from inception to September 24, 2019. Articles reporting on NOM for SBO in patients without previous abdominal surgery and without clinical or radiographic features necessitating an emergent operation were included. Data were combined to obtain a pooled proportion of patients discharged without operation following a trial of NOM. 6 studies reporting on a total of 272 patients were included. The pooled proportion of patients discharged following NOM was 49.5% (95% CI 23.7–75.3%). Adhesions were found to be the predominant cause of obstruction. NOM did not appear to increase short-term complications. Most SBOs in patients without previous abdominal surgery are adhesive in nature and many patients can be discharged from hospital without surgery. While the short-term outcomes of NOM are acceptable, future studies are needed to address the long-term outcomes and safety of NOM as a treatment strategy for SBO in patients without previous abdominal surgery.

Background of WSES guidelines

Adhesive small bowel obstruction requires appropriate management with a proper diagnostic and therapeutic pathway. Indication and length of Non Operative treatment and appropriate timing for surgery may represent an insidious issue.

Delay in surgical treatment may cause a substantial increase of morbidity and mortality. However repeated laparotomy and adhesiolysis may worsen the process of adhesion formation and their severity.

The Bologna Guidelines include evidence-based medicine and reflect the international consensus obtained through earnest discussions among professionals in the field on 1–3 July, 2010, at the Belmeloro Convention Center, Bologna, Italy.

We aimed to validate and refine the first version of the guidelines, hypothesizing that a model, incorporated in a treatment algorithm, would be predictive, would prevent delayed management of strangulation and would be successfully improved.

Therefore in 2013 the guidelines have been revised and updated by the WSES Working Group on ASBO with the development of diagnosis and treatment evidence-based algorithms (Figure 1, Figure 2).

Figure 1

Furthermore a customary management can help to standardize care throughout a district, a region, or a state satisfying the corporate governance requirements of "clinical efficacy" and "economic efficiency" with the results of improved outcomes and decreased costs.

Improvement of performance is a mainstay of any practice management guideline.

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: systematic review [^e38629ca]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Management of SBO remains problematic. A 2018 review stated that "there has been no reliable clinical method for predicting failure of nonoperative management for adhesive SBO". Accordingly, the primary aim of our review was to identify both imaging and non-imaging factors that should be investigated for the development and evaluation of a multi-variable model predicting treatment strategy for small bowel obstruction. Ideally, such a model would identify those patients unlikely to respond to conservative management and therefore at high risk of ischaemia. At the same time, an accurate model could identify those patients destined to resolve conservatively, and thus avoid surgery. Unfortunately, the large majority of existing literature that investigates predictors of surgery and/or ischaemia is single-centre, and therefore potentially suffers from spectrum bias and/or insufficient power. A single-centre study by Scrima and colleagues sensibly included both imaging and non-imaging factors, but their model was not evaluated. Zielinski and co-workers developed a model based predominantly on CT scanning, finding vomiting, free intraperitoneal fluid, mesenteric oedema, and absent "small bowel faeces" sign, predictive of surgery. The authors then evaluated the model prospectively, adding more predictors and removing predictors initially found significant during development. The American Association for Surgery of Trauma has advocated an "anatomic severity schema" for small bowel obstruction that was validated subsequently in 351 patients.

### Bowel obstruction: a narrative review for all physicians [^8c1ed35a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Bowel obstruction is the most likely diagnosis in the patient described in the vignette. High white blood cells and peritonism could suggest adhesive small bowel obstruction with possible ischemia. A computed tomography scan with intravenous contrast must be performed as soon as possible. If computed tomography scan confirms adhesive small bowel obstruction with ischemia or perforation, then the patient must go to surgery as soon as possible: a laparoscopic approach should be attempted.

If computed tomography shows adhesive small bowel obstruction without ischemia or perforation, then a conservative treatment should be initiated: nasogastric suction and fluid replacement therapy have to be performed with a scrupulous wait-and-see strategy. After gastric contents are cleared, a water-soluble contrast administration challenge should be performed. The patient has to be monitored with regard to ischemia (peritonism, white blood cells, lactate). Surgery has to be performed immediately in the case of clinical deterioration — preferably beginning with a laparoscopic technique.

After 24 h, a plain abdominal X-ray should be performed to determine if oral contrast reached the large bowel: if positive, then oral nutrition can be started. If negative, non-operative management could be continued for another 48 h: surgery should be performed after this limit — preferably starting with a laparoscopic approach.

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: systematic review [^d7a320d4]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In summary, a systematic review and meta-analysis of imaging, clinical, and laboratory variables of patients with small bowel obstruction identified 6 potential predictors associated strongly with the need for surgery (5 positively and 1 negatively; 3 were derived from CT), and 3 associated strongly with ischaemia at surgery (all positively; 2 were derived from CT). The development of future multivariable models to guide the management of small bowel obstruction should concentrate on variables that appear to display strong evidence of potential utility. Factors that have not been investigated sufficiently well in the primary literature but which enjoy considerable clinical support should also be considered.

### Active treatment for partial small bowel obstruction… [^f6f9097c]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: Does oral therapy with magnesium oxide, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and simethicone improve outcomes in patients with partial small bowel obstruction. Setting: Inpatient Study Design: Randomized controlled trial Allocation: Concealed. Synopsis: Partial small bowel obstruction is a relatively common long-term complication of intra-abdominal and pelvic surgery, with up to one third of patients requiring surgical decompression. In this study, the researchers identified 128 Taiwanese adults with a history of abdominal surgery more than four weeks before the study began, symptoms consistent with partial small bowel obstruction, and a confirmatory radiograph showing air-fluid levels in the small bowel but only air in the large bowel. Allocation was concealed, and an attempt was made to blind the attending surgeon who made the decisions about treatment and length of stay.

Groups were balanced at the start of the study, and no patients were lost to follow-up. All patients received intravenous hydration and nasogastric tube decompression. Those in the control group received nothing by mouth, whereas those in the treatment group received water and 500 mg magnesium oxide, 0. 3 g of L. acidophilus, and 40 mg simethicone three times daily followed by clamping of the tube for one hour. Patients in the active treatment group were less likely to require surgery and had a shorter length of stay. There was no difference between groups in the likelihood of serious complications or recurrence within six months. The main limitations of the study were the failure to blind patients and caregivers and the difficulty in blinding the attending surgeon. Bottom Line: The combination of magnesium oxide, L.

acidophilus, and simethicone appears to reduce length of stay and the need for surgery in patients with partial small bowel obstruction, although this study was limited by a failure to completely blind patients and their caregivers.

### Clinical features vs CT findings to estimate need for surgery in small bowel obstruction [^772903ae]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 20% to 30% of patients hospitalized with small bowel obstruction (SBO) fail nonoperative treatment. Rapidly identifying patients requiring urgent surgical intervention is critical. Currently, computed tomography (CT) is the criterion standard for diagnosing SBO management. However, practice variation exists due to a lack of definitive operative radiographic findings for SBO. We compared the ability of clinical features alone with that of clinical features combined with CT findings to estimate the need for surgical SBO management.

### Diagnosis and management of small bowel obstruction in virgin abdomen: a WSES position paper [^12487729]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency, causing high morbidity and healthcare costs. The majority of SBOs are caused by adhesions that result from previous surgeries. Bowel obstruction, however, also occurs in patients without previous operation or known pathology, a so called virgin abdomen. It is unknown if small bowel obstruction in the virgin abdomen (SBO-VA) can be managed according to the same principles as other cases of small bowel obstruction. The aim of this position paper is to evaluate the available evidence on etiology and management of small bowel obstruction in the virgin abdomen.

Methods

This is a narrative review with scoping aspects. Clinical topics covered in this review include epidemiology and etiology of SBO-VA, diagnosis and imaging, initial assessment, the role of surgical management in SBO-VA, and the role of non-operative management in SBO-VA.

Results

Our scoping search revealed seven original studies reporting original patient data related to SBO-VA. All the included studies are retrospective cohorts, with populations ranging between 44 and 103 patients with SBO-VA. Adhesions were found to be the cause of the obstruction in approximately half of the reported cases of SBO-VA. A relatively high number of cases of SBO-VA were managed surgically with studies reporting 39–83%. However, in cases where a trial of non-operative management was started, this was generally successful.

Conclusion

The data available suggest that etiology and treatment results for patients with SBO-VA are largely comparable to the results in patients with SBO after previous abdominal surgery. We therefore propose that patients with a virgin abdomen could be treated according to existing guidelines for SBO and adhesive small bowel obstruction.

Operative treatment

Historically, abdominal exploration through laparotomy has been the standard treatment for adhesive small bowel obstruction. In recent years, however, laparoscopic surgery for ASBO has been introduced. The potential benefits of laparoscopy include less extensive adhesion (re)formation, earlier return of bowel movements, reduced post-operative pain, and shorter length of stay. In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 non-randomized studies, laparoscopic adhesiolysis reduced risk of morbidity, in-hospital mortality, and surgical infections. However, there also seems strong selection bias in these series allocating mainly the less severe cases to laparoscopy. In a questionnaire among surgeons, 60% of the respondents reported to have performed laparoscopic adhesiolysis for ASBO in their practice, but half of them in less than 15% of cases.

Although laparoscopy might provide some benefits to some patients for ASBO, surgeons should carefully select candidates for laparoscopic treatment. Laparoscopy in an abdomen with very distended loops of bowel and multiple complex adhesions could increase the risk of severe complications such as enterotomies and delayed diagnosis of perforations. Indeed, some authors have reported bowel injury in 6.3 to 26.9% of patients treated with laparoscopic adhesiolysis for ASBO. In a recent population-based study, bowel resections were significantly more frequent in laparoscopic surgery. Incidence of bowel resection was 53.5 versus 43.4% in laparoscopic versus open procedures. Farinella et al. reported that predictors for a successful laparoscopic treatment of ASBO are the following: ≤ 2 laparotomies in history, appendectomy as the operation in history, no previous median laparotomy incision, and a single adhesive band. Laparoscopic adhesiolysis also seems more difficult in patients who have previously been treated by radiotherapy.

More compelling evidence on the role of laparoscopy in surgery for ASBO is from an ongoing randomized trial and is still awaited. In this trial, strict inclusion and exclusion criteria have been used to select candidates in whom simple single band adhesions are expected.

Operative management: summary

Laparoscopic surgery has been introduced in recent years and might decrease morbidity in subgroups of patients undergoing surgery for ASBO. The risk of bowel injuries seems higher in laparoscopic surgery for ASBO. Therefore, careful selection of patients for laparoscopic surgery is required. Further recommendations are found in Table 5.

### Adult small bowel obstruction [^d354f535]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a clinical condition that is often initially diagnosed and managed in the emergency department (ED). The high rates of potential complications that are associated with an SBO make it essential for the emergency physician (EP) to make a timely and accurate diagnosis.

Objectives

The primary objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the history, physical examination, and imaging modalities associated with the diagnosis of SBO. The secondary objectives were to identify the prevalence of SBO in prospective ED-based studies of adult abdominal pain and to apply Pauker and Kassirer's threshold approach to clinical decision-making to the diagnosis and management of SBO.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, major emergency medicine (EM) textbooks, and the bibliographies of selected articles were scanned for studies that assessed one or more components of the history, physical examination, or diagnostic imaging modalities used for the diagnosis of SBO. The selected articles underwent a quality assessment by two of the authors using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Data used to compile sensitivities and specificities were obtained from these studies and a meta-analysis was performed on those that examined the same historical component, physical examination technique, or diagnostic test. Separate information on the prevalence and management of SBO was used in conjunction with the meta-analysis findings of computed tomography (CT) to determine the test and treatment threshold.

Results

The prevalence of SBO in the ED was determined to be approximately 2% of all patients who present with abdominal pain. Having a previous history of abdominal surgery, constipation, abnormal bowel sounds, and/or abdominal distention on examination were the best history and physical examination predictors of SBO. X-ray was determined to be the least useful imaging modality for the diagnosis of SBO, with a pooled positive likelihood ratio (+LR) of 1.64 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07 to 2.52). On the other hand, CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were both quite accurate in diagnosing SBO with +LRs of 3.6 (5- to 10-mm slices, 95% CI = 2.3 to 5.4) and 6.77 (95% CI = 2.13 to 21.55), respectively. Although limited to only a select number of studies, the use of ultrasound (US) was determined to be superior to all other imaging modalities, with a +LR of 14.1 (95% CI = 3.57 to 55.66) and a negative likelihood ratio (-LR) of 0.13 (95% CI = 0.08 to 0.20) for formal scans and a +LR of 9.55 (95% CI = 2.16 to 42.21) and a -LR of 0.04 (95% CI = 0.01 to 0.13) for beside scans. Using the CT results of the meta-analysis for the 5- to 10-mm slice subgroup as well as information on intravenous (IV) contrast reactions and nasogastric (NG) intubation management, the pretest probability threshold for further testing was determined to be 1.5%, and the pretest probability threshold for beginning treatment was determined to be 20.7%.

Conclusions

The potentially useful aspects of the history and physical examination were limited to a history of abdominal surgery, constipation, and the clinical examination findings of abnormal bowel sounds and abdominal distention. CT, MRI, and US are all adequate imaging modalities to make the diagnosis of SBO. Bedside US, which can be performed by EPs, had very good diagnostic accuracy and has the potential to play a larger role in the ED diagnosis of SBO. More ED-focused research into this area will be necessary to bring about this change.

Non-operative management

The cornerstone of non-operative management is nil per os and decompression using a naso-gastric tube or long intestinal tube. Non-operative management is effective in approximately 70–90% of patients with ASBO. There has been some debate in the literature over the use of long intestinal tubes or naso-gastric tubes. In an older trial, no significant difference in failure rates was found between naso-gastric tubes and long intestinal tubes. In a more recent trial, 186 patients were randomized between a newly designed trilumen long tube and a naso-gastric tube. Long tubes seemed more effective in this trial with a failure rate of 10.4% in this group compared with 53.3% in the naso-gastric tube group. Results from this trial should be interpreted with care, because the failure rate of naso-gastric tube compression is much higher than would be expected from other literature. Moreover, a drawback of trilumen tubes is the need for endoscopic placement. Non-operative management should further include fluid resuscitation, correction of electrolyte disturbances, nutritional support, and prevention of aspiration.

Duration of the period in which non-operative management can be tried is subject to debate. Several retrospective series and databases have shown that delays in surgery increase morbidity and mortality. Evidence for the optimal duration of non-operative treatment is absent, but most authors and the panel consider a 72-h period as safe and appropriate. Continuing non-operative treatment for more than 72 h in cases with persistent high output from a decompression tube, but no other signs of clinical deterioration, however, remains subject to debate. Common medical complications in patients with small bowel obstruction are dehydration with kidney injury, electrolyte disturbances, malnutrition, and aspiration.

Non-operative management: summary

The panel recommends a trial of non-operative management in all patients with ASBO, unless there are signs of peritonitis, strangulation, or bowel ischemia. Evidence for the optimal duration of non-operative is absent, but most authors and the panel consider a 72-h period as safe and appropriate. Further recommendations are found in Table 5.

### Optimal management of malignant left-sided large bowel obstruction: do international guidelines agree? [^74f4d86b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

International guidelines offer limited and contrasting recommendations on the management of left-sided MBO. There is a lack of high-quality evidence to support whether emergency surgery or stenting as a bridge to surgery is the best procedure with regards to morbidity, mortality and long-term oncological outcomes. Comparison of the guidelines is difficult as they are based on differing levels of evidence and a number require updating to consider the results of more recent randomised controlled trials. Furthermore, a number of guidelines fail to provide a formal evaluation of the evidence at all. This review provides a snapshot of current guidelines, and until high-quality research is available, the optimal management of this emergency surgical condition will continue to be debated.

### Homocysteine (HCY), a novel biomarker for predicting irreversible transmural intestinal necrosis in patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction: results from a prospective observational study [^7871ab43]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is one of the leading causes of surgical emergencies, particularly those necessitating emergent operations. Notably, post-operative adhesions are identified as the primary cause of small bowel obstruction, accounting for 60% of cases.

Despite its high clinical prevalence, the management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) remains primarily driven by surgeons' empirical judgment rather than standardized evidence-driven frameworks, highlighting the persistent gap in unified clinical guidelines. According to the two leading surgical guidelines — the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) recommendations and the Bologna guidelines — the management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) has evolved from a routine immediate surgical approach to a more selective strategy favoring nonoperative treatment when appropriate. However, determining the optimal timing for intervention remains challenging, leading to ongoing controversy among surgeons regarding the choice between surgical and conservative management. This decision is particularly complex in frail or elderly patients, as it is crucial to carefully consider the risks and benefits of each approach. Indeed, the timing of surgery plays a crucial role in determining patient outcomes, with the development of intestinal ischemia or necrosis serving as a pivotal factor in surgical decision-making. Currently, small bowel necrosis diagnosis relies on clinical peritonitis presentation and contrast-enhanced CT findings. Existing studies highlight CT's role in detecting ischemia, assessing bowel resection necessity, and evaluating NOM outcomes through imaging biomarkers and predictive models. While CT effectively detects ischemia and guides treatment decisions, current protocols depend heavily on subjective radiologic interpretations with high interobserver variability, even among experienced radiologists. Therefore, there is an urgent need for objective, cost-effective biological markers to enable early prediction of intestinal necrosis and guide treatment strategies in ASBO patients.

### Small bowel obstruction in the elderly: a plea for comprehensive acute geriatric care [^ef249415]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common emergency diagnosis in elderly patients, which occurrence tends to increase parallel to the increasing number of elderly patients requiring acute medical care and emergency surgery. Approximately 10–12% of patients above 65 years presenting with abdominal pain at the emergency department (ED) is diagnosed with small bowel obstruction. Small bowel obstruction in general is one of the most frequent causes of general emergency surgery. In the UK, small bowel obstruction accounts for 51% of all emergency laparotomies. Adhesiolysis and small bowel resection are two of seven main causes counting for 80% of morbidity and death related to emergency surgery. Any emergency surgery in elderly is associated with high morbidity and mortality compared to elective operations.

Management of small bowel obstruction has advanced over recent years resulting in improved treatment results for small bowel obstruction in the general population. Computed tomography (CT) has been a step forward in detecting different etiologies of bowel obstruction and of the completeness of the obstruction. Adding water-soluble contrast can accurately predict completeness of obstruction and successful conservative treatment. These diagnostic tools led to a more tailored approach and to a reduction of immediate operations. Today, more than 70% of small bowel obstructions are treated successfully by conservative approach, avoiding the risks of a potentially complicated operation. Also, laparoscopic surgery of small bowel obstruction has been introduced as treatment option potentially reducing postoperative morbidity, although this minimal invasive approach is not suitable for every patient and harbours its own complications.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2010 evidence-based guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^fb8b0e19]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

There is no consensus on diagnosis and management of ASBO. Initial conservative management is usually safe, however proper timing for discontinuing non operative treatment is still controversial. Open surgery or laparoscopy are used without standardized indications.

Methods

A panel of 13 international experts with interest and background in ASBO and peritoneal diseases, participated in a consensus conference during the 1st International Congress of the World Society of Emergency Surgery and 9th Peritoneum and Surgery Society meeting, in Bologna, July 1–3, 2010, for developing evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and management of ASBO. Whenever was a lack of high-level evidence, the working group formulated guidelines by obtaining consensus.

Recommendations

In absence of signs of strangulation and history of persistent vomiting or combined CT scan signs (free fluid, mesenteric oedema, small bowel faeces sign, devascularized bowel) patients with partial ASBO can be managed safely with NOM and tube decompression (either with long or NG) should be attempted. These patients are good candidates for Water Soluble Contrast Medium (WSCM) with both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The appearance of water-soluble contrast in the colon on X-ray within 24 hours from administration predicts resolution. WSCM may be administered either orally or via NGT (50–150 ml) both immediately at admission or after an initial attempt of conservative treatment of 48 hours. The use of WSCM for ASBO is safe and reduces need for surgery, time to resolution and hospital stay.NOM, in absence of signs of strangulation or peritonitis, can be prolonged up to 72 hours. After 72 hours of NOM without resolution surgery is recommended. Patients treated non-operatively have shorter hospital stay, but higher recurrence rate and shorter time to re-admission, although the risk of new surgically treated episodes of ASBO is unchanged. Risk factors for recurrences are age < 40 years and matted adhesions. WSCM does not affect recurrence rates or recurrences needing surgery when compared to traditional conservative treatment. Open surgery is the preferred method for surgical treatment of strangulating ASBO as well as after failed conservative management. In selected patients and with appropriate skills, laparoscopic approach can be attempted using open access technique. Access in the left upper quadrant should be safe. Laparoscopic adhesiolysis should be attempted preferably in case of first episode of SBO and/or anticipated single band. A low threshold for open conversion should be maintained. Peritoneal adhesions should be prevented. Hyaluronic acid-carboxycellulose membrane and icodextrin can reduce incidence of adhesions. Icodextrin may reduce the risk of re-obstruction. HA cannot reduce need of surgery.

### Diagnosis and management of small bowel obstruction in virgin abdomen: a WSES position paper [^5cc9a6b8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency, accounting for almost 50% of all emergency laparotomies with significant in-hospital morbidity and costs. Most patients with SBO have undergone previous abdominal operations (80%), with adhesions as the single most common cause (60–75%) of SBO. However, SBO also occurs in patients who had no prior abdominal surgery, referred to as a virgin abdomen.

In the past decade, a paradigm shift in the treatment of SBO in patients with previous abdominal surgery has been implemented. Today, the majority of small bowel obstructions are managed non-operatively, treatment comprising bowel decompression, water-soluble contrast agents, and fluid resuscitation. Non-operative management has been found safe and efficacious in 70% of SBOs caused by adhesions (ASBO). Many authors, however, suggest that surgical exploration is still mandatory in the case of SBO in the virgin abdomen (SBO-VA), based on the assumption that SBO-VA is usually caused by other etiologies than adhesions, such as malignancy, internal hernia, and bezoars as the most prominent causes.

On the other hand, recent studies suggest a high incidence of adhesions also in patients with SBO-VA. The origin of adhesions in the virgin abdomen can be congenital, or the results of (unrecognized) abdominal inflammation in the patients' history. The observation that most SBO-VA are caused by adhesions could have important implications for treatment, signifying that guidelines on the management of ASBO might also apply to the majority of patients with SBO-VA.

The present paper aims to provide an overview of the literature on the etiology and management of SBO-VA and to generate recommendations for clinical management and future research.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2010 evidence-based guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^aa361ec0]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Fevang et al. found that among 146 patients with SBO initially treated conservatively, 93 (64%) settled without operation, 9 (6%) had strangulated bowel and 3 (2%) died. Whereas of the 91 patients with partial obstruction but no sign of strangulation, 72 (79%) resolved on conservative treatment. Therefore the authors recommended that patients with partial obstruction and no sign of strangulation should initially be treated conservatively. Furthermore when complete obstruction is present, it may settle on conservative management, but the use of supplementary diagnostic tools might be desirable to find the patients who will need early operative treatment.

In another review, out of 329 patients with SBO 43% were successfully treated conservatively, whereas 57% failed conservative treatment and underwent surgery. Overall, there were eight early deaths, four in each group (2.8% conservative vs. 2.1% surgical; p = ns). Out of these patients presenting with SBO, 63% had abdominal surgery and 37% had no prior abdominal surgery before developing a small bowel obstruction.

In conclusion, the most recent meta-analyses showed that the patients who had surgery within the six weeks before the episode of small bowel obstruction, patients with signs of strangulation or peritonitis (fever, tachycardia and leucocytosis), patients with carcinomatosis, patients with irreducible hernia and patients who started to have signs of resolution at the time of admission are not candidate for conservative treatment ± Water Soluble Contrast Medium administration.

Also the EAST guidelines on SBO management recommend that the patients with plain film finding of small bowel obstruction and Clinical markers (fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis and continuous pain) or peritonitis on physical exam warrant exploration.

### Small bowel diverticular disease: are we clinically aware? [^ae92ef22]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation of SBD can vary substantially, ranging from chronic abdominal discomfort to GI bleeding or perforation. The reported complication rate associated with SBD ranges from 5 to 10% and is more common in jejunoileal diverticula compared to duodenal diverticula. The clinical manifestation of SBD can vary substantially and have different degrees of severity. In milder cases, SBD can be asymptomatic, while some patients experience generalized abdominal pain and discomfort. More severe cases presented as small bowel obstruction, gastrointestinal bleeding, fever and infection, or acute abdomen, which often requires hospitalization. Due to the rare entity, SBD is not a usual suspect for clinical diagnosis, but often diagnosed incidentally on imaging or endoscopy. With the increased use and availability of diagnostic modalities for small bowel disease, such as double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) and video capsule endoscopy (VCE), SBD had been gaining clinical awareness. Asymptomatic SBD do not require active intervention, while treatment strategies of symptomatic disease is based on clinical presentation. Severe complications can be managed surgically, although recent reports have highlighted the role of endoscopic treatment for diverticular diseases.

Currently, only few studies have analyzed and reported the characteristics of SBD in a patient cohort. More recent reports have been limited to individual case reports. This retrospective case series study aims to systematically analyze the clinical characteristics, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic outcomes of SBD in a cohort from two tertiary centers. By focusing on the comparative efficacy of diverse diagnostic modalities for small bowel evaluation, our findings seek to enhance clinical awareness and optimize management strategies for this underrecognized condition.

### Small bowel obstruction outcomes according to compliance with the World Society of Emergency Surgery bologna guidelines [^9257f5c7]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency associated with substantial morbidity, hospital length of stay (LOS), and healthcare cost. The World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) Bologna guidelines provide evidence-informed recommendations for managing adhesive SBO, promoting timely surgical intervention (or non-operative management (NOM) when ischaemia, strangulation, or peritonitis are absent). However, guideline adoption and its impact on outcomes remain under studied. Compliance with the Bologna guidelines was evaluated to determine the impact of compliance on outcomes.

Methods

SnapSBO, a prospective, multicentre, time-bound, observational cohort study, captured data on patients with adhesive SBO across diverse healthcare settings and patient populations. Patient care was categorized into: successful NOM, surgery after an unsuccessful appropriate trial of NOM (NOM-T), and direct to surgery (DTS). Compliance with diagnostic, therapeutic, and postoperative Bologna guideline recommendations was assessed as either complete or partial. Primary outcomes included adherence to the Bologna guidelines, LOS, complications, and the incidence of the composite metric 'optimal outcomes' (LOS ≤ 5 days, discharge without complications, and no readmission within 30 days).

Results

Among 982 patients with adhesive SBO, successful NOM occurred in 561 (57.1%), 224 (22.8%) underwent NOM-T, and 197 (20.1%) proceeded DTS. The mean(s.d.) LOS was 5.3(9.0), 12.9(11.4), and 7.7(8.0) days respectively (P < 0.001). Optimal outcomes were achieved in 61.0%, 16.1%, and 37.6% respectively (P < 0.001) and full guideline compliance was observed in 17.2%, 10.1%, and 0.4% respectively.

Conclusion

Patients with adhesive SBO whose care was aligned with the Bologna guidelines had a shorter LOS and a greater incidence of optimal outcomes. Addressing evidence-to-practice gaps through implementation strategies that consider contextual factors will enhance guideline adoption and patient outcomes.

Further matter of debate are how long should NOM be and when it should be discontinued?

Usually NOM, in absence of signs of strangulation or peritonitis, can be prolonged up to 72 hours of adhesive SBO (Level of Evidence 2b GoR C)

After 3 days without resolution, WSCA study or surgery is recommended (Level of Evidence 2b GoR C)

If ileus persists more than 3 days and the drainage volume on day 3 is > 500 ml, surgery for ASBO is recommended (Level of Evidence 2b GoR C)

With closely monitoring and in the absence of signs suggestive of complications, an observation period even longer than 10 days before proceeding to surgical intervention appears to be safe.

However at any time, if onset of fever and leukocytosis greater than 15 000/mm³ (predictors of intestinal complications) are observed, then NOM should be discontinued and surgery is recommended.

In the experience from the retrospective series of Cox et al. out of 123 patients initially managed with conservative treatment, 31 of 38 patients requiring surgical intervention for SBO, had so more than 48 h duration after admission and the difference between cases resolving within 48 h and those requiring surgery after 48 h was significant (p < 0.001). Therefore most cases of ASBO that will resolve, seem to do so within 48 h of admission.

Fleshner et al. in their RCT comparing conservative management of ASBO with NGT or LT, reported that, between the 21 patients ultimately requiring operation, the mean period between admission and operation was 60 hours in the NGT group versus 65 hours in the LT group.

In a series of 35 patients with ASBO, a long intestinal tube was endoscopically placed and the decompression was successful in up to 90% of the cases. Therefore the authors recommend for patients with ASBO, a trial with long tube decompression for 48 to 72 hours. For those who fail a trial with the long tube, laparotomy with enterolysis or bowel resection is indicated.

Comparison between patients with and without small bowel resection during the index SBO episode management

Patients who underwent a small bowel resection during the index SBO episode had a similar rehospitalization rate and a nonsignificantly higher operation rate for small bowel obstruction recurrence, as well as similar overall mortality, compared to those who had no resection (Supplemental Table S3, online electronic supplementary material). Symptoms of SBO occurrence (considering patients who responded to follow-up evaluation) were similar between the two groups [35.0% (7/20) vs. 34.7% (17/49), OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.3–3.0; p = 0.981].

### Small bowel obstruction outcomes according to compliance with the World Society of Emergency Surgery bologna guidelines [^31eb0494]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency associated with substantial morbidity, hospital length of stay (LOS), and healthcare cost. The World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) Bologna guidelines provide evidence-informed recommendations for managing adhesive SBO, promoting timely surgical intervention (or non-operative management (NOM) when ischaemia, strangulation, or peritonitis are absent). However, guideline adoption and its impact on outcomes remain under studied. Compliance with the Bologna guidelines was evaluated to determine the impact of compliance on outcomes.

Methods

SnapSBO, a prospective, multicentre, time-bound, observational cohort study, captured data on patients with adhesive SBO across diverse healthcare settings and patient populations. Patient care was categorized into: successful NOM, surgery after an unsuccessful appropriate trial of NOM (NOM-T), and direct to surgery (DTS). Compliance with diagnostic, therapeutic, and postoperative Bologna guideline recommendations was assessed as either complete or partial. Primary outcomes included adherence to the Bologna guidelines, LOS, complications, and the incidence of the composite metric 'optimal outcomes' (LOS ≤ 5 days, discharge without complications, and no readmission within 30 days).

Results

Among 982 patients with adhesive SBO, successful NOM occurred in 561 (57.1%), 224 (22.8%) underwent NOM-T, and 197 (20.1%) proceeded DTS. The mean(s.d.) LOS was 5.3(9.0), 12.9(11.4), and 7.7(8.0) days respectively (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Patients with adhesive SBO whose care was aligned with the Bologna guidelines had a shorter LOS and a greater incidence of optimal outcomes. Addressing evidence-to-practice gaps through implementation strategies that consider contextual factors will enhance guideline adoption and patient outcomes.

### Clinical outcome in acute small bowel obstruction after surgical or conservative management [^28d8afb3]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Although it is commonly accepted that early operation for SBO (< 24 h) decreases immediate morbidity, no difference in the long-term outcomes between patients operated within or after 24 h of admission were found in our study. Based on this observation, it seems reasonable to attempt conservative management for patients without any signs of severity. Surgical treatment would be recommended in the absence of bowel function recovery within 24 h after an oral water-soluble contrast agent test.

A limitation of the present study is the selection bias regarding assignment of patients to study groups. Patients in the conservative group had lower severity scores. However, it seems unlikely that this bias affects the long-term outcomes. Moreover, the patient groups were similar regarding major causes for SBO, i.e. colectomy, hysterectomy, and appendectomy, as compared to historical series. A randomized controlled trial would be informative to definitively determine whether surgery is actually advantageous in terms of recurrence of SBO in non-strangulated SBO patients. However, such a study would expose patients with no signs of severity to the risks of a surgical operation and is ethically questionable. Moreover, a certain amount of bias in a randomized study comparing conservative and surgical management seems unavoidable. Another fact that would limit the feasibility of such a study is the inability to determine with confidence whether the small bowel is strangulated or not, which would restrict the investigators from obtaining a homogeneous group with non-strangulated SBO only.

In conclusion, this study indicates that patients undergoing surgical management for SBO had reduced risks of recurrence requiring hospitalization, as well as SBO symptoms as compared to those with conservative treatment. Based on these findings, the following clinical recommendation for the management of small bowel obstruction may be considered: patients with three or more of the following criteria (pain duration ≥ 4 days, abdominal guarding, leukocyte ≥ 10 × 10⁹/l, C-reactive protein ≥ 75 mg/l, free fluid ≥ 500 mL on CT scan, or reduced contrast enhancement on CT scan) should undergo prompt surgical intervention as it allows both obstruction removal and long-term reduction of recurrent SBO episodes. The decision to operate should also take into account the evolution of the clinical status and laboratory values, additional CT findings (e.g. volvulus, transition zone, reduced contrast enhancement, small bowel feces sign), as well as the patient's general condition, comorbidities, and surgical history.

Malignant bowel obstruction pathophysiology and symptoms — site, severity, and course: MBO can occur in the small or large bowel, with small BO being more common; obstruction may be partial or complete and occur at single or multiple transition points, leading to abdominal pain, cramps, distention, nausea, vomiting, absence of gas and stool passage, and occasionally overflow diarrhea, with symptoms usually starting gradually and worsening with complete obstruction; re-obstruction and malnutrition are common, and malnutrition is an independent predictor of poor survival.

Peritoneal adhesions

The term "peritoneal adhesions" or simply "adhesions" is defined as fibrous tissue that connects surfaces or organs within the peritoneal cavity that are normally separated. Such adhesions are the results of a pathological healing response of the peritoneum upon injury, as opposed to the normal "ad integrum" repair. Typical adhesions form after peritoneal injury from abdominal surgery. Other conditions that may cause peritoneal injury resulting in adhesion formation include radiotherapy, endometriosis, inflammation, and local response to tumors. Adhesions from a non-operative etiology are often part of a more complex pathology that can cause chronic pain and complications as the result of adhesions and other mechanisms. Management of chronic abdominal complications by adhesiolysis is controversial. The scope of the present guideline is limited to diagnosis and management of acute bowel obstructions.

Adhesive small bowel obstruction

Small bowel obstruction is a surgical emergency in which the obstruction of the small intestine hinders passage of intestinal contents. Small bowel obstruction is characterized by abdominal pain, vomiting, distention, and constipation. Adhesions are the single most common cause for small bowel obstruction. Nonadhesive etiologies of bowel obstruction include incarcerated hernias, obstructive lesions (malignant and benign), and a number of infrequent causes for bowel obstruction such as bezoars, inflammatory bowel disease, and volvulus. Definitive confirmation of the adhesive etiology of bowel obstruction is made during operative treatment. Methods to confirm the adhesive etiology of bowel obstruction non-invasively include a history of previous episodes of bowel obstruction by adhesions or exclusion of other causes of bowel obstruction by imaging (often CT scan).

However no randomized controlled trial comparing open to laparoscopic adhesiolysis exists up to date, and both the precise indications and specific outcomes of laparoscopic adhesiolysis for adhesive SBO remain poorly understood. The only RCT on laparoscopic adhesiolysis assessed the incidence of chronic abdominal pain after randomization to laparoscopic adhesiolysis or no treatment during diagnostic laparoscopy and it failed to demonstrate any significant differences in terms of pain or discomfort.

Although data from a retrospective clinical controlled trial suggest that laparoscopy seems feasible and better in terms of hospital stay and mortality reduction.

In a retrospective analyisis Grafen et al. compared the outcomes of laparoscopic management of ASBO to both exploratory laparotomy and secondary conversion to open surgery. 93 patients were divided into successful laparoscopy (71%), secondary conversion (26%) and primary laparotomy (3%). The first group had more simple adhesions, fewer prior operations, lower ASA score, shortest operative time, as was the duration of both intensive care unit and hospital stay; moreover they were younger and had a shorter duration of SBO prior to their operation. Despite that mortality was 6%, regardless of operative technique. The authors, moreover, found that patients who only had prior appendectomy or cholecystectomy could all be managed laparoscopically without need for secondary conversion; on the other hand a prolonged ileus (mean 4.3 days) with progressive abdominal distension and a higher number or more demanding previous operations address to a primary laparotomy. Finally the reasons for converting to open adhesiolysis were: inadequate laparoscopic control due to intestinal distension, extensive adhesions, iatrogenic perforations and resection of necrotic segments.

When deciding between an open or laparoscopic approach, the first consideration is that the surgeon be trained and capable of performing advanced laparoscopy.

With regards to patient selection, individuals with an acute small bowel obstruction and peritonitis, free air or gangrenous bowel requiring an emergent operation are best managed with a laparotomy. Patients without peritonitis who do not resolve with nonoperative management should be considered for laparoscopic adhesiolysis. In these cases, it is important to consider the bowel diameter, degree of abdominal distention, and location of the obstruction (ie, proximal or distal). Suter et al. found that a bowel diameter exceeding 4 cm was associated with an increased rate of conversion: 55% versus 32%. Patients with a distal and complete small bowel obstruction have an increased incidence of intraoperative complications and increased risk of conversion. Patients with persistent abdominal distention after nasogastric intubation are also unlikely to be treated successfully with laparoscopy.

CT scan is highly diagnostic in SBO and has a great value in all patients with inconclusive plain films for complete or high grade SBO. However CT-scans should not be routinely performed in the decision-making process except when clinical history, physical examination, and plain film are not conclusive for small bowel obstruction diagnosis. CT can confirm the presence of complete obstruction and allow the diagnosis of the cause of SBO, it can also exclude a non-adhesional pathology and assess the occurrence of strangulation with a sensitivity and specificity higher than 90% and a NPV of nearly 100%.

IV contrast is necessary. Oral is not

Water-soluble contrast follow-through is valuable in patients undergoing initial non operative conservative management in order to rule out complete ASBO and predict the need for surgery.

This investigation is safer than barium in cases of perforation and peritoneal spread and has possible therapeutic value in the case of adhesive small intestine obstruction.

MRI use should be restricted to those patients having CT or iodine contrast contraindications.

- Conservative treatment and timing for surgery

The management of small bowel obstruction caused by adhesions is controversial because surgery can induce new adhesions, whereas conservative treatment does not remove the cause of the obstruction. Conservative treatment involves nasogastric intubation, intravenous fluid administration, and clinical observation. Strangulation of the bowel requires immediate surgery, but intestinal ischemia can be difficult to determine clinically. Several issues are raised when managing patients with ASBO.

The first question is whether to operate or not to operate

Patients without the signs of strangulation or peritonitis or history of persistent vomiting or combination of CT scan signs (free fluid, mesenteric oedema, lack of faeces signa, devascularized bowel) and partial ASBO can safely undergo non-operative management (LoE 1a GoR A)

In the absence of any signs of strangulation, patients with an adhesive SBO can be managed safely with non-operative treatment and tube decompression should be attempted (Level of Evidence 1b GoR A)

Patients who had surgery within the six weeks before the episode of small bowel obstruction, patients with signs of strangulation or peritonitis (fever, tachycardia and leucocytosis, metabolic acidosis and continuous pain), patients with irreducible hernia and patients who started to have signs of resolution at the time of admission are NOT candidate for conservative treatment ± WSCA administration (Level of Evidence 1a GoR A)

One of the most dreaded complications of surgery is a missed enterotomy. Although a missed enterotomy can occur after laparotomy, the incidence is higher after laparoscopic surgery.

The long-term results regarding recurrence are limited, with most series reporting a mean follow-up between 12 and 24 months.

Feasibility of diagnostic laparoscopy is ranging from 60% to 100% whilst therapeutic effectiveness of the laparoscopic approach is lower (40–88%). Predictive factors for successful laparoscopic adhesiolysis are: number of previous laparotomies ≤ 2, non-median previous laparotomy, appendectomy as previous surgical treatment causing adherences, unique band adhesion as pathogenetic mechanism of small bowel obstruction, early laparoscopic management within 24 hours from the onset of symptoms, no signs of peritonitis on physical examination, experience of the surgeon.

Surgical operating time is greater in patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery compared to patients who underwent a laparotomy.

Postoperative morbidity is lower in patients who underwent laparoscopic adhesiolysis compared to those who underwent the laparotomic approach. Furthermore a greater rate of morbidity is present in patients who underwent laparotomic conversion; whereas mortality is comparable in the two groups (0–4%). Finally the laparoscopic adhesiolysis can avoid laparotomy, which is itself a cause of new adhesions and bowel obstruction, although some authors noticed a greater incidence of recurrent small bowel obstructions in patients who underwent laparoscopy compared to those in which a laparotomy was performed.

Operative technique has a capital role for a successful laparoscopic treatment. The initial trocar should be placed away (alternative site technique) from the scars in an attempt to avoid adhesions. Some investigators have recommended the use of computed tomography scan or ultrasonography to help determine a safe site for the initial trocar insertion.

### Small bowel obstruction in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis related desmoid disease [^45b315fb]. Colorectal Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

Intra-abdominal desmoid disease is one of the most common extra-intestinal manifestations of familial adenomatous polyposis. Small bowel obstruction occurs frequently in affected patients and is notoriously difficult to treat. The aim of this study was to review the management and outcome of desmoid-related small bowel obstruction.

Method

This was a retrospective, descriptive study of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and intra-abdominal desmoid disease who developed small bowel obstruction. Demographic data and data concerning the presentation, diagnosis and treatment of the bowel obstructions were abstracted from the polyposis database or patients' records. Patients with obstruction unrelated to desmoid disease were excluded.

Results

There were 47 patients (30 women and 17 men). Median age at first bowel obstruction was 24.2 (interquartile range 19.2–34.2) years. The median time from index surgery to first bowel obstruction was 4.1 (interquartile range 1.5–9.0) years. Twenty-two patients had a colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis and 21 a proctocolectomy and ileoanal pouch. Obstruction was treated medically in 29% of cases and surgically in 69%. Thirteen patients had total parental nutrition. Thirty (63.8%) had a second episode of small bowel obstruction at a mean of 5.3 years after the first, 50% of which were treated medically. Eighteen (37.5%) patients had more than two episodes of bowel obstruction. There were 118 operations, including lysis of adhesions (29), small bowel resection (14), bypass (12), ileostomy (12), desmoid excision (9) and stricturoplasty (2).

Conclusion

Desmoid-related small bowel obstruction in familial adenomatous polyposis patients requires multiple surgical strategies to restore a patent gastrointestinal tract. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO THE LITERATURE? This is the only series in the literature specifically addressing small bowel obstruction in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and intra-abdominal desmoid disease. The data show that small bowel obstruction is common, tends to recur, but can be successfully managed by a combination of medical and well selected surgical treatment.

### Optimal management of malignant left-sided large bowel obstruction: do international guidelines agree? [^e7a9e5f0]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 20% of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer will present with left-sided large bowel obstruction. The optimal management of this cohort of patients remains unclear. We aimed to review international guidelines to see if there was a consensus on the treatment of this surgical emergency.

Methods

The PubMed and Medline databases were searched for guidelines on the management of left-sided, malignant large bowel obstruction (MBO) between 2010 and 2018.

Results

Nineteen guidelines were identified spanning a range of continents. There was no clear consensus on the management of potentially resectable disease. Eight guidelines (42%) suggested primary surgery, two guidelines (11%) suggested stenting as a bridge to surgery and nine guidelines (47%) suggested surgery or stenting could be performed. Primary resection with or without anastomosis was the most frequently recommended procedure (n = 6 35%), but over a third of guidelines gave no operative recommendations. There was very limited detail on the stenting procedure and how long elective surgery should be deferred. In the palliative situation, there was general agreement that stents should be offered in preference to surgery.

Conclusion

International guidelines offer limited and contrasting recommendations on the management of left-sided MBO. There is a lack of high-quality evidence to support whether emergency surgery or stenting as a bridge to surgery is the optimal procedure in terms of morbidity, mortality and long-term oncological outcome.

Quality of evidence

Of the 19 guidelines, 13 (68%) appraised the quality of evidence available to formulate their recommendations (Table 2). Several different tools were used to grade the evidence, but the most commonly used was the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Thirteen guidelines were published between 2010 and 2016. Most of these guidelines were based on low quality or level III–IV evidence (n = 5, 38%). In contrast, six guidelines were published between 2017 and 2018 and these were mostly based on moderate quality or level I–II evidence (n = 5, 83%). To date, no guidelines have reported on high quality or level Ia evidence.

Contraindications to a trial with long tube decompression include strangulation obstruction, malignant obstruction, incarcerated hernias, foreign body, radiation enteritis, and peritonitis.

In a series of 53 patients with ASBO and treated with long intestinal tube decompression, laparotomy is appropriate after non-response for 7 and 3 days for complete and partial SBO, respectively.

From further experiences, if ileus persists more than 3 days and the drainage volume on day 3 is > 500 ml, surgery for ASBO is recommended.

The EAST practice management guidelines for SBO recommend that patients without resolution of the SBO by day 3–5 of non-operative management should undergo water soluble study or surgery.

Finally when deciding between operative or non operative management it would be beneficial to assess the risk of ASBO recurrence after NOM and which factors can predict recurrence of ASBO after NOM

The patients non responders to the long-tube and conservative treatment within 72 hours have a considerable risk of recurrent ASBO (Level of Evidence 2b GoR C)

Risk factors for recurrences are age < 40 years and matted adhesion (Level of Evidence 1b GoR A)

Gastrografin use does not affect the recurrences rates or recurrences needing surgery when compared to traditionally conservatively treated patients (Level of Evidence 1b GoR A)

Out of 32,583 patients with an index admission for SBO in 1997 from an US population study, 24% had surgery during the index admission and regardless of treatment during the index admission, 81% of surviving patients had no additional SBO readmissions over the subsequent 5 years.

Conservative treatment and timing for surgery

The management of ASBO is controversial because surgery can induce new adhesions, whereas conservative treatment does not remove the cause of the obstruction. Conservative treatment involves nasogastric intubation, intravenous fluid administration, and clinical observation. Strangulation of the bowel requires immediate surgery, but intestinal ischemia can be difficult to determine clinically.

Potentially, acute care surgery (ACS) model may adversely affect patients who present with SBO because they may be handed over from surgeon to surgeon without definitive care. These patients may not require an operation initially but may require one subsequently because of the development of complications or if the SBO does not resolve with conservative treatment.

In an Australian retrospective study Lien et al. observed that, in the ACS period, there was no significant difference in complication rates or length of hospital stay in those who were not handed over and those who were, both in the pre-ACS and ACS period.

The authors suggested that clinical handover may provide an 'audit-point' for patient management and opportunity for collaborative input. Moreover, participation of doctors with greater clinical experience may minimize errors in information transfer due to increased acumen in recognizing potential complications.

A delay in operation for SBO places patients at higher risk for bowel resection. In a retrospective review Leung and coll find that younger patients (P = 0.001), no previous operation (P < 0.001), and absence of adhesive disease (P < 0.001) were more likely to go to operation. Acquiring a CT scan (P = 0.029) or radiograph (P < 0.001) were factors that increased time to the operating room (OR). In the group with time to OR less than 24 hours, 12% of patients had bowel resection versus time to OR greater than 24 hours, 29% of them required bowel resection.

Several issues are raised when managing patients with ASBO.

To increase the yield of our search to detect relevant publications, we also searched reference list of relevant articles and guidelines for the treatment of patients with SBO.

3 Relevant studies selection

All the studies that included data for a (sub)cohort of SBO-VA patients relating to our search questions were included.

4 Data extraction

From included studies, we extracted data related to clinical topics including epidemiology and etiology of SBO-VA, diagnosis and imaging, initial assessment, the role of surgical management in SBO-VA, and the role of non-operative management in SBO-VA. All the relevant data was charted in tables.
5 Collation, summarizing, and reporting

The charted data was combined, categorized, and compared across the included studies.

All relevant information was reported and discussed to answer the study questions.

Definitions

Small bowel obstruction

Small bowel obstruction is a surgical emergency in which a mechanical obstruction of the small intestine hinders the passage of intestinal contents. Typical symptoms of small bowel obstruction are abdominal pain, vomiting, distension, and constipation. However, not all these symptoms may be present especially in the elderly population.

Small bowel obstruction can be classified as partial (incomplete) or complete obstruction. Imaging studies such as water-soluble contrast agents (WSCA) or CT can help differentiate between complete and incomplete obstruction. In case of a partial obstruction, there is a higher likelihood that a bowel obstruction can be managed by non-operative means.

Virgin abdomen

The term "virgin abdomen" refers to the abdomen of a patient without prior surgery, radiotherapy, or known peritoneal inflammatory disease in history. There is no consensus in the literature about primary abdominal wall hernias that are not related to a previous incision. In our results, we will describe whether patients with a primary abdominal wall hernia have or have not been included among patients with virgin abdomen.

Peritoneal adhesions

Peritoneal adhesions are defined as fibrous scar tissue that connects surfaces of intra-peritoneal organs that are normally separated.

Peritoneal adhesions may be classified as congenital or acquired. Most adhesions are acquired and result from the peritoneal healing response upon injury, typically abdominal operation; other less common etiologies of acquired adhesions include malignancy, radiotherapy, abdominal or pelvic inflammations, and endometriosis.

Congenital adhesions are defined as anomalous intra-peritoneal adhesions that are not related to a previous abdominal disease or operation; these might result as remnants of physiological organogenesis.

### Clinical outcome in acute small bowel obstruction after surgical or conservative management [^51d57739]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute small bowel obstruction (SBO) accounts for about 20% of all surgical emergencies in Western societies. Small bowel obstruction is caused mainly by postoperative adhesions (more than 75% of all cases). The operative procedures usually associated with SBO are colectomy, hysterectomy, and appendectomy. Other causes of SBO are Crohn's disease (7%), neoplasm (5–10%), hernia (2%), or radiation-induced enteritis (1%). In a series of 29,790 patients with a single previous abdominal or pelvic surgery, Ellis et al. reported that within the following 10 years 34.6% of them were readmitted with a mean of 2.1 times for a disease related to adhesions. About 10% of patients have "spontaneous" SBO with no previous abdominal surgery. The management of SBO is based on clinical evaluation, biological tests, and computed tomography (CT) imaging. Conservative treatment with bowel rest, nasogastric tube decompression, and fluid resuscitation is successful in a variable proportion of patients. In conservative management, regular reassessment is mandatory for early recognition of signs of bowel ischemia that would require a surgical operation. Patients with clinical degradation or with a CT scan evoking strangulated SBO need urgent surgery. In a significant proportion of patients both therapeutic options are valid; the choice of the treatment depends mainly on the clinician's assessment, and therefore it represents a common clinical challenge. On the one hand, successful conservative treatment may leave adhesions that could cause recurrence; on the other hand, surgery may be the source of new adhesions like any other abdominal surgery. Landercasper et al. reported a 42% risk of SBO recurrence by 10 years, which is lessened in surgically treated patients compared to their conservatively treated counterparts. Another retrospective study analyzed the pattern of recurrence after one or more episodes of SBO; the rate of SBO recurrence was shown to increase proportionally to the number of previous SBO episodes.

In the present study, we report a long-term follow-up of patients treated with surgical versus conservative approach for SBO. The aim was to compare the rate of SBO recurrence, resulting in new hospitalization with or without surgery, as well as the occurrence of SBO symptoms, such as recurrent abdominal pain, at home.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2013 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^7105c3cc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In 2013 Guidelines on diagnosis and management of ASBO have been revised and updated by the WSES Working Group on ASBO to develop current evidence-based algorithms and focus indications and safety of conservative treatment, timing of surgery and indications for laparoscopy.

Recommendations

In absence of signs of strangulation and history of persistent vomiting or combined CT-scan signs (free fluid, mesenteric edema, small-bowel feces sign, devascularization) patients with partial ASBO can be managed safely with NOM and tube decompression should be attempted. These patients are good candidates for Water-Soluble-Contrast-Medium (WSCM) with both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The radiologic appearance of WSCM in the colon within 24 hours from administration predicts resolution. WSCM maybe administered either orally or via NGT both immediately at admission or after failed conservative treatment for 48 hours. The use of WSCM is safe and reduces need for surgery, time to resolution and hospital stay.NOM, in absence of signs of strangulation or peritonitis, can be prolonged up to 72 hours. After 72 hours of NOM without resolution, surgery is recommended. Patients treated non-operatively have shorter hospital stay, but higher recurrence rate and shorter time to re-admission, although the risk of new surgically treated episodes of ASBO is unchanged. Risk factors for recurrences are age < 40 years and matted adhesions. WSCM does not decrease recurrence rates or recurrences needing surgery. Open surgery is often used for strangulating ASBO as well as after failed conservative management. In selected patients and with appropriate skills, laparoscopic approach is advisable using open access technique. Access in left upper quadrant or left flank is the safest and only completely obstructing adhesions should be identified and lysed with cold scissors. Laparoscopic adhesiolysis should be attempted preferably if first episode of SBO and/or anticipated single band. A low threshold for open conversion should be maintained. Peritoneal adhesions should be prevented. Hyaluronic acid-carboxycellulose membrane and icodextrin decrease incidence of adhesions. Icodextrin may reduce the risk of re-obstruction. HA cannot reduce need of surgery. Adhesions quantification and scoring maybe useful for achieving standardized assessment of adhesions severity and for further research in diagnosis and treatment of ASBO.

### Diagnosis and management of small bowel obstruction in virgin abdomen: a WSES position paper [^730a88be]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although several aspects in diagnosis and treatment of SBO-VA have not been clearly described in the few available studies, the overall results are comparable to the results of studies on SBO in patients with previous abdominal surgeries in history. We therefore propose that patients with a virgin abdomen could be treated according to existing guidelines for SBO and ASBO.
