## Question

Conflicting attitudes or behaviors that create tension within a person's mind are referred to in terms of

Answer Choices:
A. persuasion
B. general adaptation syndrome
C. serial position
D. cognitive dissonance

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which term refers to conflicting attitudes or behaviors that create tension within a person's mind. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core concept being described. Then, I should verify each answer choice against authoritative sources. Next, I will eliminate incorrect options and confirm the best fit. Finally, I will double-check that the chosen term matches the psychological definition and usage in the provided materials.

> Let me first confirm the core concept: the question is about mental tension arising from holding contradictory beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors, which is a classic psychological conflict phenomenon rather than mere persuasion, stress physiology, or memory effects.

> Now, I will examine Option A, persuasion. Wait, let me verify the definition. Persuasion is the process of changing attitudes or beliefs through communication, not the internal tension produced by conflicting cognitions; it is an external influence rather than an internal conflict state, so this does not fit the question's description of inner tension.

> Next, Option B, general adaptation syndrome. Hold on, I should verify this. General adaptation syndrome is a stress-response model describing physiological stages in response to external stressors, not the cognitive tension from conflicting attitudes or behaviors; it belongs to psychophysiology rather than cognitive psychology, so it is not the correct term for internal mental conflict.

> I will now examine Option C, serial position. Let me think about this. The serial position effect pertains to memory recall gradients for items at the beginning and end of a list, which is unrelated to the experience of conflicting attitudes or behaviors causing internal tension; this is a memory phenomenon, not a conflict phenomenon, so it should be excluded.

> Option D is cognitive dissonance. I should confirm the definition. Cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort or tension that occurs when a person holds two or more inconsistent cognitions, or when behavior conflicts with beliefs; this matches the question's description of conflicting attitudes or behaviors creating tension within the mind, and the provided sources explicitly discuss dissonance and related conflict-resolution processes, including the "spreading of alternatives" after decisions, which is a classic dissonance-reduction mechanism [^3020eaaa].

> But wait, what if the question is trying to trick me with "internal conflict" language from other frameworks? Let me reconsider. While terms like "internal conflict" appear in psychodynamic theory, the question is asking for the specific name of the cognitive tension phenomenon, and that name is cognitive dissonance; the other options are either processes of influence, stress physiology, or memory effects, none of which capture the precise meaning of conflicting cognitions producing discomfort.

> Final answer: D. Cognitive dissonance.

---

The correct answer is **D. cognitive dissonance**. This term refers to the mental tension that arises when a person holds conflicting attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors, prompting discomfort and a drive to resolve the inconsistency [^3020eaaa]. The other options are incorrect: **persuasion** is the process of changing attitudes, not the tension itself; **general adaptation syndrome** is a stress-response model; and **serial position** relates to memory recall, not internal conflict.

## Definition and explanation of cognitive dissonance

Cognitive dissonance is the **psychological discomfort** experienced when an individual holds two or more inconsistent cognitions (thoughts, beliefs, or attitudes) or when their behavior conflicts with their beliefs [^3020eaaa]. This discomfort motivates individuals to reduce the inconsistency, often by changing their beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors to restore internal consistency [^3020eaaa].

---

## Examples of cognitive dissonance

Cognitive dissonance can manifest in various everyday situations, such as:

- **Smoking**: A person who smokes cigarettes but knows that smoking is harmful to their health experiences cognitive dissonance. The conflict between the behavior (smoking) and the belief (smoking is harmful) creates mental tension, often leading to rationalizations or attempts to quit smoking to resolve the dissonance.

- **Environmental behavior**: An individual who values environmental conservation but frequently uses single-use plastics may experience cognitive dissonance. This inconsistency between values and behavior can prompt changes in behavior, such as adopting reusable products.

- **Consumer behavior**: After making a significant purchase, a consumer may experience post-decision dissonance, questioning whether they made the right choice. This can lead to seeking reassurance or justifying the purchase to reduce discomfort [^3020eaaa].

---

## Psychological mechanisms involved in cognitive dissonance

Several psychological mechanisms are involved in experiencing and resolving cognitive dissonance:

- **Dissonance arousal**: The initial recognition of inconsistency between cognitions or between behavior and beliefs triggers discomfort or tension [^3020eaaa].

- **Dissonance reduction**: Individuals are motivated to reduce this discomfort through various strategies, including changing their beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors, or by adding new cognitions to justify the inconsistency [^3020eaaa].

- **Rationalization**: People often rationalize their behavior or beliefs to align them with each other, thereby reducing dissonance. For example, a smoker might downplay the health risks of smoking to justify their behavior.

- **Behavioral change**: In some cases, individuals may change their behavior to align with their beliefs or values, thereby resolving the dissonance [^3020eaaa].

---

## Consequences of cognitive dissonance

Cognitive dissonance can have significant psychological and behavioral consequences:

- **Stress and anxiety**: Persistent cognitive dissonance can lead to stress, anxiety, and emotional discomfort.

- **Behavioral change**: Dissonance often motivates individuals to change their behavior to align with their beliefs or values, promoting personal growth and development [^3020eaaa].

- **Rationalization and denial**: Individuals may engage in rationalization or denial to justify their behavior, potentially perpetuating harmful habits or beliefs.

- **Decision-making**: Cognitive dissonance can influence decision-making processes, leading individuals to avoid situations that may create dissonance or to seek information that confirms their existing beliefs (confirmation bias) [^38778544].

## Comparison with other psychological concepts

| **Concept** | **Definition** | **Relation to cognitive dissonance** |
|-|-|-|
| Persuasion | The process of changing attitudes or beliefs through communication | Persuasion can induce cognitive dissonance by introducing conflicting information, prompting individuals to change their attitudes or beliefs to reduce dissonance |
| General adaptation syndrome | A stress-response model describing physiological reactions to stressors | General adaptation syndrome relates to stress responses, whereas cognitive dissonance specifically addresses mental tension from conflicting cognitions or behaviors |
| Serial position effect | A memory phenomenon where items at the beginning and end of a list are recalled better | Serial position effect is unrelated to cognitive dissonance, as it pertains to memory recall rather than internal conflict |

---

## Conclusion

Cognitive dissonance is the **psychological tension** that arises from conflicting attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors. This discomfort motivates individuals to restore consistency, often by changing their beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors. Understanding cognitive dissonance helps explain why people sometimes change their minds, justify their actions, or experience stress when their beliefs and behaviors are inconsistent.

People have concerns, and ethicists often respond to them with philosophical arguments. But can conceptual constructions properly address fears and anxieties? It is argued in this paper that while it is possible to voice, clarify, create and-to a certain extent-tackle concerns by arguments, more concrete practices, choices, and actions are normally needed to produce proper responses to people's worries. While logical inconsistencies and empirical errors can legitimately be exposed by arguments, the situation is considerably less clear when it comes to moral, cultural, and emotional norms, values, and expectations.

### Practice parameter for psychodynamic psychotherapy with children [^b9d68bc7]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2012). Medium credibility.

Psychodynamic psychotherapy with children — definitions and core propositions state that psychodynamic psychotherapy is based on the core propositions of psychoanalytic theory derived from clinical observations, and that research in experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience provides the empirical foundation for these postulates. Foremost propositions include that complex, unconscious mental processes determine conscious ideation and purposeful behavior; internal representations of experience with significant persons and the real world shape the individual's basic assumptions and expectations; observable thoughts and behaviors, including symptoms, are over-determined and communications have multiple meanings; psychic conflict is ever present and part of normal development with external conflicts between the individual and the social or physical environment and internal conflicts within the mind; defenses are unconscious mental mechanisms that reduce anxiety and maintain psychological homeostasis; resistance to psychological change serves to maintain psychic stability although it slows the therapeutic process; transference in the therapist-patient interaction provides an opportunity to observe, understand and revise internalized relational patterns; therapist neutrality establishes a secure relational setting for therapy; and the therapist's emotional responses to the patient (countertransference) are important for the therapist to recognize and understand.

### The costs of over-control in anorexia nervosa: evidence from fMRI and ecological momentary assessment [^e1a98865]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Evidence that over-control may come at a cost such as increased tension in everyday life is in line with EMA data showing that highly restrictive eating coincides with higher tension, anxiety and negative affect measured throughout the day. These results offer an insightful perspective on the clinical presentation of AN. Several theoretical models of AN etiology include heightened tension and highly controlled behavior as core features –. However, these models state that over-controlled behavior (e.g. dietary restriction) reduces tension, presumably serving as an alternative, maladaptive strategy of ER. In accordance with Haynos et al. our results question the effectiveness of over-control (including emotional avoidance) as an ER strategy and suggest that while over-controlled behavior may be experienced as a helpful way to reduce tension in the short term, it may in fact increase tension in the long run. This possibility is supported by data on the downregulation of positive emotions, which has been shown to predict higher body-related rumination and increased negative affect in AN. In other studies, higher daily levels of negative affect in AN predicted increased ruminationand increased dietary restriction on the following day. In light of these findings, it seems plausible that negative affective states and a tendency towards over-controlled behavior form a self-perpetuating circle that impedes the reduction of dysfunctional behavior in AN and prevents long-term improvement of mood. From a methodological point of view, our findings emphasize the importance of precisely defining time scales (e.g. short-term versus long-term regulation) when investigating ER in eating disorders. As also pointed out by Engel et al. temporal parameters of analytic approaches could account for some of the previous inconsistencies in ER studies on AN. From a conceptual point of view, our findings also highlight complexities in the definition of self-control. While self-control is often viewed as a limited resource that costs effort, others describe it as a dynamic process of resolving goal conflict, e.g. between have to and want to goals or short- and long- term goals –. From this perspective, restrictive eating in AN can be viewed as a consequence of the conflict between hedonic eating and weight control being resolved by heightened accessibility of long-term (weight-related) goals — an implicit process which might enable AN patients to control themselves even in very tempting situations. Thus, self-control may be 'second nature' for many individuals with AN. Similarly, constant down-regulation of emotions may emerge from the goal conflict between acting out and down-regulating emotions being implicitly resolved by self-restraint. In the context of goal conflict theories, these behavioral tendencies in AN may be seen as maladaptive because they fail to establish a balance between different types of goals. This predominance of weight/emotion control goals has severe long-term physical and emotional consequences.

### A theoretical framework for polarization as the gradual fragmentation of a divided society [^566caa77]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ideologically opposed camp formation

Camps are groups based on shared narratives about social reality. Conflict occurs due to alternative interpretations of important aspects of that reality. These narratives are often aligned with opposing or mutually exclusive world views, moral values, and political orientation. For example, conflicting narratives include those based on dissent about interpretations of history in intractable conflicts –. While conflicting narratives may divide societies into opposed camps, consensus within these camps, that is, self-identification with like-minded people, forms the basis of identity maintenance and development. This means that, within each opposing camp, the group narrative shapes the content of the collective identity with its associated values, beliefs, and norms.

From the perspective of group members, the strength of social identification reflects the importance of the group to the individual. If we apply this argument to opposed camps, the strength of identification should be reflected in the degree of ideological certainty about the group narrative. That is, certainty about the group-defining narrative representing the truth from the perspective of the group. Of course, other sources of social identity strength are available to group members, including leadership, power struggles, and social cleavages. For members of ideologically opposed camps, however, the interactions between ingroup and outgroup members, by which group-defining narratives are validated or invalidated via discussions, are likely to affect the group members' levels of certainty. This creates the need for group members exposed to the outgroup's position to seek further validation from the ingroup. Conversely, it is likely that members of camps would seek to avoid exposure to narratives and arguments contradicting their own. For example, both committed liberals and conservatives prefer to stay in their own ideological bubble rather than be confronted with conflicting narratives on contentious social issues. It follows that intragroup interactions are likely to become preferential as members of ideologically opposed camps would actively seek validation and re-endorsement of the ingroup narrative (confirmation bias) and avoid challenges from outgroups. Thus, while group members would be attracted by interactions with ingroup members, they would be ideologically "repulsed" when interacting with outgroup members. This pattern of preferential interaction can lead to ideological segregation through exclusive communication with others who have the same point of view, as in "… liberals watching and reading only liberals; moderates, moderates; conservatives, conservatives; Neo-Nazi, Neo-Nazi"(p.9), which can drive the further transformation of society, through further polarization between ideologically opposed camps. Within a camp where consensus is expected, interactions between group members validate and reinforce the camp identity, so that a process of mutual influence towards the crystallization of identity may occur.

### Authentic self-expression on social media is associated with greater subjective well-being [^5ae6af8c]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The desire to present the self in a way that is ideal and authentic is not mutually exclusive; on the contrary, an individual is likely to desire both simultaneously. This occurs in part because self-idealization and authentic self-expression fulfill different psychological needs and are associated with different psychological costs. On the one hand, self-idealization has been called a "fundamental part of human nature"because it allows individuals to cultivate a positive self-view and to create positive impressions of themselves in others. In addition, authentic self-expression allows individuals to verify and affirm their sense of self, which can increase self-esteem, and a sense of belonging. On the other hand, self-idealizing behavior can be psychologically costly, as acting out of character is associated with feelings of internal conflict, psychological discomfort, and strong emotional reactions; individuals may also possess characteristics that are more or less socially desirable, bringing their desire to present themselves in an authentic way into conflict with their desire to present the best version of themselves.

Here, we explore the tension between self-idealization and authentic self-expression on social media, and test how prioritizing one over the other impacts users' well-being. We focus our analysis on a core component of the self: personality. Personality captures fundamental differences in the way that people think, feel and behave, reflecting the psychological characteristics that make individuals uniquely themselves. Building on the Five Factor Model of personality, we test the extent to which authentic self-expression of personality characteristics are related to Life Satisfaction, hypothesizing that greater authentic self-expression will be positively correlated with Life Satisfaction. In exploratory analyses, we also consider whether this relationship is moderated by the personality characteristics of the individual. That is, not all individuals might benefit from authentic self-expression equally. Given that some personality traits are more socially desirable than others, individuals who possess more desirable personality traits are likely to experience a reduced tension between self-idealization and authentic self-expression. Consequently, individuals with more socially desirable profiles might disproportionality benefit from authentic self-expression because the motivational pulls of self-idealization and authentic self-expression point in the same — rather than the opposite — direction.

### Tension at the borders: perceptions of role overload, conflict, strain and facilitation in work, family and health roles among employed individuals with arthritis [^5bdcbd93]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Time constraints fulfilling role demands (role overload) were frequent, and this was one way that work and personal roles negatively impacted caring for arthritis. Individuals were protective of their work, sometimes not taking time to care for their health. A consequence of this was that reports of fatigue were pervasive for those with IA and OA. Ultimately, many respondents could not sustain involvement in all roles and reported role loss in their personal lives, especially in socializing and leisure. Future research needs to examine role overload and personal life role loss as potential early warning indicators of employment difficulties that might result in changes to work, including forgoing employment.

Role conflict focused almost exclusively on difficulties that arthritis created in other roles. Pain, fatigue, symptom unpredictability and disability interfered with work and personal roles. A wide range of self-management behaviours and job accommodations had the potential to improve the person–job fit and mitigate role conflict. Although the general workplace literature emphasizes the importance of person–organization fit, much of this research has examined the congruence between a worker's attitudes or personality and the organization's culture. Our study finds additional dimensions are relevant. Namely, health conditions such as arthritis have an intermittent and unpredictable course, and symptoms and disability can undermine the person–organization fit. This may be exacerbated by unwillingness to disclose arthritis or utilize job accommodations until absolutely necessary. Yet, delaying accommodations may have consequences for work and put employment retention at risk. Person–organization fit will be of increasing importance as the workforce ages and individuals in their prime earning years develop chronic conditions, particularly OA.

### Social manipulation of preference in the human brain [^4b5d48ef]. Neuron (2013). Low credibility.

Our preferences are influenced by what other people like, but depend critically on how we feel about those people, a classical psychological effect called "cognitive balance". Here, we manipulated preferences for goods by telling participants the preferences of strongly liked or disliked groups of other people. Participants' preferences converged to those of the liked group, but diverged from the disliked group. Activation of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) tracked the discrepancy between one's own preference and its social ideal and was associated with subsequent preference change (toward the liked and away from the disliked group), even several months later. A follow-up study found overlapping activation in this same region of dmPFC with negative monetary outcomes, but no overlap with nearby activations induced by response conflict. A single social encounter can thus result in long-lasting preference change, a mechanism that recruits dmPFC and that may reflect the aversive nature of cognitive imbalance.

### Pathological affective dependence as a risk factor for intimate partner violence: initial psychometric validation of the Italian version of the pathological affective dependence scale [^80623dc4]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

The factor analytic findings revealed a structure that effectively captures the core phenomenology of PAD. Specifically, this structure includes three distinct factors: 'Internal Conflict' (Factor 1), 'Inability to Separate' (Factor 2) and 'Partner Abuse' (Factor 3) in both the state and trait versions of the PADS. The items in the 'Internal Conflict' factor reveal a profound struggle within individuals with PAD. Items such as 'I am aware of the fact that my partner might not be the right person for me, but at the same time, I can't leave him/her' and 'I find myself suddenly changing my mind about whether or not I want to be with my partner, based on his/her behavior' underscore the psychological tension individuals face when attempting to reconcile the awareness of an unhealthy relationship with the difficulty of disengagement (Dutton and Painter), in line with what the theory of PAD (Pugliese, Saliani, et al.) postulated. In the 'Internal Conflict' factor, only items describing alternate and akratic conflict reached the psychometric requirements for inclusion. The exclusion of absent conflict, involving a lack of awareness, stems from its poor measurability via self‐report instruments. This oscillation between denial and awareness is a hallmark of PAD and aligns with trauma‐related psychological processes (Dutton and Painter; Hulley et al.). The 'Inability to Separate' factor delves into the specific challenges individuals encounter when contemplating leaving an abusive relationship. The term 'inability' is used not to imply a literal lack of agency, but rather to highlight the perceived emotional incapacitation to separate, a core characteristic of the condition of IPV survivors (Anderson and Saunders). The items within this factor, such as 'Breaking up with my partner would make me feel lost' and 'Leaving my partner would break me apart', emphasize the profound emotional and psychological impact associated with the idea of separation. The third factor, 'Partner Abuse', explores the impact of the abusive partner's behaviour on the victim's emotional state. Items like 'My partner devalues me' and 'My partner makes me feel as if I am mistaken' reflect the detrimental aspects of the partner's actions. This factor shows the centrality of the partner's abusive, mistreating and manipulative behaviours in shaping the overall experience of PAD (Pico‐Alfonso et al.).

### Wise reasoning, intergroup positivity, and attitude polarization across contexts [^632ba7d8]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Wise reasoning theoretically enables people to solve challenges pragmatically because it goes beyond self-centered cognitions, adding deeper reflection on complex circumstances and a bigger picture orientation to provide a better understanding of situations. In so doing, it may temper biased responses to social challenges (e.g. stereotypes; gut reactions against outgroups) with less skewed and more nuanced information (e.g. individuating information; shared humanity between groups). As such, in intergroup contexts wise reasoning may afford more positivity (or less extreme negativity) toward outgroups and less attitude polarization. Indeed, recent studies have shown that wise reasoning has an adaptive influence on important outcomes such as prosocial behavior (e.g. cooperation in public goods games), cognitive biases (e.g. bias blindspot), and balanced attributions toward others in personal conflicts. Further wise reasoning is strengthened via moral and interdependent motivations.

Although explicit use of the term "wise reasoning" in reference to the integration of wisdom-based reasoning processes is relatively recent, research has suggested its importance indirectly via reference to some of its individual dimensions. For instance, inducing people to recognize, reappraise, and challenge their own habitual thoughts and emotions, whether through lab experiments or through field experiences. is a process of epistemic humility that can reduce intergroup biases. Similarly, the conflict management literature has speculated on the importance of "going to the balcony" (observer's viewpoint), a process of contextualism, and "stepping to the other side" (perspective taking), a process of perspectivism, for resolving conflicts. However, the positive effects of these processes individually may not generalize broadly when taken apart from the integrated wise reasoning process. Perspective taking alone, for example, can vary in effectiveness depending on region or cultureand it can improve dominant groups' attitudes toward disadvantaged groups but not vice-versa. The process itself can be egocentrically biased – or used for intentionally selfish or malicious aims. In contrast, because wise reasoning is an integrative, self-decentering process, we speculated that it would show more consistency and broad generalizability, showing an inverse relationship with intergroup bias if and when engaged, despite differences in culture, group membership, or status.

### Guidelines for assessment of and intervention with persons with disabilities [^d43d201f]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Guideline 6 — psychologists strive to use appropriate language and respectful behavior toward individuals with disabilities — emphasizes that psychologists are expected to strive for "accurate, unbiased communication" and must "not knowingly engage in behavior that is harassing or demeaning." The text cautions that excessively positive language (e.g., "heroic," "despite his disability," or "overcoming disability") or excessively negative language (e.g., "afflicted with," "suffering from," "confined to wheelchair," or "wheelchair bound") is problematic because these terms reinforce stereotypes rather than focus on the individual, and notes that euphemisms are equally problematic as they diminish the disability itself and perpetuate the stereotype that disability should be avoided or not talked about. The use of person-first language (putting the person first, as in person with disability) has been repeatedly endorsed to reduce stigma and bias, while recognizing that language is not a static concept, it evolves over time as cultural awareness and attitudes shift, and that disabled psychologists have promoted the use of identity-first language. The page also reports that others have recently recommended the interchangeable use of person-first and identity-first language, and that some individuals with disabilities have used what traditionally would be viewed as negative terminology to refer to themselves within their disability subculture.

### Communicating science, not magic [^bcc836dd]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Common communication styles about psychological theories and interventions

Colloquial terms

Terms used to describe psychological concepts often carry lay connotations that differ from their scientific definitions. Terms such as "mindset" and "wise" invoke a sense of familiarity and an intuitive — but not necessarily accurate — understanding of their meaning. For example, within mindset theory, "mindset" usually refers to one's belief about the changeability of a human attribute — someone with a "growth mindset" holds that traits are malleable, whereas someone with a "fixed mindset" holds that traits are relatively stable. In contrast, outside of mindset theory, "mindset" usually refers to a way of thinking or a set of attitudes. Before "growth" and "fixed" entered the collective vocabulary, mindset was frequently preceded with "positive" — i.e. to have a positive mindset. Critically, "mindset" is still used with its original meaning. When someone first encounters mindset as a research concept or an intervention, the idea may seem familiar because people already know the word "mindset." Familiarity leads to fluency, which leads to signals of credibility and acceptance without scrutiny.

Likewise, the word "wise" has had positive associations for centuries. Most people understand the word as a description of someone who makes use of substantial experience and knowledge to make good decisions. But in psychological intervention research, a "wise" intervention is one that focuses on how people interpret their social situation or themselves — this use of the term has little relation to the lay understanding of the word. As such, people may assume the colloquial connotation that the interventions make use of substantial experience and knowledge. Again, the intuitive, familiar term with positive connotations disinvites scrutiny. Stated differently, a "wise" intervention sounds like something everyone should do, whereas a "subjective construal" or even a "situation interpretation" intervention may invite additional questions.

Examples other than "mindset" and "wise" include "deliberate practice," "mindfulness," and "grit." The use of these terms is likely to invoke a sense of credibility and acceptance over scrutiny and contemplation. This, in turn, increases the risk of misunderstandings.

### When parents take conflicts to digital media [^23dd0342]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Over the past decade, there have been numerous cases around the world in which parents have used digital media to orchestrate public opposition to doctors' recommendations. Parents are not always "successful" with such efforts; these cases have mixed outcomes and, sometimes, unintended consequences for parents. In this article, we address the current lack of understanding of parents' goals, motivations, and rationalizations in initiating such campaigns. We analyze 12 cases in which parental digital media campaigns went viral that occurred between 2007 and 2018, with the aim of better understanding parents' motivations for going public. We identify 7 themes raised by parent-initiated digital media campaigns: (1) changing doctors' minds, (2) being heard, (3) feeling empowered, (4) buying more time, (5) raising public awareness, (6) feeling that they have done everything possible, and (7) financial gain. Greater attunement to these themes and what is driving parents in such conflicts may help to disrupt the highly adversarial narrative surrounding such cases. It may also inform how clinicians approach disagreements that cross a certain threshold of public interest at the bedside.

### Conceptualisations of good care and conflicts in live-in migrant care arrangements for people with dementia-perspectives of family caregivers in Germany [^9e528dee]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Allowing closeness and creating space for emotions

Certain communicative skills of the live-in carers favour the quality and stability of the arrangement. The basis is an attitude of understanding, kindness, respect, recognition and closeness. Emotions are described as very important in dealing with the person with dementia, and relationships between the live-in and the person with dementia that are characterised by mutual closeness have a stabilising effect on the entire arrangement:

"She [person with dementia] got along best with those who were very close to her, who also sought this emotional connection. For her it was hard when someone kept a distance and said "I am the carer and that's as far as it goes and no further". (Group 4)

If the chemistry is right, live-in carers and the person with dementia form a close bond, which is sensitively communicated within the framework of non-verbal and emotional signs and can defuse challenging behaviours such as aggression or agitation.

Family caregivers also attribute good care to the management of medication or the possibility of reducing it due to the situation being pacified by a live-in carer:

"I noticed when she spent a whole day in day care, she never got that attention. That's when she got restless and started moving about a lot, that's when she needed things to play with in her hands and stuff. And as soon as she came home, with the live-in carer, she was calm. We didn't need any medication then either. In day care, we always needed medication to calm her down. And then she was still totally agitated when she came back home." (Group 2).

Perceived conflicts

The conceptualisations of good dementia live-in care give rise to conflicts when corresponding expectations are not met. The decision for live-in care is made in the face of a perceived lack of alternatives in view of the nursing home scenario and a lack of community-based structures and resources. It requires an adaptation process and negotiation process within the family to gain readiness to accept the risk of live-in care and a stranger in the home. In the course of this process, family caregivers intensively deal with their role, their possibilities and priorities. In this area of tension conflicts arise on a regular basis. Reasons and triggers for these conflicts are described below in three subcategories.

### APA multicultural guidelines executive summary: ecological approach to context, identity, and intersectionality [^476f590c]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

APA Multicultural Guidelines — consultation considerations — psychologists are encouraged to recognize the multiple and often unique factors underlying how well individuals thrive and meet goals during different stages of the life course, noting that "invisible intersectionality" refers to the fact that often the various identities of an individual are not readily discernible to an uninformed observer, and that intersectionality may create ambiguity for an individual when encountering prejudicial and discriminatory behavior, since it may be unclear which identities are eliciting the discriminatory behavior; for these reasons the psychologist strives to not take it for granted that problems arise only from the more obvious identity differences and ambiguities.

### Disclosure of interests and management of conflicts of interest in clinical guidelines and guidance statements: methods from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^f33b3a2b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American College of Physicians Clinical Guidelines Committee — Management of conflicts of interest does not use the term "resolution," which would imply the risk is in the past and complete; instead, the committee manages COIs by continually acknowledging, assessing, and managing them over the course of guideline development. The policy assumes disclosure by itself is inadequate to minimize bias; if management begins and ends with disclosure there is a risk for confusion, and without a clear policy implementing conflict management can disrupt the work process and may result in participant stress that hinders compliance, such as discomfort with excluding or partially restricting participants from certain discussion or activities.

### APA multicultural guidelines executive summary: ecological approach to context, identity, and intersectionality [^ed40ce23]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

APA Multicultural Guidelines — Guideline 2 emphasizes that psychologists aspire to recognize and understand that as cultural beings they hold attitudes and beliefs that can influence their perceptions, interactions, and their clinical and empirical conceptualizations, and therefore strive to move beyond conceptualizations rooted in categorical assumptions, biases, and/or formulations based on limited knowledge about individuals and communities.

### Experiences of a transdiagnostic group, the take control course, for clients with common mental health problems: a qualitative study [^31301e94]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Given that enduring higher level conflict is specified as the primary contributor to symptoms of psychological distress, the TCC focuses on enabling "awareness of valued higher‐level goals (and reasons for change); and awareness of higher‐level goal conflict" (Morris, Mansell, & McEvoy, 2016, p. 8). Accordingly, a key reason for using awareness/mindfulness techniques within TCC is enabling clients to develop present moment awareness that can be brought to bear in resolving conflicting goals. Mindfulness techniques are also important within TCC as evidence indicates that they can promote cognitive flexibility (Chiesa, Calati, & Serretti, 2011; Gu, Strauss, Bond, & Cavanagh, 2015; Shapero et al. 2018). Within PCT, flexibility as a cognitive process refers to flexibility of awareness. For example, "flexibility of awareness" would be indicated both by an individual having sufficient cognitive flexibility to be aware of relevant higher level goals and being able to implement these via lower level goals. The two key elements here are a broad awareness of higher level goals (including goals that could potentially conflict) in conjunction with a mobility of awareness, so that an individual does not "get stuck" at higher level abstract goals but is able to implement higher level reorganization using lower level goals (Morris, Mansell, & McEvoy, 2016). Behaviourally, this might be demonstrated by the ability to disengage from patterns of responding that are no longer helpful in meeting an individual's important goals (Morris & Mansell, in press). Varied strands of evidence indicate that mindfulness can enable a broad and mobile awareness that allows access to conflicted goals and distressing experiences. For example, mindfulness techniques can enable observation and tolerance of internal experiences that are uncomfortable or distressing and indicative of conflict (Farb, Anderson, Irving, & Segal, 2014; Lippelt, Hommel, & Colzato, 2014). This allows breadth of awareness, as distressing material is not excluded. Through sustained awareness of such experiences, the individual's perception is likely to become more elaborate and deep‐rooted conflicts more likely to be resolved (Alsawy et al. 2014; Teper, Segal, & Inzlicht, 2013). Further, Teper et al. (2013) have proposed that mindfulness enhances conflict monitoring and allows individuals to remain more open to conflicts: "Thus, mindfulness promotes executive control by enhancing experience of and attention to transient affects — the control alarms — that arise from competing goal tendencies" (Teper et al. 2013, p. 452).

### Zero-sum beliefs and the avoidance of political conversations [^0ad74a9d]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Why do people avoid political conversations? In this work, we examine the avoidance of political conversations in the days and weeks leading up to two highly contested elections in Israel and the U.S. — a time when politics, politicians, and political conversations are clearly top-of-mind, highly salient, and of extreme importance. Specifically, we examine whether seeing politics as zero-sum statistically predicts people's tendency to avoid talking about it with ideologically opposed others. While some issues may, in fact, be zero-sum (e.g. a party that refuses to recognize its counterpart's existence or legitimacy), we argue that that the general tendency to view politics as zero-sum statistically reduces people's willingness to talk about it.

There are various potential reasons for why people may actively avoid engaging in political conversations. For instance, individual differences in the aversion to conflict, people's desire to maintain harmony in their relationships, and individual differences in susceptibility to cognitive phenomena such as the confirmation bias may all lead people to avoid potentially divisive political discussions –. Similarly, contextual factors such as the overall political climate and the perceived intensity of partisan divisions in society may also shape people's avoidance of political conversations –. Indeed, as political debates become increasingly polarized and hostile, people may opt to retreat from engaging in such conversations in order to sidestep potential conflicts and the personal psychological toll that doing so entails. More broadly, sociocultural influences such as one's social networks and community dynamics may similarly play a part in the avoidance of political debates, fostering fear of judgment and alienation from one's peers and colleagues.

### Practicing medicine with colleagues: pitfalls from social psychology science [^848a4c2f]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

This perspective reviews three pitfalls from psychology science that can distort clinical assessments and contribute to interpersonal conflicts. One pitfall is the illusion that one's own subjective perceptions or judgments are objective observations or interpretations that reasonable colleagues would share. A second pitfall involves self-serving situational attributions rather than disposition attributions for explaining missteps after things go wrong. A third pitfall is confirmation bias that leads to a perseverance of erroneous beliefs, a tendency to mostly seek supportive colleagues, and a failure to check for dissenting viewpoints. An awareness of these three pitfalls may help clinicians improve patient care when practicing with colleagues.

### I believe, therefore I do [^2f979426]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The paper by Street and Haidet begins to suggest an explanation for why patient activation might be so powerful. In a clever and elegant study, they measured patient's health beliefs as well as their physician's personal beliefs and perceptions of their patient's health beliefs. These parallel three-way assessments yielded some striking findings. Patients generally were more likely to believe that their disease was their responsibility than their physicians thought and perhaps more importantly, something they could control. Contrary to their physician's perceptions, patients were less likely to endorse a biological cause for their condition. Moreover, physicians seemed to think that their patients were more likely to believe in a biological cause than the physicians themselves, perhaps suggesting that physicians think that patients don't believe they can control their illness. Somewhat surprisingly, physicians who had a longer standing relationship with their patient did not show more accurate perceptions of their patients' beliefs. However, physicians whose patients were more activated — meaning that they asked questions, communicated their concerns and acted assertively in their consultation — had significantly more accurate perceptions of their patients' health beliefs.

The study by Street and Haidet did not address how congruence in patient beliefs and physician perceptions could be related to subsequent adherence and treatment outcomes. But 40 years of theoretical and applied work on health behavior gives some guidance. Several prominent health behavior theories identify beliefs as the key underlying construct that drives people's behavior. Fishbein and Ajzen's Reasoned Action Approach to health behavior provides a detailed explication of the link between beliefs and behavior. This theory has been successfully applied to countless interventions aimed at changing a wide range of health behaviors. According to the Reasoned Action Approach, a behavior is likely to occur if a person has formed an intention to do so. If one doesn't already have an intention to perform a given behavior, the intention can be predicted by measuring the person's attitudes, perceived normative pressure and self-efficacy about engaging in the behavior. Underlying these constructs are the patients beliefs about their outcomes expectancies, normative and efficacy beliefs. Although much of this cognitive process is often unconscious, if made conscious, one could articulate the following questions from the patient's point of view: (1) what are the advantages and disadvantages of taking this new therapy?, (2) do others who are important to me or like me think that I should or should not take this new therapy?, and (3) what might help me or stop me from taking this new therapy?

### Guidelines for prevention in psychology [^1221739c]. The American Psychologist (2014). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for Prevention in Psychology — purpose and definitions emphasize that guidelines are "statements that suggest or recommend specific professional behavior, endeavors, or conduct for psychologists" and "are not intended to be mandatory or exhaustive and may not be applicable to every professional and clinical situation"; they "are not definitive and they are not intended to take precedence over the judgment of psychologists" and are intended to "inform psychologists, the public, and other interested parties regarding desirable professional practices" in prevention. The document states that the Guidelines are "consistent with federal and state laws and regulations" and that "in the event of a conflict between the Guidelines and any state or federal law or regulation, the law or regulation in question supersedes these Guidelines." Prevention is conceptualized as including "stopping a problem behavior from ever occurring," "delaying the onset of a problem behavior," "reducing the impact of a problem behavior," "strengthening knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors that promote emotional and physical well-being," and "promoting institutional, community, and government policies that further physical, social, and emotional well-being of the larger community." The document notes that "the terms prevention, preventive intervention(s), preventive program(s), and preventive services are used," that "The Prevention Guidelines are recommended based on their potential benefits to the public and professional psychologists," and that "The Guidelines provide added visibility to the importance of prevention across professional practice areas and among the public," including "encouraging psychologists to become involved with preventive activities relevant to their area of practice."

### Why misinformation must not be ignored [^1a88cb7b]. The American Psychologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent academic debate has seen the emergence of the claim that misinformation is not a significant societal problem. We argue that the arguments used to support this minimizing position are flawed, particularly if interpreted (e.g., by policymakers or the public) as suggesting that misinformation can be safely ignored. Here, we rebut the two main claims, namely that misinformation is not of substantive concern (a) due to its low incidence and (b) because it has no causal influence on notable political or behavioral outcomes. Through a critical review of the current literature, we demonstrate that (a) the prevalence of misinformation is nonnegligible if reasonably inclusive definitions are applied and that (b) misinformation has causal impacts on important beliefs and behaviors. Both scholars and policymakers should therefore continue to take misinformation seriously. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved).

### Tolerance to ambiguous uncertainty predicts prosocial behavior [^3f136f3a]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Empirical research, however, has failed to find a relationship between attitudes toward risk and prosocial behavior, such as decisions to trust. This may be because assessing whether an individual is trustworthy — or cooperative, generous, or kind — is more analogous to estimating unknown probabilistic outcomes, as it is rare to know with probabilistic certainty how another's actions will unfold. In other words, it becomes difficult to estimate another's behavior when intentions and motives are hidden. This inability to apply known probabilities to a set of outcomes further affects the actions an individual might subsequently take, rendering social exchanges rife with ambiguous uncertainty. For these reasons, many social choices are likely to be defined by ambiguous, rather than risky, uncertainty. And yet, research exploring the effects of uncertainty on social decision-making has focused on the psychological construct of risk, while failing to consider the dimension of ambiguity. Thus, one critical question that has received little attention is how ambiguity attitudes shape prosocial decision-making.

### Tolerance to ambiguous uncertainty predicts prosocial behavior [^49e515ae]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Uncertainty is a fundamental feature of human life that can be fractioned into two distinct psychological constructs: risk (known probabilistic outcomes) and ambiguity (unknown probabilistic outcomes). Although risk and ambiguity are known to powerfully bias nonsocial decision-making, their influence on prosocial behavior remains largely unexplored. Here we show that ambiguity attitudes, but not risk attitudes, predict prosocial behavior: the greater an individual's ambiguity tolerance, the more they engage in costly prosocial behaviors, both during decisions to cooperate (experiments 1 and 3) and choices to trust (experiment 2). Once the ambiguity associated with another's actions is sufficiently resolved, this relationship between ambiguity tolerance and prosocial choice is eliminated (experiment 3). Taken together, these results provide converging evidence that attitudes toward ambiguity are a robust predictor of one's willingness to engage in costly social behavior, which suggests a mechanism for the underlying motivations of prosocial action.

### An overview of survey research [^e39186e7]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Surveys provide evidence for the social sciences for knowledge, attitudes, and other behaviors, and, in health care, to quantify qualitative research and to assist in policymaking. A survey-designed research project is about asking questions of individuals, and, from the answers, the researcher can generalize the findings from a sample of respondents to a population. Therefore, this overview can serve as a guide to conducting survey research that can provide answers for practitioners, educators, and leaders, but only if the right questions and methods are used. The main advantage of using surveys is their economical access to participants online. A major disadvantage of survey research is the low response rates in most situations. Online surveys have many limitations that should be expected before conducting a search, and then described after the survey is complete. Any conclusions and recommendations are to be supported by evidence in a clear and objective manner. Presenting evidence in a structured format is crucial but well-developed reporting guidelines are needed for researchers who conduct survey research.

Table 2 — best practices for respectful documentation emphasize replacing negative or stigmatizing terms with descriptive, person-centered language and state clear rationales. For medical care engagement, avoid "Nonadherent or noncompliant with medication," "Refuse or resist treatment," and "Frequent-flyer," and use "Factual descriptors of patient behavior" such as "Discontinued medication," "Declines or does not tolerate treatment," or "Seen recently or Last seen," because "Directly describing patient behavior offers a nonjudgmental opportunity to understand why the patient is presenting with these behaviors." For patient characteristics or behavior, avoid "Difficult patient, unpleasant," "Aggressive, angry, challenging, defensive," or "Exaggerate, hysterical," and either "Omit these descriptors entirely, or consider documenting the underlying cause of a behavior, if known," such as "Prior negative experiences with health care" or "Concern that symptoms will not be taken seriously"; rationale: "Negative patient descriptors can predispose other medical professionals to have a negative perception of the patient's health condition and potentially to formulate a less aggressive management plan*." For stigmatized health conditions, avoid essentializing labels like "Drug user, addict" or "Mentally ill person, schizophrenic" and use "Person-first language to humanize and de-stigmatize" such as "Person with a substance use disorder" or "Person with a mental health disorder," because "Using person-centered, strengths-based, and nonstigmatizing language promotes respect and can increase support and empowerment for patients‡."

### Using theories of behavior change to develop interventions for healthy aging [^01810ec7]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2021). Medium credibility.

Healthy aging requires people to adopt and maintain beneficial behaviors in all stages of the life span. Supporting behavior change, including via the motivation to make and maintain those changes, is therefore important for the promotion of healthy aging. The aim of this overview is to introduce theoretical frameworks from the psychology of motivation that lend themselves to the development of effective interventions promoting behavior change conducive to healthy aging. We discuss theoretical frameworks referring to the determinants, properties, and functionality of goals aimed at behavior change, and consider the implications of the various theories for designing interventions to support healthy aging. We first consider theories that focus on beliefs and attitudes as determinants of goals, then we address theories that focus on the structure and content as important properties of goals, and, finally, we examine theories drawing on conscious and nonconscious processes underlying the functionality of these goals. We will present if-then planning and mental contrasting, as well as nudging and boosting, that is, novel strategies of behavior change that support the creation of scalable interventions for healthy aging across the life span. Against this background, new perspectives emerge for modern, state-of-the-art, and individually tailored interventions with the aim of enhancing older people's healthy living.

### Determining whether a patient is feeling better: pitfalls from the science of human perception [^02032fd3]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Human perception is fallible and may lead patients to be inaccurate when judging whether their symptoms are improving with treatment. This article provides a narrative review of studies in psychology that describe misconceptions related to a patient's comprehension, recall, evaluation and expression. The specific misconceptions include the power of suggestion (placebo effects), desire for peace-of-mind (cognitive dissonance reduction), inconsistent standards (loss aversion), a flawed sense of time (duration neglect), limited perception (measurement error), declining sensitivity (Weber's law), an eagerness to please (social desirability bias), and subtle affirmation (personal control). An awareness of specific pitfalls might help clinicians avoid some mistakes when providing follow-up and interpreting changes in patient symptoms.

### Motivated misremembering of selfish decisions [^af4654dd]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Humans tend to see themselves as fair and honest, and often behave accordingly. Yet some are tempted to stray from such ideals when they can get away with it –. This suggests that, at least in some cases, people prioritize appearing moral to themselves and others over truly aligning their actions with moral principles –. This seems to be an effective strategy as well. Maintaining a positive moral self-image not only bolsters psychological well-being and physical health –, but also yields downstream social benefits. Individuals who appear committed to moral rules are viewed as more attractive social partners, — and one dependable strategy for convincing others of one's morality is to first convince oneself of it.

How can people preserve their moral self-image while simultaneously behaving selfishly? Social scientists have often credited our ability to engage in motivated reasoning — that is, we form self-serving beliefs and attitudes to justify immoral acts to ourselves before or after the events unfold. This feat is accomplished in a number of ways. For one, people tend to strike a justifiable balance between self-interest and their moral values — for instance, lying just enough to profit financially, but not so much as to harm their moral self-image. In addition, people psychologically distance themselves from their unethical actions — attributing past misdeeds to situational pressures, or having been a "different person" at the time. Moreover, people exploit uncertainty — behaving more selfishly when the consequences for others are ambiguous, making self-serving mistakes, and avoiding information about how their actions may have harmed others. A common thread in each of these self-serving strategies is that they operate over abstract beliefs and attitudes.

### Value computations underpin flexible emotion expression [^2cd280ab]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Emotion expressions are inherently social, and exert a powerful influence on others' behavior –. By efficiently communicating one's evaluations of their environment –, emotion expressions serve important functions in coordinating and regulating people's social lives — facilitating social relationships, deterring social transgressions, and eliciting prosocial behavior –. These adaptive socio-communicative functions of emotion expressions have been so thoroughly documented that researchers posit evolutionary pressures may have hard-wired human physiology to produce outward-facing expressions of internally-felt emotion.

Yet, if communicating emotion is so valuable, why do people so often suppress their emotions –, or express emotions they do not genuinely feel –? Implicit in the tension between these observations is that despite furnishing communicative benefits, veridically expressing felt emotions (particularly negative ones) sometimes incurs costs to the expresser –. What precisely these costs are, where they come from, and how people consider them when deciding whether to express, suppress, or exaggerate/fake their emotions remain poorly understood, in part because it can be difficult to precisely quantify the calculations people make in such decisions. For example, what specific calculations do people make when deciding whether to express or suppress anger? When, why, and how might people mask anger with sadness, or exaggerate positive emotions they do not feel? Answering these questions would not only advance our understanding of fundamental socio-psychological processes, but also provide insight into how persistent patterns of expressive behavior might disrupt interpersonal processes and exacerbate personal, organizational, and societal ill-being.

### Intuitions, principles and consequences [^8f27e0b2]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

Some approaches to the assessment of moral intuitions are discussed. The controlled ethical trial isolates a moral issue from confounding factors and thereby clarifies what a person's intuition actually is. Casuistic reasoning from situations, where intuitions are clear, suggests or modifies principles, which can then help to make decisions in situations where intuitions are unclear. When intuitions are defended by a supporting principle, that principle can be tested by finding extreme cases, in which it is counterintuitive to follow the principle. An approach to the resolution of conflict between valid moral principles, specifically the utilitarian and justice principles, is considered. It is argued that even those who justify intuitions by a priori principles are often obliged to modify or support their principles by resort to the consideration of consequences.

### Factual knowledge can reduce attitude polarization [^2563a976]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In contrast to the motivated reasoning claim, we argue it is far from obvious that factual knowledge causally increases attitude polarization. In fact, there seem to be good theoretical and empirical reasons to expect the opposite. Recent research suggests that human reasoning is "meaningfully directed toward the formation of accurate, rather than merely identity-confirming, beliefs" (ref.p. 2525) and that individuals act as Bayesian learners who incorporate new information into their evaluations of the political and social environment. Consistent with this view, a growing number of empirical studies have uncovered evidence that people update their political attitudes and beliefs in line with evidence (e.g. refs.–) and arguments, presented to them. Building on this line of work, we test the pre-registered hypothesis that learning facts about a contentious political issue has a causal depolarizing effect on political attitudes. We predict that when people are presented with a credible and politically diverse set of facts on an issue and are sufficiently incentivized to learn that content, they learn that there are valid considerations on both sides of the debate. This, in turn, results in the adoption of less extreme attitudes.

### The dragons of inaction: psychological barriers that limit climate change mitigation and adaptation [^fae71421]. The American Psychologist (2011). Low credibility.

Most people think climate change and sustainability are important problems, but too few global citizens engaged in high-greenhouse-gas-emitting behavior are engaged in enough mitigating behavior to stem the increasing flow of greenhouse gases and other environmental problems. Why is that? Structural barriers such as a climate-averse infrastructure are part of the answer, but psychological barriers also impede behavioral choices that would facilitate mitigation, adaptation, and environmental sustainability. Although many individuals are engaged in some ameliorative action, most could do more, but they are hindered by seven categories of psychological barriers, or "dragons of inaction": limited cognition about the problem, ideological world views that tend to preclude pro-environmental attitudes and behavior, comparisons with key other people, sunk costs and behavioral momentum, discredence toward experts and authorities, perceived risks of change, and positive but inadequate behavior change. Structural barriers must be removed wherever possible, but this is unlikely to be sufficient. Psychologists must work with other scientists, technical experts, and policymakers to help citizens overcome these psychological barriers.

### What is the state of the evidence on the mind-cancer survival question, and where do we go from here? A point of view [^7f8b7a72]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Goals Of Work

There is long history of anecdote and surmise linking psychosocial factors to cancer incidence and survival. However, over the past three decades, an increasing number of rigorous studies have investigated the possibility of a mind-cancer survival connection. The objective of this paper is (1) to review the past 30 years of psycho-oncology research on the mind-cancer survival question, (2) to review the methodological debate and interpretations of the research findings, and (3) to consider future research directions.

Main Results

Over the past three decades, a small number of studies have been published. Some observational and quasi-experimental studies suggest the possibility that coping and psychological factors may influence disease outcomes, but clinical trials suggest that psychosocial interventions do not prolong survival. Methodological comment and interpretation about the significance of these trials vary. Some researchers view the mind-cancer survival question as resolved and negative, whereas others identify conceptual and methodological challenges and view the possible impact of psychosocial factors on survival as simply unproven. We take the position that the question is unanswered.

Conclusion

Recommended future research directions include: (1) more trials based on testable theories, targeted interventions, and greater specificity in the measurement model and (2) new research questions and more rigorous observational, prospective, and longitudinal studies, case studies, mixed methods, and innovative design approaches being developed by complementary and alternative medicine researchers. Further research is warranted on the mind-cancer survival question.

### Cognitive debiasing 2: impediments to and strategies for change [^c5a47726]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2013). Medium credibility.

Clinicians must be informed and recognise the need for constant vigilance and surveillance of their thinking to mitigate diagnostic and other clinical errors. There is an ongoing imperative to self-monitor for bias and especially to be mindful of faulty decision making at vulnerable times, and for the risk of excessive reliance on intuitive judgements when further reflection is required. This is captured in a current definition of critical thinking: 'the ability to engage in purposeful, self-regulatory judgment'. This paper has reviewed a rich variety of cognitive debiasing initiatives from social science and clinical medicine. Given recent advances in the understanding of clinical decision making, the time appears ripe for renewed research effort and we hope these two papers will provoke such effort.

This becomes even more challenging if one considers that biases tend to act unconsciously. A general problem with debiasing, as Horton notes, is that 'the same kinds of biases that distort our thinking in general also distort our thinking about the biases themselves'. Indeed, many biases are applied unconsciously, and if physicians are unaware of them, they will have difficulty recognising the need for debiasing. Clinicians themselves may be just as vulnerable as their patients to a number of psychological factors that might compromise decision making. Nevertheless, the topic has attracted considerable interest and effort, reflecting a widespread perception of the need for solutions to the vulnerability of human reasoning.

### Psychologists should study basic social cognition processes within the context of sexual interactions [^becedf49]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Understanding others

In interpersonal interactions, understanding the partner's perspective, inferring their motives and objectives, and predicting what they are planning to do are key components of a smooth and pleasant interaction. In the sexual context, being attuned to the other's needs, emotions, and desires has further important implications for sexual and relationship satisfaction. Emotion perception and perspective-taking (as well as other terms such as mentalization, cognitive empathy, empathic accuracy, and affective Theory of Mind,) are terms that have been used in past research to study people's ability to recognize and understand emotional or mental states, from verbal and nonverbal expressions, within a certain context or as a personality tendency.

Despite the essential role that an accurate interpretation of others' mental states plays in social interactions, individuals are often biased in how they judge other people's emotional expressions, perspectives, and intentions. One of the most theory-driven consistent findings in the literature is that people's judgments of other people's mental states are anchored in their own mental state, a phenomenon coined egocentric bias. Very briefly, whereas considering one's own perspective is an automatic, effortless process, taking the perspective of another requires cognitive resources and effort. The more incongruent the two perspectives are, the more difficult and less likely it is for one to take the other's perspective, or to judge the other's emotional expression as expressing a different emotion from one's own. The egocentric bias may have major implications when one is trying to decipher the mental state of their partner in a sexual interaction. This is especially the case because most cues in such interactions are nonverbal cues –, which can be further accompanied by a high level of uncertainty, which in turn increases egocentrism in perspective-taking. The individual's egocentric assumption might be that their partner desires the interaction as much as they do. This assumption in turn might lead the individual to interpret ambiguous expressions of the partner as reflecting a state more similar to their own. In addition to the egocentric bias, the confirmation bias may also affect one's judgment. If an individual believes that their partner desires the interaction, they might only attend to cues that support this belief, and miss cues that contradict it, such as the partner's ambivalent expressions (a similar, but more specific concept, is the concept of positive illusions in close relationships, where individuals see their partners more positively than their partners see themselves). The odds of an individual accurately understanding the mental state of another might decrease even more if they are unaware of potential considerations that can highly influence their partner. For instance, in heterosexual relationships, men might not be aware that women sometimes consent to sexual interactions because they feel they are expected to.

### When should patient intuition be taken seriously? [^e7cfaeec]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

As a style of information processing, intuition involves implicit perceptual and cognitive processes that can be quickly and automatically executed without conscious mental will, such that people know more than they can describe. Patient intuition can influence patient and clinician decision-making and behavior. However, physicians may not always see patient intuition as credible or important, and its management in the clinical setting is poorly understood. This paper takes a step toward suggesting conditions under which patient intuition should be taken seriously. These conditions relate to the credibility or accuracy of the intuitive beliefs held by the patient, and their significance to the patient. Credibility may be increased when the intuitions of patients (1) reflect their individualized knowledge, (2) can complement the common absence of scientific evidence in managing health problems, and (3) can quickly and effectively process key information in complex cognitive tasks. Even intuitions that lack credibility can be subjectively rational and meaningful to patients, and help to shape the decisions they and clinicians make.

Experiential knowledge in critical care decision making — experiential knowledge gained through clinical practice is described as both necessary and fallible, distinct from knowledge derived from clinical research, and reliance on it is vulnerable to biases and does not guarantee expertise; no single type of medical knowledge is sufficient for clinical decision making, so clinicians ideally incorporate all available and relevant medical knowledge, while recognizing that different kinds may produce incomplete, inconsistent, or conflicting support for clinical decisions, creating difficulty and controversy.

### Confidence drives a neural confirmation bias [^38778544]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

A prominent source of polarised and entrenched beliefs is confirmation bias, where evidence against one's position is selectively disregarded. This effect is most starkly evident when opposing parties are highly confident in their decisions. Here we combine human magnetoencephalography (MEG) with behavioural and neural modelling to identify alterations in post-decisional processing that contribute to the phenomenon of confirmation bias. We show that holding high confidence in a decision leads to a striking modulation of post-decision neural processing, such that integration of confirmatory evidence is amplified while disconfirmatory evidence processing is abolished. We conclude that confidence shapes a selective neural gating for choice-consistent information, reducing the likelihood of changes of mind on the basis of new information. A central role for confidence in shaping the fidelity of evidence accumulation indicates that metacognitive interventions may help ameliorate this pervasive cognitive bias.

### Professional practice guidelines for operational psychology: an executive summary [^fb02cc7c]. The American Psychologist (2025). High credibility.

Guideline 3 — operational psychologists make reasonable efforts to consider the legal, regulatory, and scientific, bases of their work while taking care to respect the rights of affected parties. They strive to safeguard the rights of all affected parties and avoid participating in practices that are illegal or unjust or that violate the rights of others. To balance potentially competing interests, they seek to balance these interests by adhering to legal, regulatory, and ethical requirements; using reliable data collection procedures that are the least invasive necessary for meeting client demands; restricting reports to data that are relevant and reliable; and describing as necessary the bases and limitations of their procedures, findings, and opinions. In occupationally mandated assessments, they first consider laws, policies, and regulations that dictate assessment parameters, including subjects' rights to refuse participation, relevant areas of psychological inquiry, and criteria that establish fitness for duty, and they use multiple sources and methods to gather relevant data while keeping in mind informed consent and release of information concerns. Although they may not function as ultimate decision-makers, their opinions may be given substantial weight, and to the fullest extent possible they recognize that this work may inform rather than dictate courses of action. In unusual circumstances when ethical responsibilities may conflict with organizational demands, perceived societal needs, human rights, or legal or regulatory authorities, they seek to clarify the nature of the conflict, make known their commitment to the EPPCC, seek consultation from peers when available, and take reasonable steps to resolve the conflict in a responsible manner that is consistent with the EPPCC and avoids or minimizes harm. When organizational activities that violate human rights are identified, they seek to document and report such findings through appropriate channels, first trying to resolve ethical matters informally when appropriate, then, when violations have substantially harmed or are likely to substantially harm a person or organization, taking care to resolve ethical matters formally through appropriate channels; they also refer legal matters to appropriate legal authorities as required and consider withdrawal or removal of their support from the project or activity accordingly.

### Guidelines for assessment of and intervention with persons with disabilities [^5d025a51]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Disability cultural competence in psychological practice — common biases, workforce representation, and corrective actions — are detailed, noting limited representation and access as follows: "leaving individuals with disabilities overwhelmingly without access to providers who share the lived experience of disability" and "approximately 3% of psychology graduate students and 2% of faculty in APA-accredited programs report having a disability," while cognitive errors include "A psychologist may misattribute a psychological characteristic to having a disability" and the "example of diagnosis overshadowing" wherein "psychologists tend to believe problems… are attributable to their disability as opposed to psychological conditions." Additional pitfalls include that "psychologists may under-emphasize disability-related concerns, or even assume clients use their disabilities as an excuse to avoid specific actions," with countertransference highlighted as "psychologists need to address countertransference issues." The text also cautions that "Psychologists may assume that people with cognitive impairments or intellectual disabilities are unable to speak on their own behalf; therefore, they are incapable of exercising control over their own lives and are incompetent to make their own treatment-related decisions," and that "Lack of familiarity with disability may influence how a psychologist perceives and responds to the client's emotional expression." To address bias and improve care, it specifies: "Two recommended actions psychologists may take to address biases, faulty assumptions, and negative emotional reactions are (1) self-examination and (2) increasing cultural understanding, including learning about disability-related issues," alongside practical steps that explicitly state, "Acknowledge that beliefs, attitudes, and values may be held that differ from the client and may have the potential to be deleterious to rapport building, clinical decision-making, and delivery of clinical services," "Examine preconceptions, beliefs, and emotional reactions toward persons with disabilities," "Consider ableist views that might underpin attitudes and reactions," "The development of attitudes is typically an insidious process," "Consider how disability-related and life experiences, separately or together, may be related to the client's current psychological issues," and "Assess the client's strengths and weaknesses and incorporate them into interventions."

### Trauma-informed care [^e86dc437]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Engagement — trauma-informed care (TIC) with children, adolescents, and families emphasizes creating a respectful and emotionally safe space to prevent retraumatization and reassure that the setting is safe, with mutual regard and clear roles for providers and families. Engagement begins with greeting and being fully present, asking open-ended then more specific questions elicited by caregiver or child responses, and listening in an active, nonjudgmental, attuned way that includes reflecting, clarifying, paraphrasing, attending to emotions, and summarizing; implicit bias can affect nonjudgmental stance while acceptance, curiosity, and empathy support attentive listening. Adolescents and capable children bring their own perspective, and while the provider has expertise in medicine, the patient and family have expertise about the child, what happened, and their situation, beliefs, strengths, and culture. When working with families and patients who have experienced trauma, the provider's body language, affect, and tone of voice can promote or inhibit care; approaching children slowly and calmly or letting them sit with a caregiver and using higher pitched, more musical speech may ease tension via associations with oxytocin in the amygdala, whereas a shift to low tones may alert to potential danger and stimulate defensive responses.

### Surveys: an introduction [^18c7b4f6]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

Surveys are a valuable research tool for studying the knowledge, attitudes, and behavior of a study population. This article explores quantitative analyses of written questionnaires as instruments for survey research. Obtaining accurate and precise information from a survey requires minimizing the possibility of bias from inappropriate sampling or a flawed survey instrument, and this article describes strategies to minimize sampling bias by increasing response rates, comparing responders to nonresponders, and identifying the appropriate sampling population. It is crucial that the survey instrument be valid, meaning that it actually measures what the investigator intends it to measure. In developing a valid survey instrument, it can be useful to adapt survey instruments that were developed by other researchers and to conduct extensive pilot-testing of your survey instrument.

### Disclosure of interests and management of conflicts of interest in clinical guidelines and guidance statements: methods from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^9b549ba4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American College of Physicians Clinical Guidelines Committee — Moderate-level conflicts of interest most frequently represent an intellectual interest that is clinically relevant to the guideline topic; such previously formed conclusions may leave a clinical guideline vulnerable to cognitive biases and may result in indirect financial benefit related to career advancement. Cognitive biases of particular concern include confirmation bias and authority bias, and the committee states it is appropriate and necessary to document and assess intellectual interests. Moderate-level COIs may also signify the potential for an individual or entity to create professional advantages or financial profit based on an association with the development of a clinical guideline rather than its specific conclusions.

### Factual knowledge can reduce attitude polarization [^2fd170b3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

It is commonly argued that factual knowledge about a political issue increases attitude polarization due to politically motivated reasoning. By this account, individuals ignore counter-attitudinal facts and direct their attention to pro-attitudinal facts; reject counter-attitudinal facts when directly confronted with them; and use pro-attitudinal facts to counterargue, all making them more polarized. The observation that more knowledgeable partisans are often more polarized is widely taken as support for this account. Yet these data are only correlational. Here, we directly test the causal effect of increasing issue-relevant knowledge on attitude polarization. Specifically, we randomize whether N = 1,011 participants receive a large, credible set of both pro- and counter-attitudinal facts on a contentious political issue - gun control - and provide a modest incentive for them to learn this information. We find evidence that people are willing to engage with and learn policy-relevant facts both for and against their initial attitudes; and that this increased factual knowledge shifts individuals towards more moderate policy attitudes, a durable effect that is still visible after one month. Our results suggest that the impact of directionally motivated reasoning on the processing of political information might be more limited than previously thought.

### Forced to be free? Increasing patient autonomy by constraining it [^3020eaaa]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2014). Low credibility.

The simplest way to avoid these costs, it might be thought, is by ensuring that patients are given the chance to reassess their decisions. We may think that though patients may initially be overwhelmed by the stress of the decision facing them, if we allow them to reflect again, perhaps over the course of several days (when this is practicable) and change their minds, they will be able to avoid some of these pathologies. Indeed, this kind of strategy may be a part of the solution to the problems outlined above, but there is reason to think that it will be of limited usefulness by itself. There is a large literature on what happens to our judgements after we have made a decision. As a consequence of making the decision, our attitudes to the alternatives change: we come to think the option we have chosen is far superior to the options we have rejected. The relevant mechanism here seems to be cognitive dissonance: because we are aware of the attractive features of those options we have decided not to pursue, we experience dissonance, and dissonance can be resolved by changing our judgements. This phenomenon is known as the spreading of alternatives: alternatives that were initially thought of more or less equal (or at any rate, not very dissimilar) value come to be thought as very unequal after one is chosen. We tend to come to see the option we have chosen as very much better than those we have rejected. Lieberman et al showed that the spreading of alternatives does not require that subjects recall the option chosen. This evidence suggests that if patients do not change their minds about their initial judgements, this may not be because the initial judgement was the one that was really most in accord with their values.

### Asking a question: linking evidence with practice [^36b2bc29]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

For clinicians and researchers alike, a clear and answerable question is the starting line of the evidence-based practice process. For clinicians, the question captures the patient and defines the information needed to treat this patient. For researchers, the question directs study design and drives everything from recruitment to reporting. The question is also the anchor point that links clinical practice to research. Engaging in evidence-based practice forces a subconscious process that occurs during assessment of the patient into the conscious mind and makes it explicit. Clearly and concisely defining the question leads directly to the search for relevant research. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2018;48(7):596–597. doi:10.2519/jospt.2018.0702.

### Choosing wisely in clinical practice: embracing critical thinking, striving for safer care [^c50540dd]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In recent years, the Choosing Wisely and Less is More campaigns have gained growing attention in the medical scientific community. Several projects have been launched to facilitate confrontation among patients and physicians, to achieve better and harmless patient-centered care. Such initiatives have paved the way to a new "way of thinking". Embracing such a philosophy goes through a cognitive process that takes into account several issues. Medicine is a highly inaccurate science and physicians should deal with uncertainty. Evidence from the literature should not be accepted as it is but rather be translated into practice by medical practitioners who select treatment options for specific cases based on the best research, patient preferences, and individual patient characteristics. A wise choice requires active effort into minimizing the chance that potential biases may affect our clinical decisions. Potential harms and all consequences (both direct and indirect) of prescribing tests, procedures, or medications should be carefully evaluated, as well as patients' needs and preferences. Through such a cognitive process, a patient management shift is needed, moving from being centered on establishing a diagnosis towards finding the best management strategy for the right patient at the right time. Finally, while "thinking wisely", physicians should also "act wisely", being among the leading actors in facing upcoming healthcare challenges related to environmental issues and social discrepancies.

### Interventions based on the theory of mind cognitive model for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [^52cab3c7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The 'Theory of Mind' (ToM) model suggests that people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a profound difficulty understanding the minds of other people - their emotions, feelings, beliefs, and thoughts. As an explanation for some of the characteristic social and communication behaviours of people with ASD, this model has had a significant influence on research and practice. It implies that successful interventions to teach ToM could, in turn, have far-reaching effects on behaviours and outcome.

Objectives

To review the efficacy of interventions based on the ToM model for individuals with ASD.

Search Methods

In August 2013 we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, Social Services Abstracts, AutismData, and two trials registers. We also searched the reference lists of relevant papers, contacted authors who work in this field, and handsearched a number of journals.

Selection Criteria

Review studies were selected on the basis that they reported on an applicable intervention (linked to ToM in one of four clearly-defined ways), presented new randomised controlled trial data, and participants had a confirmed diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder. Studies were selected by two review authors independently and a third author arbitrated when necessary.

Data Collection and Analysis

Risk of bias was evaluated and data were extracted by two review authors independently; a third author arbitrated when necessary. Most studies were not eligible for meta-analysis, the principal reason being mis-matching methodologies and outcome measures. Three small meta-analyses were carried out.

Main Results

Twenty-two randomised trials were included in the review (N = 695). Studies were highly variable in their country of origin, sample size, participant age, intervention delivery type, and outcome measures. Risk of bias was variable across categories. There were very few studies for which there was adequate blinding of participants and personnel, and some were also judged at high risk of bias in blinding of outcome assessors. There was also evidence of some bias in sequence generation and allocation concealment. Not all studies reported data that fell within the pre-defined primary outcome categories for the review, instead many studies reported measures which were intervention-specific (e.g. emotion recognition). The wide range of measures used within each outcome category and the mixed results from these measures introduced further complexity when interpreting results. Studies were grouped into four main categories according to intervention target/primary outcome measure. These were: emotion recognition studies, joint attention and social communication studies, imitation studies, and studies teaching ToM itself. Within the first two of these categories, a sub-set of studies were deemed suitable for meta-analysis for a limited number of key outcomes. There was very low quality evidence of a positive effect on measures of communication based on individual results from three studies. There was low quality evidence from 11 studies reporting mixed results of interventions on measures of social interaction, very low quality evidence from four studies reporting mixed results on measures of general communication, and very low quality evidence from four studies reporting mixed results on measures of ToM ability. The meta-analysis results we were able to generate showed that interventions targeting emotion recognition across age groups and working with people within the average range of intellectual ability had a positive effect on the target skill, measured by a test using photographs of faces (mean increase of 0.75 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.29 points, Z = 2.75, P < 0.006, four studies, N = 105). Therapist-led joint attention interventions can promote production of more joint attention behaviours within adult-child interaction (mean increase of 0.55 points, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.99 points, Z = 2.45, P value = 0.01, two studies, N = 88). Further analysis undermines this conclusion somewhat by demonstrating that there was no clear evidence that intervention can have an effect on joint attention initiations as measured using a standardised assessment tool (mean increase of 0.23 points, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.94 points, Z = 0.63, P value = 0.53, three studies, N = 92). No adverse effects were apparent.

Authors' Conclusions

While there is some evidence that ToM, or a precursor skill, can be taught to people with ASD, there is little evidence of maintenance of that skill, generalisation to other settings, or developmental effects on related skills. Furthermore, inconsistency in findings and measurement means that evidence has been graded of 'very low' or 'low' quality and we cannot be confident that suggestions of positive effects will be sustained as high-quality evidence accumulates. Further longitudinal designs and larger samples are needed to help elucidate both the efficacy of ToM-linked interventions and the explanatory value of the ToM model itself. It is possible that the continuing refinement of the ToM model will lead to better interventions which have a greater impact on development than those investigated to date.

### Effective patient-physician communication [^eefabb9e]. ACOG (2025). High credibility.

Box 1. Glossary — key terms in patient–physician communication are defined as follows: affective communication is a style aimed at putting a patient at ease and releasing emotions and includes components such as empathy, reassurance, and support; cultural competence promotes "culturally sensitive" practice and the trained ability to identify cross-cultural expressions of illness and health but is criticized as promoting overly reductionist, simplistic, and static depictions of culture and normalizing dominant White culture; cultural humility is a lifelong process of self-reflection and self-critique that begins with examining one's own beliefs and cultural identities; cognitive heuristics are "shortcuts" in clinical decision making that, although beneficial for efficiency, increase the likelihood of misjudgment; humility involves self-awareness, empathic openness toward others, and profound appreciation for the privilege of patient care; relationship-centered care is a conceptual framework in which all participants appreciate the importance of their relationships with one another; and shared decision making is a communication approach with a bidirectional flow of information between patients and physicians that culminates in the physician and patient jointly deciding on a treatment strategy.

### Calibration of cognitive tests to address the reliability paradox for decision-conflict tasks [^98b1744d]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Differential psychology aims to measure the way in which individuals vary in their behavior and to understand the processes that cause those differences. These causes are conceptualized as stable individual characteristics, or traits, but the behavioral effects of traits on any given measurement occasion are modulated by fluctuations in transient states, such as arousal, attention, mood, fatigue, and the intrinsic variability in the nervous system. State variation acts as a type of measurement noise with respect to the correlation-based techniques that are used in differential psychology to estimate the proportion of behavior that can be explained by trait variation. It has long been acknowledged that correlations based on averages over measurement occasions under-estimate this proportion, leading to an emphasis on the development of reliable scales with levels of measurement noise that are small relative to the underlying level of trait variation. In this paper, we focus on the reliable measurement of individual differences in the ability to control the decision conflict caused by interference from misleading or irrelevant information. Decision conflict is apparent in many real-world high-stakes contexts, such as shoot/don't shoot scenarios, where strong inhibitory skills ensure superior performance. The ability to inhibit conflicting information is recognized as a key component of individual differences in areas ranging from executive-control, to aging.

Individual differences in conflict control are often measured using choice tasks, such as the Flanker, Simon, or Stroop. In such tasks, the conflict effect is traditionally measured by the difference in mean response time (RT) between an incongruent condition, where information from an irrelevant stimulus attribute conflicts with information from another stimulus attribute that is relevant for the choice, and a control condition, where the two sources of information are congruent, or the irrelevant attribute is absent (e.g. Fig. 1). The irrelevant attributes are chosen so they activate cognitive representations that interfere with response selection. This can occur because of pre-potent factors, including the tendency to respond based on reading a color word in the Stroop task instead of based on the color the word is printed in, or responding towards a stimulus position in the Simon task rather than the rule mapping stimulus color to a response button on the side opposite the stimulus. In the Flanker task, fine-grained spatially-based attention selection is required between the relevant (target) and irrelevant (distractor) characteristics due to high similarity (e.g. left- vs. right-facing arrows), differing only slightly in terms of their spatial location (central for the target with adjacent distractors nearby).

### APA multicultural guidelines executive summary: ecological approach to context, identity, and intersectionality [^1d09f0aa]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

APA Multicultural Guidelines — Guideline 2 states that psychologists aspire to recognize and understand that as cultural beings, they hold attitudes and beliefs that can influence their perceptions of and interactions with others as well as their clinical and empirical conceptualizations, and that psychologists strive to move beyond conceptualizations rooted in categorical assumptions, biases, and/or formulations based on limited knowledge about individuals and communities. The rationale notes that psychologists' worldviews are rooted in their professional knowledge, personal life experiences, and interactions with others across their ecological contexts, and these worldviews influence their empirical and clinical conceptualizations and approaches, and that socialization concerning age, sex, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion and spirituality, social class, and disability has important implications for psychologists' conscious and unconscious preferences and inclinations when formulating diagnoses, analyzing and interpreting research data, and planning interventions; psychotherapy research indicates that therapists' attitudes, cultural empathy, and cultural humility predict therapist's self-reported cultural competence in practice and client's perceptions of therapist's cultural competence.

### Leadership: an overview [^cb10c865]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Despite the influence of leadership in our lives, it remains poorly understood by most of us. This review defines leadership as "a combination of position, responsibilities, attitude, skills, and behaviors that allows someone to bring out the best in others, and the best in their organization, in a sustainable manner". There are many traits and skills demonstrated by leaders. These include talent, drive, willpower, practical wisdom, loyalty, ethical behavior, emotional intelligence, integrity, self-awareness, and resilience. However, to best understand leadership we focus on what leaders are actually required to do, rather than on the skills and traits used to accomplish these tasks. We review nine functions that are at the core of leadership: serve as the public face of the organization; articulate the vision and mission; create culture; strategic planning; decide what to focus on; select, and develop, the right people; establish a decision-making process; manage your boss; and be responsible 24/7. All leaders operate in a specific context, during a unique point in the history of their organization, with a unique set of circumstances. What is required of the leader in one set of circumstances will change as those circumstances change. If the leader understands her core responsibilities, and if she develops the people, culture, and processes necessary to deal with a changing environment, she will have the self-awareness and support necessary to continue to lead successfully.

Academy members in leadership positions should understand that they occupy a position of trust and are expected to act at all times in the best interests of the Academy, in good faith, and without bias or favor to outside interest. Whenever outside interests or other responsibilities potentially conflict with duty to the Academy, these must be declared. Members certify that they will act in such manner as to avoid even the appearance of using positions to advance any personal interest. If an actual, potential, or apparent conflict is detected, policies are in place to resolve such conflicts. All authors of Academy publications and speakers at Academy meetings adhere to the same principles of disclosure and avoidance of conflict of interest for the fair and balanced presentation of scientific information that guides practice. Any member who speaks at the annual business meeting or advisory board meeting must verbally disclose any potential conflicts of interest before speaking. The Academy is committed to transparency and objective decision-making at all organizational levels.

### Dimensions of wisdom perception across twelve countries on five continents [^446bcac7]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Probing a range of models proposed in prior research on mind perception, and social judgment, we observed two latent dimensions that guide people's evaluation of wisdom-related characteristics in others and the self — reflective orientation and socio-emotional awareness, which were aligned with the explicit attribution of wisdom (as well as knowledgeability and understanding) to specific individuals. Contrary to our expectations, these dimensions were consistent across cultures. Moreover, ratings of targets were stable across cultures on the Reflective dimension but varied depending on culture on the socio-emotional dimension. Additionally, we found that people in most cultures compared themselves favorably on socio-emotional characteristics associated with wisdom vis-à-vis exemplars of wisdom.

### The limits of shared decision making [^4a859be1]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Absence of or insufficient evidence of benefit

Scientific evidence for or against a course of action is a key determinant of how clinicians frame decisions in discussions with patients, although the influence of peers and accepted norms are arguably just as important. In some situations, for a range of reasons, increased attention is frequently given to the absence of evidence of net benefit, especially when the evidence is of low quality or contradictory.

There are three common situations where this may be the case.

When there is no evidence

For many options there is little to no research available to allow comparison. However, it is not unusual for patients to have strong prior beliefs about the need for a specific treatment or a test. The clinician may need to become better informed, or may already be aware that insufficient evidence exists, or that there is likely harm, and that acquiescing risks the prospect of delaying effective treatment. Both these scenarios require skilful negotiation for either more time to search for information or to provide reasons why the request for the option may be declined, especially if the option likely brings harm or an unjustified use of resources. Such discussions are made more complex when patients are exposed to media that promote novel healthcare developments. Honesty and transparency can guide communication, however, a consensus is often difficult to achieve. This situation is often one where clinical equipoise does not exist, and therefore places limits on SDM.

Scientific evidence of inferiority

Clinicians may also be unwilling to consider SDM when evidence exists in favour of some options compared with others, or where situations have high stakes and the use of effective treatment is considered imperative or is widely viewed as a standard of care, even if individual patient preferences vary. Clinicians report feeling a moral and professional obligation to recommend superior versus inferior options in such situations. They may feel the need to follow clinical guidelines and harbour concerns that they will be viewed as either incompetent or negligent for not adhering to professionally held norms. There is evidence that the willingness of clinicians to practice SDM varies, especially in the face of strong clinical practice recommendations.

### Consensus-building conversation leads to neural alignment [^9dabbbf9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Theoretical implications: influence, language, and the mind

In agreement with prior studies, we found that the cognitive processes underlying social understanding were shared across people. Further, we found that these processes were more aligned after natural consensus-building conversation, not only when participants were listening to each other, but into the future. These results bear on theories of social influence, language and the mind.

Much research on social influence has focused on public compliance, setting aside the long-lasting effects of social interaction on private cognition. However, the present results show that consensus-building conversation can align neural responses within groups, and that this alignment can generalize to novel stimuli that were not discussed. This suggests a stronger role for private acceptance in understanding social influence, and demonstrates the feasibility of fMRI as a tool for measuring changes in private thought.

The observed results could only have occurred if participants' ways of speaking were commensurable, complicating strong versions of accounts on which people regularly use the same words but with completely different meanings –. Additionally, we would not have observed neural alignment if the participants tended to represent the same concepts using different neural processes.

The reported results suggest the possibility that one function of consensus-building conversation is producing neural alignment. This would pose a challenge to the claim that language did not evolve for communication, but instead for organizing individual thought. By contrast, the reported results are consistent with the theory that the coordination of belief is an important evolutionary function of language –, and further suggest the alignment of neural processes governing attention as a mechanism. On this account, conversation resembles a neuro-feedback processwhere people use language to understand and influence others' mental states. The tight, ever-evolving coupling between your thoughts and my thoughts, corresponding to tight neural alignment across our brains, is a plausible mechanism for building group realities based on shared language. This view is compatible with predictive processing accounts of cognition, especially those that place special importance on the challenge of predicting other people. The aligning function of conversation may also support cumulative development on an evolutionary time scale, as the language environment created by past generations scaffolds the learning of the next –.

### Nutrition and physical activity interventions for adults in the general population: a position paper of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the American council on exercise [^bba07700]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2024). High credibility.

Practice implications — client-centered counseling emphasizes inclusive, collaborative communication. Practitioners "can make clients feel more at ease by offering an accessible and inclusive physical or virtual meeting space and by using person-first language and preferred pronouns." Effective interventions "require counseling or coaching with dynamic client interactions, using a client's knowledge as a starting point to facilitate behavior change," and "nutrition and exercise practitioners may, in fact, provide little expertise during consultations and instead help clients figure out answers for themselves (ie, employ motivational interviewing techniques)." Practitioners have "the responsibility to prioritize a client's needs and preferences while providing objective, evidence-based information," and "approaching clients' circumstances with an open mind facilitates understanding client needs and potentially effective solutions." They "can build and maintain a client's trust and comfort by respecting the client's interests and developing goals together," for example when "some clients with overweight or obesity do not wish to focus on weight loss, and asserting body weight change as a primary goal may weaken trust and create discomfort." If "a client has uncertain weight goals, an opportunity arises to share evidence about potential benefits and obstacles of various weight management strategies," and clients may aim "to return to a fitness level they achieved in their past," where "empathetic discussions and using motivational interviewing techniques" can help shape realistic goals. "Figure 4 provides an example of client-centered communication."

Having a questioning attitude is the fist step in the research process. Research begins with a question, which leads to a hypothesis. Questions abound in our daily clinical lives. Most quality research consists of comparisons. By carefully selecting a comparison group or condition, the quality of the research project can be improved. By including in the hypothesis the comparison group, the experiment can be focused and the analysis simplified. The best questions come from the investigator's subject of interest.

Adult children's perceptions that their fathers currently favored any offspring in the family predicted reports of tension with their siblings, whereas perceptions of mothers' favoritism did not. Fathers' favoritism was a stronger predictor of daughters' than sons' reports of sibling tension.

Discussion

These findings contribute to a growing body of research demonstrating the consequences of parental favoritism in adulthood. Equally important, they demonstrate that perceptions of fathers' current favoritism plays an even greater role in shaping their adult children's sibling relations than do mothers' favoritism.

### Disclosure of interests and management of conflicts of interest in clinical guidelines and guidance statements: methods from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^5fb5620e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Clinical Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians — tiered conflict of interest (COI) levels and management actions define low-level COI as any inactive high-level conflict and any intellectual interest only tangentially related to the clinical topic area (e.g., service within previous 3 y); moderate-level COI as intellectual interest that may lead to cognitive bias and relationships with entities that may seek to profit by association with guidelines (including roles within previous 3 y); and high-level COI as any active relationship with a high-risk entity. Management is matched to severity: for low-level, the participant is not restricted from discussion, voting, or authorship; for moderate-level, the participant participates in all discussion but is restricted from voting and authorship; and for high-level, the participant releases interest or is recused — if able and willing to dissolve ties ("release interest"), the COI becomes low-level, and if unable or unwilling, the participant is recused from all work (discussion, voting, and authorship). As seriousness of the COI increases, the management strategy intensifies.

### Everyday norms have become more permissive over time and vary across cultures [^31298e26]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Every social situation that people encounter in their daily lives comes with a set of unwritten rules about what behavior is considered appropriate or inappropriate. These everyday norms can vary across societies: some societies may have more permissive norms in general or for certain behaviors, or for certain behaviors in specific situations. In a preregistered survey of 25,422 participants across 90 societies, we map societal differences in 150 everyday norms and show that they can be explained by how societies prioritize individualizing moral foundations such as care and liberty versus binding moral foundations such as purity. Specifically, societies with more individualistic morality tend to have more permissive norms in general (greater liberty) and especially for behaviors deemed vulgar (less purity), but they exhibit less permissive norms for behaviors perceived to have negative consequences in specific situations (greater care). By comparing our data with available data collected twenty years ago, we find a global pattern of change toward more permissive norms overall but less permissive norms for the most vulgar and inconsiderate behaviors. This study explains how social norms vary across behaviors, situations, societies, and time.

### Shifting attention to accuracy can reduce misinformation online [^b2dae3aa]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

In recent years, there has been a great deal of concern about the proliferation of false and misleading news on social media 1–4. Academics and practitioners alike have asked why people share such misinformation, and sought solutions to reduce the sharing of misinformation 5–7. Here, we attempt to address both of these questions. First, we find that the veracity of headlines has little effect on sharing intentions, despite having a large effect on judgments of accuracy. This dissociation suggests that sharing does not necessarily indicate belief. Nonetheless, most participants say it is important to share only accurate news. To shed light on this apparent contradiction, we carried out four survey experiments and a field experiment on Twitter; the results show that subtly shifting attention to accuracy increases the quality of news that people subsequently share. Together with additional computational analyses, these findings indicate that people often share misinformation because their attention is focused on factors other than accuracy-and therefore they fail to implement a strongly held preference for accurate sharing. Our results challenge the popular claim that people value partisanship over accuracy 8,9, and provide evidence for scalable attention-based interventions that social media platforms could easily implement to counter misinformation online.

### Crisis + emergency risk communication. 2012 edition [^05ea63aa]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Crisis and emergency risk communication — panic management guidance — states "Do not try to dispel panic" and that "Panic during a crisis is rare. People nearly always behave in a rational way during a crisis." When "told what to do by those in authority, people followed instructions," but "If no one is in charge and no advice is forthcoming people may:" "Assess the situation, and, based on their experiences, determine a course of action," "Take calm, self-protective actions that seem rational and appropriate to them, even if authorities recommend otherwise," and "Feel anxiety, fear, and even delayed panic attacks or PTSD when the crisis ends." The guidance advises to "Recognize the differences among your audience" because "A person anticipating high risk is much more likely to respond inappropriately than a person in the heat of the battle, who will act on the information and doesn't have the time to rethink," and notes that "the more removed people are from the real danger (in place and time), the more likely they are to allow their emotions full range." It emphasizes that "The condition most conducive to panic isn't bad news — it's conflicting messages from those in authority," with people upset when "They can't trust what those in authority are telling them," and warns, "If you start hedging or hiding the bad news, you increase the risk of a confused, angry, and uncooperative public."

### Tolerance to ambiguous uncertainty predicts prosocial behavior [^ed4582ab]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Uncertainty is endemic to decision-making, and is especially acute during social interactions, as it is difficult to predict how other people will act. Thus, there is a constant demand to estimate the probabilistic distributions associated with another's behavioral repertoire. We examined this social decision space, finding that ambiguity, but not risk, attitudes predict willingness to engage in prosocial behavior. Specifically, the greater an individual's ambiguity tolerance, the more they engage in costly prosocial actions — across multiple different social contexts. We observed this relationship during binary decisions to cooperate (experiments 1 and 3) and granular choices to trust (experiment 2). Finally, we also found that the relationship between ambiguity tolerance and prosocial choice can be abolished if the ambiguity associated with another's actions is sufficiently resolved (experiment 3). Taken together, these results provide converging evidence that one's attitudes toward ambiguous uncertainty are a robust and stable predictor of prosocial behavior, suggesting that a specific cognitive phenotype (e.g. personality variable) underlies — at least in part — the motivation to engage in prosocial action.

Interestingly, the divergent results observed in the aversive and appetitive domain in experiment 2 suggest that individuals hold different perceptions of uncertainty depending on whether the associated outcomes are positive or negative. Trustworthy partners linked with ambiguous outcomes were trusted less than trustworthy partners whose behavior was fully informed. This effect was not observed for untrustworthy partners, such that there was no effect of the ambiguity manipulation on how much (or little) people were willing to entrust to the untrustworthy players. This intimates that while trust is easily eroded under tenuous, uncertain contexts, distrust is less susceptible to the effects of uncertainty — largely because people seem unwilling to trust those who signal that they cannot be trusted. This converges with early research examining negativity biases, which demonstrates that moral reputations are hard to build and easy to lose. In other words, the possibility of negative outcomes caused by others looms larger than the possibility of positive ones.

### Committee opinion no. 683: behavior that undermines a culture of safety [^5c15ce56]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Behavior that undermines a culture of safety — definition, impact, and examples are described as follows: a key element of an organizational safety culture is maintaining an environment of professionalism that encourages communication and promotes high-quality care, and behavior that undermines a culture of safety, including disruptive or intimidating behavior, has a negative effect on the quality and safety of patient care. Disruptive behavior has been defined as "personal conduct, whether verbal or physical, that negatively affects or that potentially may negatively affect patient care," and several types of behavior can create distress or negatively affect morale in the work environment, with examples including overt actions such as verbal outbursts and physical threats, and passive actions such as refusing to perform assigned tasks or exhibiting uncooperative attitudes during routine activities. Disruptive and intimidating behavior undermines teamwork and collegiality, disruptive behavior often is manifested by health care professionals in positions of power, and co-workers often are reluctant to report disruptive behavior because of fear of retaliation and the stigma associated with "blowing the whistle" on a colleague; additionally, negative behavior of revenue-generating physicians may be overlooked because of concern about the perceived consequences of confronting them.

### Participatory practices at work change attitudes and behavior toward societal authority and justice [^5b59e0cd]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Across two field experiments, the results provide support for our hypothesis that short-term participatory experiences at a work group could change attitudes that are traditionally conceptualized as stable and a product of one's personality and long-term social experience: generalized attitudes toward societal authority and justice. Following a six-week period in which workers experienced a participatory meeting in which workers talked and supervisors listened, treatment workers reported less deference to generalized authority and lower belief in the just nature of the world, compared with workers who were not assigned to these meetings. The size of these changes is roughly one standard deviation on the survey measurement scale, and is perhaps more impressive considering that they were observed one month (2 weeks, in Study 2) after participatory meetings had ended. Generalized attitudes toward authority and justice changed without a shift in larger societal procedural justice and without a shift in the actual mechanisms of the workplace's authority and justice structures, beyond a 20-minute meeting each week. The data suggest that generalized attitudes toward authority and justice can be affected in an enduring way by brief but immersive experiences with a more egalitarian local power structure.

In Study 1, workers assigned to the participatory meetings also reported a heightened level of perceived conflict between managers and workers in the larger Chinese society, but not greater conflict between other dominant and lower status groups, a focused finding that counters a potential alternative interpretation that treatment workers simply reported more negative attitudes. These same workers assigned to participatory meetings also endorsed a more favorable attitude toward their own local factory management, reporting at significantly higher rates that factory management (i.e. the supervisors of their supervisors) cared about and respected them. This effect was observed one week after the intervention and remained robust when re-tested one month later along with the variables reported in this study. Workers in Study 2 did not become more positive about their local authority, likely because of a ceiling effect in positive attitudes toward the university.

### Crisis + emergency risk communication. 2012 edition [^2271d0a0]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Stakeholder and partner communication — when issues are framed broadly, communicators are directed to "ask questions that are more specific to the audience" to surface concrete concerns and actions, using prompts such as "What are the ramifications to you (your family, your community, or the nation) when faced with this current problem?," "What consequences are you hoping to avoid?," "What do you see as the worst outcome for you (or your community)?," and "What courses of action do you believe could lead to this outcome?" The page adds that "Questions that encourage audience members to state the benefits they would like to see result from a course of action may promote understanding of anticipated outcomes," with examples including "Because you have brought up quarantine, what benefits would you (or your community) expect if you accepted quarantine as a course of action to reduce spread of disease?" and "From what I understand, you are looking for a way to protect yourself (or your family or community) from more illness or death. If I can explain how quarantine will meet those needs, are you open to implementing it?" It emphasizes the approach by noting, "Allowing people to persuade themselves is not an easy process" and that "It is the most effective way to gain your audience's acceptance in thought and behavior."

### Methodology for ACOEM's occupational medicine practice guidelines-2025 revision [^a48bbca8]. ACOEM (2025). High credibility.

ACOEM Standard 5 — establishing evidence foundations and rating strength of recommendations — states that for each recommendation, the following should be provided, including an explanation of reasoning with a clear description of potential benefits and harms, a summary of relevant available evidence with tables of included and excluded studies, assessment of the quality, quantity and consistency of the evidence, and the part played by values, opinion, theory, and clinical experience; it also requires a rating of the level of confidence, a rating of the strength of the recommendation, and a description and explanation of any differences of opinion. Each recommendation has a description of the benefits and the harms, the evidence is summarized in a Rationale for Recommendation section with discussion of limitations and consistency, and conflicts may lead to Insufficient Evidence (aka consensus) recommendations; where there are no quality studies or substantially conflicting studies, only consensus of Insufficient Evidence recommendations are possible. A rating of the level of confidence is included for all recommendations, the strength rating is provided in bold type for all recommendations, and in rare split-panel cases the dissension is reported as a percentage of votes with brief rationale.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^8fe96cf1]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Change mechanisms — mediators of outcome in depression treatments: A systematic review of 35 studies identified mediators across psychotherapies and found that change in dysfunctional attitudes, negative "automatic" thoughts, mindfulness and worry skills, and rumination mediated change in outcomes in most studies, with mixed evidence for attributional style, behavioral components, and therapeutic alliance. Reviews reported that cognitive change mediates symptom change in cognitive therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for depression, and that changes in mindfulness, rumination, worry, compassion, or meta-awareness mediated effects of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for depression. Among women who received brief couple therapy for depression, changes in depressive symptoms were mediated by changes in their own illness-related cognitions and behaviors and in their perceptions of increased positivity and support from their husbands. Additional evidence notes that skills learning and practice during homework assignments contribute to better outcomes for cognitive, behavioral, and cognitive-behavioral therapies for depression. In psychodynamic psychotherapy, research has provided varying support that greater insight, change in defensive style (more mature), less relationship rigidity and maladaptive representations, higher object relations, greater reflective functioning, and better therapeutic alliance facilitate better outcomes. In humanistic-experiential therapies, emotional processing facilitates better outcomes, and changes produced by antidepressant treatments are extremely complex with understanding of those changes evolving.

### Challenges to the improvement of obstetric care in maternity hospitals of a large Brazilian city: an exploratory qualitative approach on contextual issues [^fe9c44d2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Professional responsibility Vis-à-Vis the patient

Problems underlined above that undermined teamwork and created antagonism between professionals were also appeared to risk shrinking individual professionals' sense of personal responsibility, promoting instead a tendency toward non-cooperation and shifting of responsibilities onto other professionals. Norms and standards on maternity wards are sometimes used as an argument – "this is not my responsibility" – so that no one were responsible for solving problems in effective patient care.

For example, the ultrasound doctor arrived, she has to check on the patients on the floor; we have scheduled visits and those of the emergency room… One says: "I have no obligation to take the patient" and the other one replies: "I have to call in the stretcher bearer", "but the stretcher guy went to the blood bank… " "That's not my job, that's the guy's job!" Well, there's only one guy out there… [LAUGHING] [Doctor 04]

Leadership

Participants of this study expressed their expectations about attributes of leaders. They have expected that leaders would be able to manage conflicts and to facilitate team-building and harmonization. It was also expected that leaders would have technical competence, listening skills, command ability for assignment of roles among team members, as well as capacity to implement actions to ensure coordination and integration of care. Thus leadership, whether they like it or not, seems works as an example to be followed, thereby, their behavior, attitudes and daily presence had an impact on the behavior of the teams and each professional.

… so that person must have a profile of mediator, of someone able to listen, and after having heard, provides a response on what he/she has heard, go there at the other end, which was the object of the complaint and check what happened, listens to that party as well and, after hearing both parties, enters into an understanding and take it to those two conflicting parties, right? I believe that the leader must have this profile, he/she shouldn't be that explosive person… he/she has to be a quiet person with the ability to listen, someone who has the ability to talk to the other person in a non-aggressive way and knows how to coordinate things and assign tasks.

### Do ask, do tell [^513a4af2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

As a consequence of bias and ignorance within the medical profession, lesbians and gay men frequently receive suboptimal health care. Knowledge of each patient's sexual orientation and behaviors is critical for the development of a productive therapeutic relationship, accurate risk assessment, and the provision of pertinent preventive counseling. However, clinicians often forget to ask about this information, and many lesbians and gay men are reticent to reveal the truth. I present vignettes from my personal experiences as a lesbian patient and doctor to illustrate the importance of creating an environment in which such disclosure can occur and to portray the challenges and rewards of coming out as a gay physician.

### Survey research [^c44856f5]. Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Surveys provide evidence on practice, attitudes, and knowledge. However, conducting good survey research is harder than it looks. The authors aim to provide guidance to both researchers and readers in conducting and interpreting survey research. Like all research, surveys should have clear research question(s) using the smallest possible number of high-quality, essential, survey questions (items) that will interest the target population. Both researchers and readers should put themselves in the position of the respondents. The survey questions should provide reproducible results (reliable), measure what they are supposed to measure (valid), and take less than 10 min to answer. Good survey research reports provide results with valid and reliable answers to the research question with an adequate response rate (at least 40%) and adequate precision (margin of error ideally 5% or less). Possible biases among those who did not respond (nonresponders) must be carefully analyzed and discussed. Quantitative results can be combined with qualitative results in mixed-methods research to provide greater insight.
