## Question

What is a detailed pain algorithm for back pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a detailed, step-by-step algorithm for back pain management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic triage and red flag screening. Then, I should verify the imaging decision pathway. Next, I will consider whether pain phenotyping is ready for clinical use. After that, I need to outline first-line nonpharmacologic care, followed by pharmacologic escalation if needed. Subsequently, I should address chronic low back pain management using a biopsychosocial approach, then interventional and surgical options for selected cases, and finally monitoring, follow-up, and special populations, before summarizing the algorithm and caveats with clear citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the initial diagnostic assessment and red flag screening, because missing serious underlying conditions is the highest-risk clinical error; I need to ensure we triage early for infection, malignancy, fracture, inflammatory spondyloarthropathy, and cauda equina syndrome with a focused history and exam that looks for progressive neurological deficits, bowel or bladder dysfunction, fever with severe pain, night pain or weight loss, and recent significant trauma or high-risk bone states such as osteoporosis or chronic corticosteroid use [^113sgg8c] [^114hvKiN] [^112BNubN]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; if no red flags are present, I should document chronicity as acute under 6 weeks, subacute 6 to 12 weeks, or chronic beyond 12 weeks and proceed as non-specific low back pain while remaining vigilant for evolving red flags over time.

> Next, I should review the imaging decision pathway; routine early imaging in non-specific acute or subacute low back pain without red flags provides no clinical benefit and may lead to harm through incidental findings and unnecessary downstream procedures, so I will avoid imaging in that scenario while reserving prompt imaging for severe or progressive neurologic deficits, suspicion of cancer, infection, fracture, or other specific conditions, or when symptoms persist beyond about 6 to 12 weeks despite appropriate care with a reappraisal of diagnosis [^114hvKiN] [^113sgg8c]. Wait, let me verify the modality choice; lumbar MRI with or without contrast is preferred for suspected serious pathology or radiculopathy, whereas plain radiographs have limited utility except in selected subacute or chronic cases with suspected fracture or deformity, and while I see thoracic ACR 2024 statements aligning against routine imaging, I need to be careful not to over-extrapolate them to lumbar even though the principle of selective imaging remains consistent across regions [^113sgg8c] [^114Lq71v] [^111xBR72].

> I will now examine pain phenotyping; emerging frameworks propose categorizing low back pain by dominant mechanisms such as nociceptive, neuropathic, or nociplastic to inform targeted therapy, but wait, I should verify readiness for clinical implementation because the BACPAP consortium explicitly concludes that while this approach is promising, evidence is insufficient to guide treatment decisions now, so I will document phenotype features to inform future care and research without using them to direct initial management [^112Hut8Y].

> Next, I should review first-line conservative management for acute and subacute non-specific low back pain; I need to ensure patients receive strong education and reassurance about the favorable natural history, advice to avoid bed rest, and encouragement of early, gradual return to usual activities, coupled with nonpharmacologic options aligned with preferences and availability such as superficial heat, spinal manipulative therapy, massage, acupuncture, yoga, and mindfulness-based stress reduction, since these modalities have the best evidence-risk profile in early phases and can reduce transition to chronicity when combined with activity maintenance [^1164WXri] [^11438T4J] [^111pxHxH] [^117JnJgu]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check that superficial heat is best supported in acute and subacute phases rather than chronic, which is consistent with ACP guidance prioritizing heat early and structured exercise and psychological strategies later if symptoms persist [^1164WXri].

> If symptoms remain severe or functionally limiting despite nonpharmacologic care, I should confirm pharmacologic escalation principles; NSAIDs are the most evidence-supported first-line drugs for acute, subacute, and chronic non-specific low back pain when pharmacotherapy is desired, and topical NSAIDs are reasonable for localized pain or for patients with systemic risks, while I limit skeletal muscle relaxants to short-term use in acute pain and consider tramadol briefly only when NSAIDs are contraindicated or ineffective after careful risk-benefit discussion, and I should avoid routine acetaminophen for low back pain given insufficient benefit in recent guidance and reserve opioids as a last resort in exceptional, refractory cases with shared decision-making and exit strategies because guideline recommendations for opioids vary and signal considerable risk [^116GQ8q6] [^112kienb] [^111upJXW] [^117M4Sa8] [^116Yae6f]. Hold on, I should verify contraindications and risks each time I consider NSAIDs, including gastrointestinal bleeding, renal impairment, and cardiovascular risk, adjusting to topical formulations or nonpharmacologic care when appropriate [^112kienb].

> Once pain persists beyond 12 weeks or earlier if psychosocial barriers are prominent, I need to ensure a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment to identify depression, fear-avoidance beliefs, catastrophizing, occupational factors, and deconditioning, then implement structured exercise programs tailored to capacity and preference, and deliver psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, or operant approaches, recognizing that co-delivery by interdisciplinary or psychologically informed providers enhances outcomes and that multidisciplinary rehabilitation confers modest but durable benefits on pain, disability, and return to work when usual care has failed [^115crRCd] [^113CM3GM] [^112nVT6h] [^116qnjL9]. Let me reconsider the sequence; if simpler single-modality care is inadequate, an early shift to coordinated multidisciplinary rehabilitation is reasonable for high disability or complex psychosocial presentations given the long-term advantages despite higher up-front resource demands [^116qnjL9].

> For selected patients with a clear anatomic pain generator and failure of 6 to 12 weeks of appropriate conservative therapy, I will now examine interventional and surgical options; epidural steroid injections can provide short-term reductions in pain and disability for radicular pain due to disc herniation, facet radiofrequency ablation may help when facet-mediated pain is confirmed by diagnostic blocks and performed with image guidance, stand-alone interspinous spacers can be considered for mild-to-moderate lumbar spinal stenosis in carefully selected cases, and surgical referral is indicated for severe or progressive neurologic deficits, refractory radiculopathy, or structural instability after shared decision-making about expected benefits and risks [^115vv67U] [^113y8zVv] [^115HmUgK] [^114ybyzQ]. Wait, let me verify the durability; across guidelines, benefits of injections are largely short-term and patient selection is crucial, and I should communicate that repeated procedures have diminishing returns and must be individualized, a point echoed in neuropathic pain algorithms discussing variable and often transient effects for radiculopathy and FBSS contexts [^113pRvq2].

> I should confirm a looped monitoring and follow-up structure because low back pain often recurs; initial follow-up at 2 to 4 weeks to reassess pain, function, and adherence, then at 6 to 12 weeks, using standardized patient-important outcomes such as achieving at least 30 percent pain improvement and gains in functional scales or work status, and establishing triggers for earlier re-evaluation including new neurologic deficits, worsening pain despite adherence, development of red flags, or functional plateau, with treatment adjustment including tapering medications when improving, escalation to multidisciplinary programs if stagnant, and reconsideration of diagnosis and selective re-imaging if deteriorating [^114XKJ6i]. Hold on, I should verify that outcome thresholds are interpretable by both clinicians and patients, aligning with OMERACT recommendations to report both continuous and responder outcomes to guide decisions pragmatically [^114XKJ6i].

> Special populations and contexts require careful adaptation; in older adults I should maintain a lower threshold for imaging when fracture risk is elevated due to osteoporosis, low-velocity trauma, or chronic corticosteroid exposure, while prioritizing topical NSAIDs and appropriately dosed exercise interventions, and for complex psychosocial or workers' compensation cases I should consider earlier multidisciplinary involvement to address occupational and behavioral barriers, and in post-surgical pain or failed back surgery syndrome I may consider epidural injections after conservative approaches fail while being transparent about typically short-lived effects and the need for comprehensive rehabilitation supports [^113sgg8c] [^113pRvq2] [^116qnjL9]. I need to check pregnancy-specific pharmacologic guidance, which is not detailed in the present evidence set, so I will avoid making unsupported claims here and default to obstetric-safe physical therapies and shared decision-making pending guideline consultation when applicable [^112pGDGa].

> Stepping back, the final algorithm is a tiered and bi-directional system that first screens for danger with red flags that prompt urgent imaging and specialist referral, stratifies by chronicity into acute, subacute, and chronic pathways, prioritizes nonpharmacologic care at all stages, reserves pharmacology for refractory symptoms with NSAIDs as first-line if desired, escalates based on psychosocial complexity to structured psychological therapies and multidisciplinary rehabilitation, and considers invasive options only for specific anatomic diagnoses after conservative care failure, with deliberate loops for reassessment and outcome-based progression or de-escalation at defined intervals [^114hvKiN] [^1164WXri] [^112kienb] [^116qnjL9] [^113y8zVv]. But wait, I should also state the critical caveats explicitly: phenotyping is promising but not yet actionable for directing initial treatment, imaging must remain selective rather than routine, opioids are broadly discouraged as first-line and vary widely across guidelines, multidisciplinary care is central to chronic management, and real-world adherence to guidelines is variable, underscoring the need for continuous quality improvement and clinician support systems to close the evidence-to-practice gap [^112Hut8Y] [^114hvKiN] [^116Yae6f] [^116qnjL9] [^114VMgy7].

---

A detailed back pain algorithm starts with **red flag screening** and **mechanism-based classification** (nociceptive, neuropathic, nociplastic) to guide targeted care [^112Hut8Y] [^114hvKiN]. For **acute pain**, use education, activity, and NSAIDs; for **chronic pain**, prioritize exercise, CBT, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation, reserving opioids and interventional procedures for refractory cases [^112kienb] [^1164WXri] [^111pxHxH]. Imaging is only for **red flags or persistent symptoms**, and **regular reassessment** ensures timely escalation or de-escalation [^113sgg8c] [^114hvKiN].

---

## Initial assessment and triage

### Red flag screening

During screening, **red flags** include cancer, infection, fracture, cauda equina, and severe or progressive neurologic deficits [^114hvKiN]; the **immediate action** is urgent imaging and specialist referral if any are present.

---

### Pain classification

Pain is classified as **nociceptive, neuropathic, or nociplastic**: nociceptive pain reflects mechanical or degenerative sources (e.g. facet, disc) [^112Hut8Y]; neuropathic pain involves nerve pathology such as radiculopathy [^112Hut8Y]; and nociplastic pain arises from central sensitization (e.g. fibromyalgia) [^112Hut8Y].

---

## Diagnostic imaging and laboratory tests

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended imaging** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute LBP without red flags | No routine imaging | Not indicated [^114hvKiN] |
| Persistent LBP (> 6 weeks) with red flags | MRI | Suspected cancer, infection, fracture, severe neurologic deficits [^113sgg8c] |
| Radiculopathy or spinal stenosis | MRI | Persistent neurologic symptoms [^113sgg8c] |
| Suspected osteoporosis or compression fracture | X-ray or MRI | Elderly, low-velocity trauma, osteoporosis, chronic corticosteroid use [^113sgg8c] |

---

Within the diagnostic workup, **laboratory tests** include CBC, ESR, and CRP when infection or inflammatory disease is suspected.

---

## Non-pharmacological management

### Acute and subacute back pain

- **Education**: Reassure, stay active, avoid bed rest.
- **Exercise**: Supervised or group programs [^117JnJgu].
- **Manual therapy**: Spinal manipulation, massage.
- **Superficial heat**: For acute/subacute pain [^11438T4J].

---

### Chronic back pain

Management emphasizes **structured exercise** — such as aerobic, strength, flexibility, or yoga programs [^117JnJgu] — alongside psychological therapies, including CBT, mindfulness, and operant approaches [^115crRCd]. Multidisciplinary **rehabilitation** using biopsychosocial programs is recommended [^116qnjL9].

---

## Pharmacological management

| **Pain type** | **First-line medications** | **Second-line medications** | **Third-line medications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Nociceptive pain | NSAIDs [^111upJXW] | Acetaminophen | Short-term opioids (severe cases) [^112kienb] |
| Neuropathic pain | Gabapentin, pregabalin, TCAs, SNRIs | Tramadol, tapentadol | Low-dose opioids (refractory cases) [^111NK1fd] |
| Nociplastic pain | Antidepressants, anticonvulsants | Combination therapy | Low-dose opioids (refractory cases) |

---

As part of pharmacologic therapy, **topical agents** include capsaicin for short-term relief [^115e2c9Y].

---

## Interventional procedures

- **Epidural injections**: Short-term relief for radicular pain [^115vv67U].
- **Facet joint interventions**: Medial branch blocks, radiofrequency ablation [^115HmUgK].
- **SI joint injections**: For sacroiliac pain [^1126EECG].
- **Spinal cord stimulation**: Refractory neuropathic pain [^111NK1fd].

---

## Surgical interventions

For surgical interventions, **indications** include persistent neurologic deficits, cauda equina, severe spinal stenosis, and refractory radiculopathy; typical **procedures** are decompression, discectomy, fusion, and interspinous spacers.

---

## Follow-up and reassessment

Follow-up includes **regular reassessment** of pain, function, psychosocial factors, and treatment response. If response is inadequate, consider escalation to interventional or surgical options as appropriate; if improved, de-escalate by reducing pharmacologic and interventional treatments.

---

## Special considerations

- **Elderly**: Caution with NSAIDs, prefer acetaminophen, topical agents, gentle exercise.
- **Pregnancy**: Avoid NSAIDs, opioids; use acetaminophen, physical therapy, manual therapy.
- **Comorbidities**: Tailor to cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, psychiatric conditions.

---

A structured algorithm that integrates red flag screening, mechanism-based classification, selective imaging, and stepwise non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic care — with escalation to interventional or surgical options only when necessary — optimizes outcomes and minimizes harm.

### Diagnostic imaging for low back pain: Advice for high-value health care from the American College of Physicians [^114hvKiN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). High credibility.

Diagnostic imaging is indicated for patients with low back pain only if they have severe progressive neurologic deficits or signs or symptoms that suggest a serious or specific underlying condition. In other patients, evidence indicates that routine imaging is not associated with clinically meaningful benefits but can lead to harms. Addressing inefficiencies in diagnostic testing could minimize potential harms to patients and have a large effect on the use of resources by reducing both direct and downstream costs. In this area, more testing does not equate to better care. Implementing a selective approach to low back imaging, as suggested by the American College of Physicians and American Pain Society guideline on low back pain, would provide better care to patients, improve outcomes, and reduce costs.

### Nociceptive, neuropathic, or nociplastic low back pain? The low back pain phenotyping (BACPAP) consortium's international and multidisciplinary consensus recommendations [^112Hut8Y]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

The potential to classify low back pain as characterized by dominant nociceptive, neuropathic, or nociplastic mechanisms is a clinically relevant issue. Preliminary evidence suggests that these low back pain phenotypes might respond differently to treatments; however, more research must be done before making specific recommendations. Accordingly, the low back pain phenotyping (BACPAP) consortium was established as a group of 36 clinicians and researchers from 13 countries (five continents) and 29 institutions to apply a modified Nominal Group Technique methodology. This methodology was used to develop international and multidisciplinary consensus recommendations to provide guidance for identifying the dominant pain phenotype in patients with low back pain and potentially adapt pain management strategies.

The BACPAP consortium's recommendations are also intended to provide direction for future clinical research by building on the established clinical criteria for neuropathic and nociplastic pain. The BACPAP consortium's consensus recommendations are a necessary early step in the process to determine if personalized pain medicine based on pain phenotypes is feasible for low back pain management. Therefore, these recommendations are not ready to be implemented in clinical practice until additional evidence is generated that is specific to these low back pain phenotypes.

### Noninvasive treatments for acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^1164WXri]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the noninvasive treatment of low back pain.

- **Methods**: Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews published through April 2015 on noninvasive pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for low back pain. Updated searches were performed through November 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included the reduction or elimination of low back pain, improvement in back-specific and overall function, improvement in health-related quality of life, reduction in work disability and return to work, global improvement, number of back pain episodes or time between episodes, patient satisfaction, and adverse effects.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population comprises adults with acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain.

- **Recommendation 1**: Given that most patients with acute or subacute low back pain improve over time regardless of treatment, clinicians and patients should select nonpharmacologic treatment with superficial heat (moderate-quality evidence), massage, acupuncture, or spinal manipulation (low-quality evidence). If pharmacologic treatment is desired, clinicians and patients should select nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or skeletal muscle relaxants (moderate-quality evidence). (Grade: strong recommendation).

### The effect of an integrated multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme for patients with chronic low back pain: Long-term follow up of a randomised controlled trial [^112GNcvV]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). High credibility.

Multidisciplinary rehabilitation is recommended as a second-line treatment in the management of chronic low back pain. It is based on the widely accepted biopsychosocial approach and comprises a multifaceted intervention targeting the wide range of modifiable factors known to contribute to chronic low back pain. The team providing rehabilitation can reinforce the integration of knowledge, skills, and behaviours by considering the patient's environment and ensuring regular interaction with the patient via scheduled booster sessions. Combining the biopsychosocial approach with the chronic care model seems reasonable from a theoretical point of view. However, the optimal dose, content, and delivery of multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes remain unknown.

As described in a previous paper, an integrated multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme was designed, comprising inpatient stays alternating with home-based activities and booster sessions. The intention was to support the integration of knowledge, skills, and behaviours gained from a multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation programme into the daily life of patients with chronic low back pain. In another previous paper, results from the six-month follow-up of a randomised controlled trial comparing an integrated rehabilitation programme with an existing rehabilitation programme were reported.

Long-term (one year) follow-up data on the effect of such a rehabilitation programme are needed, given that time is thought to be related to the successful integration of knowledge, skills, and behaviours.

### Evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines in interventional pain management: Part 7: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic accuracy studies [^1153JYch]. Pain Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Appropriate diagnosis is essential in providing proper and effective therapy. The field of diagnostic accuracy tests is dynamic, with new tests being developed at a fast pace along with continuous improvements in technology of existing tests. Well-designed diagnostic test accuracy studies can help in making appropriate health care decisions, provided that they transparently and fully report their participants, tests, methods, and results. Exaggerated and biased results from poorly designed and reported diagnostic test studies can trigger their premature dissemination and lead physicians into making incorrect treatment decisions.

Consequently, a diagnostic test is useful only to the extent that it distinguishes between conditions or disorders that might otherwise be confused. Since it is unlikely that clinicians, patients, and policymakers have the time, skills, and resources to find, appraise, and interpret the evidence and incorporate it into their health care decisions, systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide an accurate and reliable synthesis of vast quantities of data. A systematic review can identify what is known and unknown, giving guidance for future research.

Systematic reviews have been considered a vital link in the great chain of evidence that stretches from the laboratory to the bedside by helping to separate the insignificant, unsound, or redundant deadwood from the salient and critical studies worthy of reflection. A dangerous discrepancy exists between experts and evidence with all types of evidence.

### Optimal strategies for reporting pain in clinical trials and systematic reviews: Recommendations from an OMERACT 12 workshop [^114XKJ6i]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Pain is a patient-important outcome, but reporting in randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews is often suboptimal, impeding clinical interpretation and decision-making.

- **Methods**: A working group at the 2014 Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT 12) was convened to provide guidance for reporting treatment effects regarding pain for individual studies and systematic reviews.

- **Results**: For individual trials, authors should report, in addition to mean change, the proportion of patients achieving one or more thresholds of improvement from baseline pain (e.g. ≥ 20%, ≥ 30%, ≥ 50%), achievement of a desirable pain state (e.g. no worse than mild pain), and/or a combination of change and state. Effects on pain should be accompanied by other patient-important outcomes to facilitate interpretation. When pooling data for meta-analysis, authors should consider converting all continuous measures for pain to a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and use the established minimally important difference (MID) of 10 mm, and the conventionally used appreciably important differences of 20 mm, 30 mm, and 50 mm, to facilitate interpretation. Effects ≤ 0.5 units suggest a small or very small effect. To further increase interpretability, the pooled estimate on the VAS should also be transformed to a binary outcome and expressed as a relative risk and risk difference. This transformation can be achieved by calculating the probability of experiencing a treatment effect greater than the MID and the thresholds for appreciably important differences in pain reduction.

### Targeted treatment in primary care for low back pain: The treatment system and clinical training programmes used in the IMPaCT Back study (ISRCTN 55174281) [^1155Lyj6]. Family Practice (2012). Low credibility.

The physiotherapists' training package was designed for patients in the low- and medium-risk subgroups. Approximately 30 primary care physiotherapists attended a three-day training course, followed by a clinical mentoring program. This training package was developed and delivered by a senior physiotherapist (Spinal Extended Scope Practitioner), with contributions from a musculoskeletal GPwSI, a consultant spinal orthopaedic surgeon, a consultant rheumatologist, and a disability advisor. It included pre-training reading materials and utilized a combination of lectures, interactive group discussions, paper patients (based on real LBP patients), and direct observations of patient assessments and treatments. The training was supplemented by a comprehensive manual that provided clear guidelines and treatment algorithms for evidence-based assessment and treatment of LBP patients, whether with or without leg pain.

The primary focus was on equipping physiotherapists to assess and target back pain, leg pain, co-morbid pain, and disability through evidence-based practice. Training covered the evidence-based assessment of LBP, including use and interpretation of the subgrouping tool to guide treatment. It also provided detailed information on diagnostic investigations, medication, epidural injections, and surgery related to back pain and radiculopathy. Guidelines for managing LBP in primary care were discussed, emphasizing appropriate reassurance and explanation of back pain symptoms, advice on analgesia, and maintaining or resuming usual activities.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® thoracic back pain [^114Lq71v]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). High credibility.

In specific circumstances of low back pain, particularly concerning patients with upper back pain, the ACR 2024 guidelines recommend not obtaining routine imaging in adult patients with acute, subacute, or chronic thoracic back pain without myelopathy, radiculopathy, or red flags. It is suggested to consider obtaining a thoracic spine X-ray in patients with subacute or chronic thoracic back pain.

### Corrigendum to: A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^114f95vv]. Pain Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

This is a corrigendum to: A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain, Pain Medicine, Volume 20, Issue Supplement_1, June 2019, Pages S2–S12.

It was brought to our attention by a reader that in the originally published version of this manuscript, there were two errors in Table 1.

Below is the correct information: The starting dose of Pregabalin should be listed as 75 mg PO BID, with a maximum daily dose of 600 mg. Additionally, the caution to avoid topical 8% Capsaicin for use in diabetic peripheral neuropathy has been removed.

These details have been corrected only in this corrigendum to preserve the published version of record.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^113pRvq2]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

**Interventional therapies**: The recommendations around the use of epidural injections in neuropathic pain are mixed. The American Pain Society (APS) reported that there was fair evidence and provided a weak recommendation for the use of epidural steroid injection in persistent radiculopathy due to herniated lumbar disc. The American Society for Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) concluded that there was good evidence for caudal, interlaminar, and transforaminal epidural injections, with or without steroids, for treatment of disc herniation or radiculitis. Neuropathic Pain SIG (NeuPSIG) recommendations from 2013 reported that the evidence for treatment of herpes zoster was moderate, but low for radiculopathy. They gave a "weak" recommendation for the use of epidural injections in the treatment of herpes zoster and radiculopathy. For failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) with radiculopathy, they suggested that epidural injection should be considered in patients who have incompletely responded or failed to respond to other therapies and in whom more invasive techniques are being considered. They stated that it is likely that the effects will be short-lived and that repeat injections may be needed; the frequency, timing, and required number were not prescribed.

### Low back pain and sciatica: Summary of NICE guidance [^113CM3GM]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for low back pain, specifically in relation to physical therapy, the 2017 NICE guidelines recommend considering a combined physical and psychological program. This program should incorporate a cognitive-behavioral approach, preferably in a group setting, taking into account the patient's specific needs and capabilities. It is recommended for patients with persistent low back pain (LBP) or sciatica who have substantial psychosocial obstacles to recovery, such as avoiding normal activities based on inappropriate beliefs about their condition, or if previous treatments have been ineffective.

### Psychological interventions for chronic, non-specific low back pain: Systematic review with network meta-analysis [^112nVT6h]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

To optimize co-delivery of exercise and psychological therapies at the onset of treatment, interdisciplinary or intradisciplinary approaches to treatment delivery can be feasible alternatives. In health, interdisciplinary approaches describe the coordination of different health disciplines working together to optimize care delivery, whereas intradisciplinary approaches describe single health disciplines blending skills within their own scope of practice, with concepts, methods, or techniques borrowed from other disciplines. The amount of evidence is growing suggesting that, in line with psychologically-informed practice, exercise providers (mainly physiotherapists) have the capacity to successfully incorporate psychological strategies into treatment for patients with musculoskeletal pain conditions. In clinical psychology, promotion of physical activity and movement are established as inherent components of cognitive behavioural therapy interventions for chronic pain, such as graded activity or graded exposure.

A recent systematic review with an NMA of 217 randomized controlled trials has shown that patients with LBP benefit from being encouraged to perform exercises that they enjoy. Consequently, psychologists are well situated to potentially incorporate structured exercise programs, guided by a patient's preference, into treatment. Overall, we remind exercise providers that incorporating psychological strategies into treatment is crucial for maximizing physical function or reducing pain intensity and fear avoidance. We also remind psychologists that exercise is an important component of treatment strategies.

### Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain: A joint clinical practice guideline from the American college of physicians and the American pain society [^114ybyzQ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). High credibility.

When addressing medical management for low back pain, particularly concerning general principles, the ACP/APS 2007 guidelines recommend evaluating the severity of baseline pain and functional deficits. It is important to consider potential benefits, risks, and the relative lack of long-term efficacy and safety data before initiating therapy. Offering medications with proven benefits alongside back care information and self-care is encouraged.

Search engines used during the composition of the various sections included MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, in addition to examining the reference sections of all manuscripts. There were no limitations on language or types of articles used to develop the guidelines. Experimental studies were considered for the sections on physical examination and technical parameters, while case reports were considered for sections pertaining to risk mitigation and complications. Keywords tailored to individual questions included 'facet', 'low back pain', 'zygapophysial', 'zygapophyseal', 'radiofrequency', 'denervation', 'ablation', and 'arthritis'.

- **Grading and evidence**: Conclusions for each topic were graded on a scale from A to D, or as insufficient, according to the US Preventative Services Task Force grading of evidence guidelines. The level of certainty was rated as high, medium, or low. This system, which has been modified for use in interventional pain management guidelines drafted by the American Society of Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine, American Academy of Pain Medicine, American Society of Anesthesiologists, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP), and the International Neuromodulation Society, was chosen for its flexibility in permitting high-grade recommendations even in the absence of high-quality level I studies, which are challenging to conduct for invasive procedures.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of neuropathic pain: A systematic review [^1178hpTB]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

The AGREE II instrument, an updated version of the original AGREE instrument, is an internationally recognized and rigorously developed tool used widely to assess clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). It consists of 23 key items organized into six domains: "scope and purpose" (items 1–3), "stakeholder involvement" (items 4–7), "rigor of development" (items 8–14), "clarity of presentation" (items 15–18), "applicability" (items 19–21), and "editorial independence" (items 22–23).

Each item within a domain is scored from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). A score of 1 should be given if there is no relevant information or the information is very poorly reported. Conversely, a score of 7 should be assigned when the full criteria and considerations detailed in the User's Manual have been fully met. Scores between 2 and 6 should be given if the reporting does not completely meet the specified criteria for the AGREE II item.

Three reviewers assessed each included CPG independently, providing their scores based on the overall assessment. Item scores were discussed, and any scoring discrepancies were resolved by consensus. The score for each domain was calculated using the formula: (obtained score - minimal possible score) / (maximal possible score - minimal possible score). According to AGREE II guidelines, a CPG was considered satisfactory if it scored at least 50% on all six domains.

Descriptive and statistical analyses were carried out for each domain of the AGREE II instrument.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^111NK1fd]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The objective of this review was to merge treatment guidelines and best practice recommendations for the management of neuropathic pain into a comprehensive algorithm for primary physicians. The algorithm covers assessment, multidisciplinary conservative care, nonopioid pharmacological management, interventional therapies, neurostimulation, low-dose opioid treatment, and targeted drug delivery therapy.

- **Methods**: Available literature was identified through a search of the US National Library of Medicine's Medline database, PubMed.gov. References from identified published articles were also reviewed for relevant citations.

- **Results**: The algorithm provides a comprehensive treatment pathway from assessment to the provision of first- through sixth-line therapies for primary care physicians. Clear indicators for the progression of therapy from first line to sixth line are provided. Multidisciplinary conservative care and nonopioid medications (tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentinoids, topical agents, and transdermal substances) are recommended as first-line therapy. Combination therapy (first-line medications), along with tramadol and tapentadol, is recommended as second-line treatment. Serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, anticonvulsants, NMDA antagonists, and interventional therapies are suggested as third-line options. Neurostimulation is considered a fourth-line treatment. Low-dose opioids (not exceeding 90 morphine equivalent units) are designated as fifth-line treatment. Finally, targeted drug delivery is the last-line therapy for patients with refractory pain.

- **Conclusions**: The presented treatment algorithm provides a structured approach, enabling primary care physicians to systematically address neuropathic pain management.

### Adherence to back pain clinical practice guidelines by Brazilian physical therapists: A cross-sectional study [^114VMgy7]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

This study was a cross-sectional observational analysis with two main objectives: to investigate whether Brazilian physical therapists make clinical decisions for patients with low back pain based on clinical practice guidelines, and to determine if these therapists can recognize differential diagnoses of low back pain associated with red or yellow flags.

Early adherence to clinical practice guidelines may accelerate recovery and reduce the costs associated with low back pain. However, it is unknown whether Brazilian physical therapists follow these guidelines in their clinical decisions for treating patients with low back pain.

The sample consisted of physical therapists from two Brazilian physical therapy associations. Data were collected via electronic survey and face-to-face interviews. The survey included six hypothetical clinical cases of low back pain, which were used to evaluate clinical decisions and adherence to clinical practice guidelines. Participants had 27 possible answers for each clinical case and could choose up to five. The results were analyzed to indicate full adherence, partial adherence, or no adherence to the guidelines.

A total of 530 physical therapists were invited, and 189 participated in the study, resulting in a response rate of 35.6%. Full adherence to the guidelines was low for all six cases, with rates ranging from 5% to 24%. Partial adherence to the guidelines was higher when compared to full adherence.

### Evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines in interventional pain management, part I: Introduction and general considerations [^116wktY4]. Pain Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines play essential roles in modern interventional pain management. Similar to other medical specialties in the United States, evidence-based medicine drives the search for answers to numerous questions concerning cost, quality of health care, and access to care. Scientific, relevant evidence is vital in clinical care, policy-making, dispute resolution, and law. Consequently, evidence-based practice integrates pertinent, trustworthy information by systematically acquiring, analyzing, and transferring research findings into clinical, management, and policy arenas.

In the United States, researchers, clinicians, professional organizations, and government entities are seeking a practical approach to health care by utilizing evidence-based medicine. All aspects of evidence-based practice, whether in the form of evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, meta-analysis, or guidelines, develop through a methodological and rational accumulation, analysis, and comprehension of evidentiary knowledge applicable in clinical settings.

Historically, evidence-based medicine can be traced back to the 1700s, despite not being explicitly defined and advanced until the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was initially referred to as "critical appraisal", describing the application of basic rules of evidence as they evolved into daily practices. Evidence-based medicine is defined as a conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of the best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients.

### Comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for facet joint interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) Guidelines Facet Joint Interventions 2020 guidelines [^115HmUgK]. Pain Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic axial spinal pain is one of the major causes of significant disability and health care costs, with facet joints as one of the proven causes of pain.

- **Objective**: To provide evidence-based guidance in performing diagnostic and therapeutic facet joint interventions.

- **Methods**: The methodology utilized included the development of objectives and key questions with the utilization of trustworthy standards. The literature pertaining to all aspects of facet joint interventions was reviewed, with a best evidence synthesis of available literature and utilization of grading for recommendations.

- **Summary of evidence and recommendations**:

- **Non-interventional diagnosis**:
	- The level of evidence is II in selecting patients for facet joint nerve blocks at least 3 months after onset and failure of conservative management, with a strong strength of recommendation for physical examination and clinical assessment.
	- The level of evidence is IV for the accurate diagnosis of facet joint pain with physical examination based on symptoms and signs, with weak strength of recommendation.

- **Imaging**:
	- The level of evidence is I with a strong strength of recommendation for mandatory fluoroscopic or computed tomography (CT) guidance for all facet joint interventions.
	- The level of evidence is III with a weak strength of recommendation for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
	- The level of evidence is V with a weak strength of recommendation for scintigraphy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT).

- **Interventional diagnosis**:
	- **Lumbar spine**: The level of evidence is I to II.

### An introduction to an evidence-based approach to interventional techniques in the management of chronic spinal pain [^1158WHSm]. Pain Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Practice guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioners and patients in making decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances. Clinical practice guidelines present statements of best practice based on a thorough evaluation of the evidence from published studies on the outcomes of treatment. In November 1989, Congress mandated the creation of the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (AHCPR). AHCPR was given broad responsibility for supporting research, data development, and related activities. Associated with this mandate, the National Academy of Sciences published a document indicating that guidelines are expected to enhance the quality, appropriateness, and effectiveness of health care services.

- **Conflicts in terminology and technique**: Guidelines as a whole have been characterized by multiple conflicts in terminology and technique. These conflicts are notable for the confusion they create and for what they reflect about differences in values, experiences, and interest among different parties.

Despite this confusion, public and private development of guidelines is growing exponentially. There are only limited means to coordinate these guidelines in order to resolve inconsistencies, fill in gaps, track applications and results, and assess the soundness of individual guidelines. Significant diversity exists in clinical practice guidelines. The inconsistency amongst guidelines arises from variations in values, tolerance for risks, preferences, expertise, and conflicts of interest.

In 2000, the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) first…

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline: Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^112pGDGa]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

In September 2017, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) approved the joint Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for the diagnosis and management of low back pain. This CPG was intended to provide healthcare providers with a framework to evaluate, treat, and manage patients with low back pain (LBP).

- **Methods**: The VA/DoD Evidence-Based Practice Work Group convened a joint VA/DoD guideline development effort. This included a multidisciplinary panel of practicing clinician stakeholders and conformed to the Institute of Medicine's tenets for trustworthy clinical practice guidelines. The guideline panel developed key questions in collaboration with the ECRI Institute, which systematically searched and evaluated the literature through September 2016. An algorithm was developed, and recommendations were rated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. A patient focus group was also convened to ensure patient values and perspectives were considered when formulating preferences and shared decision-making in the guideline.

- **Recommendations**: The VA/DoD LBP CPG provides evidence-based recommendations for the diagnostic approach, education and self-care, non-pharmacologic and non-invasive therapy, pharmacologic therapy, dietary supplements, non-surgical invasive therapy, and team approach to the treatment of low back pain.

### Evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines in interventional pain management: part 5. Diagnostic accuracy studies [^116JoMRo]. Pain Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Diagnosis is a critical component of health care. The world of diagnostic tests is highly dynamic. New tests are developed at a fast pace, and the technology of existing tests is continuously being improved. However, clinicians, policymakers, and patients routinely face a range of questions regarding diagnostic tests. Well-designed diagnostic test accuracy studies can help in making these decisions, provided that they transparently and fully report their participants, tests, methods, and results, as facilitated by the standards for the reporting of diagnostic accuracy studies (STARD) statement. Exaggerated and biased results from poorly designed and reported diagnostic test studies can trigger their premature dissemination and lead physicians into making incorrect treatment decisions. Thus, a diagnostic test is useful only to the extent that it distinguishes between conditions or disorders that might otherwise be confused. While almost any test can differentiate healthy persons from severely affected ones, appropriate diagnostic tests should differentiate mild and moderate forms of disease. Shortcomings in a study's design and interpretation can affect estimates of diagnostic accuracy. Thus, quality diagnostic studies are essential in medicine in general and interventional pain management in particular. The STARD initiative was developed to improve accuracy and completeness in the reporting of studies of diagnostic accuracy and provide guidance to assist in reducing the potential for bias in the study and to evaluate a study's generalizability.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^115m8Lkc]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

For effective therapy, patient selection is crucial. Patients with localized pain are likely to respond best to TDD (e.g. axial back pain, focal abdominal pain, or dermatomal pain), whereas those with diffuse (e.g. entire extremity), global, and whole-body pain are less likely to respond well. This is due to the limited spread of drugs in the cerebrospinal fluid. There are some patients who may benefit from a trial of TDD before neurostimulation, but in general, the higher safety profile of neurostimulation places it ahead of TDD in a neuropathic pain algorithm. For select patients, due to ziconotide's safety profile, intrathecal ziconotide may be considered before initiating oral opioids. However, in most cases, TDD should be considered after low-dose oral opioid therapy has failed to provide adequate pain relief.

### Clinician education unlikely effective for guideline-adherent medication prescription in low back pain: Systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs [^116Yae6f]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

The majority (93%) of evidence-based primary care clinical guidelines recommend the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for non-specific low back pain of any symptom duration. However, the appropriateness of all other medications based on class and duration of symptoms is debated. For example, while 57% of guidelines recommend paracetamol, 36% recommend against it. The majority of guidelines (87%) recommend low potency opioids for short durations if first-line therapies provide no improvement. However, countries such as Australia and Denmark are firmly against the use of opioids for non-specific low back pain. Notably, as these guidelines tend to be designed for use in the general practice setting, it is likely that these opioid recommendations overlook the fact that patients presenting in the emergency department setting will often have greater pain intensity and therefore warrant stronger pain relief.

Other medications that remain debated by guidelines include antidepressants, muscle relaxants, and herbal medicines. For radicular low back pain, medication recommendations are less established, which stems from the lack of large blinded clinical trials; neuropathic agents may, or may not, provide benefits for radicular low back pain.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults: A clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians [^1112ppNB]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations on the nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults in the outpatient setting. The guidance is based on the best available evidence about benefits and harms, considered in the context of costs and patient values and preferences. This guideline does not address noninvasive treatment of low back pain, which is covered by a separate ACP guideline and endorsed by AAFP.

- **Methods**: This guideline is based on a systematic evidence review on the comparative efficacy and safety of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults in the outpatient setting, and a systematic review on the predictors of prolonged opioid use. We evaluated the following clinical outcomes using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system: pain (at ≤ 2 hours and at 1 to 7 days), physical function, symptom relief, treatment satisfaction, and adverse events.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is adults with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries.

- **Recommendation**: ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries with topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with or without menthol gel as first-line therapy.

### The IPA, a modified numerical system for pain assessment and intervention [^115XcCrD]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

The NRS is a validated tool for assessing the severity of pain the patient is experiencing; however, the hypothesis of this study questions its utility and accuracy in providing a clear depiction of that severity because of the arbitrary numerical system. The assumptions that arise from a high or low score on the NRS have the potential to lead to erroneous pain prescriptions. Because of the highly subjective nature of pain and the pain experience, a fundamental problem arises when the patient is confined to a nondescriptive unidimensional scale, and the physician heavily relies on the response to this scale to guide the pain management process.

Studies have highlighted how the responses to the NRS are not enough to aid in pain treatment. A recent study describing patients' feelings toward the NRS exhibits the discrepancies in scoring because patients incorporate more factors outside of pain when selecting a score. Patients expressed a fear of not being believed because of a higher pain rating. This study also found that a wide range of pain scores denoted when the pain was unbearable. A patient who rates their pain as 5 of 10, for example, may deem that pain as bearable; however, that same pain intensity could possibly be considered as unbearable pain for another patient. They also communicated a lack of understanding of how physicians used this arbitrary number in pain management and feared that it was compared with other patients' pain scores. Some patients fear selecting a number on the various unidimensional scales that does not provide them with an accurate representation of their pain experience.

### EAU guidelines on pain management [^1169uEmF]. European Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Pain is the most common symptom of any illness. The physician's therapeutic task is twofold: to discover and treat the cause of pain, and the pain itself, whether or not the underlying cause is treatable, to provide relief and reduce the suffering caused by pain. Although we use the term "pain" to define all sensations that hurt or are unpleasant, two distinct types of pain exist. The first, nociceptive pain, is associated with tissue damage or inflammation. The second, neuropathic pain, results from a lesion to the peripheral or central nervous systems. Pain can also be classified as acute or chronic.

There are two main settings where caregivers face pain: after surgery and in cancer patients. These tasks require a multidisciplinary team capable of properly assessing and treating pain. Postoperative pain should be treated early and aggressively. Several drug options are available and should be tailored to the surgical procedure and the patient. Pain in cancer patients encompasses different aspects; it can be caused by the cancer itself or may be secondary to muscular spasm or cancer treatments. Management primarily involves pharmacotherapy, but primary treatments such as surgery, radiochemotherapy, or even antibiotics can provide adequate relief.

- **Pain management strategies**:
	- Analgesics should be employed according to an ascending scale, but other options can be combined to improve the outcome when a satisfactory balance between relief and side effects is not achieved. These include invasive techniques, physical therapy, and psychological therapy. The mainstay of pain management is interdisciplinary cooperation, requiring collaboration among various healthcare professionals to effectively address patient needs.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. Part I: Introduction and general considerations [^113moCN7]. Pain Physician (2013). Low credibility.

In 2011, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) re-engineered its definition of clinical guidelines as follows: "clinical practice guidelines are statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care that are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefit and harms of alternative care options". This new definition departs from a two-decade-old definition from a 1990 IOM report that defined guidelines as "systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances". The revised definition clearly distinguishes between the term "clinical practice guideline" and other forms of clinical guidance derived from widely disparate development processes, such as consensus statements, expert advice, and appropriate use criteria.

The IOM committee acknowledged that for many clinical domains, high-quality evidence was lacking or even nonexistent. Even though the guidelines are important decision-making tools, along with expert clinical judgment and patient preference, their value and impact remain variable due to numerous factors. Some factors that impede the development of clinical practice guidelines include bias from various conflicts of interest, inappropriate and poor methodological quality, poor writing and ambiguous presentation, and the projection that these guidelines are not applicable to individual patients or are too restrictive with the elimination of clinician autonomy. Additionally, overzealous and inappropriate recommendations, either positive or negative, further affect their utility.

### Interventional therapies, surgery, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation for low back pain: An evidence-based clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Society [^1144ayFA]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

- **Study design**: Clinical practice guideline.

- **Objective**: To develop evidence-based recommendations on the use of interventional diagnostic tests and therapies, surgeries, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation for low back pain of any duration, with or without leg pain.

- **Summary of background data**: Management of patients with persistent and disabling low back pain remains a clinical challenge. A number of interventional diagnostic tests, therapies, and surgeries are available, and their use is increasing, but in some cases, their utility remains uncertain or controversial. Interdisciplinary rehabilitation has also been proposed as a potentially effective noninvasive intervention for persistent and disabling low back pain.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel was convened by the American Pain Society. Its recommendations were based on a systematic review that focused on evidence from randomized controlled trials. Recommendations were graded using methods adapted from the US Preventive Services Task Force and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group.

- **Results**: Investigators reviewed 3348 abstracts. A total of 161 randomized trials were deemed relevant to the recommendations in this guideline. The panel developed a total of 8 recommendations.

- **Conclusion**: Recommendations on the use of interventional diagnostic tests and therapies, surgery, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation are presented. Due to important trade-offs between potential benefits, harms, costs, and burdens of alternative therapies, shared decision-making is an important component of the guideline.

### Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain: A joint clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society [^1144jTXr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). High credibility.

The ACP/APS 2007 guidelines recommend considering nonpharmacologic therapy with proven benefits for the medical management of low back pain, particularly regarding general principles. For acute low back pain (LBP), spinal manipulation is advised. For chronic or subacute LBP, options include intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, spinal manipulation, yoga, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or progressive relaxation in patients who do not respond to self-care options.

### Development of evidence-based recommendations for procedure-specific pain management: PROSPECT methodology [^112h2Nra]. Anaesthesia (2019). Low credibility.

The PROSPECT sub-group determines if each intervention should be recommended or not recommended. To be recommended, the intervention must be shown to be beneficial in at least two RCTs. Studies are not excluded from the review based on the risk of bias scoring. Additionally, to ensure clinical relevance, the relevance to peri-operative practice is assessed. We also evaluate whether the intervention would improve postoperative pain relief and/or outcomes when added to the 'basic analgesic regimen' or if it would be beneficial in cases where this regimen is not possible or is contraindicated. Furthermore, the balance between the invasiveness of the analgesic technique and the consequences of postoperative pain, as well as the balance between analgesic efficacy and the adverse event profile of the analgesic technique, is considered. Relevant patient characteristics (e.g. opioid tolerance and psychiatric comorbidities) may be included to address not only procedure-specific but also patient-specific aspects of pain management.

Notably, efficacy data from 'similar' procedures are not used for recommendations. Adverse effects of analgesic interventions are identified through an extensive literature search, which is not procedure-specific, though risks are adjusted for the procedure being evaluated. Case-control studies, cohort studies, or observational studies can be used to determine the adverse effects of analgesic interventions.

Finally, a draft table or algorithm of the recommendations for analgesic, anaesthetic, or surgical interventions is prepared with each recommendation.

### Evidence-based interventional pain management: Principles, problems, potential and applications [^117YDq14]. Pain Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The past decade has been marked by unprecedented interest in evidence-based medicine (EBM) and a focus on using innovative methods and protocols to provide valid and reliable information for and about healthcare. It is claimed that healthcare decisions are increasingly based on research-derived evidence, rather than on expert opinion or clinical experience alone. However, this quest for evidence to support clinical practice raises questions about whether the methods employed to acquire information, the ranking of information that is acquired, and the prudent use of this information are sound enough to sustain the validity of an evidence-based paradigm in practice.

Moreover, it is becoming apparent that the scope, depth, and applicability of available evidence to effectively and ethically guide the myriad of situational decisions in clinical practice are not uniform across all medical fields or disciplines. In particular, comprehensive evidence synthesis or complete guidelines for clinical decision-making in interventional pain management remain relatively scarce.

EBM is defined as the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of the best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. Thus, the practice of EBM requires the integration of individual clinical expertise with the best available external evidence from systematic research. To arrive at evidence-based medical decisions, all valid and relevant evidence should be considered alongside randomized controlled trials and patient preferences.

### Does a diagnostic classification algorithm help to predict the course of low back pain? A study of Danish chiropractic patients with 1-year follow-up [^116gH69g]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

A diagnostic classification algorithm, "the Petersen classification", consisting of 12 categories based on a standardized examination protocol, was developed for the primary purpose of identifying clinically homogeneous subgroups of individuals with low back pain (LBP).

- **Objectives**: To investigate whether a diagnostic classification algorithm is associated with activity limitation and LBP intensity at follow-up assessments of 2 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year, and whether the algorithm improves outcome prediction when added to a set of known predictors.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective observational study of 934 consecutive adult patients with new episodes of LBP who were visiting chiropractic practices in primary care and categorized according to the Petersen classification. Outcomes were disability and pain intensity measured with questionnaires at 2 weeks and 3 months, and 1-year trajectories of LBP based on weekly responses to text messages. Associations were analyzed with linear and logistic regression models. In a subgroup of patients, the numbers of visits to primary and secondary care were described.

- **Results**: The Petersen classification was statistically significantly associated with all outcomes (p < 0.001) but explained very little of the variance (R² = 0.00–0.05). Patients in the nerve root involvement category had the most pain and activity limitation and the most visits to primary and secondary care. Patients in the myofascial pain category were the least affected.

- **Conclusion**: The Petersen classification was not helpful in determining individual prognosis.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^112YxJqA]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

This article presents an evidence-based algorithm to assist primary care providers with the diagnosis and management of lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults. It is part of a series that focuses on coexisting pain patterns and contributors to chronic low back pain (CLBP) in the aging population. The objective of the series is to encourage clinicians to take a holistic approach when evaluating and treating CLBP in older adults.

A content expert panel and a primary care panel collaboratively used the modified Delphi approach to iteratively develop an evidence-based diagnostic and treatment algorithm. The panelists included physiatrists, geriatricians, internists, and physical therapists who treat both civilians and Veterans. The algorithm was developed so that all required resources are available within the Veterans Health Administration system. An illustrative patient case was chosen from one of the author's clinical practices to demonstrate the reasoning behind principles presented in the algorithm.

An algorithm was developed which logically outlines evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults. A case is presented which highlights the potential complexities of identifying the true pain generator and the importance of implementing proper treatment.

Lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults can contribute to and coexist with CLBP. Distinguishing the true cause(s) of pain from potentially a myriad of asymptomatic degenerative changes can be challenging.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of neuropathic pain: A systematic review [^1171tnuQ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), defined as "statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care that are informed by a systematic review of the evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options", have been expected to facilitate more consistent, effective, and efficient medical practice and ultimately improve health outcomes. Many organizations worldwide have published CPGs on similar topics over the past several decades; however, their quality has been found to vary greatly, raising concerns about the quality of CPGs.

Neuropathic pain (NP), caused by a somatosensory lesion or various diseases, comprises a wide range of heterogeneous conditions. NP affects millions of people worldwide, with an estimated prevalence in the general population as high as 7–8%. Generally, NP is chronic, severe, and resistant to over-the-counter analgesics, making its management challenging. To improve the management of NP, several bodies, including the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS), the Canadian Pain Society Special Interest Group on Neuropathic Pain (NePSIG), the Assessment Committee of the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), as well as an expert panel from the Middle East region (MER), Latin America (LA), and South Africa (SA), have developed the CPG for the management of NP.

In the present study, we systematically reviewed the available CPGs for NP, focusing on their methodological aspects.

### Low back pain and sciatica: Summary of NICE guidance [^112BNubN]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for low back pain, specifically concerning differential diagnosis, NICE 2017 guidelines recommend excluding specific causes of low back pain, such as cancer, infection, trauma, or inflammatory diseases like spondyloarthritis, when assessing patients with low back pain, particularly if there is a change in symptoms.

### Evidence synthesis and development of guidelines in interventional pain management [^1145Kfbe]. Pain Physician (2005). Low credibility.

The past decade has seen unprecedented interest in evidence-based medicine and various avenues that can provide valid and reliable information about healthcare, including clinical practice guidelines. Consequently, healthcare decisions are increasingly based on research-based evidence rather than expert opinion or clinical experience alone. Methods describing evidence synthesis or development of guidelines in interventional pain management are scarce.

To describe the methods of evidence synthesis and development of guidelines, this review seeks to provide an understanding of evidence-based medicine, the importance and synthesis of clinical practice guidelines, and various issues related to rating the quality of individual articles. This includes understanding narrative and systematic reviews, grading the strength of the evidence, searching for evidence, and finally, the analytical preparation of guidelines, with a focus on interventional pain management.

- **Conclusion**: Evidence synthesis and development of guidelines in interventional pain management is a complex and difficult task. It is emphasized that practice guidelines are not intended as standards or absolute requirements. Consequently, practice guidelines may be adapted, modified, or rejected according to the clinical needs and constraints of each practitioner and patient.

### A proposed treatment algorithm for low back pain secondary to Bertolotti's syndrome [^113ZMwR6]. Pain Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Chronic low back pain is widely prevalent, and there are a range of conditions that may result in it. Generally, treatment begins with conservative management, such as medications, physical therapy, and home exercise regimens. If these conservative measures fail, various interventional techniques can be employed. An uncommonly recognized cause of back pain is Bertolotti's syndrome, which results from lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (LSTV). LSTV is a congenital abnormality that is characterized by either the lumbarization of the sacrum, where the first sacral bone fails to fuse with the rest of the sacrum, or the sacralization of the lumbar spine, where the L5 vertebra fuses with the sacrum, creating a longer sacrum. In many cases, the condition can be recognized by imaging techniques such as x-ray, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging.

- **Objectives**: To propose a treatment algorithm for patients with low back pain secondary to Bertolotti's syndrome.

- **Study design**: Case study and treatment algorithm proposal.

- **Methods**: A treatment algorithm for patients with low back pain secondary to Bertolotti's syndrome involves starting with local anesthetic and steroid injection of the pseudo-articulation, followed by radiofrequency ablation of the pseudo-articulation, and then complete endoscopic resection of the pseudo joint.

- **Results**: The proposed stepwise treatment guideline has the ability to diagnose Bertolotti's syndrome as the cause of low back pain and provide symptomatic relief.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: Lateral hip and thigh pain [^116Lmq5o]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

This article presents an evidence-based algorithm to assist primary care providers with the diagnosis and management of lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults. It is part of a series that focuses on coexisting pain patterns and contributors to chronic low back pain (CLBP) in the aging population. The objective of the series is to encourage clinicians to take a holistic approach when evaluating and treating CLBP in older adults.

- **Methods**: A content expert panel and a primary care panel collaboratively used the modified Delphi approach to iteratively develop an evidence-based diagnostic and treatment algorithm. The panelists included physiatrists, geriatricians, internists, and physical therapists who treat both civilians and Veterans, and the algorithm was developed so that all required resources are available within the Veterans Health Administration system. An illustrative patient case was chosen from one of the author's clinical practices to demonstrate the reasoning behind principles presented in the algorithm.

- **Results**: An algorithm was developed which logically outlines evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults. A case is presented which highlights the potential complexities of identifying the true pain generator and the importance of implementing proper treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults can contribute to and coexist with CLBP. Distinguishing the true cause(s) of pain from potentially a myriad of asymptomatic degenerative changes can be challenging, but a systematic approach is essential for proper treatment.

### Evidence for managing chronic low back pain in primary care: A review of recommendations from high-quality clinical practice guidelines [^116BTpBk]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic low back pain represents a major problem throughout the world, which is increasing largely because of the aging global population. Clinical practice guidelines can be powerful tools for promoting evidence-based practice, as they integrate research findings in order to support decision-making. This study aimed to review recommendations for the management of chronic low back pain in primary care based on high-quality, recent, and recently updated clinical practice guidelines.

The databases CINHAL, PubMed, EMBASE, PEDro, Google Scholar, Government websites, and Scientific Association websites were searched until April 2019. The retrieved documents underwent several consecutive selection steps, including semi-automated duplicate screening and document selection based on title and abstract screening. Finally, three independent investigators screened the documents for the selected inclusion criteria and reviewed the retrieved documents using the AGREE II instrument.

A total of 3055 records were retrieved, of which 10 clinical practice guidelines met the inclusion criteria. The overall quality of these clinical practice guidelines was moderately variable. The recommendations of four clinical practice guidelines deemed as "excellent" were extracted and summarized. Although we tried to implement the most comprehensive research strategies, some clinical practice guidelines may be missing due to publication bias or incomplete indexing.

This study showed partial progress regarding the methodological quality of the clinical practice guidelines. Several AGREE II assessment outcomes reflect this evolution.

### Aaapt: Assessment of the acute pain trajectory [^111e6jE8]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Pain trajectory patterns in the subacute phase (i.e. beyond 7 days but less than 3 months) further impact clinical decision-making. Assessment of subacute pain trajectories can identify patients with ongoing treatment needs, optimize resource allocation, and detect early patterns of recovery that may indicate the emergence of pain persistence. Monitoring the pain trajectory into the subacute period to distinguish rapid or expected patterns of pain resolution from slower resolution (i.e. slower improvement or worsening pain) can identify patients who may benefit from intensive rehabilitative treatment. This can guide clinicians in treatment stratification — for example, matching more intensive physical and psychological therapies to these patients who demonstrate slower recovery.

### Noninvasive treatments for acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116GQ8q6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for low back pain, with specific emphasis on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the ACP 2017 guidelines recommend offering NSAIDs as first-line therapy for patients with acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain, if pharmacotherapy is desired.

### Stratification of patients based on the neuropathic pain symptom inventory: Development and validation of a new algorithm [^112R4C1U]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

The personalization of neuropathic pain treatment could be improved by identifying specific sensory phenotypes, that is, specific combinations of symptoms and signs predictive of the response to different classes of drugs. A simple and reliable phenotyping method is required for such a strategy. We investigated the utility of an algorithm for stratifying patients into clusters corresponding to specific combinations of neuropathic symptoms assessed with the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI).

Consistent with previous results, we first confirmed, in a cohort of 628 patients, the existence of a structure consisting of three clusters of patients characterized by higher NPSI scores for pinpointed pain (cluster 1), evoked pain (cluster 2), or deep pain (cluster 3). From these analyses, we derived a specific algorithm for assigning each patient to one of these three clusters.

We then assessed the clinical relevance of this algorithm for predicting treatment response through post hoc analyses of two previous controlled trials of the effects of subcutaneous injections of botulinum toxin A. Each of the 97 patients with neuropathic pain included in these studies was individually allocated to one cluster by applying the algorithm to their baseline NPSI responses. We found significant effects of botulinum toxin A relative to placebo in clusters 2 and 3, but not in cluster 1, suggesting that this approach was, indeed, relevant.

Finally, we developed and performed a preliminary validation of a web-based version of the NPSI and algorithm for the stratification of patients.

### An updated overview of clinical guidelines for the management of non-specific low back pain in primary care [^112tRWkk]. European Spine Journal (2010). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to present and compare the content of (inter)national clinical guidelines for the management of low back pain. To rationalize the management of low back pain, evidence-based clinical guidelines have been issued in many countries. Given that the available scientific evidence is the same, irrespective of the country, one would expect these guidelines to include more or less similar recommendations regarding diagnosis and treatment.

We updated a previous review that included clinical guidelines published up to and including the year 2000. Guidelines were included that met the following criteria: The target group consisted mainly of primary health care professionals, and the guideline was published in English, German, Finnish, Spanish, Norwegian, or Dutch. Only one guideline per country was included: the one most recently published. This updated review includes national clinical guidelines from 13 countries and 2 international clinical guidelines from Europe published from 2000 until 2008.

The content of the guidelines appeared to be quite similar regarding the diagnostic classification (diagnostic triage) and the use of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Consistent features for acute low back pain were the early and gradual activation of patients, the discouragement of prescribed bed rest, and the recognition of psychosocial factors as risk factors for chronicity. For chronic low back pain, consistent features included supervised exercises, cognitive behavioural therapy, and multidisciplinary treatment.

### The development of clinical guidelines and guidance statements by the Clinical Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians: Update of methods [^114VT8PH]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) was one of the first organizations in the United States to develop evidence-based clinical guidelines and has been developing guidelines since 1981. The ACP's Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC), in collaboration with staff from the Clinical Policy department, develops clinical guidelines and guidance statements and continues to refine and enhance its methodology. This article presents an update of the CGC's 2010 paper outlining policies, methods, and presentation format of ACP's clinical guidelines and guidance statements. Updated methods include more stringent policies about disclosure of interests and conflict management; inclusion of public perspective; full adoption of GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods; more standardized reporting formats that consider the value of care, patient comorbid conditions, patient values and preferences, and costs; and further clarification of guidance statement methods.

### Methods for pragmatic randomized clinical trials of pain therapies: IMMPACT statement [^115AsxLj]. Pain (2024). High credibility.

- **Treatment standardization and fidelity monitoring**: Although uncommon in real-world clinical pain management, authors have repeatedly called for some standardization or protocolization of study treatments in pragmatic trials, monitoring of fidelity, and detailed reporting of intervention content. Especially in trials of nonpharmacological interventions, provider expertise and style of practice require consideration, balancing the need for a representative range of skillsets with acceptable levels of heterogeneity in treatment delivery.

Furthermore, clinical practice may not always follow evidence-based guidance, implying that provider training may be required, introducing elements of standardization into a trial. The extent to which treatment flexibility needs to be controlled depends on the research question and the specifics of the intervention; opportunities to train and oversee clinicians may also be limited in trials that take place in real-world settings. Notably, dosage safety and therapeutic ranges are important to consider in drug trials, while the potential to introduce undesired heterogeneity through practitioners and intervention complexity is more pertinent in nonpharmacological therapies.

However, any standardization of treatment delivery, for example, through trial-specific training and protocolization, ought to be well justified. If training and standardization exceed what is seen in the routine practice of a given intervention, this needs to be clearly identified and implications for a trial's generalizability discussed.

### New developments in the treatment algorithm for peripheral neuropathic pain [^111nxpTr]. Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain often imposes a substantial and unrelenting burden on individuals who experience it; single-agent analgesics typically only reduce pain at best. Worldwide, five sets of treatment recommendations offer insight into managing neuropathic pain, including two European guidelines, one Canadian, one Latin American, and another constructed under the auspices of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). The analgesics common to these guidelines are topical lidocaine, secondary amine tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin and norepinephrine dual reuptake inhibitors, calcium channel α(2)-δ ligands, tramadol, and opioid antagonists.

Significant knowledge gaps in the treatment of neuropathic pain conditions have hampered the development of algorithms and multimodal approaches. However, as the evidence base expands, the addition of new comparative trial data will further refine the development of new guidance for clinical management of neuropathic pain. New alternatives for managing neuropathic pain, such as the high-concentration capsaicin patch, will enlarge the treatment armamentarium and potentially impact therapeutic guidelines.

### Clinical decision rules for identification of low back pain patients with neurologic involvement in primary care [^116xUmGx]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

This descriptive study aimed to compare clinical decision rules in low back pain guidelines for the identification of neurologic involvement. Low back pain guidelines have been developed in various countries. These guidelines include clinical decision rules for identifying neurologic involvement, a crucial aspect of the assessment of patients with low back pain in primary care. Previously, broad variations in recommended clinical assessments have been identified. A more specific investigation of these assessments seems warranted since guidelines play a vital role in facilitating the accurate and timely identification of neurologic involvement in patients presenting with low back pain in primary care.

- **Methods**: Guidelines included in this study met the following criteria: they contained clinical decision rules for low back pain assessments, recommended clinical management strategies for low back pain in primary care, and were available in English.

- **Results**: The guidelines identified three categories of neurologic involvement: cauda equina syndrome, nerve root syndrome, and spinal stenosis. Notably, cauda equina syndrome was the only category included in all guidelines. Some guidelines omitted spinal stenosis, or both nerve root syndrome and spinal stenosis. Decision factors for category assignment were generally consistent for cauda equina syndrome. Nerve root syndrome was agreed to be characterized by conduction block in sensory and motor nerves and pain on straight leg raise.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment: Part X: Sacroiliac joint syndrome [^1126EECG]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

To present an algorithm of sequential treatment options for managing sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain in the setting of chronic low back pain (CLBP) in the older adult, this section is the tenth part in a series and includes an illustrative clinical case.

- **Methods**: The stepped care drug table and evaluation and treatment algorithm were created following a thorough literature review of approaches and a subsequent analysis through a modified Delphi process. The principal investigator developed the initial draft, which was refined for content by an interdisciplinary panel of five experts. The refined materials were then assessed for the feasibility of implementation and validity of recommendations for older adults in a primary care setting by a panel of nine primary care providers. While not exclusive to Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) facilities, an emphasis was made to include resources and medications available to providers in the VHA.

- **Results**: The algorithm and drug table developed to systematically identify and address SIJ pain in the older adult is presented here. The process should begin with recognizing the presenting symptoms of CLBP stemming from the SI region, and supporting physical exam testing using the compression test and thigh thrust maneuver. Identification of the SIJ as a pain generator is followed by assessment and treatment of contributory factors. SIJ pain treatment should begin with education and self-management, including exercise, and may escalate to include interventional procedures and/or referral to a pain rehabilitation program.

### Chronic low back pain in adults: Evaluation and management [^115vv67U]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for low back pain, specifically with respect to epidural injections, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend considering offering epidural corticosteroid injections. These injections can provide a slight reduction in short-term pain and disability for patients with radicular pain, although they are recognized as not being effective in the long term.

### Multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation for chronic low back pain: Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^116qnjL9]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

Referral of a patient with chronic low back pain for multidisciplinary rehabilitation, as opposed to usual care or a physical treatment, is likely to confer a benefit in terms of reduced pain and disability that endures beyond one year. Compared with physical treatments, multidisciplinary rehabilitation is also likely to confer a benefit in terms of the likelihood of being at work a year later.

These modest effects should be weighed against the monetary costs and time commitments associated with multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs. Although our subgroup analysis regarding the influence of symptom severity was inconclusive, referring only those patients with major physical and psychological effects of low back pain to multidisciplinary rehabilitation would seem reasonable, given the intervention costs.

Multidisciplinary rehabilitation is an umbrella term applied to programs that adhere to the biopsychosocial conceptualization of chronic pain and include more than just a physical treatment. Substantial variation may exist in the approach used by a particular clinic or program, the intensity of each component, and the skill and experience of the clinicians delivering the program. Our findings show that a coordinated intervention covering several domains of the biopsychosocial model and delivered by clinicians from different backgrounds is more likely to benefit patients with chronic low back pain in the long term than is usual care or physical treatment alone. We recognize that access to dedicated centers that offer quality multidisciplinary rehabilitation is crucial for these benefits to be realized.

### Low back pain and sciatica: Summary of NICE guidance [^117JnJgu]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for low back pain, and more specifically with respect to physical therapy, the NICE 2017 guidelines recommend considering offering a group exercise program. This program can include biomechanical, aerobic, mind-body, or a combination of approaches for patients experiencing a specific episode or flare-up of low back pain (LBP) with or without sciatica. It is important to take into account the patient's specific needs, preferences, and capabilities when offering these programs.
