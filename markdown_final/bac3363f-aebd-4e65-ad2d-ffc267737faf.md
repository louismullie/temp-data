## Question

Alzheimer's blood tests

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the current status, performance, and appropriate use of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease, including how to interpret results, where they fit in the diagnostic pathway, and what uncertainties remain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why blood biomarkers are needed now. Then, I should verify which blood biomarkers have the strongest evidence and how they perform against reference standards. Next, I will review guideline-based recommendations for triage versus confirmatory use and the performance thresholds that underpin them. After that, I need to check implementation details, including pretest probability, pre-analytical and analytical variability, and equity considerations. Finally, I will consider limitations, edge cases, and how to counsel patients, and I will close with a practical, stepwise approach clinicians can adopt while the evidence continues to evolve.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Alzheimer's disease remains the leading cause of dementia, and diagnosis based on symptoms alone is imprecise, with substantial misdiagnosis rates in both specialist and primary care settings, which is why biomarkers are increasingly necessary to anchor etiologic diagnosis and to determine eligibility for disease-modifying therapies that require confirmation of amyloid pathology, such as lecanemab and donanemab [^114ZpfmG] [^111ocvQU]. Hold on, I should verify the scope of current guidance: the Alzheimer's Association's 2025 Clinical Practice Guideline explicitly addresses individuals with objective cognitive impairment in specialized care and does not extend to screening asymptomatic individuals or to primary care workflows, which remain outside this first iteration of recommendations [^112bdG3G] [^112yPbga].

> Next, I should review which blood biomarkers have the most robust evidence. Plasma p-tau217 and the Aβ42/40 ratio consistently show the strongest diagnostic performance for detecting amyloid pathology, with p-tau181 and p-tau231 also informative but generally less accurate than p-tau217. Neurofilament light chain and GFAP can add prognostic and staging information but are not primary diagnostic markers for amyloid or tau pathology at this time [^114jdg6s]. Wait, let me verify a potential pitfall: I initially thought p-tau217 directly measures tau tangles. Hmm, wait a minute, that's not quite right — p-tau217 correlates strongly with amyloid burden and is a surrogate of amyloid-driven tau phosphorylation rather than a direct measure of fibrillar tau tangles, which are better captured by tau-PET, so I should correct that interpretation to avoid overstatement [^114jdg6s] [^113KxC4f].

> I will now examine performance characteristics and variability. Across 31 different BBM tests evaluated in the AA systematic review, pooled sensitivity ranged from roughly 49% to 91% and specificity from 62% to 97%, underscoring substantial inter-assay variability and the need to treat each test as distinct rather than interchangeable [^1158hvi2] [^114tNrmn]. Hold on, I should verify the certainty of evidence: the panel rated certainty as low to very low for most tests due to risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision, which means point estimates can shift with new data and that brand-agnostic, performance-based guidance is prudent rather than endorsing specific assays [^116xAxuH] [^112XvENx].

> Next, I should review the guideline's two-tiered use model. For triage, the panel suggests BBM tests with at least 90% sensitivity and 75% specificity can be used to rule out AD pathology when negative, with positive results confirmed by CSF or amyloid PET; for confirmatory use, BBM tests with at least 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity can substitute for CSF or PET to establish amyloid pathology, provided the clinical context supports AD as the leading diagnosis [^1139oQev] [^112Wa7jb]. I need to ensure I'm precise about pretest probability effects: at 20% pretest probability, a 90% sensitivity, 75% specificity test yields a PPV near 47% and an NPV near 97%, whereas at 80% pretest probability, PPV rises to about 94% and NPV falls to about 65%, which is why pretest probability materially alters the meaning of a positive or negative result [^111yJxDW] [^1127KXSZ].

> Let me consider implementation details. I should confirm that BBM testing should occur only after a comprehensive clinical evaluation and be interpreted within that clinical context. Pretest probability should guide ordering and counseling, and results should not be used as a standalone diagnostic shortcut or for screening asymptomatic individuals, given the risk of false positives and mislabeling [^117TvFcx] [^112bdG3G]. I need to check analytical variability: many studies used single-batch processing, whereas real-world clinical labs process samples in rolling batches; small imprecision, especially for analytes with modest fold changes like Aβ42/40, can misclassify patients at fixed cutoffs, so labs should monitor coefficients of variation and clinicians should interpret borderline results cautiously [^112hKpft] [^111vGy4M].

> But wait, what about equity and access. The guideline highlights that without deliberate efforts, BBMs could widen disparities due to cost, infrastructure, and underrepresentation of diverse populations in validation studies; therefore, payer coverage, workforce training, and inclusive research are critical to equitable deployment and to avoid a two-tier system of biomarker access [^113BUZ8Z] [^111Mzkyf]. Hold on, I should verify the regulatory signal: the FDA's recent clearance of the Lumipulse G pTau217/β-amyloid 1–42 plasma ratio test supports feasibility, but the label reinforces that results must be interpreted in conjunction with clinical information and that the test is not intended for screening or standalone diagnosis, aligning with specialty-use guidance rather than primary care screening [^113aa7AF].

> I should double-check limitations and edge cases. BBMs are not validated for cognitively unimpaired individuals or for primary care screening, and use in low-prevalence populations risks low PPV and potential harm from overdiagnosis; false negatives can delay confirmatory testing and treatment, while false positives can lead to inappropriate therapy and psychological distress, so shared decision-making and careful selection of candidates are essential [^112bdG3G] [^113hNETL]. Let me reconsider comorbidities and confounders: systemic conditions, medications, and pre-analytical factors can influence BBM levels, and the evidence base remains limited in diverse, real-world populations, so clinicians should maintain diagnostic humility and integrate BBMs within a full workup rather than replacing it [^111vGy4M] [^114K3rVR].

> Next, I should review how to counsel patients and families. Many value minimally invasive testing and earlier clarification of etiology, but others experience anxiety, financial burden, or ethical concerns, especially with inconclusive or unexpected results; therefore, pre-test counseling should cover possible outcomes, downstream implications for treatment eligibility, and the need for confirmatory testing when results are positive in a triage framework [^111wxiY6] [^111BqkWn]. I need to ensure I mention that positive BBM results do not equate to a clinical diagnosis of dementia; they indicate the presence of AD pathology and must be integrated with cognitive, functional, and imaging data to guide management decisions [^117DKWxj].

> Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach. First, complete a comprehensive clinical evaluation with cognitive testing and appropriate structural imaging to establish objective cognitive impairment and a reasonable pretest probability of AD. Second, if AD remains the leading etiologic hypothesis, consider ordering a BBM test with known performance characteristics, using triage thresholds to rule out pathology when negative and confirmatory thresholds when both sensitivity and specificity are high and the clinical picture is concordant. Third, interpret results within the clinical context, recognizing that pretest probability drives predictive values and that borderline or discordant results warrant confirmatory CSF or PET testing and longitudinal follow-up. Fourth, engage in shared decision-making about implications for disease-modifying therapy eligibility, monitoring, and counseling, and document the rationale for BBM use in the care plan [^112yPbga] [^117TvFcx] [^111yJxDW].

> In summary, blood-based biomarkers for AD, particularly p-tau217 and Aβ42/40, are clinically actionable in specialized care for patients with objective cognitive impairment when used with appropriate thresholds and clinical judgment. However, evidence certainty is still limited, inter-assay variability is substantial, and BBMs should complement — not replace — comprehensive clinical evaluation and, when needed, confirmatory CSF or PET testing as the field continues to mature [^113ccCy2] [^116xAxuH].

Blood tests for Alzheimer's disease are **minimally invasive, cost-effective, and scalable** alternatives to CSF and PET for detecting amyloid and tau pathology [^111aFxQp] [^11638kko]. The most validated markers are **plasma Aβ42/40, p-tau181, p-tau217, and NfL**, with p-tau217 showing the highest accuracy for AD pathology [^114784Di] [^114FvXpM]. Current guidelines recommend use in specialized memory clinics for patients with objective cognitive impairment, with **≥ 90% sensitivity and ≥ 75% specificity for triage** [^1139oQev] and **≥ 90% sensitivity and specificity for confirmatory testing** [^112Wa7jb]. They are not recommended for screening asymptomatic individuals or for primary care use due to false positives and limited evidence in diverse populations [^115Lr3QU] [^111vGy4M]. Results must be interpreted in clinical context, and positive findings should be confirmed with CSF or PET when treatment decisions depend on them [^117TvFcx] [^112z9zUs].

## Key blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease

Several blood biomarkers have emerged as promising tools for AD diagnosis, including:

| **Biomarker** | **Description** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|
| Amyloid-beta (Aβ) 42/40 ratio | Reflects amyloid pathology in the brain | High diagnostic accuracy for AD pathology [^notfound] |
| Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 181 | Reflects tau pathology and neuronal injury | High diagnostic accuracy for AD pathology [^114784Di] |
| Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 217 | Highly specific to AD pathology | Highest diagnostic accuracy among tau biomarkers [^notfound] |
| Neurofilament light chain (NfL) | Indicates axonal injury and neurodegeneration | Useful for monitoring disease progression [^114jdg6s] |

---

These biomarkers have demonstrated strong correlations with CSF and PET biomarkers, indicating their reliability for detecting AD pathology [^114jdg6s] [^113aa7AF].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy of blood biomarkers

Recent studies have shown that blood biomarkers, particularly p-tau217, achieve high diagnostic accuracy for AD pathology. For example, p-tau217 has demonstrated **sensitivity and specificity above 90%** in detecting amyloid pathology, comparable to CSF and PET imaging [^notfound]. The Aβ42/40 ratio also shows high diagnostic accuracy, particularly when combined with tau biomarkers [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The Alzheimer's Association has developed clinical practice guidelines for the use of blood biomarkers in specialized care settings. These guidelines recommend:

- **Triage testing**: Blood biomarkers with ≥ 90% sensitivity and ≥ 75% specificity can be used as a triage test to rule out AD pathology [^1139oQev] [^1132MY1k].
- **Confirmatory testing**: Blood biomarkers with ≥ 90% sensitivity and specificity can substitute for CSF or PET imaging in confirmatory testing [^112Wa7jb] [^113rLSXM].
- **Clinical context**: Blood biomarker results must be interpreted within the clinical context and not used as standalone diagnostic tools [^117TvFcx] [^1132MY1k].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite their promise, blood biomarkers for AD face several limitations and challenges:

- **Variability in test performance**: Different assays and laboratories show variability in diagnostic accuracy, necessitating standardization [^111vGy4M] [^112hKpft].
- **Limited evidence in diverse populations**: Most studies have been conducted in predominantly white, educated populations, raising concerns about generalizability [^111BqkWn] [^113LNWUL].
- **Ethical considerations**: False positives and misinterpretation of results can cause psychological distress and inappropriate treatment decisions [^113hNETL] [^111wxiY6].
- **Not recommended for screening**: Blood biomarkers are not recommended for asymptomatic individuals or primary care settings due to the risk of false positives and limited evidence [^115sfKh5] [^113aa7AF].

---

## Current clinical applications

Blood biomarkers are currently being used in specialized memory clinics to aid in the diagnosis of AD. They are particularly useful for:

- **Early detection**: Identifying AD pathology in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early-stage dementia [^1132MY1k] [^112rV9SS].
- **Monitoring disease progression**: Tracking changes in biomarker levels over time to assess disease progression and treatment response [^114jdg6s] [^114784Di].
- **Reducing invasive procedures**: Minimizing the need for CSF analysis and PET imaging, which are invasive and costly [^114784Di] [^114ZJP9a].

---

## Future directions

The future of blood biomarkers for AD looks promising, with ongoing research focused on:

- **Standardization**: Developing standardized assays and protocols to improve consistency and reliability [^111vGy4M] [^113qKic6].
- **Expansion to diverse populations**: Conducting studies in diverse populations to ensure generalizability and equity [^111Mzkyf] [^113LNWUL].
- **Integration into clinical practice**: Establishing clear guidelines and training for healthcare professionals to facilitate widespread adoption [^116UfGgK] [^111aFxQp].

4 IDENTIFY KEY STEPS NEEDED TO BE TAKEN BEFORE WIDESPREAD USE OF BBMS IN GENERAL

Assay validation against clinically relevant reference standards

Once a test has been analytically validated (meaning that the test specifically measures what it is supposed to measure with a high enough precision and dynamic range, see Andreasson et al.for details), the diagnostic performance in clinically relevant settings needs to be established, preferably in relation to neuropathology and/or reference/gold standard tests. However, novel plasma biomarkers can also be validated against other in vivo methods that reflect AD pathology (although not optimal, this approach may give an acceptable traceability chain toward neuropathology). Aβ‐PET is the most widely used reference standard given the fact that this method has a high agreement with a presence of Aβ plaques in the brain, and it was the only FDA‐approved measure of Aβ pathology until recently. However, Aβ‐PET and CSF Aβ42‐based ratios (CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 or Aβ42/p‐tau) are largely interchangeable to determine the Aβ statusand CSF analysis is therefore commonly used as a valid reference standard instead of Aβ‐PET, with the first CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 in vitro diagnostic test cleared by the FDA in 2022. Emerging data have also shown that tau‐PET imaging reflects fibrillar tau pathology, which is why this method might be used as a reference standard in addition to CSF or PET markers of Aβ pathology. In general, one should be careful and whenever possible not use clinic‐based syndrome diagnosis as reference standard that is not confirmed using either relevant in vivo biomarkers (e.g. certain PET and CSF methods) or neuropathology. Further, any clinic‐based diagnosis must have been established blinded to the outcome of the index test being evaluated.

Good practice statement on BBM testing — A BBM test should not be obtained before a comprehensive clinical evaluation by a healthcare professional, and test results should always be interpreted within the clinical context. The panel urges clinicians to consider the pretest probability of AD pathology for each patient when deciding whether or not to use a BBM test.

### Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline on the use of blood-based biomarkers in the diagnostic workup of suspected Alzheimer's disease within specialized care settings [^114pWGsT]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Alzheimer's Association blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) — clinical implications and recommendation strength emphasize evolving evidence and cautious guidance: Guidelines provide a framework for clinicians to make decisions based on evidence, which reduces variability and promotes standardization of care. Assays for the same biomarker frequently use different methods, resulting in varying performance characteristics, and therefore must be evaluated as separate tests. Even for tests that are already clinically available, only a handful of peer-reviewed published studies met our inclusion criteria, so the evidence base is early and somewhat fragile, with the evidence for at least one test rated as either "low" or "very low" certainty. Ultimately, the panel decided that patients would benefit from a set of "conditional recommendations with low certainty" with an accompanying systematic review of the most accurate and promising tests, noting that without this providers may either select BBMs that are less promising or refer patients for more invasive and expensive testing. The recommendations do not account for proprietary business decisions, such as a company's intent to pursue regulatory approval for a research-use-only (RUO) assay.

### A blood test for Alzheimer's disease: progress, challenges, and recommendations [^112JTjct]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Ever since the discovery of APOEɛ4 around 25 years ago, researchers have been excited about the potential of a blood test for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since then researchers have looked for genetic, protein, metabolite, and/or gene expression markers of AD and related phenotypes. However, no blood test for AD is yet being used in the clinical setting. We first review the trends and challenges in AD blood biomarker research, before giving our personal recommendations to help researchers overcome these challenges. While some degree of consistency and replication has been seen across independent studies, several high-profile studies have seemingly failed to replicate. Partly due to academic incentives, there is a reluctance in the field to report predictive ability, to publish negative findings, and to independently replicate the work of others. If this can be addressed, then we will know sooner whether a blood test for AD or related phenotypes with clinical utility can be developed.

6 CONCLUSIONS

Results from a comprehensive physician/payer survey and in‐depth expert panel discussions highlight considerable barriers in the current pathway to a diagnosis of AD in multiple countries. Introduction of an easy‐to‐use, non‐invasive biomarker test to detect amyloid pathology and facilitate recognition of AD early in the disease continuum would accelerate the diagnostic pathway, allow early initiation of DMT, and potentially improve patient outcomes. Such a test could function as a first‐line screening test or triaging tool, informing the decision to perform PET/CSF. With the imminent availability of DMTs, the need for fast and reliable AD diagnostic testing will grow, and a BBBM test for amyloid pathology is likely to become an integral part of the assessment toolkit.

Alzheimer's disease blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) — predictive values by pretest probability are illustrated rather than reported per test; a test with sensitivity (Sn) of 90% and specificity (Sp) of 75% ("triage" thresholds) would have positive predictive values (PPV) of 47%, 78%, or 94% and negative predictive values (NPV) of 97%, 88%, 65% when the pretest probability is 20%, 50%, or 80%, respectively, while a test with Sn of 90% and Sp of 90% ("confirmatory" thresholds) would have PPV of 69%, 90%, or 97% and NPV of 97%, 90%, 69% at the same pretest probabilities.

### The Alzheimer's association appropriate use recommendations for blood biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease [^112Bvxfd]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Blood‐based markers (BBMs) have recently shown promise to revolutionize the diagnostic and prognostic work‐up of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as to improve the design of interventional trials. Here we discuss in detail further research needed to be performed before widespread use of BBMs. We already now recommend use of BBMs as (pre‐)screeners to identify individuals likely to have AD pathological changes for inclusion in trials evaluating disease‐modifying therapies, provided the AD status is confirmed with positron emission tomography (PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. We also encourage studying longitudinal BBM changes in ongoing as well as future interventional trials. However, BBMs should not yet be used as primary endpoints in pivotal trials. Further, we recommend to cautiously start using BBMs in specialized memory clinics as part of the diagnostic work‐up of patients with cognitive symptoms and the results should be confirmed whenever possible with CSF or PET. Additional data are needed before use of BBMs as stand‐alone diagnostic AD markers, or before considering use in primary care.

1 BACKGROUND

Drug development strategies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) aim to identify disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs) that alter the course of disease and slow the rate of cognitive and functional decline. Approved DMTs are soon expected to become widely available, transforming clinical practice and the clinical trial landscape, although evidence suggests that timely treatment is likely to achieve a greater degree of disease modification and slow the rate of cognitive and functional decline. Reviews of health systems reported that infrastructure in Europe and the United States (US) lacks capacity for the early and effective detection, diagnosis, and treatment of AD, potentially denying many patients access to transformative care when DMT becomes readily available. Therefore, the care pathway for early AD detection and treatment will need to evolve.

One essential requirement to ease patient journeys in the DMT landscape will be development of fully automated, high‐precision, non‐invasive biomarker tests that facilitate rapid identification and treatment of appropriate patients early in the care pathway. The diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is well established in AD. However, CSF testing requires an invasive lumbar puncture, and is not used routinely. Similarly, positron emission tomography (PET) is an effective diagnostic tool, but is invasive and expensive and not routinely used. Lack of available treatments, uncertainty in diagnosis, access issues, and risks to older patients also contribute to low utilization of these tools.

Strategies to prepare management pathways for the widespread implementation of DMTs should aim to develop biomarker assays into an in vitro diagnostic solution, expanding access and enabling routine clinical use. Development of a blood‐based biomarker (BBBM) test may allow early detection of amyloid pathology and optimization of costly and invasive CSF/PET analyses. Initial research has already demonstrated the utility of BBBM tests for detection of amyloid pathology, and such tests may soon become a reality. Appropriately implementing this potential solution would require a thorough understanding of barriers in the current diagnostic pathway and development of strategies to ensure that the solution is accessible and affordable for all.

To identify current barriers to timely AD diagnosis and to investigate a potential role for a BBBM test, we conducted two surveys of healthcare professionals (HCPs) and payers across six countries, and convened two advisory board panels.

2.3 Guideline scope

The panel identified two key clinical questions that warrant recommendation in this first iteration of the guideline:
Should a BBM test be incorporated as a triaging test to determine the presence or absence of AD pathology in the diagnostic workup of individuals with cognitive impairment (including those with MCI or dementia) presenting for specialized care for memory disorders?
Should a BBM test serve as a substitute for CSF analysis or amyloid PET as a confirmatory test to determine the presence or absence of AD pathology in the diagnostic workup of patients with cognitive impairment (MCI or dementia) presenting for specialized care for memory disorders?

A triaging test refers to a test in which a negative result rules out AD pathology with high probability, whereas a positive result should be confirmed using another method, such as CSF AD biomarkers or amyloid PET.

A confirmatory test refers to a test for which a negative result rules out AD pathology, and a positive test confirms AD pathology with a high probability.

Input on these questions was gathered during the 2024 Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC), where experts in the field provided insights to inform the development of this guideline.

This guideline is not intended to serve as a comprehensive clinical pathway or appropriate use recommendations for the broader diagnostic workup or treatment decision‐making in individuals with MCI or dementia. It does not address the use of BBMs for screening purposes, use in non‐specialty settings, or use in people with no cognitive concerns or only subjective memory impairment.

Blood-based biomarker (BBM) testing for confirmatory use — In patients with objective cognitive impairment presenting for specialized memory-care, the panel suggests using a high-sensitivity and high-specificity BBM test as a confirmatory test in the diagnostic workup of AD (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty evidence). A confirmatory test refers to a test in which a negative test rules out AD pathology, and a positive test confirms AD pathology with a high probability. For confirmatory testing, the panel defined acceptable diagnostic test accuracy to be at least 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity for a reference test (CSF AD biomarkers, amyloid PET, or AD neuropathology).

### Blood tests for Alzheimer's disease: the impact of disease prevalence on test performance [^115sfKh5]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Impact of disease prevalence on the performance of blood test for Alzheimer's disease pathology. Plasma amyloid‐β (Aβ) 42/40 and phosphorylated‐tau (pTau) assays have demonstrated a wide range of sensitivities and specificities for the detection of Alzheimer's disease pathology in case control studies. In practice, diagnostic performance is further complicated by the prevalence of the disease in the population in which the assay is applied, which for Alzheimer's pathology can range from as low as 3.8% (estimated) for asymptomatic young adults to much higher ranges in specialized memory clinics (e.g. 22‐67%). Performance ranges of six (A) Aβ42/40 assays and (B) 10 pTau assays, demonstrating lowest (light shading) to highest (darker shading) performing assays as a function of disease prevalence. The sensitivity (SN) and specificity (SP) pairs used for Aβ42/40 were 82% SN and 47% SP (light shading), and 92% SN and 65% SP (dark shading), as estimated from Janelidze et al.and for pTau, 74% SN and 67% SP (light shading), and 96% and 87% (dark shading).

With the introduction of AD CSF biomarkers into clinical practice, there was international consensus and clear guidance regarding appropriate use scenarios for testing. This guidance is just starting to be developed for blood‐based testing, and consensus has not yet been reached. For AD blood biomarkers, preliminary recommendations advise implementation only within specialized memory clinics and only for patients with cognitive symptoms. Implementation is not recommended in primary care, or as a stand‐alone diagnostic tool.

AD blood tests have the potential to deliver greater equity into the healthcare system via improved ease of access. From the clinical implementation of AD CSF and amyloid imaging testing — only for specialists in dementia care and individuals with cognitive symptoms — we have learned that AD biomarker testing can be leveraged to improve medical care such as optimizing pharmacotherapy decisions, and reducing the number of diagnostic procedures needed to arrive at a diagnosis. For individuals living with AD and their family members, CSF testing is valued for the greater diagnostic certainty it brings, and because it empowers individuals with knowledge about their brain health, helping them prepare for the future. We cannot, however, assume that benefits from CSF testing and amyloid imaging will directly translate to the new settings where blood‐based testing may be deployed.

Abstract

INTRODUCTION

Disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) will increase diagnostic demand. A non‐invasive blood‐based biomarker (BBBM) test for detection of amyloid‐β pathology may reduce diagnostic barriers and facilitate DMT initiation.

OBJECTIVE

To explore heterogeneity in AD care pathways and potential role of BBBM tests.

METHODS

Survey of 213 healthcare professionals/payers in US/China/UK/Germany/Spain/France and two advisory boards (US/Europe).

RESULTS

Current diagnostic pathways are heterogeneous, meaning many AD patients are missed while low‐risk patients undergo unnecessary procedures. Confirmatory amyloid testing (cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers/positron emission tomography) is utilized in few patients, resulting in diagnostic/treatment delays. A high negative‐predictive‐value test could streamline the diagnostic pathway by reducing unnecessary procedures in low‐risk patients; supporting confirmatory testing where needed. Imminent approval of DMTs will increase need for fast and reliable AD diagnostic tests.

DISCUSSION

An easy‐to‐use, accurate, non‐invasive BBBM test for amyloid pathology could guide diagnostic procedures or referral, streamlining early diagnosis and DMT initiation.

Highlights

This study explored AD care pathways and how BBBM may meet diagnostic demands
Current diagnostic pathways are heterogeneous, with country and setting variations
Many AD patients are missed, while low‐risk patients undergo unnecessary procedures
An easy‐to‐use, accurate, non‐invasive BBBM test for amyloid pathology is needed
This test could streamline early diagnosis of amyloid pathology and DMT initiation

Timely detection of the pathophysiological changes and cognitive impairment caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly pressing because of the advent of biomarker-guided targeted therapies that may be most effective when provided early in the disease. Currently, diagnosis and management of early AD are largely guided by clinical symptoms. FDA-approved neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers can aid detection and diagnosis, but the clinical implementation of these testing modalities is limited because of availability, cost, and perceived invasiveness. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs) may enable earlier and faster diagnoses as well as aid in risk assessment, early detection, prognosis, and management. Herein, we review data on BBBMs that are closest to clinical implementation, particularly those based on measures of amyloid-β peptides and phosphorylated tau species. We discuss key parameters and considerations for the development and potential deployment of these BBBMs under different contexts of use and highlight challenges at the methodological, clinical, and regulatory levels.

### A blood test for Alzheimer's disease: It's about time or not ready for prime time? [^117TQGrR]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

A blood test for Alzheimer's disease is now available for clinical use in persons with cognitive impairment. This is an extraordinary milestone, though the amyloid-based PrecivityAD™ test is not without limitations. Pre and post-test counseling are essential. Phosphorylated tau blood tests are likely to follow soon. When used in conjunction with an appropriate clinical evaluation, blood tests provide the opportunity for an early, accurate, and accessible diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Standalone use, however, carries a significant risk of misinterpretation and is strongly discouraged. Now is the time to develop appropriate use criteria to guide the use of these promising assays.

4.5 Implementation of a blood test in the diagnostic pathway

Our findings suggest that introduction of a BBBM test to streamline the AD patient pathway may provide a systematic route to confirmatory testing and a clear rationale for referral, and reduce time to diagnosis.

Previous reports also suggest the value of BBBM testing in specialized memory clinic settings to distinguish AD from other types of dementia, although challenges remain including clinical use of biomarkers in patients without objective cognitive impairment. The current report adds to the weight of evidence to support the use of a BBBM test to diagnose amyloid pathology and offers some suggestions for its implementation.

Actionability of the BBBM test for triage of patients and supporting referral will be driven by changes to the diagnostic pathway (e.g. the availability of DMTs). Further, payers considered that patients with cognitive impairment and a negative blood test would likely be referred from primary care, as non‐AD causes of cognitive impairment would still need to be investigated.

Another consideration in the wide implementation of a BBBM test is the need for counseling. Currently 30% of 69 centers in the European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium offer no routine counseling or discussion on the implications of biomarker testing.

Specialists are keen to embrace any new tools that could improve their diagnostic capabilities. An additional test is not expected to create a burden or complicate the diagnostic pathway, while any new tools improving diagnostic accuracy are likely to be welcomed by specialists.

A BBBM test could be used to decide whether more complex investigations should be performed, which would streamline the pathway and reduce unnecessary confirmatory CSF or PET testing. This approach is also consistent with the Alzheimer's Association's recent appropriate use recommendations for blood biomarkers in AD, which encourage the cautious introduction of BBBMs in clinical practice, provided AD status is confirmed whenever possible using CSF or PET. Further, a recent EU/US Task Force report notes that as BBBM tests may be less invasive, costly, infrastructure‐dependent, and time‐ and resource‐intensive than CSF and PET biomarkers, they could improve detection, diagnostic accuracy, patient‐centered autonomy and empowerment, and improve overall care.

By ruling out patients early and reducing the number of unnecessary PET/CSF investigations, a BBBM test could preserve resources for those who have higher likelihood of being amyloid positive. This is particularly key since access to CSF or PET is limited and not reimbursed in many countries.

### Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline on the use of blood-based biomarkers in the diagnostic workup of suspected Alzheimer's disease within specialized care settings [^1114eMWj]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Strengths and limitations — methodology, regulatory data constraints, panel diversity, and applicability: This clinical practice guideline (CPG) "is grounded in a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature and developed using the GRADE approach", which "ensures a transparent, structured, and evidence-based process for evaluating the certainty of evidence and formulating recommendations" and "allows for explicit linkage between evidence and recommendations". Some BBM tests rely on regulatory submissions whose data "are generally not peer-reviewed or publicly available… ", so "some tests… may not have been included in the systematic review or the panel's EtD process" if peer-reviewed data were unavailable. The panel "was intentionally multidisciplinary and diverse in composition", including "experts from a broad range of specialties" and representing "a variety of geographic regions, countries, gender, and years of clinical experience". Applicability varies because "the prevalence of brain amyloid in people with cognitive impairment has varied across populations", "a given patient's pretest probability for AD will vary according to clinical presentation and known risk factors", and "the panel has only considered individual biomarkers (including ratios that use a reference peptide as the denominator)".

Alzheimer's Association blood-based biomarker evidence scope and recency notes that because new BBM tests are continually becoming available, eligibility criteria were not limited to commercially available tests, and the evidence base includes tests that may be commercially and not commercially available, including those that are clinically available or for research use only. Several studies have been published since the latest literature search update in November 2024; these newer studies were not included in the current analysis but will be considered for future iterations of the guideline.

### Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease: more to come? [^116zBe2U]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2013). Low credibility.

The past decades have witnessed an enormous expansion of the literature on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is now clear that a triplet of CSF biomarkers (total-tau, phospho-tau, and the 42 amino acid fragment of amyloid-β) reflects core neuropathological features of AD and contributes diagnostically relevant information if measured in a proper manner. Here, we discuss what is needed for these biomarkers to become generally implemented in the clinical routine. We also discuss novel CSF biomarkers, the challenge of differential diagnosis-making in diseases with shared pathologies, and if CSF biomarkers will survive in the long run, given the advancements in molecular neuroimaging and ultra-sensitive blood tests.

### Blood tests for Alzheimer's disease: increasing efforts to expand and diversify research participation is critical for widespread validation and acceptance [^111Mzkyf]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the recent successes in blood biomarkers for AD present the field with opportunities to truly expand access to diagnosis and research, and to better understand the disease from multiple perspectives. The success of these expansion and diversification efforts may be contingent on the ability to translate these prospects to environments and populations that are often outside the radar of biomarker-supported medicine. To achieve this requires the development and implementation of specific programs adapted to the needs and individualities of the target communities and populations, in partnership with local experts.

### FDA clears first blood test used in diagnosing… [^113aa7AF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

- **For Immediate Release**: The U. S. Food and Drug Administration today cleared for marketing the first in vitro diagnostic device that tests blood to aid in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. The Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1–42 Plasma Ratio is for the early detection of amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease in adult patients, aged 55 years and older, exhibiting signs and symptoms of the disease. The Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1–42 Plasma Ratio measures two proteins, pTau217 and β-amyloid 1–42, found in human plasma, a component of blood, and calculates the numerical ratio of the levels of the two proteins. This ratio is correlated to the presence or absence of amyloid plaques in the patient's brain, reducing the need for a PET scan. During review of the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1–42 Plasma Ratio, the FDA evaluated data from a multi-center clinical study of 499 individual plasma samples from adults who were cognitively impaired.

The samples were tested by the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1–42 Plasma Ratio and compared with amyloid PET scan or CSF test results. In this clinical study, 91. 7% of individuals with Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1–42 Plasma Ratio positive results had the presence of amyloid plaques by PET scan or CSF test result, and
97. 3% of individuals with negative results had a negative amyloid PET scan or CSF test result. Less than 20% of the 499 patients tested received an indeterminate Lumipulse G pTau217/β-Amyloid 1–42 Plasma Ratio result. These findings indicate that the new blood test can reliably predict the presence or absence of amyloid pathology associated with Alzheimer's disease at the time of the test in patients who are cognitively impaired. The test is intended for patients presenting at a specialized care setting with signs and symptoms of cognitive decline. The results must be interpreted in conjunction with other patient clinical information.

False negative results could result in additional unnecessary diagnostic tests and potential delay in effective treatment. Importantly, the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1–42 Plasma Ratio is not intended as a screening or stand-alone diagnostic test and other clinical evaluations or additional tests should be used for determining treatment options.

2.2 Target audience

This guideline's primary target audience includes specialists involved in the diagnostic evaluation of cognitive impairment in specialized care settings. A specialist in this context is defined as a healthcare provider, typically, but not exclusively, in neurology, psychiatry, or geriatrics, who spends at least 25% of their clinical practice time caring for adults with cognitive impairment or dementia. Not all clinicians in these fields are dementia specialists, and providers in other areas of practice may identify as a specialist based on their specific knowledge and training. Specialists are proficient in assessing, diagnosing and treating cognitive disorders, understanding and interpreting the results of brain imaging, CSF, and BBM tests, and clearly communicating the results of the aforementioned tests and their implications to patients and families. Primary care providers, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants working in these specialized care settings are also included in the primary target audience. While non‐specialty care providers working in primary care settings and healthcare professionals in nursing homes and long‐term care facilities are not the intended target audience, this guideline may serve as a resource to enhance their understanding of BBM use in AD diagnostic workup, particularly as such tests are being increasingly marketed for use in non‐specialty care settings.

This guideline is intended to inform clinical decision‐making, support the development of standards of care, guide laboratory practices, and assist clinicians in selecting appropriate BBM tests for individual patients. In addition, it may help inform the use of BBMs and their incorporation in clinical trial outcomes or decisions in clinical trials with adaptive design.

The secondary target audience includes individuals affected by MCI or dementia, their caregivers, policy‐makers involved in dementia care and healthcare decision‐making, and laboratory medicine specialists involved in using BBMs.

### Alzheimer's disease: the next frontier-special report 2017 [^115xjb4V]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2017). Low credibility.

In the history of medicine, one means to progress is when we make the decision that our assumptions and definitions of disease are no longer consistent with the scientific evidence, and no longer serve our health care needs. The arc of scientific progress is now requiring a change in how we diagnose Alzheimer's disease. Both the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) 2011 workgroup and the International Work Group (IWG) have proposed guidelines that use detectable measures of biological changes in the brain, commonly known as biological markers, or biomarkers, as part of the diagnosis. This Special Report examines how the development and validation of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers-including those detectable in the blood or cerebral spinal fluid, or through neuroimaging-is a top research priority. This has the potential to markedly change how we diagnose Alzheimer's disease and, as a result, how we count the number of people with this disease. As research advances a biomarker-based method for diagnosis and treatment at the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease, we envision a future in which Alzheimer's disease is placed in the same category as other chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes, which can be readily identified with biomarkers and treated before irrevocable disability occurs.

Blood-based biomarker (BBM) testing for triaging in specialized memory-care — In patients with objective cognitive impairment, the panel suggests using a high-sensitivity BBM test as a triaging test in the diagnostic workup of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty evidence). A triaging test refers to a test in which a negative result rules out AD pathology with high probability, whereas a positive result should be confirmed using another method, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers or amyloid positron emission tomography (PET). For triaging, the panel defined acceptable diagnostic test accuracy to be at least 90% sensitivity and 75% specificity for a reference test (CSF AD biomarkers, amyloid PET, or AD neuropathology).

### How can Alzheimer's disease blood-based biomarkers reach clinical practice? [^113Em5Mq]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommended guidelines have been put forward, outlining the preferred product characteristics of BBMs, the minimum acceptable accuracy for their tests, their clinical use, and their implementation into clinical practice. However, crucial barriers to a seamless translation to the clinic remain.

Therefore, an international diagnostic roundtable with 10 experienced AD clinicians and biomarker experts from China, Germany, Japan, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United States of America (USA) was organized to propose an optimal pathway for implementing BBMs to ensure timely and accurate diagnosis of early symptomatic AD (outlined in Figure 1). The roundtable discussed implementation of BBM tests to either rule out or rule in AD pathology in both non‐specialist and specialist pathways (Figure 1). Furthermore, the roundtable proposed the next steps to streamline the pathway in clinical practice and highlighted the main barriers to implementing BBMs for AD diagnosis.

Alzheimer's Association blood-based biomarkers — scope and setting: Recommendations address BBM testing only in individuals with objective cognitive impairment who have already completed a comprehensive clinical workup and do not extend to cognitively unimpaired individuals. The focus is on specialized care settings in which a memory disorder specialist participates in the decision to order a BBM test for possible Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, and the panel determined that primary care and specialized care settings merit separate CPG processes. The panel notes that different population prevalence means the same test will have different negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV), and that pretest probability must be considered in setting acceptable thresholds for sensitivity and specificity, with pretest probability for Alzheimer's disease pathology more accurate in specialist than non-specialist settings.

### Blood biomarkers and early detection of Alzheimer's… [^117EpicJ]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

The Role of Blood Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease Amyloid positron emission tomography, or PET, and CSF biomarkers have long been validated and used in AD diagnosis due to their high accuracy. Key BBMs with potential diagnostic utility include: Plasma amyloid-beta: This BBM predicts amyloid plaque burden in the brain. 16, 17 Phosphorylated tau: Counterintuitively, this BBM is most strongly associated with amyloid pathology, in addition to having some correlation with tau pathologies. Experts do not recommend BBM testing for patients without any cognitive impairment because it may confuse the clinical diagnosis. 7 Blood biomarker tests may be inaccurate in cognitively normal or asymptomatic patients and lead to unnecessary psychological distress. At this time, there are no approved treatments for patients without cognitive impairment, and the use of BBMs to predict future risk is not recommended.

For cognitively normal patients who have concerns or complaints about cognitive function or memory loss, referral for more detailed neuropsychological testing may be useful. BLOOD BIOMARKER TESTING AND TREATMENT PATHWAYS BBM testing can assist in stratifying patients for appropriate diagnostic and treatment pathways. 7 If a BBM test is negative but clinical suspicion for AD remains high, repeat testing in six to 12 months may be considered. In addition, BBMs help identify candidates for disease-modifying therapies. As of 2023, 79% of AD drugs in clinical trials were DMTs. 34 Currently available DMTs are most effective at earlier stages of cognitive impairment. They have been shown to promote clearance of amyloid-beta deposits in the brain by as much as 55% to 85%, 35 although questions remain about whether they achieve longer-term meaningful changes in cognitive and clinical function.
12.

36 This condition is more common in patients with a higher amyloid burden, a history of thrombotic or hemorrhagic stroke, or multiple apolipoprotein E 4 alleles, as well as in patients who are on anticoagulants. Therefore, identifying patients who are eligible for DMTs requires early detection and careful review of exclusion criteria. As research on DMTs advances, it may be helpful for primary care clinicians to incorporate discussion of these therapies into shared decision-making with patients with early cognitive impairment and positive BBM test results who may be candidates for DMTs. 37.

### Challenges in the practical implementation of blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease [^111vGy4M]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2024). High credibility.

Blood biomarkers have emerged as accessible, cost-effective, and highly promising tools for advancing the diagnostics of Alzheimer's disease. However, transitioning from cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers to blood biomarkers-eg, to verify amyloid β pathology-requires careful consideration. This Series paper highlights the main challenges in the implementation of blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease in different possible contexts of use. Despite the robustness of measuring blood biomarker concentrations, the widespread adoption of blood biomarkers requires rigorous standardisation efforts to address inherent challenges in diverse contexts of use. The challenges include understanding the effect of pre-analytical and analytical conditions, potential confounding factors, and comorbidities that could influence outcomes of blood biomarkers and their use in diverse populations. Additionally, distinct scenarios present their own specific challenges. In memory clinics, the successful integration of blood biomarkers in diagnostic tests will require well-established diagnostic accuracy and comprehensive assessments of the effect of blood biomarkers on the diagnostic confidence and patient management of clinicians. In primary care settings, and even more when implemented in population-based screening programmes for which no experience with any biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease currently exists, the implementation of blood biomarkers will be challenged by the need for education of primary care clinical staff and clear guidelines. However, despite the challenges, blood biomarkers hold great promise for substantially enhancing the diagnostic accuracy and effectively streamlining referral processes, leading to earlier diagnosis and access to treatments. The ongoing efforts that are shaping the integration of blood biomarkers across diverse clinical settings pave the way towards precision medicine in Alzheimer's disease.

### Considerations for widespread implementation of blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease [^111BqkWn]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses significant challenges to health care, often resulting in delayed or inadequate patient care. The clinical integration of blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) for AD holds promise in enabling early detection of pathology and timely intervention. However, several critical considerations, such as the lack of consistent guidelines for assessing cognition, limited understanding of BBM test characteristics, insufficient evidence on BBM performance across diverse populations, and the ethical management of test results, must be addressed for widespread clinical implementation of BBMs in the United States. The Global CEO Initiative on Alzheimer's Disease BBM Workgroup convened to address these challenges and provide recommendations that underscore the importance of evidence-based guidelines, improved training for health-care professionals, patient empowerment through informed decision making, and the necessity of community-based studies to understand BBM performance in real-world populations. Multi-stakeholder engagement is essential to implement these recommendations and ensure credible guidance and education are accessible to all stakeholders.

### Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of Alzheimer's disease and other disorders associated with dementia: EFNS guideline [^112KzcWD]. European Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this international guideline on dementia was to present a peer-reviewed evidence-based statement for the guidance of practice for clinical neurologists, geriatricians, psychiatrists, and other specialist physicians responsible for the care of patients with dementia. It covers major aspects of diagnostic evaluation and treatment, with particular emphasis on the type of patient often referred to the specialist physician. The main focus is Alzheimer's disease, but many of the recommendations apply to dementia disorders in general. The task force working group considered and classified evidence from original research reports, meta-analysis, and systematic reviews, published before January 2006. The evidence was classified and consensus recommendations graded according to the EFNS guidance. Where there was a lack of evidence, but clear consensus, good practice points were provided. The recommendations for clinical diagnosis, blood tests, neuroimaging, electroencephalography (EEG), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, genetic testing, tissue biopsy, disclosure of diagnosis, treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and counselling and support for caregivers were all revised when compared with the previous EFNS guideline. New recommendations were added for the treatment of vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies, for monitoring treatment, for treatment of behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia, and for legal issues. The specialist physician plays an important role together with primary care physicians in the multidisciplinary dementia teams, which have been established throughout Europe. This guideline may contribute to the definition of the role of the specialist physician in providing dementia health care.

1 INTRODUCTION

Blood‐based markers (BBMs) have recently shown promise to revolutionize the diagnostic and prognostic work‐up of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as to improve the design of interventional trials. We here aim to provide appropriate use recommendations for use of these BBMs in clinical practice and trials. To this aim, we discuss the current need for biomarkers; we briefly summarize the state‐of‐the‐art of results for the most promising BBMs; and, more importantly, we define research priorities needed to fill significant knowledge gaps. Finally, we describe the consensus appropriate use recommendations defined by this expert group for use of BBMs in the clinic as well in trials.

### Recommendations for clinical implementation of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease [^111ocvQU]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent estimates from the US Health and Retirement Study suggest that approximately 22% of individuals aged 65 and older have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and up to 10% have dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for approximately 60%–80% of dementia cases. AD is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular plaques comprised of abnormal amyloid β (Aβ) proteins, neurofibrillary tangles consisting of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and neuronal degeneration in brain regions critical for cognitive function. AD pathology manifests decades before the onset of cognitive symptoms. As the disease progresses to the symptomatic phase, patients first develop MCI before transitioning to AD dementia.

Despite the high prevalence of MCI and dementia, up to 92% of patients with MCI remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed in primary care settings. This diagnostic challenge is further compounded by delayed diagnoses in dementia cases, in part due to limited cognitive screening in primary care and the absence of time‐ and cost‐effective diagnostic tools. Moreover, the scarcity of dementia specialists in the United States exacerbates the situation, with many patients failing to access specialty care, and those who are referred experiencing prolonged wait times (e.g. approximately 56 months following a referral based on a brief cognitive assessment). Consequently, because the majority of AD neuroimaging or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker testing takes place in specialty care settings (i.e. secondary or tertiary care), only a small fraction of patients with cognitive impairment receive such testing.

The advent of disease‐modifying treatments (DMTs) that slow the clinical progression of AD by acting on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms is expected to trigger a surge in patients seeking a determination of eligibility for these therapies. Lecanemab was the first DMT to receive traditional approval from the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA), followed by Donanemab and additional drugs are in development. These new treatments act by lowering brain amyloid and are indicated for patients with early symptomatic AD, encompassing MCI and mild dementia due to AD. Because these therapies target aggregated soluble and insoluble forms of Aß, biomarker confirmation of amyloid pathology is required before initiation. As these DMTs continue to gain momentum in clinical practice, the need for biomarker testing to facilitate timely diagnosis of AD is expected to increase by orders of magnitude.

Alzheimer's Association blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) guideline — scope and key clinical questions state that the panel identified two key clinical questions that warrant recommendation: "Should a BBM test be incorporated as a triage test" in the diagnostic workup of individuals with cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment [MCI] or dementia) in specialized care, and "Should a BBM be used as a confirmatory test" in this workup; a triage test refers to a test in which a negative result rules out Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology with high probability and a positive result should be confirmed using another method (such as cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] AD biomarkers or amyloid positron emission tomography [PET]), while a confirmatory test refers to a test for which a negative result rules out AD pathology and a positive test confirms AD pathology with a high probability; the guideline is not intended to serve as a comprehensive clinical pathway and does not address the use of BBMs for screening purposes, use in non-specialty settings, or use in people with no cognitive concerns or only subjective memory impairment.

### The Alzheimer's association appropriate use recommendations for blood biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease [^115Lr3QU]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Medium credibility.

Blood-based markers (BBMs) have recently shown promise to revolutionize the diagnostic and prognostic work-up of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as to improve the design of interventional trials. Here we discuss in detail further research needed to be performed before widespread use of BBMs. We already now recommend use of BBMs as (pre-)screeners to identify individuals likely to have AD pathological changes for inclusion in trials evaluating disease-modifying therapies, provided the AD status is confirmed with positron emission tomography (PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. We also encourage studying longitudinal BBM changes in ongoing as well as future interventional trials. However, BBMs should not yet be used as primary endpoints in pivotal trials. Further, we recommend to cautiously start using BBMs in specialized memory clinics as part of the diagnostic work-up of patients with cognitive symptoms and the results should be confirmed whenever possible with CSF or PET. Additional data are needed before use of BBMs as stand-alone diagnostic AD markers, or before considering use in primary care.

### Commentary on "Developing a national strategy to prevent dementia: leon thal symposium 2009". developing a blood test for Alzheimer's disease using advanced genomic expression technology [^115h7fvt]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2010). Low credibility.

There is a significant need for reliable molecular biomarkers to aid in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical diagnosis. RNA transcriptional profiling, although extensively applied for biomarker development in other diseases, is first defining its role in AD. Application of this technology has the sensitivity and power to provide sufficient information for the development of tests to determine disease severity, progression, heterogeneity, and potential for therapeutic response in the AD population. In order to bring forth the potential of this technology, however, the community needs to make a concerted effort to begin sample collection as soon as patients/subjects are identified. Only then can these powerful technologies be applied in a well controlled study for the development of novel diagnostics.

### Introduction to special issue on advances in blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease [^113wuRVp]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2016). Low credibility.

Blood-based biomarkers related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) have significant potential to advance both the diagnostic and therapeutic processes and procedures related to this devastating disease. In light of this potential, a significant amount of work has been conducted in recent years. In fact a PubMed search (6/2016) using the terms "blood based biomarkers AND Alzheimer's disease" yielded 474 hits with an overwhelming 48% of these articles being published from 2013–2016. This special issue of Alzheimer's & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring on Advances in blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease is intended to provide a broad-based snapshot regarding several aspects of the space. This special issue contains advancements in the space spanning newer technologies (e.g. exosome biomarkers) as well as progression in markers that have been more extensively studied (e.g. autoantibodies, apoJ). The special issue is broken down by categories that broadly correspond to a specific putative context of use (COU).

Blood-based biomarkers offer an excellent complementary information to well-established cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), imaging (MRI, PET, other) biomarkers for the establishment of multistage processes for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, such as what has been of tremendous utility in other areas of medicine (e.g. cancer). The intention of these blood-based biomarkers is to increase access to CSF, imaging, and other biomarker modalities as well as to provide novel information to enhance the scientific understanding of the complete biological dysfunction associated with AD and other neurological diseases.

This special issue has been conceptually divided into broadly defined categories beginning with methodological considerations, to a set of possible context of uses (COUs) and ends with a study highlighting ethnic considerations in this space of scientific investigation.

### Blood-based biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease: future directions for implementation [^114ZoG6U]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) will increase diagnostic demand. A non-invasive blood-based biomarker (BBBM) test for detection of amyloid-β pathology may reduce diagnostic barriers and facilitate DMT initiation.

Objective

To explore heterogeneity in AD care pathways and potential role of BBBM tests.

Methods

Survey of 213 healthcare professionals/payers in US/China/UK/Germany/Spain/France and two advisory boards (US/Europe).

Results

Current diagnostic pathways are heterogeneous, meaning many AD patients are missed while low-risk patients undergo unnecessary procedures. Confirmatory amyloid testing (cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers/positron emission tomography) is utilized in few patients, resulting in diagnostic/treatment delays. A high negative-predictive-value test could streamline the diagnostic pathway by reducing unnecessary procedures in low-risk patients; supporting confirmatory testing where needed. Imminent approval of DMTs will increase need for fast and reliable AD diagnostic tests.

Discussion

An easy-to-use, accurate, non-invasive BBBM test for amyloid pathology could guide diagnostic procedures or referral, streamlining early diagnosis and DMT initiation.

Highlights

### Peripheral inflammatory biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease [^114a56TE]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease of unknown pathological origin. The clinical diagnosis of AD is time-consuming and needs to a combination of clinical evaluation, psychological testing, and imaging assessments. Biomarkers may be good indicators for the clinical diagnosis of AD; hence, it is important to identify suitable biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of AD. Peripheral inflammatory biomarkers have been the focus of research in recent years. This review summarizes the role of inflammatory biomarkers in the disease course of AD.

### A blood screening test for Alzheimer's disease [^111Tv6Py]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2016). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia and is the fifth leading cause of death for those over 65 years. Currently, over 5 million Americans suffer from AD, and it is estimated that those numbers will grow exponentially by 2050. AD has an annual health care cost similar to that of cardiovascular disease and more than cancer. As a result of these rapidly increasing numbers, there is a growing need for the identification of a time-effective and cost-effective screening tool for use in primary care settings.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently implemented the annual wellness visit (AWV) that includes a cognitive examination; however, the 2015 American Gerontological Society working group reported that "older adults are inadequately assessed for cognitive impairment during routine visits with their primary care providers". This limited access to early diagnostics has been associated with delayed treatment initiation, delays in provision of services to family members, overall decreased quality of life, and increased family burden. Given the limited time available in primary care visits (average of 18 minutes), primary care providers are left with a significant dilemma of how to meet the AWV requirements.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Clinical implications

Guidelines provide a framework for clinicians to make decisions based on evidence, which reduces variability and promotes standardization of care. Laboratory directors can take advantage of this guideline when selecting tests based on standard validation results that align with the needs of the clinicians. Additionally, guidelines can help payers with evaluation of medical necessity to establish reimbursement policies. Our recommendations do not account for proprietary business decisions, such as a company's intent to pursue regulatory approval for a research‐use‐only (RUO) assay.

The medical literature regarding BBMs is rapidly evolving, and many different biomarkers and assays are in different stages of development. Assays for the same biomarker frequently use different methods, resulting in varying performance characteristics, and therefore must be evaluated as separate tests. Even for tests that are already clinically available, only a handful of peer‐reviewed published studies met our inclusion criteria. As a result, the existing evidence base is early and somewhat fragile, with the evidence for all tests rated as either "low" or "very low" certainty. When certainty is poor, it is possible that a future study could sway the pooled point estimates to a degree that would impact whether it meets the panel's recommended thresholds for acceptable diagnostic test accuracy. The panel considered the implications of declining to issue a recommendation for any test at this time, deferring until such time that more data emerge and confidence improves. Ultimately, we decided that patients would benefit from a set of "conditional recommendations with low certainty" with an accompanying systematic review of the most accurate and promising tests in the current field. Without this resource, providers may either select BBMs that are less promising than other available BBM options or refer patients for more invasive and expensive testing, when our expert opinion, based on the evidence reviewed here, is that harm could be reduced by the thoughtful use of BBMs in many instances.

### Blood-based biomarkers for detecting Alzheimer's disease pathology in cognitively impaired individuals within specialized care settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111t9XHm]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

While several BBM tests are now commercially available, their diagnostic performance differs across assays, and their use in clinical settings remains unstandardized. Prior expert efforts have provided preliminary recommendations for BBM implementation in different settings, such as the field's first Appropriate Use Recommendations for BBMs in clinical settings and clinical trials led by the Alzheimer's Association, the "Revised Criteria for Diagnosis and Staging AD, Alzheimer's Association Workgroup", the Global CEO Initiative (CEOi) on Alzheimer's Disease BBM Workgroup recommendations outlining the minimum acceptable performance standards for BBMs 7 and the World Health Organization's Preferred Product Characteristics of BBMs in diagnostics of AD.

While these efforts provide a valuable foundation, they are not based on a formal systematic review of the evidence. To our knowledge, no prior systematic review has comprehensively evaluated the diagnostic performance of BBMs for detecting AD pathology in cognitively impaired individuals across available assays, nor has a clinical practice guideline (CPG) been developed using a systematic, evidence‐based approach. Therefore, evidence‐based CPGs to guide decision making in specific clinical scenarios are urgently needed to enable consistent standards of care. To address this need, we conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis to synthesize the available evidence and inform the development of a CPG for BBM use in the diagnostic workup of suspected AD in specialty care settings. Both the systematic review and the CPG were led by the Alzheimer's Association, and the CPG was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

### Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline on the use of blood-based biomarkers in the diagnostic workup of suspected Alzheimer's disease within specialized care settings [^112yPbga]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Alzheimer's Association Clinical Practice Guideline on blood-based biomarkers in specialized care settings — using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, the guideline provides formal recommendations that translate complex scientific data into clear, actionable recommendations and specifically provides guidance on whether blood tests for Alzheimer's disease should be used in specialized care settings as part of a comprehensive diagnostic process by providers with training and experience in the diagnosis of memory disorders. The rationale includes that multiple blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) have become available as promising and accessible alternatives for detecting AD pathology and that recent regulatory approvals of new amyloid targeting therapies for AD require biomarker confirmation of amyloid pathology to determine treatment eligibility. BBMs have been incorporated into the recently revised criteria for diagnosis and staging of AD by a workgroup of the Alzheimer's Association, yet the absence of a formal Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) remains a critical barrier to the consistent and evidence-based application of BBMs in real-world settings, which this CPG aims to address by integrating BBMs into the diagnostic workflows of AD in cognitively impaired individuals in the care of memory disorder specialists in specialized care settings.

### The future of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease [^1152egF2]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is significantly hampered by the lack of easily accessible biomarkers that can detect disease presence and predict disease risk reliably. Fluid biomarkers of AD currently provide indications of disease stage; however, they are not robust predictors of disease progression or treatment response, and most are measured in cerebrospinal fluid, which limits their applicability. With these aspects in mind, the aim of this article is to underscore the concerted efforts of the Blood-Based Biomarker Interest Group, an international working group of experts in the field. The points addressed include: (1) the major challenges in the development of blood-based biomarkers of AD, including patient heterogeneity, inclusion of the "right" control population, and the blood-brain barrier; (2) the need for a clear definition of the purpose of the individual markers (e.g., prognostic, diagnostic, or monitoring therapeutic efficacy); (3) a critical evaluation of the ongoing biomarker approaches; and (4) highlighting the need for standardization of preanalytical variables and analytical methodologies used by the field.

### Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer disease: mapping the road to the clinic [^116NpjRC]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Biomarker discovery and development for clinical research, diagnostics and therapy monitoring in clinical trials have advanced rapidly in key areas of medicine - most notably, oncology and cardiovascular diseases - allowing rapid early detection and supporting the evolution of biomarker-guided, precision-medicine-based targeted therapies. In Alzheimer disease (AD), breakthroughs in biomarker identification and validation include cerebrospinal fluid and PET markers of amyloid-β and tau proteins, which are highly accurate in detecting the presence of AD-associated pathophysiological and neuropathological changes. However, the high cost, insufficient accessibility and/or invasiveness of these assays limit their use as viable first-line tools for detecting patterns of pathophysiology. Therefore, a multistage, tiered approach is needed, prioritizing development of an initial screen to exclude from these tests the high numbers of people with cognitive deficits who do not demonstrate evidence of underlying AD pathophysiology. This Review summarizes the efforts of an international working group that aimed to survey the current landscape of blood-based AD biomarkers and outlines operational steps for an effective academic-industry co-development pathway from identification and assay development to validation for clinical use.

### Recommendations for clinical implementation of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease [^111aFxQp]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

Blood-based biomarkers (BBM) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are being increasingly used in clinical practice to support an AD diagnosis. In contrast to traditional diagnostic modalities, such as amyloid positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, BBMs offer a more accessible and lower cost alternative for AD biomarker testing. Their unique scalability addresses the anticipated surge in demand for biomarker testing with the emergence of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) that require confirmation of amyloid pathology. To facilitate the uptake of BBMs in clinical practice, The Global CEO Initiative on Alzheimer's Disease convened a BBM Workgroup to provide recommendations for two clinical implementational pathways for BBMs: one for current use for triaging and another for future use to confirm amyloid pathology. These pathways provide a standardized diagnostic approach with guidance on interpreting BBM test results. Integrating BBMs into clinical practice will simplify the diagnostic process and facilitate timely access to DMTs for eligible patients.

2.7 How to use this guideline

These recommendations are designed to support clinicians, patients, caregivers, policy‐makers, and healthcare decision‐makers in making evidence‐informed decisions, specifically regarding which BBM test(s) to use and whether it/they should be used as a triaging or confirmatory test for AD pathology in specialized care settings. The recommendations are not meant to restrict, limit, delay, or deny clinical use, insurance coverage, or patient access to biomarker testing when deemed appropriate by a qualified healthcare provider. Furthermore, these recommendations do not substitute for clinical judgment nor encompass all possible considerations in the diagnostic and therapeutic evaluation of AD. We advise clinicians to exercise discretion and adapt their approach based on individual patient circumstances and emerging evidence.

### How can Alzheimer's disease blood-based biomarkers reach clinical practice? [^11638kko]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis has been based largely on clinical symptoms, despite their limited sensitivity and specificity. Biomarker use was proposed to support a more accurate and timely diagnosis. However, neuroimaging or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is rarely used in primary care due to their perceived invasiveness, cost, and need for appropriate infrastructure. Blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) could represent an economical, minimally invasive alternative, but barriers exist to a seamless translation to the clinic.

Methods

Ten international experienced AD clinicians and biomarker experts participated in a diagnostic roundtable to discuss the implementation of BBMs for diagnosing early symptomatic AD.

Results

The participants proposed an optimal AD diagnostic pathway and highlighted three main gaps to implementing BBMs for early symptomatic AD diagnosis: limited real-world data, resource gaps, and system barriers.

Discussion

Although BBMs could streamline the AD diagnostic pathway, further real-world evidence and collaboration among multiple stakeholders are needed.

Highlights

Early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis improves treatment strategy and lowers costs. Currently available biomarkers are not widely used across all clinical settings. Blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) could be a cost-effective, minimally invasive alternative.BBMs could accelerate an accurate AD diagnosis. There are barriers to the inclusion of BBMs in clinical practice.

Alzheimer's Association balance of effects — When a BBM test with acceptable accuracy is used by a trained specialist, the panel judged the desirable effects to be large and undesirable effects to be small to moderate; hence, the balance of effects probably favors the use of BBM tests over CSF, PET scan, or no testing to confirm AD pathology, and in most health care settings BBM tests can enhance diagnostic pathways and expand access to timely care when implemented thoughtfully.

Objective and Scope

A panel of clinicians, subject-matter experts, and guideline methodologists convened by the Alzheimer's Association conducted a systematic review and formulated evidence-based recommendations for using blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) in the diagnostic workup of suspected Alzheimer's disease (AD) within specialized care settings. The scope focuses on individuals with objective cognitive impairment, including those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia, who are undergoing evaluation by providers trained and experienced in memory disorders, where AD is the suspected underlying etiology.

Methods

The panel conducted a systematic review to assess the diagnostic accuracy of BBMs in detecting AD pathology. The BBMs of interest included plasma phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) and amyloid-beta (Aβ) tests measuring the following analytes: p-tau217, ratio of p-tau217 to non-p-tau217 ×100 (%p-tau17), p-tau181, p-tau231, and ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40. The reference standard tests included cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers, amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), or neuropathology. The panel applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of the evidence and the GRADE evidence-to-decision (EtD) Framework to develop its recommendations.

Recommendations

The key recommendations in this Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) are: (1) BBM tests with ≥ 90% sensitivity and ≥ 75% specificity can be used as a triaging test and (2) BBM tests with ≥ 90% sensitivity and specificity can serve as a substitute for amyloid PET imaging or CSF AD biomarker testing in patients with cognitive impairment presenting to specialized care for memory disorders. The panel cautions users of this guideline that there is significant variability in diagnostic test accuracy and many commercially available BBM tests do not meet these thresholds, especially using a single cutoff. Additionally, these tests do not serve as a substitute for comprehensive clinical evaluation by a healthcare professional and should be used only as part of a full diagnostic workup of patients with cognitive impairment presenting to specialized care settings, and with careful consideration of pretest probability of AD pathology.

Conclusions and Practical Implications

This CPG provides performance-based, brand-agnostic recommendations for the use of BBMs in the diagnostic workup of suspected AD within specialized care settings. By linking recommendations to a systematic review and associated living updates, and using a robust and transparent methodology, the guideline ensures scientific rigor, adaptability, and sustained relevance as evidence evolves. Clinicians are encouraged to stay informed about emerging paradigms-such as biomarker combinations or ratios and multi-threshold testing-that may further refine the diagnostic accuracy of BBMs as the field evolves.

### Translating blood biomarkers into clinical practice for Alzheimer's disease: challenges and perspectives [^114K3rVR]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in clinical practice is urgent with advances in AD treatment. Blood biomarker assays are preferential diagnostic tools for widespread clinical use with the advantages of being less invasive, cost effective, and easily accessible, and they have shown good performance in research cohorts. However, in community-based populations with maximum heterogeneity, great challenges are still faced in diagnosing AD based on blood biomarkers in terms of accuracy and robustness. Here, we analyze these challenges, including the confounding impact of systemic and biological factors, small changes in blood biomarkers, and difficulty in detecting early changes. Furthermore, we provide perspectives on several potential strategies to overcome these challenges for blood biomarkers to bridge the gap from research to clinical practice.

1 INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, contributing to an estimated 60% to 80% of all dementias. According to the Alzheimer's Association Facts & Figures report, approximately 7.2 million Americans are living with AD dementia in 2025. This number is projected to double by 2060, highlighting a growing public health crisis as the population ages. Pathologically, AD is defined by the accumulation of extracellular cortical plaques composed of amyloid beta (Aβ) fibrils and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles containing abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau protein. These pathologies manifest many years or even decades before the onset of clinical symptoms, marking a prolonged preclinical phase during which progressive brain damage occurs.

For decades, the options for ante mortem detection of AD pathology have been limited to tests that are either expensive, such as positron emission tomography (PET), or invasive but safe when properly performed, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ‐based biomarker analysis. Furthermore, these tools remain out of reach to most healthcare providers, even in many specialized clinical settings. Despite these barriers, there are multiple reasons why patients and clinicians seek in vivo confirmation of AD pathology. A key driver is higher diagnostic accuracy, since AD is often misdiagnosed without biomarkers, even in specialist settings. Furthermore, identifying the presence or absence of AD pathology can help narrow the etiology of cognitive impairment, guide appropriate care strategies, and provide valuable prognostic information for patients and their families. The recent regulatory approvals of new amyloid targeting therapies for AD, which require biomarker confirmation of amyloid pathology to determine treatment eligibility, further highlights the need. As these therapies are receiving regulatory approval and being marketed in different parts of the world, the demand for biomarker‐based diagnostics to accurately identify eligible patients, enable early intervention, and ascertain when treatment is likely to be most effective, is expected to rise substantially.

### Clinical use of biomarkers in the era of Alzheimer's disease treatments [^114Kyy34]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

With the advent of treatments that specifically target Alzheimer's disease brain pathology, biomarker tests will become an increasingly important part of the routine clinical evaluation of cognitive impairment and guide clinical decision making. Clinicians must ensure they are using accurate and well-validated biomarker tests and select the most appropriate testing modality for each patient based on individual and practical considerations. The interpretation of test results may be complex and depends on the pre-test probability and test-specific factors. Biomarker results must be presented and discussed with patients in a process that is sensitive to the major implications of the results and is carefully connected to diagnosis, prognosis, and management. Advances in treatments for Alzheimer's disease will likely require non-dementia specialists to use biomarkers, necessitating major educational efforts. In the new era of Alzheimer's disease treatments, biomarkers are essential tools that will be integrated into all aspects of dementia diagnosis and care.

Alzheimer's Association blood-based biomarker guideline — definitions of certainty and recommendation implications delineate four evidence-certainty categories and the meaning of strong versus conditional guidance. High certainty is defined as being "very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect", while Moderate means being "moderately confident in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different". Low indicates that "confidence in the effect estimate is limited; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect", and Very low that there is "very little confidence in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of the effect". For patients, strong recommendations mean "most patients in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", whereas conditional recommendations mean "most patients in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not". For clinicians, strong recommendations state "most patients should receive this course of action" and that adherence "could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator", while conditional recommendations emphasize to "recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients" and that "decision aids may be useful". For policy-makers, strong recommendations "can be adapted as policy in most situations", whereas conditional recommendations note that "policy-making will require substantial debate and the involvement of various collaborative parties". For researchers, strong recommendations are "supported by credible research or other convincing judgments", though "on occasion, a strong recommendation is based on low or very low certainty", while conditional recommendations are "likely to be strengthened… by additional research" and reviewing the conditions can "help to identify possible research gaps".

### Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: recommendations of the international working group [^117DKWxj]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

In 2018, the US National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association proposed a purely biological definition of Alzheimer's disease that relies on biomarkers. Although the intended use of this framework was for research purposes, it has engendered debate and challenges regarding its use in everyday clinical practice. For instance, cognitively unimpaired individuals can have biomarker evidence of both amyloid β and tau pathology but will often not develop clinical manifestations in their lifetime. Furthermore, a positive Alzheimer's disease pattern of biomarkers can be observed in other brain diseases in which Alzheimer's disease pathology is present as a comorbidity. In this Personal View, the International Working Group presents what we consider to be the current limitations of biomarkers in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and, on the basis of this evidence, we propose recommendations for how biomarkers should and should not be used for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease in a clinical setting. We recommend that Alzheimer's disease diagnosis be restricted to people who have positive biomarkers together with specific Alzheimer's disease phenotypes, whereas biomarker-positive cognitively unimpaired individuals should be considered only at-risk for progression to Alzheimer's disease.

### Blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice and trials [^114784Di]. Nature Aging (2023). High credibility.

Blood-based biomarkers hold great promise to revolutionize the diagnostic and prognostic work-up of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in clinical practice. This is very timely, considering the recent development of anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) immunotherapies. Several assays for measuring phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in plasma exhibit high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing AD from all other neurodegenerative diseases in patients with cognitive impairment. Prognostic models based on plasma p-tau levels can also predict future development of AD dementia in patients with mild cognitive complaints. The use of such high-performing plasma p-tau assays in the clinical practice of specialist memory clinics would reduce the need for more costly investigations involving cerebrospinal fluid samples or positron emission tomography. Indeed, blood-based biomarkers already facilitate identification of individuals with pre-symptomatic AD in the context of clinical trials. Longitudinal measurements of such biomarkers will also improve the detection of relevant disease-modifying effects of new drugs or lifestyle interventions.

### Revised criteria for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease: Alzheimer's association workgroup [^113wCV12]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

In 2011, the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association (NIA‐AA) convened three workgroups that published separate recommendations for the diagnosis and evaluation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its preclinical, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia phases. In 2012, an NIA‐AA workgroup published a consensus document on the neuropathologic diagnosis of AD. Several years later, the NIA‐AA convened a single workgroup to update 2011 recommendations for diagnosis and evaluation. The product of that workgroup, published in 2018, was labeled a research framework. The 2018 publication stated that the framework should be updated in the future as needed in response to scientific advances.

The convening organization for these revised criteria is the AA. The AA identified a four‐person core leadership group for this effort (i.e. a steering committee) as well as a larger full workgroup. Members of the full workgroup were selected to provide a range of relevant scientific and clinical expertise; to achieve a representative sample of professional stakeholders; and to achieve a balance of academic and industry representation, sex/ethnicity, and geographic location. The steering committee also engaged expert advisors to provide reviews of the project.

Although the purpose of this document is to update the 2018 document, a set of fundamental principles emerged from prior NIA‐AA workgroups. These principles, outlined in Box 1, are carried forward and serve as the foundation or starting point for the current revised criteria.

Three major developments prompted this update. First, treatments that target core disease pathology have, for the first time, received regulatory approval. The prospect of these therapies entering clinical practice highlights the importance of conceptual alignment among clinicians, industry, and academia around diagnosis and staging of AD.

Second, the most significant advance in AD diagnostics in recent years has been the development of blood‐based markers (BBM) with some (not all) assays exhibiting accurate diagnostic performance. This now makes the biological diagnosis of AD (which previously required positron emission tomography [PET] or cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] assays) more generally accessible and is projected to revolutionize clinical care and research. The field is now in a transition phase during which BBM are being integrated with traditional CSF and PET biomarkers.

At this stage, the panel has only considered individual biomarkers (including ratios that use a reference peptide as the denominator) rather than combinations of multiple biomarkers. The panel deliberately chose to focus on individual biomarkers initially to evaluate combinations in subsequent phases. The panel is aware that combinations of biomarkers, such as the p‐tau217/Aβ42 ratio or a fixed combination of Aβ42/Aβ40 and a p‐tau217 ratio, are being commercialized and provided to clinicians.

Because new BBM tests are continually becoming available to clinicians, the panel decided not to limit eligibility criteria to tests that were commercially available at the time of this review. As a result, the evidence base includes tests that may currently be commercially and not commercially available, including those that are clinically available, or for research use only.

Lastly, several studies have been published since our latest literature search update in November 2024. These newer studies were not included in the current analysis but will be considered for inclusion in future iterations of this guideline as part of ongoing efforts to ensure recommendations reflect the most up‐to‐date evidence.

Alzheimer's Association BBM laboratory implementation and analytical variability highlight real-world processing and monitoring needs: Most studies informing the associated systematic review used single-batch plasma analyses, which do not reflect real-world clinical settings where samples are processed on a rolling basis, for example, daily or weekly. In clinical practice, even small assay imprecision and bias can affect interpretation, particularly when applying fixed diagnostic cutoffs, so clinical laboratories need to evaluate and monitor the coefficient of variation (CV) of biomarker assays to ensure consistent performance and help minimize the risk of misclassification due to analytical variability. This is especially important for biomarkers with small fold changes between AD pathology–positive and -negative individuals, such as Aβ42/40, which are more susceptible to assay imprecision in routine use, and recommendations for such biomarkers should therefore be interpreted with extra caution, since the systematic review did not account for such aspects.

2 THE CURRENT NEEDS FOR BLOOD‐BASED AD BIOMARKERS

2.1 Clinical practice

Approximately 25% to 30% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD dementia are misdiagnosed when assessed at specialized dementia clinics, and the accuracy of clinical diagnosis is similar or even lower for other dementias, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and vascular dementia. However, most patients with cognitive or behavioral symptoms are managed in primary care where the misdiagnosis is even higher. Fifty percent to 70% of symptomatic patients with AD are not recognized or correctly diagnosed in primary care today, because routine cognitive screening is not performed and there is a lack of easily accessible, time‐ and cost‐effective, and accurate diagnostic tools. The problem is even worse in early stages of the disease, that is, in patients without dementia who have either subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Further, clinicopathological studies highlight that the match between clinical phenotype and biology/neuropathology in neurodegenerative dementias is imperfect. Such studies also note that the diseases have a preclinical prodrome during which symptoms may be absent or very mild and non‐specific despite active neuropathological processes.

3.3 System barriers

Although a consensus on minimum performance standards for AD BBMs has been published, there are no recommendations in the available clinical guidelines.

Because newly approved in vitro diagnostic tests by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA are now available, and further approvals from other regulatory bodies may soon follow, guidelines on how to implement them in clinical practice should be published contemporaneously and easily and quickly updated to accommodate the fast pace of scientific progress in this field, as proposed in the recently published Alzheimer's Association guideline.

Finally, to ensure equitable access to BBMs, reimbursement for these tests will be crucial. Reimbursement from health care systems will need to be supported by studies demonstrating the importance and cost‐effectiveness of providing diagnosis and treatment at the earliest stages of AD.

Alzheimer's Association undesirable effects and risks of BBM testing — When used appropriately, the panel judged the undesirable effects of BBM tests to be small; however, undesirable effects could be more significant if not used by trained personnel. Key concerns include potential for over testing and increased system burden; inappropriate testing where a person with a low pretest probability of having AD pathology receives a positive result after a blood test which could almost equally be a false positive (FP) as opposed to a true case; FPs that could cause significant harm if a patient is then started on therapy based on erroneous test results; and false negatives (FNs) that could cause delays in confirmatory testing and treatment. Additional concerns are variability in test performance across platforms and manufacturers; not all BBM tests have been validated to the same standard and tests may be assumed interchangeable; direct-to-consumer (DTC) tests which can lead to confusion, misinterpretation, or unwarranted anxiety among patients; and clinicians over-relying on BBM results as a diagnostic shortcut, which may contribute to underdiagnosis of treatable, co-occurring, or non-AD conditions and lead to premature or inaccurate diagnostic labeling, potentially harming patient trust and clinical decision-making.

Alzheimer's disease BBM recommendations — an evidence-to-decision (EtD) framework was used to translate evidence into practice recommendations labeled either "strong" or "conditional" based on certainty of evidence, balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, resources/cost, acceptability, feasibility, and equity; the phrase "panel recommends" indicates a strong recommendation and "the panel suggests" indicates a conditional recommendation, and the panel was blinded to test names until after recommendations were drafted.

### Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease: towards clinical implementation [^114jdg6s]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

For many years, blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease seemed unattainable, but recent results have shown that they could become a reality. Convincing data generated with new high-sensitivity assays have emerged with remarkable consistency across different cohorts, but also independent of the precise analytical method used. Concentrations in blood of amyloid and phosphorylated tau proteins associate with the corresponding concentrations in CSF and with amyloid-PET or tau-PET scans. Moreover, other blood-based biomarkers of neurodegeneration, such as neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein, appear to provide information on disease progression and potential for monitoring treatment effects. Now the question emerges of when and how we can bring these biomarkers to clinical practice. This step would pave the way for blood-based biomarkers to support the diagnosis of, and development of treatments for, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.

4.3 Unmet diagnostic need to facilitate timely detection and treatment initiation

There is no standardized pathway to determine whether patients should be referred to determine a non‐AD cause of cognitive decline or be offered a confirmatory test with PET/CSF.

The initial survey revealed that patients are more likely to be referred if they are considered to have an atypical presentation, if there is particular urgency due to legal, social, or support reasons, or if AD symptoms are unverifiable with tools available in primary care. The same survey indicated that barriers to referral include the perception that no meaningful support can be offered, a belief that AD diagnosis can be ruled out, and the sense that "nothing could be done anyway". The Clinical Trials on AD Taskforce noted the lack of an effective treatment is one of the main reasons that patients do not seek medical intervention and that PCPs do not refer to specialists, although this will change when DMTs become available.

The advisory boards noted that symptomatic patients with a negative blood test still need to be referred, as AD is not the only cause of cognitive impairment (although the most common).

Data suggesting that many patients have inconclusive outcomes such as "watch and wait"support the role of a simple BBBM test to detect amyloid pathology and create a consistent and efficient pathway to confirmatory PET/CSF testing.

### Revised criteria for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease: Alzheimer's association workgroup [^113qKic6]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

Future directions for Alzheimer's disease criteria and research — Observational studies and clinical trials should be conducted with more representative cohorts, with true epidemiological and real-world studies of biomarker properties in representative groups to ascertain relationships valid at the population level. Standardization of biofluid assays, tau positron emission tomography (PET) quantification methods, and cutpoints is needed, and the exact thresholds for abnormality may evolve over time as additional data inform prognostic value. Improved understanding of various posttranslational modifications of tau may enhance fluid-based biological staging, and with improved understanding of immune/inflammatory processes, microglia, and astrocyte biology in AD pathogenesis, a more prominent role for I biomarkers in biological characterization and prognosis is envisioned, especially if brain-specific changes can be detected in blood. As clinical trials targeting mechanisms other than anti-Aβ immunotherapy are performed, the effects of these interventions on biomarkers and clinical outcomes should be included in future criteria.

3.4 Diagnostic test accuracy

The panel decided to use a brand‐agnostic approach to formulating recommendations due to the evolving nature of the field, but did synthesize evidence on the diagnostic test accuracy of the selected tests versus selected reference standards in an associated systematic review.

Diagnostic test accuracy estimates across tests showed a high degree of variability. Notably, some tests did meet or exceed the panel's established thresholds, meaning a single cut‐point achieved the thresholds of 90% Sn and 75% Sp for triaging or 90% Sn and Sp for confirmatory testing. Across all 31 tests, pooled Sn ranged from 49.31% to 91.41%, and Sp ranged from 61.54% to 96.72%.

It is important to note that the panel evaluated only single cut‐point performance. Tests offering two‐cutoff approaches were not assessed due to limited peer‐reviewed evidence available. Summary of findings for all evaluated tests are reported in Table S2, and results of sensitivity analyses reported in Table S3. Full methodology and results are reported in the systematic review.

3.5 Certainty of the evidence of test accuracy

The certainty of the evidence for test accuracy across all tests ranged from moderate to very low, and for tests meeting the panel's predetermined thresholds for accuracy, certainty ranged from low to very low. Most tests were rated down due to serious issues of risk of bias, largely due to not using prespecified thresholds and/or not reporting whether index test results were interpreted without knowledge of reference test results and vice versa. Inconsistency and imprecision varied across tests for both Sn and Sp. Publication bias was not detected for any of the tests.

3.6 Desirable effects

The panel judged the desirable effects of using a BBM test to be large. Compared to current reference standards such as PET or CSF, BBM tests are minimally invasive and can significantly reduce the physical discomfort and anxiety often associated with lumbar puncture or PET imaging procedures. Additionally, blood testing may help streamline the diagnostic process, allowing for more timely identification of underlying AD pathology. This can lead to earlier clinical diagnosis, reduce delays between symptom onset and treatment initiation, and minimize the need for repeated consultations and referrals, thereby decreasing the burden on patients, caregivers, and the healthcare system.

While blood-based tests are readily available for various conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and common cancers, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases lack an early blood-based screening test that can be used in primary care. Major efforts have been made towards the investigation of approaches that may lead to minimally invasive, cost-effective, and reliable tests capable of measuring brain pathological status. Here, we review past and current technologies developed to investigate biomarkers of AD, including novel blood-based approaches and the more established cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers of disease. The utility of blood as a source of AD-related biomarkers in both clinical practice and interventional trials is discussed, supported by a comprehensive list of clinical trials for AD drugs and interventions that list biomarkers as primary or secondary endpoints. We highlight that identifying individuals in early preclinical AD using blood-based biomarkers will improve clinical trials and the optimization of therapeutic treatments as they become available. Lastly, we discuss challenges that remain in the field and address new approaches being developed, such as the examination of cargo packaged within extracellular vesicles of neuronal origin isolated from peripheral blood.

3 RECOMMENDATIONS

3.1 Recommendations and remarks

The panel formulated two recommendations and one good practice statement for the use of BBM tests in the diagnostic workup of patients with objective cognitive impairment presenting for specialized care. These conditional recommendations favor the use of BBM tests and offer acceptable minimum diagnostic test accuracy for triaging and confirmatory tests (Table 2).

TABLE 2
Recommendations and remarks for the use of BBM tests in patients with objective cognitive impairment presenting for specialized care

3.2 Summary of identified studies

Forty‐nine, observational studies assessed the diagnostic test accuracy of plasma biomarkers of interest for determining AD pathology in patients with cognitive impairment to inform recommendations. Across these studies, 31 different BBM tests were evaluated in our systematic review and are summarized in Table 3 below:

TABLE 3
List of assay/analyte combinations studied in the systematic review.

Eighty‐four studies that would have otherwise met eligibility criteria were ultimately excluded due to cognitively impaired and unimpaired populations being analyzed together, such that we were unable to separate data on only cognitively impaired individuals.

Demographic data reported in primary studies were occasionally reflective of combined populations (i.e. instances where test accuracy data was reported according to cognitive status but demographic data was not). The mean sample size across studies was 560 participants (range: 70 to 2244). Mean age across studies ranged from 62.6 to 85.9 years, and the percentage of males ranged from 33.8% to 60%. Across the 32 studies that evaluated and reported apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 genotyping, carriers ranged from 27.1% to 56.2% of the population.

3.3 EtD framework

The panel used the GRADE EtD framework for diagnostic test accuracy studies to systematically assess and transparently document the factors influencing the recommendation, including the diagnostic test accuracy, certainty of evidence, balance of benefits and harms, values and preferences, resources required, cost‐effectiveness, equity, acceptability, and feasibility. The completed EtD form (Table S1) summarizes the judgments, research evidence, and additional expert input for each EtD factor.

Abstract

OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE

A panel of clinicians, subject‐matter experts, and guideline methodologists convened by the Alzheimer's Association conducted a systematic review and formulated evidence‐based recommendations for using blood‐based biomarkers (BBMs) in the diagnostic workup of suspected Alzheimer's disease (AD) within specialized care settings. The scope focuses on individuals with objective cognitive impairment, including those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia, who are undergoing evaluation by providers trained and experienced in memory disorders, where AD is the suspected underlying etiology.

METHODS

The panel conducted a systematic review to assess the diagnostic accuracy of BBMs in detecting AD pathology. The BBMs of interest included plasma phosphorylated‐tau (p‐tau) and amyloid‐beta (Aβ) tests measuring the following analytes: p‐tau217, ratio of p‐tau217 to non‐p‐tau217 ×100 (%p‐tau17), p‐tau181, p‐tau231, and ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40. The reference standard tests included cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers, amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), or neuropathology. The panel applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of the evidence and the GRADE evidence‐to‐decision (EtD) Framework to develop its recommendations.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The key recommendations in this Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) are: (1) BBM tests with ≥ 90% sensitivity and ≥ 75% specificity can be used as a triaging test and (2) BBM tests with ≥ 90% sensitivity and specificity can serve as a substitute for amyloid PET imaging or CSF AD biomarker testing in patients with cognitive impairment presenting to specialized care for memory disorders. The panel cautions users of this guideline that there is significant variability in diagnostic test accuracy and many commercially available BBM tests do not meet these thresholds, especially using a single cutoff. Additionally, these tests do not serve as a substitute for comprehensive clinical evaluation by a healthcare professional and should be used only as part of a full diagnostic workup of patients with cognitive impairment presenting to specialized care settings, and with careful consideration of pretest probability of AD pathology.

CONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS

This CPG provides performance‐based, brand‐agnostic recommendations for the use of BBMs in the diagnostic workup of suspected AD within specialized care settings. By linking recommendations to a systematic review and associated living updates, and using a robust and transparent methodology, the guideline ensures scientific rigor, adaptability, and sustained relevance as evidence evolves. Clinicians are encouraged to stay informed about emerging paradigms — such as biomarker combinations or ratios and multi‐threshold testing — that may further refine the diagnostic accuracy of BBMs as the field evolves.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, the following calls to action emerged from the roundtable: First, large‐scale international prospective real‐world studies are needed to establish the clinical potential of high‐performing BBMs for the diagnosis of AD. The inclusion of older, diverse populations and those with multiple chronic conditions is necessary. Second, experts are establishing easy‐to‐update international and local guidelines that incorporate the tools with sufficient performance to be integrated into leaner, faster AD patient pathways. Third, regulators and payers should approve and provide access to in vitro diagnostic tests that meet the recommended performance criteria, for example, those of the Global CEO Initiative on Alzheimer's Disease on the acceptable performance of BBMs, the Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guidelines, or the World Health Organization (WHO) preferred product characteristics.

Finally, when these BBMs become available, experts should provide training to HCPs and policymakers on how to implement these new tools in clinical practice and provide the resources to establish referral pathways and expert consultancy systems.

2.5.1 Test accuracy

The panel decided not to make recommendations for or against specific tests; this decision reflects several considerations, including variability in how tests are developed, validated, and implemented across laboratories. Furthermore, manufacturers and laboratories do not typically rely on meta‐analyses to determine test cutoffs for abnormality, and some are even recommending two cutoff approaches. These inconsistencies further support the panel's position that ranking or endorsing specific tests is premature at this time. Instead, test accuracy data and accuracy judgments reported in this guideline are meant to serve as a resource for clinicians implementing the recommendations to aid them in choosing which test(s) to order.

The panel aligned clinical thresholds for acceptable accuracy of BBM tests based on what clinicians in real‐world settings would find acceptable and used recent expert opinion as a starting point for that discussion. Therefore, a given test was judged "accurate" at the triaging level if the point estimate for Sn was at least 90% and the Sp at least 75%. For the "confirmatory" level, the point estimates had to be at least 90% for both Sn and Sp.

A given patient's pretest probability for AD pathology will vary according to clinical presentation, age, and known risk factors. Therefore, the panel chose not to report predictive values associated with individual tests, since these metrics would be highly dependent on pretest probability. Instead, we note that a test with a Sn of 90% and Sp of 75% (our "triage" thresholds) would have a PPV of 47%, 78%, or 94%, and NPV of 97%, 88%, 65%, when applied in a population with a pretest probability of 20%, 50%, or 80%, respectively. A test with a Sn of 90% and Sp of 90% (our "confirmatory" thresholds) would have a PPV of 69%, 90%, or 97%, and NPV of 97%, 90%, 69%, when applied in a population with a pretest probability of 20%, 50%, or 80%, respectively.

Because Youden's index cutoff is not always an optimal combination of Sn and Sp, we supplemented with analyses of fixed sensitivity at 90% and fixed specificity at 75% when data were available.

Generalizability of recommendations — blood-based biomarker (BBM) tests face access and equity challenges that may affect implementation: The guideline notes "a lack of widespread accessibility and reimbursement for many BBM tests", calls for frameworks "that enable patients to benefit from emerging diagnostic technologies", and urges providers to be "champions for equitable access to BBMs globally", warning that without deliberate efforts this advancement "could paradoxically widen existing disparities among countries, socioeconomic groups, and other vulnerable populations".

The recent academic and commercial development, and regulatory approvals, of blood-based Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers are breakthrough developments of immense potential. However, clinical validation studies and therapeutic trial applications are limited almost exclusively to non-Hispanic White cohorts often including highly-educated, high-earning participants. This commentary argues that the true benefits of blood tests for AD will be realized by active inclusion of diverse groups including minoritized populations, people of socioeconomic status different from those included in existing cohorts, and residents of low- and middle-income countries. The article discusses key factors that are critical for a successful implementation of diversity programs.

### Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice: time to incorporate biomarkers? [^117N9BYB]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

These results are consistent with the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) recommendations published in 2018 and the Alzheimer's Association Workgroup revised criteria published in 2024, which represent significant advances in the biological definition of AD, as well as with the recent recommendations of the European multidisciplinary taskforce, which emphasize the importance of biomarkers in the diagnostic process of neurocognitive disorders. All of these recommendations support our argument for the integration of biomarkers to improve the diagnostic accuracy in AD. It should be noted that CSF biomarkers, amyloid and tau PET imaging, and blood-based biomarkers have distinct advantages over cognitive testing and brain imaging in the AD diagnosis. While cognitive testing and brain imaging provide valuable information about brain function and structure, biomarkers reflecting AD pathophysiology can provide specific insights into the underlying pathological processes, such as amyloid-β and tau deposition. This specificity makes these biomarkers critical for early and accurate diagnosis, especially in cases where traditional methods show overlap between different neurodegenerative diseases. Until recently developed blood-based biomarkers are fully validated, the AD diagnosis should include amyloid PET imaging and CSF biomarkers, which are currently the most reliable measures of AD pathology in clinical practice. This approach ensures that we are using the best tools available while keeping an eye on future developments in blood-based biomarkers. The integration of biomarkers is critical to improving diagnostic accuracy, but the role of the clinical expert, incorporating clinical information and the results of neurological, cognitive testing and brain imaging, is still indispensable. As recently highlighted, the advent of new diagnostic tools and treatments, such as plasma biomarkers and anti-amyloid therapies, will require continued reliance on the clinical acumen of physicians to navigate and apply these advances effectively.

2.4 Evidence review

This guideline has been informed by a corresponding systematic review of diagnostic test accuracy, published separately; please refer to that publication for a more detailed description of the systematic review methodology. A summary of tests meeting the criteria for a triaging or confirmatory test is also shown at.

Briefly, the following databases were searched from 2019 through November 3, 2024: PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Methodologists conducted study selection, data extraction, risk of bias, and certainty assessments, and statisticians performed data analysis. Details regarding the literature search strategy can be found in the Supporting Information.

Raw data were sought, including the number of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), false negatives (FN), sensitivity (Sn), and specificity (Sp), at the Youden index cutoff. Data were sourced from (1) published studies, (2) author‐provided information when missing from studies, and (3) Sn and Sp associated with the Youden index derived from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves using WebPlotDigitizerwhen neither published nor provided by authors.

### Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline on the use of blood-based biomarkers in the diagnostic workup of suspected Alzheimer's disease within specialized care settings [^116LLK9i]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Meta‐analyses of diagnostic test accuracy were conducted for each BBM test to calculate pooled Sn and Sp. The main meta‐analysis examined single cutoffs based on Youden's index. Additional sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the data based on reported versus missing data: (1) reported data only using any cutoff for the index test, (2) reported data using any cutoff for the index test plus data derived from curves at Youden's index when data was missing, (3) fixing Sp cutoff at 75% for triaging, and (4) fixing Sn cutoff at 90% for confirmatory testing.

The guideline panel assessed the certainty of the supporting evidence and formulated the recommendations according to the GRADE approach. The certainty of the evidence for each analyzed test was determined by assessing the following domains: risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency, imprecision, and publication bias. This information is reported in the Evidence Profiles. The certainty of evidence for Sn was assessed separately from that for Sp, including considerations of inconsistency and imprecision. Sensitivity carried greater weight for certainty of evidence in triaging decisions (when an initial BBM test is performed with the plan to follow‐up confirmatory testing if positive) to ensure accurate identification of true cases, while Sp carried a greater weight for certainty of evidence in confirmatory testing (when only the BBM test is used without additional biomarker assessment) to minimize FPs.

Scope and rationale for update emphasize that the criteria are presently operationalizable at some but by no means all centers even among major medical institutions in high-income countries and are viewed as a bridge between research and clinical care; three major developments prompted this update, namely that treatments targeting core disease pathology have, for the first time, received regulatory approval, that the most significant advance in AD diagnostics has been development of blood-based biomarkers (BBM) with some (not all) assays exhibiting accurate diagnostic performance, and that imaging, CSF, and BBM within a pathobiological AT(N) category are interchangeable for some, but not all, intended uses; the document is forward-looking and provides a common framework for AD diagnostic and staging criteria but does not provide detailed guidance on clinical workflow or treatment protocols, with formal clinical practice guidelines to appear in a subsequent document.

### Blood tests for Alzheimer disease… [^114FvXpM]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

This is a transformative time for patients with Alzheimer disease. Alzheimer disease is increasingly viewed as a treatable condition and managed like other major chronic diseases, such as heart disease and cancer. Management of Alzheimer disease includes early diagnosis with molecular confirmation, disease-modifying treatments that are initiated early in the disease course, better risk reduction and prevention strategies, and improved coordination of care. The transformation in Alzheimer disease care has been fueled by major advances in the detection of the key pathological hallmarks for Alzheimer disease that began with tests of cerebrospinal fluid in the 1990s, positron emission tomographic scans for the amyloid protein in the early 2000s, and PET scans for the tau protein in 2010. However, PET scans are expensive and are not widely available.

Plasma biomarkers, which seemed out of reach for many years because of the very low levels of amyloid and tau in blood samples, have more recently become reliable markers of Alzheimer disease pathology.

Appropriateness and caution for BBM testing — In the following clinical scenarios, a BBM test may not be appropriate: when shared decision-making discussions with the patient find that there would be low utility in knowing whether AD pathology is present. In the following clinical scenarios, a BBM test may not be appropriate or should be interpreted with extra caution: patients with obvious modifiable or temporary conditions that are likely to account for the patient's cognitive impairment; patients with limited life expectancy, as the clinical significance and prognosis of AD pathology are not well-defined in these populations; patients with a history of conditions that can affect the brain and that may impact levels of a given BBM in ways that have not been well-studied; patients with medical conditions that may affect the levels of a given BBM; and patients taking certain medications that may impact levels of a given BBM.
