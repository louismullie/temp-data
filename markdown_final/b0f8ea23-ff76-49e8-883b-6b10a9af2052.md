## Question

vesicular rash per penile shaft recurrent

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage a recurrent vesicular rash on the penile shaft. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis and why. Then, I should verify key differentials that can mimic HSV and how to distinguish them. Next, I will outline the diagnostic workup, including lesion-based testing and serology. After that, I need to consider host factors like HIV status and immunosuppression. Finally, I will lay out evidence-based treatment options, counseling, and follow-up, making sure I double-check timing and dosing details against guidelines and labels.

> Let me first confirm the leading diagnosis. Recurrent vesicular lesions on the penile shaft strongly suggest genital herpes simplex virus (HSV), given its characteristic pattern of grouped vesicles on an erythematous base that ulcerate and heal, often with prodromal paresthesias and a history of recurrences; HSV-2 recurs more frequently than HSV-1, and asymptomatic shedding is common, which fits the scenario of repeated episodes without constant symptoms [^111dH5pm] [^112J6d3F] [^111fv6s4].

> Wait, let me verify the key differentials before I jump to conclusions. Herpes zoster can involve the genital region in a sacral dermatomal pattern and may present with vesicles and neuropathic symptoms, but it is typically unilateral and dermatomal rather than recurrent in a focal genital site; case reports document sacral zoster with vesicles on the buttocks, perineum, and scrotum, sometimes with urinary dysfunction, which helps distinguish it from recurrent focal HSV on the shaft [^115Yt2b2] [^116itzxg]. Monkeypox (mpox) can produce vesiculopustules and umbilicated lesions on the genitals, often with systemic features and lymphadenopathy, and has been prominent in recent outbreaks among men who have sex with men; however, the described recurrence pattern is less typical for mpox than for HSV, though coinfections and atypical courses do occur, so I should keep a high index of suspicion if epidemiology or morphology fits [^113tJPNw] [^1175cTss] [^114r53Qq]. Molluscum contagiosum presents as firm, dome-shaped, umbilicated papules rather than transient vesicles, making it less likely here, though genital involvement is common and can be confused with vesicular diseases in some contexts [^111yQ9E7]. Fixed drug eruption and contact dermatitis can mimic genital lesions but lack the true vesiculation and recurrence pattern of HSV, so careful history and exam should help exclude them [^111yQ9E7].

> I need to check the diagnostic approach next. For active lesions, lesion-based virologic testing is preferred: PCR is the most sensitive method, and viral culture, while less sensitive, allows typing and susceptibility testing if needed. Type-specific serology is useful when lesions are absent or PCR/culture are negative but suspicion remains high, and it can clarify HSV-1 versus HSV-2 status to inform prognosis and counseling [^111bAiEW] [^11411Uhi] [^116D33iw]. Hold on, I should verify timing: for recurrent episodes, treatment efficacy drops if started more than 24 hours after symptom onset, so sampling and initiation should be as early as possible when lesions are present [^11435F2m] [^112v3uKn].

> Let me consider host factors that modify risk and management. I should confirm HIV status because HSV shedding and recurrence frequency are higher with lower CD4 counts, and HIV-positive patients benefit from suppressive therapy and may require longer treatment durations. Guidelines also advise broader STI screening in people with genital ulcers, given increased HIV acquisition risk and coinfections [^111KDthH] [^111vyT7f] [^111bAiEW]. If the patient is immunocompromised or has atypical, persistent, or treatment-refractory lesions, I should double-check for acyclovir resistance and consider culture with susceptibility testing, as resistance is more likely in advanced immunosuppression and alters therapy choices [^116GuR8V] [^116CgUXf].

> Now, I will outline treatment for a recurrent episode. Episodic therapy initiated at prodrome or within 24 hours shortens duration and symptoms. Options include acyclovir 800 mg orally twice daily for 5 days or 800 mg three times daily for 2 days, valacyclovir 500 mg twice daily for 3 days or 1,000 mg once daily for 5 days, or famciclovir 1,000 mg twice daily for 1 day or 500 mg once then 250 mg twice daily for 2 days. I should confirm that starting beyond 24 hours reduces benefit, so early initiation is critical [^112AoZ3x] [^115cKaZk] [^11435F2m] [^112v3uKn]. For patients with frequent or distressing recurrences, suppressive therapy reduces recurrences by about 70–80% and transmission risk. Options include acyclovir 400 mg twice daily, valacyclovir 500–1,000 mg once daily, or famciclovir 250 mg twice daily, with reassessment annually to determine ongoing need [^1163qaP8] [^112qu7uB] [^112HP4HZ]. But wait, what if the patient is HIV-positive? In that case, I should extend episodic treatment to 7–10 days and use suppressive regimens such as acyclovir 400 mg twice daily, valacyclovir 500 mg twice daily, or famciclovir 500 mg twice daily, considering indefinite suppression if recurrences remain frequent or severe despite immune reconstitution [^1126gRXQ] [^117FqkxX] [^1117k3eG].

> I should confirm counseling points and safety. Patients must be advised that HSV is lifelong, that asymptomatic shedding occurs, and that safer sex practices and disclosure reduce transmission; suppressive valacyclovir lowers transmission to serodiscordant partners, though efficacy beyond 8 months and in non-heterosexual or multi-partner contexts is less certain, so condoms and avoidance of contact during prodrome/lesions remain essential [^11435F2m] [^112HP4HZ]. Let me double-check that I emphasize early treatment at prodrome for recurrences and hydration with antivirals to reduce nephrotoxicity risk, especially in older adults or those with renal disease [^11435F2m] [^112v3uKn].

> Next, I should review follow-up and special scenarios. If lesions are atypical, persistent, or fail to respond, I need to reconsider the differential, repeat PCR/culture, and send HSV typing with susceptibility testing. In immunocompromised hosts with suspected acyclovir resistance, I should switch to foscarnet or cidofovir while arranging infectious diseases consultation, and remember that prior resistance does not preclude future sensitivity, so suppressive acyclovir can be resumed after clearance if appropriate [^116GuR8V] [^116CgUXf]. Hold on, I should verify that I also screen for other STIs at baseline and address coinfections, given the high frequency of concurrent STIs in genital ulcer patients and the HIV risk amplification with HSV-2 [^111bAiEW] [^111fv6s4].

> In summary, the most likely diagnosis for a recurrent vesicular rash on the penile shaft is genital HSV, with herpes zoster, mpox, molluscum, and fixed drug eruption as key differentials. Confirm with lesion PCR/culture and type-specific serology when needed, tailor therapy to immune status, initiate episodic treatment early, and offer suppressive therapy for frequent or distressing recurrences, alongside thorough counseling and STI screening to optimize outcomes and reduce transmission [^111dH5pm] [^111bAiEW] [^112AoZ3x] [^1163qaP8].

A recurrent vesicular rash on the penile shaft is most often due to **HSV-2** [^1111241A], with HSV-1 as a less frequent cause [^111fv6s4]; both present with grouped, painful vesicles that ulcerate and heal in 1–2 weeks, often with prodromal tingling or burning [^112J6d3F]. Diagnosis is confirmed by **PCR** [^111bAiEW] or viral culture from lesion swabs; type-specific serology helps when lesions are absent or atypical [^116D33iw]. Management includes episodic antivirals (acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir) [^112AoZ3x] started at prodrome [^11435F2m], and suppressive therapy for frequent or severe recurrences [^112qu7uB]; patient education on transmission and safer sex is essential [^11435F2m]. Key differentials include herpes zoster (dermatomal, unilateral) [^115Yt2b2], mpox (umbilicated, monomorphic, often with systemic symptoms) [^1175cTss], and molluscum contagiosum (firm, umbilicated papules) [^111yQ9E7]; clinical features and testing distinguish these entities [^116Jw7PY].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Diagnosis** |
|-|-|-|
| HSV-1/HSV-2 | - Grouped painful vesicles <br/> - Ulcerate <br/> - Heal in 1–2 weeks <br/> - Prodrome common [^11152iNU] | - PCR [^111bAiEW] <br/> - Viral culture <br/> - Serology [^116D33iw] |
| Herpes zoster | - Unilateral dermatomal vesicles <br/> - Severe pain <br/> - Rarely recurrent [^notfound] | - PCR for VZV [^115Yt2b2] <br/> - Clinical course |
| Mpox | - Umbilicated vesiculopustules <br/> - Monomorphic <br/> - Systemic symptoms [^113tJPNw] | - Orthopoxvirus PCR [^116v7GLZ] |
| Molluscum contagiosum | - Firm umbilicated papules <br/> - Non-painful <br/> - Chronic [^notfound] | - Clinical <br/> - Histology [^113fASWF] |
| Fixed drug eruption | - Recurrent at same site <br/> - Erythema <br/> - Vesicles <br/> - Bullae [^notfound] | - History <br/> - Drug exposure |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **PCR**: Gold standard for HSV from lesion swabs; high sensitivity/specificity [^11411Uhi].
- **Viral culture**: Useful for typing and resistance testing [^116GuR8V].
- **Serology**: Type-specific tests for HSV-1/HSV-2 when lesions absent or atypical [^116D33iw].
- **HIV testing**: Recommended given increased risk and severity with HIV [^111bAiEW].

---

## Management strategies

### Episodic therapy

- **Acyclovir**: 400 mg PO TID for 5 days or 800 mg PO BID for 5 days [^115cKaZk].
- **Valacyclovir**: 500 mg PO BID for 3 days or 1,000 mg PO daily for 5 days [^112AoZ3x].
- **Famciclovir**: 1,000 mg PO BID for 1 day or 125 mg PO BID for 5 days [^112AoZ3x].

---

### Suppressive therapy

Suppressive options include **acyclovir 400 mg PO BID** [^1163qaP8], **valacyclovir 500–1,000 mg PO daily** [^112HP4HZ], or **famciclovir 250 mg PO BID** [^117AEUuT]. Indications include frequent recurrences (≥ 6/year), severe or distressing episodes, or significant psychosocial impact [^1177DZz6].

---

### Patient education and counseling

Education and counseling should cover **asymptomatic shedding** and the need for consistent condom use [^117MDGu7]. Patients should avoid sexual activity during active lesions and prodrome [^11435F2m]. Disclose HSV status to partners and discuss suppressive therapy to reduce transmission [^117MDGu7].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

HSV infection is **lifelong** with periodic recurrences [^111fv6s4]; **HSV-2** recurs more frequently than HSV-1 [^111bAiEW]. Frequency and severity vary and are influenced by immune status, stress, and triggers [^notfound]. Suppressive therapy **significantly reduces** recurrence and transmission [^113omvTs].

---

## Potential complications

Complications include **secondary bacterial infection** [^notfound], urinary retention, and psychological distress [^111fv6s4]. HSV increases HIV acquisition risk [^111fv6s4], and acyclovir-resistant HSV can occur in immunocompromised patients [^116CgUXf].

---

A recurrent vesicular rash on the penile shaft is most often HSV-2 [^111bAiEW]; confirm with PCR or culture, use episodic or suppressive antivirals, and counsel on transmission and triggers [^113omvTs].

Case presentation

A 42-year-old Asian man with a past medical history of psoriasis presented with multiple papules on the scrotum after several sexual encounters. Due to his recent encounters, he was concerned about a sexually transmitted disease. To his knowledge, the lesions had been present for years and were asymptomatic and unchanging without previous treatment. He denied any family history of similar cutaneous findings. Physical examination showed multiple 2- to 5-mm skin-colored papules, some with central umbilication and keratin plugs, limited to the scrotum and sparing the penis (Fig 1). Shave biopsy was performed (Fig 2 and 3).

### Clinical features and novel presentations of human monkeypox in a central london centre during the 2022 outbreak: descriptive case series [^113tJPNw]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Novel presentations

We describe presentations of monkeypox infection in the participants that are not commonly reported. Some symptoms were severe and required hospital admission. Images represent both a range of presentations and a series of progression, giving an insight into the clinical course of the disease in an outbreak largely centred on gay, bisexual, and other men and men who have sex with men.

Penile oedema

Of the 31 participants who reported penile oedema, five had documented paraphimosis or phimosis.

One participant, a 34-year-old circumcised man, presented with multiple penile lesions with clinically significant associated oedema. He had a history of Crohn's disease and was receiving adalimumab. He initially described multiple small, vesicular lesions on the penile shaft, coronal sulcus, and scrotum, which enlarged over the next two days, becoming umbilicated, flesh coloured papules (fig 1). The lesions then became more indurated, and the patient developed fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. On day 5 of symptoms, he developed erythema and swelling that extended from the mid-penile shaft to the glans. Overnight the swelling progressed rapidly, and the patient was admitted to hospital for assessment.

Fig 1
Progression of penile lesions and penile oedema

On examination, 14 large, umbilicated lesions were identified along the penile shaft, coronal sulcus, and scrotum. There was associated subcutaneous oedema with no evidence of necrosis, and the skin was not tense or painful. Single pustular lesions on the participant's arm, back, and hip were also noted, along with inguinal lymphadenopathy. He was able to urinate. Results of a Treponema pallidum particle assay and rectal swab for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis nucleic acid amplification tests were negative, respectively. The urology team advised conservative management with cold compression and massage, and analgesia including topical lidocaine gel, ibuprofen, and oral morphine sulphate. Over the next 48 hours the swelling remained unchanged, with bruising extending from the glans towards the penile base. The swelling subsequently subsided gradually, and the patient was discharged on day 13. By day 16 the swelling had largely resolved, and the penile lesions had crusted over.

Fig 1
Dermatologic examination found a unilateral vesicular rash distributed within the S2 to S4 dermatomes on the left buttocks (A), perineum (B), and posterior scrotum (C) that did not arise as pictured until the fifth morning after onset of urinary dysfunction. The rash resolved without complication in 3 weeks after a 7-day course of valacyclovir.

The patient reported near immediate improvement in the ability to urinate the following day. Complete resolution of the rash occurred within 3 weeks without complication. Serology testing was performed at follow-up to rule out the possibility of herpes simplex virus. At 3 months postresolution, test results were negative for both herpes simplex virus 1 and herpes simplex virus 2 IgG (< 0.2 units) with elevated varicella zoster virus IgG titers (> 8 units). To date, he also reports no similar subsequent flares.

### Secondary and tertiary transmission of vaccinia virus after sexual contact with a smallpox vaccinee – san diego, California, 2012 [^1154Xja5]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Tertiary Vaccinia Case

The patient with the secondary vaccinia virus infection reported having experienced the perianal rash at the time he had sexual intercourse with a different male partner on June 22. The second male partner reported experiencing lesions on June 24. When interviewed, he reported no other recent sexual partners and said he had never been vaccinated against smallpox.

The second male partner sought care on June 25 from the same infectious disease specialist who had evaluated the secondary patient. He reported experiencing malaise, sore throat, and nasal congestion the day after sexual contact with the secondary patient. On physical examination, eight raised papular lesions were noted on his penis, and one was observed on the right forearm, all suspicious for vaccinia virus infection. Swab specimens of the lesions tested positive by PCR for nonvariola Orthopoxvirus by the County of San Diego Public Health Laboratory.

On initial evaluation and interview, the patient with tertiary infection reported no history of skin disease; however, three days later he recalled having had eczema as a child. By this time, his lesions had become more numerous and progressively painful. Re-examination on June 28 revealed 11 umbilicated lesions: eight previously noted on the penis, one previously noted on the arm, and two new lesions on the groin. In light of the number, location, and extent of lesions and the recently recalled history of eczema, CDC released VIGIV for the patient with tertiary infection, and he was admitted to the hospital. VIGIV was administered in the hospital on June 29 with no adverse effects. Two days later, five additional lesions developed on the penis and scrotum. No further lesions developed after July 1, and the patient was discharged from the hospital on July 2. At a follow-up examination on July 11, the lesions were found to have healed without further complication.

### Clinics in dermatology: herpes simplex virus (update on dermatologic aspects of sexually transmitted disease and human immunodeficiency virus) [^117MDGu7]. Clinics in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the most common cause of anogenital ulceration worldwide. There are two distinct viruses: HSV-1 associated with oro-labial cold sores and genital infection, and HSV-2 associated with genital infection. Infection is lifelong, and typically presents with painful anogenital ulceration which may recur after periods of latency. Asymptomatic shedding is common and may lead to transmission to sexual partners. Antiviral suppression with aciclovir, valaciclovir or famciclovir is useful to treat initial painful episodes, or troublesome recurrent infection. Suppressive antiviral therapy, condoms, selective abstinence and disclosure to sexual partners have all been demonstrated to reduce the risk of transmission.

### Imported monkeypox, Singapore [^114RWAHr]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The Case

On May 8, 2019, monkeypox was laboratory-confirmed in a 38-year-old man from Nigeria who had traveled to Singapore. The man resided in Delta State, Nigeria, but had attended a wedding in Ebonyi State during April 21–23, where he reported ingestion of barbecued bushmeat that might have been contaminated. He did not handle raw meat and had no exposure to wild animals or their products. He held an administrative job and reported no contact with rodents or with persons with pox-like illnesses.

The man arrived in Singapore on April 28 and attended a business workshop on April 29–30. Fever, chills, and myalgia developed on April 30, and a vesicular rash on his face developed on May 1 and progressed cephalocaudally. After symptoms developed, he remained in his hotel room most of the time. He sought medical attention on May 7; an ambulance transported him to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital emergency department, and he was transferred to the adjacent National Centre for Infectious Diseases. The same day, the treating physician notified the Ministry of Health about the suspected monkeypox case.

At examination in the emergency department, the patient had a fever of 37.7°C. He had multiple pustular lesions of varying stages over his face, trunk, and limbs (Figure 1, panel A), including palms and soles, penile shaft, and glans penis. There was no oral involvement. Cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy were present.

### Treatment of acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus with intralesional cidofovir [^117DEqLD]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 69-year-old man with a past medical history of ESRD on hemodialysis and AIDS with intermittent adherence to antiretroviral therapy presented with condyloma and squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the scrotum and urethral meatus. Treatment with topical imiquimod 5% cream was initiated. The patient had an extensive history of recurrent genital and ocular HSV, for which 0.5 to 1 g daily valacyclovir for suppressive therapy had previously been prescribed but not consistently taken as per prescription refill records. The patient had responded well to imiquimod; however, at a follow-up visit 5 months after initial presentation, examination revealed an exquisitely painful 3.5 × 4.0 cm verrucous hyperkeratotic ulcerative plaque on the dorsal prepuce of the penis (Fig 1). This ulcer presented as a chronic, nonhealing lesion, although it was uncertain for how long it had been present. A biopsy revealed pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia with focal viral cytopathic effect consistent with verrucous HSV (Fig 2). Due to the suspicion of acyclovir resistance given the history of poor adherence to antiviral therapy and the patient's absolute CD4 count being 9 cells/mm, viral culture and susceptibility testing was obtained. Viral culture of the ulcerated plaque revealed acyclovir-resistant, foscarnet-sensitive HSV.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^113omvTs]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Recurrent HSV-2 Genital Herpes

Almost all persons with symptomatic first-episode HSV-2 genital herpes subsequently experience recurrent episodes of genital lesions. Intermittent asymptomatic shedding occurs among persons with HSV-2 genital herpes infection, even those with longstanding clinically silent infection. Antiviral therapy for recurrent genital herpes can be administered either as suppressive therapy to reduce the frequency of recurrences or episodically to ameliorate or shorten the duration of lesions. Certain persons, including those with mild or infrequent recurrent outbreaks, benefit from antiviral therapy; therefore, options for treatment should be discussed. Many persons prefer suppressive therapy, which has the additional advantage of decreasing the risk for transmitting HSV-2 genital herpes to susceptible partners.

Diagnosis of mpox — A high index of suspicion is warranted for mpox. Clinical presentation with symptoms such as a characteristic rash is strongly suggestive of mpox; however, diagnosis of mpox based solely on clinical presentation can be challenging because illness can be atypical with isolated proctitis or rectal bleeding or a small number of lesions, lesions can mimic herpes zoster, herpes simplex, syphilis, and molluscum contagiosum, and due to the high frequency of coinfection with STIs during the multinational 2022 clade II mpox outbreak, a broad differential diagnosis is encouraged.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116CgUXf]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Acyclovir-resistant HSV in people with HIV — management guidance: People with HIV are less likely to experience acyclovir-resistant HSV than hematopoietic stem cell recipients, and the risk of developing acyclovir-resistant HSV was lower with daily suppressive acyclovir therapy than with episodic therapy. Recurrences following acyclovir-resistant herpes can be caused by either acyclovir-resistant or acyclovir-sensitive strains. Even in people with prior acyclovir resistance, suppressive acyclovir therapy should be offered after resolution of the episode (CIII); acyclovir resistance is not expected to wane during a clinical episode and acyclovir should not be used as therapy until resolution of the episode in this setting, and if recurrence develops while taking suppressive therapy, susceptibility testing should be done.

Varicella-zoster virus diseases — clinical manifestations in adults with HIV: Varicella rash evolves rapidly during the initial 8 to 12 hours after onset, with new vesicle formation continuing for 2 to 4 days. Herpes zoster presents as a painful dermatomal eruption; the most common sites are thoracic dermatomes (40% to 50% of cases), followed by cranial nerve (20% to 25%), cervical (15% to 20%), lumbar (15%), and sacral (5%) dermatomes. In zoster, new vesicle formation typically continues for 3 to 5 days and crusts typically persist for 2 to 3 weeks. About 20% to 30% of people with HIV have one or more subsequent episodes of herpes zoster; the probability of a recurrence within 1 year is approximately 10%. Approximately 10% to 15% of people with HIV report post-herpetic neuralgia as a complication following herpes zoster.

Angiokeratomas are benign cutaneous vascular lesions characterized by dilated thin-walled blood vessels lying in the upper part of the dermis, mostly associated with an epidermal reaction such as acanthosis and/or hyperkeratosis. Angiokeratomas of Fordyce are predominantly located on the scrotum and are only rarely found on the penis and then usually on the glans penis. We report a rare case of angiokeratoma of Fordyce located on the shaft of the penis and associated with two recurrences after appropriate surgical excision.

### Treatment to prevent recurrent genital herpes [^117AEUuT]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Genital herpes is the leading cause of genital ulcer disease worldwide and is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases. Recurrent genital herpes is associated with major medical and psychosocial morbidities; therefore, suppressive therapy is required, especially in patients with frequent and/or severe episodes.

Recent Findings

A recent meta-analysis evaluated prophylactic regimens in immunocompetent hosts, and proposed four alternatives with similar efficacies: three twice-daily regimens (i.e. acyclovir 400 mg, valaciclovir 250 mg and famciclovir 250 mg) and one once-daily regimen (valaciclovir 500 mg). Immunocompromised patients may have more prolonged, frequent and severe episodes of genital herpes. Valaciclovir 500 mg twice daily maintains the benefits of acyclovir treatment in terms of clinical efficacy and safety. Alternative therapies in case of clinical failure are discussed. Development of new strategies is moving in three directions: improvement in antiviral therapy or identification of new drug targets; local immune therapy; and vaccination. Many prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination approaches have been explored, but no effective vaccine is presently available.

Summary

In 2007 control of herpes recurrence remains an important goal because of the impact it has on the quality of life of millions of people and its relationship with transmission of other sexually transmitted diseases, especially HIV infection.

### Balanitis associated with FOLFIRI chemotherapy [^114KueGb]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Case report

A man in his 50s with esophageal cancer was admitted to the hospital for intractable diarrhea. His chemotherapy regimen had recently been switched to FOLFIRI for esophageal cancer. During admission, he complained of a pruritic rash on his hands and a painful rash on his penis associated with dysuria. These symptoms started with the second cycle of chemotherapy. He self-treated the rash with emollients but had limited relief. He was afebrile. On the circumcised glans penis extending over the corona and onto the distal penile shaft, there was a circumferential confluent red plaque with serous crust and scale (Fig 1). On his palmar hands, bilaterally overlying joints, there were moderate pink plaques with scaling (Fig 2, A). There was notable xerosis of the palms and fissuring at finger bases (Fig 2, B). There was no melanonychia, serpentine skin hyperpigmentation, stomatitis, or mucosal dyspigmentation. He had no history of asthma or atopic dermatitis and did not take any over-the-counter medications or herbal supplements. Urine testing found negative leukocyte esterase and nitrites, and urine chemistry values were within normal limits. A superficial wound culture of the penis found normal flora, with no Pseudomonas aeruginosa, β-hemolytic Streptococci, or Staphylococcus aureus, and no leukocytes detectable by staining. Testing for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae was negative, venereal disease research laboratory findings were nonreactive, and thrombocyte count was within normal limits. The patient never received hematopoietic cell transplantation or blood products. Skin biopsy was not performed. Possible diagnoses considered included irritant contact dermatitis, psoriasis, nummular eczema, erosive lichen planus, extramammary Paget disease, and human papilloma virus infection. In light of the characteristic clinical appearance and temporal relationship to FOLFIRI treatment as well as lack of evidence for infectious etiologies or graft-versus-host disease, a diagnosis of toxic erythema of chemotherapy with balanitis and grade 2 acral erythema was established. Topical steroid (clobetasol 0.05% twice a day) ointment for 14 days for the hands and 7 days for the glans penis was recommended. After 3 days of topical therapy, pruritus and pain improved. Seven days after initiation of therapy, the patient was seen in the oncology clinic, and balanitis had resolved. There was no dose modification made to the chemotherapy regimen because of these dermatologic side effects. The patient received 2 additional cycles of chemotherapy during weeks 3 and 5 after the initial reaction with no report of symptom recurrence during follow-up appointments.

### Atypical mucocutaneous manifestations of MPOX: a systematic review [^115Nayji]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

3 CLASSIC CLINICAL PRESENTATION

The incubation period of the infection ranges from 4 to 10 days. More than 90% of patients present with skin manifestations consisting of whitish papules on an erythematous inflammatory base appearing mainly within the area of virus inoculation (in recent outbreaks, such areas coincide with areas involved in sexual contact). Such erythema may not be noticeable in patients of color. The lesions have been termed pseudopustules as they are solid lesions containing no purulent material. Over the next few days, they develop central umbilication with subsequent centrifugally progressive necrosis until the entire lesion is covered (Figure 1a). Eventually, the necrotic crust falls off, leaving residual erythema or a varioliform scar. Some authors have compared the lesions to a flower in the so‐called Pansy sign. Ulcers in mucosal areas present with maceration and a dirty background(Figure 1b).

Previous African endemic cases affected patients of different ages and both sexes, but during the 2022–2024 global outbreak, a dominant sexual route of transmission was identified. A predilection for men who have sex with men (MSM) has been found, as well as a higher frequency of lesions located in genital and perianal areas, compared with the more monomorphic patterns with truncal predominance and centrifugal spread previously seen in Africa. Furthermore, infection in the current outbreak has a better prognosis and higher infectivity. The most frequent systemic manifestations include fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, headache, and arthromyalgia. A nonnegligible percentage of cases have been associated with odynophagia, proctitis, and urethritis. Myocarditis, encephalitis, respiratory, and gastrointestinal disorders have been reported as systemic complications.

3.1 Solitary lesions

Between 8.5% and 11% of patients present with solitary lesions, most frequently located in the genital area. This presentation can be a diagnostic challenge and poses a differential diagnosis with other sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in adults and adolescents with HIV — diagnosis and serologic testing: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and viral culture are preferred methods for diagnosing mucocutaneous lesions potentially caused by HSV, with PCR the most sensitive method; HSV detected in genital lesions should be typed as HSV-1 or HSV-2, and recurrences are more frequent with HSV-2 than HSV-1. Type-specific serologic assays are commercially available and can be used to diagnose HSV-2 infection in asymptomatic individuals or those with atypical lesions, and type-specific serologic screening for HSV-2 for persons with HIV infection can be considered, but false positive enzyme immunoassay results occur particularly at low index values (1.1–3.5), for which confirmatory testing with a second serologic test is recommended in the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sexually Transmitted Disease Treatment Guidelines. A diagnosis of HSV-2 should be accompanied by counseling that includes discussion of transmission risk to sex partners, and screening for HSV-1 infection is not recommended.

### Epidemiology of recurrent genital herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 [^1111241A]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe the epidemiology of type specific recurrent genital herpes, and to compare the duration of recurrent genital lesions caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2.

Methods

Participants were enrolled at clinics across the United States. Adults suspected of having active genital herpes were eligible. Lesions were cultured for HSV and typed. Data from 940 participants with recurrent culture positive HSV lesions were analysed. Pearson's chi(2) and Fisher's exact tests, multivariate logistic regression models, and a stratified Cox proportional hazards model were used to compare epidemiological characteristics and lesion duration of HSV-1 and HSV-2.

Results

HSV-1 was present in 4.2% of the recurrent HSV culture positive lesions. HSV-1 was most prevalent among whites (6.5%) and individuals with 0–2 recurrences in the previous year (9.1%) and, among men, in those with rectal/perirectal lesions (13.2%). Longer lesion duration was not significantly associated with virus type (hazard ratio (HR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.38, p = 0.79), but was associated with male sex (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.99, p = 0.04), and HIV seropositivity (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.81, p < 0.01).

Conclusions

The authors found that, in the United States, recurrent genital HSV-1 is relatively rare in the STD and HIV clinic setting, especially among black people. Among men, rectal/perirectal recurrent lesions are more likely to be caused by HSV-1 than are penile lesions. In addition, lesion duration depends on sex and HIV status but not virus type. These findings shed new light on the type specific epidemiology of recurrent genital HSV, and suggest that type specific testing can inform the prognosis and management of genital herpes.

### Umbilicated vesicles and multiple pustules on the genital area in a man [^112CinX8]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

A 61-year-old HIV-negative, man presented with itchy lesions on his genital area, that had developed 3 days before the consultation. Seven days before the eruption, he attended a party where he had unprotected sexual intercourse with men. Physical examination showed 3, 3 to 4 mm, asymptomatic, umbilicated vesicles and multiple pustules on the penis shaft and pubis, accompanied by bilateral lymphadenopathy (Fig 1, A). On follow-up after 10 days, the vesicles and pustules spontaneously resolved, leaving some crusted lesions (Fig 1, B). Dermoscopy of an umbilicated vesicle revealed a trizonal pattern, characterized by a central ulceration-crust, a white peripheral halo with dotted hemorrhagic vessels and a paler pink zone at the periphery (Fig 2). Histopathology showed a cluster of pallor and ballooning degeneration of keratinocytes, with scattered eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig 3).

Papulonecrotic tuberculid represents a hypersensitivity reaction to Mycobacterium tuberculosis or its products that disseminate through hematogenous route to the skin from an internal tuberculous focus. It is characterized by recurrent eruptions of asymptomatic, dusky red papules, which undergo ulceration and crusting, and eventually heal after a few weeks with varioliform scarring. Although it most commonly involves extragenital sites, isolated glans penis involvement has been reported very rarely.

Diagnostic Considerations

Clinical diagnosis of genital herpes can be difficult because the self-limited, recurrent, painful, and vesicular or ulcerative lesions classically associated with HSV are absent in many infected persons at the time of clinical evaluation. If genital lesions are present, clinical diagnosis of genital herpes should be confirmed by type-specific virologic testing from the lesion by NAAT or culture. Recurrences and subclinical shedding are much more frequent for HSV-2 genital herpes infection than for HSV-1 genital herpes. Therefore, prognosis and counseling depend on which HSV type is present. Type-specific serologic tests can be used to aid in the diagnosis of HSV infection in the absence of genital lesions. Both type-specific virologic and type-specific serologic tests for HSV should be available in clinical settings that provide care to persons with or at risk for STIs. HSV-2 genital herpes infection increases the risk for acquiring HIV twofold to threefold; therefore, all persons with genital herpes should be tested for HIV.

### Famciclovir [^112DFWGD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Genital Herpes

Recurrent episodes: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 329 immunocompetent adults with recurrent genital herpes. Patients self-initiated therapy within 6 hours of the first sign or symptom of a recurrent genital herpes episode with either famciclovir 1000 mg twice daily (n = 163) or placebo (n = 166) for 1 day. The median time to healing among patients with non-aborted lesions (progressing beyond the papule stage) was 4.3 days in famciclovir-treated patients (n = 125) as compared to 6.1 days in placebo-treated patients (n = 145). The median difference in time to healing between the placebo and famciclovir-treated groups was 1.2 days (95% CI: 0.5 to 2.0). Twenty-three percent of famciclovir-treated patients had aborted lesions (no lesion development beyond erythema) vs. 13% in placebo-treated patients. The median time to loss of all symptoms (e.g., tingling, itching, burning, pain, or tenderness) was 3.3 days in famciclovir-treated patients vs. 5.4 days in placebo-treated patients.

### Amivantamab, a bispecific epidermal growth factor receptor and mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor inhibitor, associated with ulcerative intertrigo [^116tVBRr]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our patient developed recurrent erosive and ulcerative intertriginous eruptions reminiscent of granuloma inframammary adultorum and granuloma gluteale adultorum, forms of erosive papulonodular dermatosis thought to result from irritant dermatitis associated with skin occlusion, especially in patients requiring diapers or using excessive occlusive topicals. The name refers to macro-appearance; biopsy does not show granulomas. Instead, biopsy typically shows dense, mixed intradermal infiltrate with nonspecific histology. A similar eruption was described in a patient treated with amivantamab for nonsmall cell lung cancer who developed penile and inguinal ulcers. Unlike symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema, a recognized dAE of amivantamab, granuloma inframammary, and gluteale adultorum present with discrete, erythematous to violaceous eroded papules and nodules rather than erythematous patches. Although the punched-out ulcerations could be consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum, they appeared in an atypical location for pyoderma gangrenosum and biopsy did not show characteristic neutrophilic infiltrate.

A common factor between this patient's unusual rash and dAEs associated with amivantamab is the presence of granulation tissue on biopsy. One case series describes Erosive Pustular Dermatosis-like eruptions in patients taking amivantamab that showed "florid granulation tissue" on biopsy, which may be linked to dysfunctional growth and differentiation of keratinocytes caused by EGFR inhibition. Additionally, suggestive of a causal link between amivantamab and this patient's ulcerative intertrigo is the appearance of a dose-dependent relationship, as she had a recurrence of a milder rash with half-dose amivantamab and no recurrence with a quarter dose.

This patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus, type II, and obesity, which both contribute to the development of intertriginous rashes. Notably, she previously experienced a rash beneath her breasts and in her groin after treatment with mobocertinib, another tyrosine-kinase inhibitor. At the time, it was presumed to be a yeast infection; mobocertinib treatment was stopped for other reasons and a Dermatology referral was never placed. The prior rash associated with mobocertinib may indicate patient-specific risk for dAE in intertriginous regions, which could be linked to known risk factors for intertriginous rash.

### Genital herpes: a review [^112J6d3F]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted disease, affecting more than 400 million persons worldwide. It is caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) and characterized by lifelong infection and periodic reactivation. A visible outbreak consists of single or clustered vesicles on the genitalia, perineum, buttocks, upper thighs, or perianal areas that ulcerate before resolving. Symptoms of primary infection may include malaise, fever, or localized adenopathy. Subsequent outbreaks, caused by reactivation of latent virus, are usually milder. Asymptomatic shedding of transmissible virus is common. Although HSV-1 and HSV-2 are indistinguishable visually, they exhibit differences in behavior that may affect management. Patients with HSV-2 have a higher risk of acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Polymerase chain reaction assay is the preferred method of confirming HSV infection in patients with active lesions. Treatment of primary and subsequent outbreaks with nucleoside analogues is well tolerated and reduces duration, severity, and frequency of recurrences. In patients with HSV who are HIV-negative, treatment reduces transmission of HSV to uninfected partners. During pregnancy, antiviral prophylaxis with acyclovir is recommended from 36 weeks of gestation until delivery in women with a history of genital herpes. Elective cesarean delivery should be performed in laboring patients with active lesions to reduce the risk of neonatal herpes.

### Rat-bite fever: an uncommon cause of fever and rash in a 9-year-old patient [^113hKKst]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of fever, acral papulopustular rash, and arthralgias in an immunocompetent child include both systemic infections and inflammatory conditions. Lesions of chronic meningococcemia may be pustular and purpuric and are accompanied by fever and arthralgias. If there is concern for sexual abuse, disseminated gonorrhea and secondary syphilis should also be considered. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is characterized by fever, headache, and malaise followed by erythematous macules on the hands and feet, which may become purpuric or pustular.

Coxsackievirus infection may also present with fever, oral erosions, widespread edematous papules, and vesicopustules involving the hands, feet, perioral skin, and buttocks. Persistence of rash after 10 days argues against coxsackievirus in this case, as does the pustular (rather than vesicular) quality and location of the lesions. Varicella zoster virus lesions are vesicular rather than pustular and heal within 1 to 2 days with scarring. Noninfectious inflammatory conditions that should be considered include acute generalized pustular psoriasis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and bowel-associated dermatosis/arthritis syndrome.

These can be isolated genital conditions or manifestations of a more widespread cutaneous disease. Though similar appearing, there are often key clinical findings that aid in in diagnosis. In general, genital dermatoses can be classified as physiologic variants, inflammatory, neoplastic, or infectious in etiology. This article provides a broad overview for urologists in addressing both common and rarer penile and scrotal dermatoses. Emphasis is placed on characteristic clinical findings to aid in diagnosis. Recommendations for diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and appropriate follow-up are discussed.

### Genital herpes: rapid evidence review [^115SCbDS]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or 2. It affects at least 500 million people worldwide and is a lifelong condition involving initial infection and periodic reactivation with variable viral shedding. There are no vaccinations for the prevention of HSV, and routine serologic screening is not recommended in asymptomatic individuals. Practices that prevent or reduce transmission include the use of suppressive antiviral therapy in serodiscordant partners, avoiding sexual contact during outbreaks, and use of condoms. A clinically apparent herpes outbreak is characterized by painful vesicles on the genitals, rectum, or perineum and may be accompanied by a flulike syndrome of fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy. Diagnosis uses type-specific polymerase chain reaction, viral culture of active lesions, or type-specific serologic testing. Nucleoside analogue medications reduce viral shedding and are used to treat active outbreaks and prevent recurrences. Complications of genital herpes include encephalitis, meningitis, and urinary retention. During pregnancy, antiviral suppression is recommended starting at 36 weeks of gestation in patients with a known history of genital herpes. Elective cesarean delivery should be offered to patients with active lesions to reduce neonatal exposure to HSV.

### An atypical presentation of monkeypox associated with scrotal and penile shaft edema [^1175cTss]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since May 2022, a new global outbreak occurred in cases of human-to human transmission of monkeypox (MPX), an orthopoxvirus. While the mode of transmission in the current outbreak is poorly understood, many cases have occurred following direct physical contact in men who have sex with men. It typically presents as the simultaneous development of discrete or multiple vesiculopustules with a monomorphic morphology and eventual crusting and may also be preceded by a prodrome of fever and lymphadenopathy.,

Compared to previous endemic outbreaks, the current MPX outbreak has been characterized by a wider array of cutaneous and extracutaneous manifestations including lesions possibly in various stages of development and with a majority of cases presenting with anogenital lesions at the site of inoculation. Other novel features include proctitis, dysphagia, penile edema, and secondary bacterial cellulitis. In this report, we discuss a unique case of MPX with only a single characteristic lesion and an atypical, and dramatic presentation of acute-onset scrotal and penile edema. Dermatologists should be aware of atypical MPX presentations in at-risk populations to optimize diagnostic accuracy and prevent over-treatment of clinical mimickers.

### Amivantamab, the first epidermal growth factor receptor and mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor inhibitor, associated with penile and inguinal ulcers and paronychia [^111QEecQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 57-year-old man with a history of advanced non–small cell lung cancer with distant metastasis presented to the clinic with painful lesions in the inguinal folds and toenails. Six weeks prior to the visit, amivantamab was started. At the time of presentation, he had already received 5 infusions. Two weeks after starting treatment, he developed small ulcers in the groin and swollen toenails. After each subsequent infusion, new ulcers appeared in the same sites and the penile area. Other associated symptoms included cracked lips and dry mouth. Prior to the initial visit, lesions had been treated with potent topical steroids and antifungals with minimal response. The patient denied having any family members with similar lesions, previous episodes of similar lesions, or systemic symptoms. Physical examination revealed multiple, tender, oval ulcers with scalloped borders on bilateral inguinal folds and penile shaft (Fig 1). There was erythema and swelling with an underlying hemorrhagic crust on the proximal nailfolds of the first, second, and third toes bilaterally (Fig 2). No inguinal lymphadenopathy was identified. Laboratory study results were negative for Epstein–Barr virus IgG and immunoglobulin M, cytomegalovirus, HIV, herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 IgG and immunoglobulin M, rapid plasma reagin test, and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test. A skin biopsy specimen from an active lesion on the groin showed an ulcer with a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (Fig 3). Based on the clinical presentation, we suspected the possibility of drug-related toxicity, and amivantamab was held for 1 month. During this interval, paronychia resolved with clobetasol and mupirocin cream, and the ulcers showed significant improvement with re-epithelization. However, due to the patient's malignancy, the oncologist resumed amivantamab. After subsequent infusion, there was a recurrence of ulcers in the same sites, and perianal erythema. To rule out chancroid ulcers, the patient completed a 3-week course of azithromycin, and lesions persisted. Therefore, a diagnosis of amivantamab-induced inguinal and penile ulcers and paronychia was established.

Case report

A 75-year-old man with no significant past medical history and minimal engagement with the healthcare system presented to the emergency department with 5 days of genital and gluteal vesicular lesions (Fig 1). The patient was in his usual state of health, when he developed a painful, vesicular rash involving his scrotum and buttock. He did not have hematuria, fevers, chills, or nausea/vomiting. He denied receiving the shingles vaccine. Upon further questioning by the dermatology consult team, the patient endorsed mild dysuria, difficulty voiding, and decreased bowel movements, with last bowel movement 3 days prior to presentation. He denied any previous history of these urologic symptoms.

Fig 1
Vesicular rash in a patient with herpes zoster at initial presentation. Left scrotum and left buttock with clustered, erythematous-to-violaceous papules and vesicles along the left S3-S4 dermatome that did not cross the midline.

On physical examination, the patient had multiple erythematous-to-violaceous clustered papules and vesicles extending from the left glans penis, ventral shaft, and scrotum to the left medial buttock along the S3-S4 dermatome. Lesions did not cross the midline and were mildly tender to palpation. Laboratory studies, including a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel, were within the normal limits. Urinalysis did not indicate cystitis. Ultrasound of the scrotum demonstrated a moderate right-sided varicocele and small right epididymal cysts. A postvoid residual urine test revealed an elevated residual volume of 425 milliliters. Swabs of skin lesions were obtained and subject to polymerase chain reaction testing for herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), with a positive result for VZV. The patient was diagnosed with herpes zoster involving the left S3-S4 dermatome and complicated by acute neuropathy, bladder paralysis, and constipation.

### Genital herpes: a review [^11152iNU]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Genital herpes simplex virus infection is a recurrent, lifelong disease with no cure. The strongest predictor for infection is a person's number of lifetime sex partners. The natural history includes first-episode mucocutaneous infection, establishment of latency in the dorsal root ganglion, and subsequent reactivation. Most infections are transmitted via asymptomatic viral shedding. Classic outbreaks consist of a skin prodrome and possible constitutional symptoms such as headache, fever, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. As the infection progresses, papules, vesicles on an erythematous base, and erosions appear over hours to days. These lesions usually crust, re-epithelialize, and heal without scarring. First-episode infections are more extensive: primary lesions last two to six weeks versus approximately one week for lesions in recurrent disease. Atypical manifestations are common. Infected persons experience a median of four recurrences per year after their first episode, but rates vary greatly. Genital herpes simplex virus type 2 recurs six times more frequently than type 1. Viral culture is preferred over polymerase chain reaction testing for diagnosis. Serologic testing can be useful in persons with a questionable history. Effective oral antiviral medications are available for initial, episodic, and suppressive therapy but are not a cure. There is some evidence that alternative therapies such as L-lysine, zinc, and some herbal preparations may offer some benefit. Counseling patients about the risk of transmission is crucial and helps prevent the spread of disease and neonatal complications.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) disease clinical manifestations — oral HSV-1 illness in untreated patients lasts 5 days to 10 days and lesions recur 1 to 12 times per year, and genital HSV shedding occurs more frequently in persons with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts < 200 cells/mm3 than in those with higher counts, while in profoundly immunocompromised patients extensive, deep, nonhealing ulcerations have been reported most often in those with CD4 counts < 100 cells/mm3. Increasingly, first-episode genital herpes is caused by HSV-1 and is indistinguishable from HSV-2 infection, but recurrences and viral shedding occur less often with genital HSV-1 infection.

Patient B

Presentation

Patient B is a 29-year-old man with a medical history of HIV of 11 years, with poor medication compliance for the past 6 months, who presented to the ED with a 2-week history of purulent penile discharge and a gradually worsening ulcer over the dorsum of his long finger metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ; Figure 3). He also reported a truncal rash that started 3 weeks ago. He works as a dishwasher and has been repeatedly picking at the ulcer over this time. In the past week, the area surrounding the wound became swollen, erythematous, and painful. A number of vesicles appeared on the dorsum of the hand as well. Physical examination showed swelling and erythema surrounding the long finger MCPJ. There was an ulcer with hypertrophic scarring over the MCPJ dorsum, with mild tenderness to palpation. There was no pain with movement. He had normal strength and sensation throughout. Review of systems was largely negative except for his penile discharge and hand pain.

Figure 3.
Bilateral hands of patient B upon presentation.

Diagnosis

Hand x-ray showed some soft tissue swelling with no signs of osteomyelitis. Labs demonstrated a CD4 count of 319, viral load 156 000. An excision of the lesion was performed at bedside and sent for pathology, stain, and cultures. Urethral swab resulted positive for gonorrhea, but negative for Chlamydia trachomatis. Blood cultures were negative. After the patient developed vesicular lesions on the face and arms, swabs of vesicular fluid were sent for PCR NAAT testing, and a diagnosis of mpox was confirmed.

Treatment

Upon presentation, the patient was immediately restarted on his antiretroviral medications (bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide) and ceftriaxone for suspected disseminated gonorrhea. As discussed, the patient's gonorrhea was not disseminated, and thus 1 dose was adequate to successfully treat this. Vancomycin was added to cover possible superimposed bacterial infection of his unroofed ulcers. This was discontinued after cultures of the lesion were negative on gram stain and culture. He continued his antiretroviral therapy and treated his hand pruritis and swelling with elevation and warm soapy soaks 6 times daily.

Disease course/outcome

After treatment of his HIV, the patient's vesicular lesions improved on hospital day 4, and the patient was discharged home to quarantine. Follow-up visit 23 days after initial presentation confirmed the resolution of all skin changes and no permanent defects. The patient returned to work without complaints.

### Interventions for men and women with their first episode of genital herpes [^112AYUJo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Genital herpes is incurable, and is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). First-episode genital herpes is the first clinical presentation of herpes that a person experiences. Current treatment is based around viral suppression in order to decrease the length and severity of the episode.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of the different existing treatments for first-episode genital herpes on the duration of symptoms and time to recurrence.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (from inception to April 2016), MEDLINE (from inception to April 2016), the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group (from inception to April 2016), EMBASE (from inception to April 2016), PsycINFO (from inception to April 2016), CINAHL (from inception to April 2016), LILACS (from inception to April 2016), AMED (from inception to April 2016), and the Alternative Medicines Specialised Register (from inception to April 2016). We handsearched a number of relevant journals, searched reference lists of all included studies, databases of ongoing trials, and other Internet databases.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on participants with first-episode genital herpes. We excluded vaccination trials, and trials in which the primary objective assessed a complication of HSV infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

All studies written in English were independently assessed by at least two review authors for inclusion, risk of bias for each trial, and to extract data. Studies requiring translation were assessed for inclusion, trial quality, and data extraction by external translators.

Main Results

We included 26 trials with 2084 participants analysed. Most of the studies were conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US), and involved men and women experiencing their first episode of genital herpes, with the exception of three studies which included only women. We rated the majority of these studies as having an unclear risk of bias; largely due to lack of information supplied in the publications, and due to the age of the trials. This review found low quality evidence from two studies of oral acyclovir, when compared to placebo, reduced the duration of symptoms in individuals undergoing their first episode of genital herpes (mean difference (MD) -3.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.91 to -0.54; I(2) = 52%). In two studies (112 participants), intravenous acyclovir decreased the median number of days that patients with first-episode herpes suffered symptoms. Oral valaciclovir (converted to acyclovir) also showed a similar length of symptom duration when compared to acyclovir in two studies. There is currently no evidence that topical acyclovir reduces symptoms (MD -0.61 days, 95% CI -2.16 to 0.95; 3 RCTs, 195 participants, I(2) statistic = 56%). There is also no current evidence that the topical treatments of cicloxolone cream, carbenoxolone sodium cream, adenosine arabinoside, idoxuridine in dimethyl sulfoxide, when compared to placebo reduced the duration of symptoms in people undergoing their first episode of herpes. Two studies reported no evidence of a reduction in the number of median days to recurrence following treatment with oral acyclovir versus placebo. Adverse events were generally poorly reported by all of the included studies and we were unable to quantitatively analyse this outcome. For those taking acyclovir, there were no serious adverse events; the most common adverse events reported for oral acyclovir were coryza, dizziness, tiredness, diarrhoea and renal colic. For intravenous acyclovir these were phlebitis, nausea and abnormal liver function tests and for topical acyclovir there was pain with the topical application. Those undergoing interferon treatment had significantly more adverse events compared to those taking placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low quality evidence from this review that oral acyclovir reduced the duration of symptoms for genital herpes. However, there is low quality evidence which did not show that topical antivirals reduced symptom duration for patients undergoing their first episode of genital herpes. This review was limited by the inclusion of skewed data, resulting in few trials that we were able to meta-analyse.

### Clinical and penile dermoscopy evaluation of a reticulated pattern on the penile glans [^116JPBi2]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old man visited our clinic for evaluation of a mildly pruritic lesion on the glans. He complained of a recurrent red patch, which had been slowly enlarging over the previous three months. Clinical examination revealed a slightly raised plaque with a reticulated lacy net pattern and white threads on the glans. There was no evidence of skin, nail or other mucosal involvement on physical examination. Laboratory tests, including hepatitis and syphilis serologies, were normal or negative. Penile dermoscopy revealed white reticular and circular lines [Wickham striae] on a red background. Penile dermoscopy should be included as a part of the clinical inspection of genital diseases to support diagnosis, as well as to ideally avoid unnecessary invasive investigation.

14.2 External Genital Warts

In two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, 601 subjects with EGW were treated with ZYCLARA, 3.75% or a matching vehicle (Studies EGW1 and EGW2). Trials enrolled subjects aged from 15 to 81 years. The baseline wart area ranged from 6 to 5,579 mm2(median 60 mm2) and the baseline wart count ranged from 2 to 48 warts. Most subjects had two or more treated anatomic areas at baseline. Anatomic areas included: inguinal, perineal, and perianal areas (both sexes); the glans penis, penis shaft, scrotum, and foreskin (in males); and the vulva (in females). Up to one packet of trial cream was applied once daily. The trial cream was applied to all warts prior to normal sleeping hours and left on for approximately 8 hours. Subjects continued applying the trial cream for up to 8 weeks, stopping if they achieved complete clearance of all (baseline and new) warts in all anatomic areas. Subjects who achieved complete clearance of all warts at any time up to the Week 16 visit entered a 12-week follow-up period to assess recurrence.

Complete clearance was defined as clearance of all warts (baseline and new) in all anatomic areas within 16 weeks from baseline. The complete clearance rates are shown in Table 7. The proportions of subjects who achieved complete clearance at or before a given week (cumulative proportion) for the combined studies are shown in Figure 1. Complete clearance rates by sex for the combined studies are shown in Table 8.

Figure 1: Cumulative Proportion of Subjects Achieving Complete Clearance of EGW by a Given Week (Studies EGW1 and EGW2)

Of the 113 ZYCLARA, 3.75%-treated subjects who achieved complete clearance in the two trials, 17 (15%) subjects had a recurrence within 12 weeks.

No trials were conducted directly comparing the 3.75% and 5% concentrations of imiquimod cream in the treatment of external genital warts.

### Genital herpes infection: progress and problems [^114mNPeo]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Genital herpes (GH) is a sexually transmitted infection causing recurrent, self-limited genital, buttock, and thigh ulcerations. Symptoms range from unrecognized or mild to severe with frequent recurrences. Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) type-1 or type-2 cause GH. HSV establishes latency in sacral ganglia and causes lifelong infection. Viral reactivation leads to genital ulceration or asymptomatic shedding which may lead to transmission. HSV infection during pregnancy can cause fulminant hepatitis and neonatal transmission. Severe and atypical manifestations are seen in immunocompromised people. Guanosine analogs treat symptoms and prevent recurrences, shedding, and transmission. Novel preventive and therapeutic strategies are in development.

### Penile involvement of immunoglobulin a vasculitis / Henoch-Schönlein purpura [^112bsv9N]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Immunoglobulin A vasculitis/Henoch-Schönlein purpura (IgAV/HSP) is a leukocytoclasia vasculitis of childhood, predominantly affecting the skin, joints, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys. The involvement of the penis is rare.

Objective

We aimed to describe this rare manifestation of IgAV/HSP and to review the previous studies, including similar cases.

Methods

Clinical data were reviewed for two children of penile involvement of IgAV/HSP in our hospital. More clinical cases were retrieved from the databases of PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus from database inception to February 1, 2020.

Results

We presented two boys aged three and five years both of whom had penile lesions after presenting with the typical rash of IgAV/HSP on lower extremities. The penile lesions improved entirely in a few days without treatment in one and with corticosteroid treatment in the other. The literature review revealed 12 articles describing 20 patients with penile involvement of IgAV/HSP. The penile findings were edema, erythema, ecchymosis, purpuric rash, edema, color change, stiffness of the shaft or prepuce, and tenderness. Penile lesions appeared before the purpuric rash of IgAV/HSP in three of 22 patients. The penile involvement could make the diagnosis challenging especially if the penile lesions appear before the typical rash of the disease. The lesions improved entirely in the short term in all patients; in five without treatment in fifteen after corticosteroid or immunosuppressive drug treatment.

Conclusions

It is important to raise awareness about this rare manifestation among health care providers. It is not clear whether corticosteroid treatment should be initiated for treatment since it seems as a self-limited feature. Treatment with corticosteroids could be considered in the treatment of selected cases especially with systemic involvement.

See FDA-Approved Patient Labeling.

17.1 Importance of Adequate Hydration

Patients should be advised to maintain adequate hydration.

17.2 Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis)

Patients should be advised to initiate treatment at the earliest symptom of a cold sore (e.g., tingling, itching, or burning). There are no data on the effectiveness of treatment initiated after the development of clinical signs of a cold sore (e.g., papule, vesicle, or ulcer). Patients should be instructed that treatment for cold sores should not exceed 1 day (2 doses) and that their doses should be taken about 12 hours apart. Patients should be informed that valacyclovir hydrochloride is not a cure for cold sores.

17.3 Genital Herpes

Patients should be informed that valacyclovir hydrochloride is not a cure for genital herpes. Because genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease, patients should avoid contact with lesions or intercourse when lesions and/or symptoms are present to avoid infecting partners. Genital herpes is frequently transmitted in the absence of symptoms through asymptomatic viral shedding. Therefore, patients should be counseled to use safer sex practices in combination with suppressive therapy with valacyclovir hydrochloride. Sex partners of infected persons should be advised that they might be infected even if they have no symptoms. Type-specific serologic testing of asymptomatic partners of persons with genital herpes can determine whether risk for HSV-2 acquisition exists.

Valacyclovir hydrochloride has not been shown to reduce transmission of sexually transmitted infections other than HSV-2.

If medical management of a genital herpes recurrence is indicated, patients should be advised to initiate therapy at the first sign or symptom of an episode.

There are no data on the effectiveness of treatment initiated more than 72 hours after the onset of signs and symptoms of a first episode of genital herpes or more than 24 hours after the onset of signs and symptoms of a recurrent episode.

There are no data on the safety or effectiveness of chronic suppressive therapy of more than 1 year's duration in otherwise healthy patients. There are no data on the safety or effectiveness of chronic suppressive therapy of more than 6 months' duration in HIV-infected patients.

17.4 Herpes Zoster

There are no data on treatment initiated more than 72 hours after onset of the zoster rash. Patients should be advised to initiate treatment as soon as possible after a diagnosis of herpes zoster.

### The global and regional burden of genital ulcer disease due to herpes simplex virus: a natural history modelling study [^111fv6s4]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Genital herpes is a lifelong sexually transmitted infection caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and type 1 (HSV-1) and is characterised by recurrent, self-limited outbreaks of painful genital lesions in a proportion of those infected. We estimated that in 2016, 491 million people aged 15–49 years had HSV-2 infection, which is almost all sexually transmitted.HSV-1, although predominately an oral infection, is increasing as a cause of genital herpes in some settings. We estimated that 192 million people had genital HSV-1 infection in 2016. Symptoms of genital HSV infection include vesicles, ulcers, fissures or other painful lesions on or near the genital skin and mucosa, collectively termed genital ulcer disease (GUD). Although many people acquire genital HSV infection without symptoms, in those who do have GUD, the first episode typically lasts the longest (up to 2–3 weeks in the absence of antiviral therapy) and may be more severe and associated with systemic symptoms. First-episode GUD is clinically indistinguishable whether caused by HSV-2 or HSV-1 infection. However, those with HSV-2-related GUD often have subsequent periodic recurrences of GUD over many years, while HSV-1-related GUD seems to recur much less frequently.GUD recurrences tend to be shorter and less severe than the first episode.

Symptomatic HSV infection is associated with psychosocial effects, including low mood, feelings of shame and stigma, fears around transmission, and effects on personal relationships. There is potential for transmission to sexual partners, and to the neonate during birth, regardless of symptoms, as viral shedding occurs both asymptomatically and symptomatically. Neonatal infection is rare but can be extremely serious, as it carries a high risk of neonatal death or permanent disability. Current epidemiological evidence suggests that HSV-2 infection also increases susceptibility to HIV infection, and may increase HIV infectiousness in people living with HIV (PLHIV). Since GUD is associated with increased quantities of viral shedding, as well as breaches to the protective integrity of the genital skin and mucosa, these transmission risks and cofactor effects may be heightened in the presence of GUD.

### Red scrotum syndrome: an update on clinicopathologic features, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^115uN4mf]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The genital skin may be affected by a variety of dermatoses, be it inflammatory, infectious, malignant, idiopathic, or others. The red scrotum syndrome is characterized by persistent erythema of the scrotum associated with a burning sensation, hyperalgesia, and itching. Its cause is unknown, but proposed mechanisms include rebound vasodilation after prolonged topical corticosteroid use and localized erythromelalgia. The condition is chronic, and treatment is often difficult. Here we review the etiology, the physical and histopathologic findings, and the management of this condition. We also describe related conditions such as red scalp syndrome, red ear syndrome, and red vulva syndrome. Finally, we summarize the different cases reported in the literature and discuss the features that help in the differentiation of red scrotum syndrome from its mimickers.

### Progress in meeting today's demands in genital herpes: an overview of current management [^115yW1b7]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Treatment of genital herpes requires accurate diagnosis, patient support, and effective treatment. Diagnosis is usually straightforward for classic presentations characterized by vesicular lesions but can be challenging for atypical presentations, which are more common. Diagnosis of asymptomatic infection requires access to molecular technology or type-specific serologic assays. Misconceptions about herpes simplex infection are common and patient education is essential. Patient concerns extend beyond disease frequency and severity-the psychological impact should not be underestimated. Antiviral therapy is relevant at all stages of infection. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are effective and well tolerated for genital herpes treatment. Continuous suppressive therapy controls all symptoms of recurrent disease and helps to relieve disease complications. The prodrugs valacyclovir and famciclovir offer easier, less-frequent dosing than required for acyclovir. Valacyclovir achieves effective suppression when taken once a day. Interventions to prevent genital herpes transmission and to control the global problem are urgently required.

### Giant seborrheic keratoses on penis [^112AGj19]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Seborrheic keratoses are very common benign epidermal tumors. Despite the high frequency, the pathogenesis is still unknown. They are extremely rare in the genital area. The participation of human papilloma viruses (HPVs) in pathogenesis of seborrheic keratoses is being discussed.

Aims

The aims of this case report are to inform about extremely rare lesion in genital area in a young man and evaluate the association of HPVs in the development of seborrheic keratoses.

Methods

We used histopathological examination to establish the correct diagnosis, which revealed signs of seborrheic keratosis. The real-time polymerase chain reaction method confirmed low-risk HPV 6 from the lesions.

Main Outcome Measures

HPVs may play a role in pathogenesis of seborrheic keratoses.

Results

The patient was successfully treated with shave excision under spinal anesthesia. Six-month follow-up was without any recurrence. We suggest that HPVs can be considered as etiologic factor in creation of seborrheic keratosis.

Conclusions

Seborrheic keratoses are very common on sun-exposed skin, but they are rare in the genital area, such as on the shaft of penis. This localization may lead to misdiagnosis. Seborrheic keratoses in genital area might negatively influence the sexual life of the patient. Containing HPV 6 low-risk virus, they never lead to malignant transformation.

### An atypical presentation of monkeypox associated with scrotal and penile shaft edema [^111KQpqN]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 27-year-old male with no significant past medical history presented with 4 days of worsening scrotal and penile edema, erythema, and pain (Fig 1). He reported a bite from an unknown arthropod near the glans penis which occurred during a camping trip in addition to swimming in a river in Southern Missouri. Other individuals attended and swam, but none reported similar symptoms. He reported being monogamous with a single male partner for many years. At symptom onset, he noted a single lesion on the right coronal penile sulcus. He denied dysuria, hematuria, dyschezia, or hematochezia.

Fig 1
Initial hospital presentation. Pubic, penile, and scrotal erythema associated with tender, indurated swelling and a subtle heme crusted papule over the right coronal sulcus.

Two days prior to hospitalization, he obtained cephalexin at an urgent care for a diagnosis of scrotal cellulitis. He experienced worsening edema and developed myalgias, chills, and fevers. On initial in-patient evaluation by urology, there were no indications for urgent surgical intervention nor concerns for Fournier's gangrene, and he was started on cefepime and vancomycin for presumed scrotal cellulitis. Dermatology was consulted on hospital day 6 given progressive scrotal and penile swelling and pain despite multiple days of antibiotics.

Physical examination showed significant tender induration over the scrotum, penile shaft, pubis, and perineum in association with mild erythema and without crepitus or fluctuance (Fig 2). A yellow crusted papule was also present on the right penile sulcus (Fig 3). Labs showed leukocytosis (13.7 × 10⁹ cells/L), thrombocytopenia (143 × 10³ /uL), lactic acidosis (3.14 mmol/L), elevated C-reactive protein (18.5 mg/dL), and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (24 mm/h). Infectious workup showed a positive Orthopoxvirus polymerase chain reaction swab on the dorsal penile sulcus lesion. Blood cultures, skin bacterial cultures, urinalysis, HIV, lesional herpes simplex virus-1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, C hlamydia trachomatis, N eisseria gonorrhea, T reponema pallidum, and hepatitis C viral testing were normal. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis and scrotal ultrasound showed bilateral hydroceles and inguinal adenopathy.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1178TucK]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) diseases — clinical manifestations in adults with HIV include primary varicella with a central distribution that evolves through macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, and crusts; lesions evolve rapidly in the initial 8 to 12 hours, and new vesicle formation continues for 2 days to 4 days with systemic symptoms. Because most adults with HIV in the United States are VZV seropositive, primary varicella is an uncommon occurrence. Herpes zoster presents as a painful dermatomal eruption; the most common sites are thoracic dermatomes (40% to 50% of cases), followed by cranial nerve (20% to 25%), cervical (15% to 20%), lumbar (15%), and sacral (5%) dermatomes. New vesicle formation typically continues for 3 to 5 days and crusts persist for 2 to 3 weeks. About 20% to 30% of patients with HIV have subsequent episodes, the probability of recurrence within 1 year is approximately 10%, and approximately 10% to 15% report post-herpetic neuralgia. Ocular involvement can occur with nasociliary branch disease (herpes zoster ophthalmicus), with vesicles on the tip of the nose (Hutchinson sign) as a clue; stromal keratitis can be chronic and VZV-associated anterior uveitis tends to be chronic and can result in increased intraocular pressure or glaucoma, scarring of intraocular tissues, and cataract.

### Painful facial, oral, and genital ulcers [^1118kGyS]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old otherwise healthy male presented to the dermatology clinic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a 2-day history of multiple painful, non-pruritic ulcers in the genital and facial regions, fever, odynophagia, headache, and fatigue. Physical examination revealed pustules and vesicles with central umbilication at the same stage of development and targetoid crusted ulcers on the right inguinal area (Fig 1), base of the penis, right gluteal region, and left cheek along with bilateral painful inguinal adenopathy. The oropharynx showed erythematous patches and erosions with white exudate.

Question 1: Based on the clinical presentation, what is the most likely etiology of the patient's ulcers?
A. Treponema pallidum
B. Monkeypox virus
C. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)
D. Candida albicans
E. Non-infectious inflammation

Answers:
A. Treponema pallidum – Incorrect. Primary syphilis infection is classically characterized by a painless genital ulcer, often associated with non-tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. Serologies for syphilis were negative in this case.
B. Monkeypox virus – Correct. Upon further questioning, the patient reported frequent unprotected sexual intercourse with alternating male partners and recent contact with symptomatic partners. After 7 days, the patient developed additional lesions on the bilateral thighs, face, right anterior neck, and buttocks. Lesions evolved to erosions with overlying crusts, with spontaneous resolution of all lesions after 3 weeks. Monkeypox is a zoonotic Orthopoxvirus. Beginning in May of 2022, a rapid increase in the number of monkeypox cases emerged. Historically, lesions began on the face and spread across the trunk and extremities. In the current outbreak, it has been observed that lesions begin primarily in the genital region in men who have sex with men.
C. HSV – Incorrect. Genital herpes presents as painful grouped vesicles or ulcers. Disseminated HSV could present as facial and genital ulcers in an immunocompromised patient. Serologies for HIV were negative.
D. Candida albicans – Incorrect. Cutaneous candidiasis presents as bright red erythema surrounded by satellite pustules and papules in moist areas. Deep fungal infections can cause genital ulcers but C. albicans is not the typical pathogen.
E. Non-infectious inflammation – Incorrect. Behcet syndrome is characterized by recurrent oral apthae associated with genital ulcers. The precise etiology is unknown, but an autoimmune etiology has been proposed. The classic triad includes uveitis as well.

### Guidance for the prevention and treatment of monkeypox (mpox) [^114r53Qq]. ACOEM (2022). High credibility.

Clinical presentation of mpox includes fever and chills with aches and fatigue early, progressing to a vesicular rash on the face and genitals in more advanced cases; symptoms typically occur within 1 or 2 weeks after exposure and a person can remain contagious for several additional weeks; the incubation period is usually 7–14 days but can range from 5–21 days; hospitalization is not typically required.

### Eruption on the vulva and groin [^116meLdP]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Transient acantholytic dermatosis (Grover disease) – Incorrect. Grover disease is a self-limited pruritic papulovesicular condition with predilection for the trunk, neck, and proximal extremities, sparing the genitocrural region. Histology may resemble pemphigus, Darier disease, or Hailey-Hailey disease or be spongiotic.
B. Segmental follicular dyskeratosis (Darier disease) – Incorrect. Darier disease presents in adolescence as greasy, scaly brown papules that may form large verrucous plaques. Histology displays acantholysis with hyperkeratosis and dyskeratotic cells; verrucous epidermal hyperplasia and prominent folliculocentricity are typical. Seborrheic regions are affected with distribution on the trunk, scalp, face and neck in addition to the groin. Nail abnormalities are common. A segmental distribution indicates this form of Darier follows the lines of Blaschko, which is inconsistent with the genitocrural distribution found in this patient.
C. Segmental Hailey-Hailey disease – Incorrect. Histopathology shows dyskeratosis and suprabasilar acantholysis with loss of intercellular bridges, classically described as a dilapidated brick wall. The clinical morphology is dissimilar, with painful flaccid vesicles and crusted erosions on intertriginous skin such as the neck, axilla, and groin in a blaschkoid distribution.
D. PAD (of the genitocrural folds) – Correct. Discrete white to skin-colored smooth or verrucous papules that coalesce into plaques on the vulva and perineum reflect the morphology of PAD. PAD is a rare chronic acantholytic dermatosis that presents in young women with asymptomatic but persistent lesions limited to the genital, inguinal, and perineal skin. PAD occurs less frequently in men and can involve the penis, scrotum, perineum, or thighs. Histology shows overlapping features of Hailey-Hailey and Darier disease, including suprabasilar acantholysis, parakeratosis, and dyskeratosis. Verrucous epidermal hyperplasia is also typical.
E. Familial dyskeratotic comedones – Incorrect. Although the clinical morphology includes discrete asymptomatic hyperkeratotic papules, comedones are the principal lesions. The trunk, extremities, face, and groin are involved. Histology shows dilated infundibula filled with keratin and dyskeratosis; acantholysis is occasionally observed.

### Anogenital pseudotumoral herpes and HIV infection: a new challenge for diagnosis and treatment [^113UFgh2]. AIDS (2012). Low credibility.

HIV-infected patients may develop rare anogenital pseudotumoral herpes potentially mimicking epidermoid carcinoma. We assessed treatment in five new cases with a median follow-up of 3.3 years. Recurrence and clinical nucleoside analog resistance were observed in all patients. All drug treatments were only temporarily curative and clinical responses varied between patients and recurrences. Foscavir seemed to be the most appropriate second-line treatment and cidofovir or thalidomide should be considered as alternative treatments.

### Sacral zoster with a primary complaint of difficulty voiding [^113RMNZy]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Report

A 27-year-old man presented to the emergency department for an acute allergy manifesting as urticaria to ciprofloxacin. The patient reported visiting an urgent care clinic earlier that day for a 3-day history of difficulty with urinary voiding but no other complaints. He received the antibiotic for a suspected urinary tract infection based solely on symptoms. No urinalysis or blood work was performed. After stabilization for the allergic reaction with oral diphenhydramine and prednisone, the patient was able to spontaneously pass a small amount of urine, after which he reported no urge. However, postvoid pelvic ultrasound scan found a highly distended bladder, and Foley catheterization relieved another 780 mL of urine.

Renal ultrasound scan and genital and prostatic examination findings were all unremarkable. Urinalysis and blood work were also both negative for infection or signs of kidney dysfunction. The patient noted a small erythematous but nonvesicular rash confined to the upper left buttock, roughly 2 cm in diameter, which he claimed to have noticed that morning. However, given the presence of similarly appearing, diffuse allergic urticaria covering much of the patient's back, it was not independently evaluated. After 3 additional hours of observation, he was discharged after a spontaneous, near-complete void confirmed with pelvic ultrasound scan.

Two days later, the patient was seen in the dermatology department for significant expansion of the previously described rash and newly associated intermittent burning pain. New vesicular eruptions surrounding the original rash still confined to the upper left buttock were observed (Fig 1, A). In addition, similar eruptions were found in the left perineal region (Fig 1, B) and left posterior scrotum (Fig 1, C). He also noted no improvement in spontaneous voiding. History confirmed childhood varicella infection with no known history of genital herpes simplex. These findings were suggestive of varicella zoster virus reactivation with a rare association of voiding dysfunction. The patient was prescribed a 7-day course of oral valacyclovir (1 g, 3 times daily) for the zoster, and tamsulosin (0.4 mg daily) to aid in voiding. He was instructed to return immediately should the rash worsen or flare again.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) clinical manifestations — Orolabial herpes is the most common manifestation of HSV-1 infection, with oral lesions evolving from papule to vesicle, ulcer, and crust; in untreated persons, the course of illness is 5 to 10 days and lesions recur 1 to 12 times per year. The majority of individuals with HSV-2 seropositivity have clinically silent infection, and genital herpes is typically caused by HSV-2, though HSV-2 can also cause orolabial herpes; genital HSV-1 is clinically indistinguishable from HSV-2 but recurrences and viral shedding occur less often. Typical genital mucosal or skin lesions evolve through papule, vesicle, ulcer, and crust, and viral shedding on mucosal surfaces occurs frequently and can result in transmission. HSV shedding occurs more frequently in people with HIV with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts < 200 cells/mm3 than in those without HIV or with higher CD4 counts.

### Painful perianal rash in an HIV-positive individual [^116v7GLZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: We found the monkeypox case report published in August 2022 by Khan et alto be helpful in describing the clinical presentation of monkeypox. We aim to expand upon these findings by presenting a case of monkeypox with anogenital involvement and propose monkeypox as an infectious etiology for proctitis.

A 40-year-old man with well-controlled HIV presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of fever and anorectal pain. He denied exposure to animals, recent travel, or sexual contact in the past year. Cutaneous examination was notable for an erythematous macular eruption on the trunk with discrete vesiculopustules on the extremities. Genital examination revealed tender, eroded vesiculopapules in the perianal region and on the penile shaft (Fig 1).

Fig 1
Monkeypox spectrum of clinical manifestations. A, Perianal papules and eroded vesiculopapules with umbilicated and crateriform centers. B, Erythematous macular eruption on the trunk. C, Firm vesiculopustules with an erythematous rim sparsely distributed on the extremities.

Ten days after initial presentation, PCR of lesional perianal swabs confirmed non-variola orthopoxvirus infection. Workup for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including herpes simplex virus, gonorrhea and chlamydia, and syphilis, was negative. A diagnosis of infectious proctitis associated with monkeypox was established.

The current outbreak of monkeypox is unique for various reasons, including rapid spread in non-endemic areas globally and intriguing epidemiology with unclear modes of transmission. Additionally, several cases with atypical clinical manifestations of the disease are being noted, including those with palmoplantar, ocular, and anogenital involvement. Proctitis is one such clinical feature that had not been included in the initial descriptions of mucocutaneous manifestations of monkeypox. The virus can cause painful inflammation of the rectal lining accompanied by tenesmus. A recent study from Spain reported proctitis as a symptom in 81 (15.9%) of 508 confirmed monkeypox patients.

### Genital herpes [^111dH5pm]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on genital herpes:

- **Definition**: Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted viral infection characterized by primary and recurrent genital inflammation and lesions.
- **Pathophysiology**: Genital herpes is mostly caused by HSV-2 and HSV-1 transmitted through sexual contact.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of genital herpes in North America is estimated to range from 5,000 to 24,000 per 100,000 people per year.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include lesions of mucous membrane presenting as bilateral clusters of macules, papules, followed by vesicles, pustules, and ulcers on the external genitalia with symptoms of pain, itching, burning, dysuria, lymphadenopathy, fever, cervicitis (women), and proctitis (homosexual men). Complications in women include aseptic meningitis and urinary retention. Recurrent episodes may show prodromal symptoms of paresthesia and pains in the area of lumbosacral dermatomes. Asymptomatic genital shedding without any clinical symptoms is quite frequent. The disease increases psychological stress with frequent recurrences.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Untreated pregnancy-related genital herpes is associated with a mortality of 0.062 per 1,000 births in neonates.
