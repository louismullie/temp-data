## Question

treatment for pertusis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pertussis treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching goals of therapy and the timing of treatment. Then, I should verify first-line antibiotic choices and dosing by age, including macrolide safety in neonates. Next, I will review alternatives when macrolides are contraindicated or resistance is suspected. After that, I need to check supportive care, escalation for severe disease, and special populations like pregnancy. Finally, I should confirm post-exposure prophylaxis indications and public health reporting requirements, and close with a concise synthesis of the treatment algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the core therapeutic goals and the critical role of timing. Antibiotics eradicate Bordetella pertussis from the nasopharynx and reduce transmission, but they do not reliably shorten illness once paroxysmal cough is established; early treatment in the catarrhal or early paroxysmal phase may lessen symptom severity, so I should not delay therapy while awaiting lab confirmation when suspicion is high, especially in infants and outbreak settings [^115JfKgH] [^112sZv2S] [^11158xnk] [^112zZU7w].

> I will now examine first-line therapy. Macrolides are preferred: azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin are all effective for eradication; azithromycin is generally favored for tolerability, adherence, and fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects, with pediatric RCTs showing equivalent bacteriologic cure and better compliance with azithromycin compared with erythromycin [^114mgK2x] [^111ujx2Q] [^112sZv2S] [^1145XPWw].

> Wait, let me verify dosing and duration so I don't overgeneralize. For azithromycin, typical regimens are 5 days total (e.g., 10 mg/kg on day 1, then 5 mg/kg on days 2–5), which achieves eradication comparable to longer erythromycin courses; clarithromycin is commonly given for 7 days, and erythromycin for 7–14 days, though shorter macrolide courses are microbiologically effective and better tolerated, supporting pragmatic use of azithromycin or clarithromycin when feasible [^114mgK2x] [^111ujx2Q] [^112sZv2S] [^1145XPWw].

> Hold on, I should verify neonatal safety before recommending macrolides in the youngest infants. Erythromycin is associated with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), and azithromycin carries a smaller but nonzero IHPS risk in infants under 1 month; nonetheless, given the severity of neonatal pertussis, azithromycin remains the drug of choice with close monitoring for IHPS, and the benefits outweigh risks in confirmed or strongly suspected cases [^116vZ1ST] [^11158xnk] [^113WcDRW].

> Next, I should review alternatives when macrolides are unsuitable or resistance is a concern. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is an acceptable alternative for patients older than 2 months who cannot take macrolides; it is not recommended for infants under 2 months due to risks such as kernicterus, and macrolide resistance patterns are most concerning in parts of Asia, where TMP-SMX may be preferred when resistance is documented or strongly suspected [^112sZv2S] [^1145XPWw] [^116U6kAu].

> Let me consider supportive care and escalation for severe disease, especially in young infants. Severe pertussis can feature apnea, hypoxemia, pulmonary hypertension, and extreme leukocytosis; management is supportive with oxygen, airway stabilization, and ICU-level care as needed, while avoiding therapies that may worsen pulmonary hypertension such as corticosteroids or nitric oxide in some contexts, and considering exchange transfusion for rapidly rising leukocytosis with cardiopulmonary compromise, recognizing that evidence is largely observational but mortality remains high without aggressive support [^1163nHTp] [^116U6kAu] [^115VEcHE].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought corticosteroids might help with airway inflammation, but I should double-check that. Reports from severe infant series suggest steroids and pulmonary vasodilators correlate with worse outcomes and may be harmful in pertussis-associated pulmonary hypertension; thus, I should avoid routine steroids and reserve nitric oxide or ECMO for refractory cases with careful multidisciplinary judgment, acknowledging that some guidance remains expert opinion rather than high-quality RCTs [^1163nHTp] [^116U6kAu].

> I need to ensure I address special populations, particularly pregnancy. For pregnant patients with suspected pertussis, treat promptly with azithromycin and extend the treatment window up to 6 weeks after cough onset given severity risk; critically, prevention via Tdap vaccination at 27–36 weeks' gestation during each pregnancy reduces infant pertussis by roughly 85% and is the cornerstone strategy to protect neonates too young to be vaccinated [^113WcDRW] [^113ktKik] [^111XBB1M].

> Next, I should review post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) indications and timing. PEP with a macrolide is recommended for all close contacts of a pertussis case within 21 days of exposure, regardless of immunization status, prioritizing households with infants, childcare settings, and healthcare workers with exposure to high-risk patients; this interrupts transmission even though antibiotics do not change established disease in the index case [^113ktKik] [^112Pukt9] [^114a7MRj].

> I should confirm infection prevention and public health steps. Persons with pertussis are considered noninfectious after 5 days of appropriate antibiotic therapy, and cough may persist for weeks; facilities should restrict those with active disease until 5 days of therapy are completed and require written clearance, while exposed individuals should start PEP and be restricted until prophylaxis is initiated or until 21 days have passed if they decline treatment, with case reporting to public health to enable contact tracing [^11742qQo] [^114a7MRj] [^112zZU7w].

> Let me synthesize the practical algorithm so I don't miss anything. Suspect pertussis in patients with paroxysmal cough, posttussive emesis, or inspiratory whoop, especially if afebrile; do not wait for labs if suspicion is high, particularly in infants or outbreaks; start azithromycin as first-line when appropriate by age and comorbidity, use clarithromycin or erythromycin if needed, and consider TMP-SMX for older infants and adults who cannot take macrolides; provide supportive care and escalate early for severe disease; administer PEP to close contacts within 21 days; and ensure maternal Tdap during each pregnancy to protect newborns [^115JfKgH] [^11158xnk] [^113ktKik] [^116Lhd3X].

---

Pertussis treatment is centered on **early macrolide therapy** to reduce transmission [^113WcDRW], with azithromycin preferred for its short course and tolerability [^114mgK2x]. Antibiotics do not shorten illness after paroxysms begin [^113WcDRW], but they **eradicate bacteria and lower contagion** [^115JfKgH]. Supportive care includes hydration, oxygen, and suctioning; **hospitalize high-risk patients** (infants, pregnant patients, severe disease) [^116U6kAu]. Postexposure prophylaxis is indicated for close contacts, especially infants and pregnant patients [^113ktKik] [^113WcDRW]. Prevention relies on vaccination, including maternal Tdap at 27–36 weeks to protect neonates [^116Lhd3X] [^115vu1yT].

---

## Antibiotic treatment

### Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are indicated for **confirmed or strongly suspected pertussis**, particularly in the early (catarrhal) stage [^11158xnk], to reduce transmission and bacterial load [^115JfKgH]. Treatment after the paroxysmal stage (> 2 weeks of cough) **does not shorten illness** but still reduces contagiousness [^114mgK2x].

---

### Recommended antibiotic regimens

| **Antibiotic** | **Age group** | **Dosage and duration** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Azithromycin | ≥ 1 month | 10 mg/kg day 1, then 5 mg/kg days 2–5 | Preferred for short course and tolerability [^114mgK2x] |
| Clarithromycin | ≥ 1 month | 15 mg/kg/day divided BID × 7 days | Alternative macrolide [^111ujx2Q] |
| Erythromycin | ≥ 1 month | 40–50 mg/kg/day divided QID × 14 days | Higher GI side effects; avoid in neonates due to IHPS risk [^116vZ1ST] |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | ≥ 2 months | TMP 8–12 mg/kg/day divided BID × 14 days | Alternative when macrolides contraindicated [^112sZv2S] |

---

For neonates (< 1 month), **azithromycin is preferred**; monitor for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) [^113WcDRW] [^11158xnk].

---

### Clinical efficacy of antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics **effectively eradicate B. pertussis** from the nasopharynx, reducing transmission but not altering the clinical course if started late [^112sZv2S] [^1145XPWw]. Early treatment (within 1–2 weeks) may lessen symptom severity [^11158xnk].

---

## Supportive care

Supportive care is essential, especially in infants and severe cases, and includes:

- **Hydration**: Maintain adequate fluid intake [^notfound].
- **Oxygen therapy**: For hypoxemia or respiratory distress [^116U6kAu].
- **Suctioning**: Clear airway secretions in infants [^116U6kAu].
- **Nutritional support**: Nasogastric feeding if feeding difficulties [^116U6kAu].

---

## Management of severe cases

Severe cases, especially in infants, may require **hospitalization and intensive care** [^115GCM43]:

- **Mechanical ventilation**: For respiratory failure or severe apnea [^1163nHTp].
- **Exchange transfusion**: For extreme leukocytosis with pulmonary hypertension [^1163nHTp] [^115VEcHE].
- **ECMO**: Refractory respiratory failure with pulmonary hypertension [^115VEcHE].
- **Pulmonary hypertension management**: Inhaled nitric oxide, prostacyclin analogs [^117R5LUZ].

---

## Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP)

PEP is recommended for **close contacts** of confirmed cases, especially infants, pregnant patients, and immunocompromised individuals [^113ktKik] [^116U6kAu]. Regimens mirror treatment: azithromycin 10 mg/kg day 1, then 5 mg/kg days 2–5; clarithromycin 15 mg/kg/day × 7 days; or erythromycin 40–50 mg/kg/day × 14 days [^114mgK2x] [^111ujx2Q].

---

## Prevention through vaccination

Vaccination is the cornerstone of prevention, with **maternal Tdap at 27–36 weeks** providing ~85% protection to infants [^113ktKik] [^111XBB1M]. Infant DTaP at 2, 4, 6, and 15–18 months, plus a booster at 4–6 years, is recommended [^114tVHZN]. Adolescent and adult Tdap boosters every 10 years maintain immunity and reduce transmission [^115Brqeo].

---

## Complications and prognosis

Complications vary by age and severity: infants may develop pneumonia, apnea, encephalopathy, and pulmonary hypertension, whereas older children and adults may have rib fractures, urinary incontinence, and prolonged cough [^112k5aEC]. Mortality is highest in unvaccinated infants; **early treatment and supportive care improve outcomes** [^115GCM43].

---

## Emerging therapies and research

Research is exploring **novel therapies**, including MASP1 modulation and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor agonism, but these remain investigational [^112k5MF8] [^115vAq25].

---

Pertussis management hinges on **early macrolide therapy** to curb transmission, with supportive care for severe disease and PEP for high-risk contacts [^116U6kAu]. Prevention through vaccination, especially maternal Tdap, is critical to reduce infant morbidity and mortality [^116Lhd3X].

### What's old is new again: pertussis [^116Ld8xd]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the availability of a vaccine, pertussis is a particularly difficult disease to control. Improvements in molecular diagnosis, changes in vaccine components, and missed opportunities for vaccination have resulted in rising pertussis disease incidence. Young infants are at the highest risk of severe complications and mortality, but immunization of mothers during pregnancy can provide protection. The presentation of infant pertussis differs somewhat from the traditional catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent stages seen in adults. By understanding the clinical presentation of pertussis in all age groups, providers can more quickly prescribe appropriate antibiotic therapy and postexposure prophylaxis. Providers are also an essential source of evidence-based vaccination counseling for pregnant women and families, and understanding the complications of this disease is an important part of these sometimes difficult but critical conversations.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115JfKgH]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Pertussis laboratory diagnosis and treatment context: There are several recognized laboratory methods to confirm a diagnosis of pertussis; culture (100% specific), polymerase chain reaction (88%-100% specific), serology (72%-100% specific), and oral fluid testing (91%-99% specific). There are several effective antibiotics; these eliminate B pertussis but do not alter the clinical course of the illness. However, treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after onset of illness to prevent spread of the disease. The decision to treat with antibiotics is therefore frequently based on a clinical diagnosis rather than waiting for laboratory confirmation.

### Pertussis: common questions and answers [^113ktKik]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, remains a public health concern despite expanded immunization recommendations over the past three decades. The presentation of pertussis, which is variable and evolves over the course of the disease, includes nonspecific symptoms in the catarrhal stage, coughing with the classic whooping in the paroxysmal stage, and persistent cough in the convalescent stage. When there is clinical suspicion for pertussis, the diagnosis should be confirmed using polymerase chain reaction testing, which has replaced culture as the preferred confirmatory test. Recent evidence has confirmed a waning of acquired immunity following pertussis immunization or infection, leading to changes in tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) immunization recommendations. Patients 11 years or older should receive at least one dose of Tdap, although Tdap may replace any dose of the tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine. All pregnant patients should receive Tdap between 27 and 36 weeks' gestation with each pregnancy to convey immunity to the newborn. Cocooning (vaccinating close contacts of high-risk individuals) is no longer recommended because immunized patients can still contract and transmit pertussis. A history of seizure or hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes after a prior pertussis vaccination is no longer a contraindication to immunization. Antibiotic treatment is intended to prevent transmission of pertussis to others and does not shorten the disease course or improve symptoms. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for household contacts of someone with pertussis and for those exposed to pertussis who are at high risk of severe illness (e.g., infants, people who are immunocompromised or in the third trimester of pregnancy) or in close contact with someone at high risk. Azithromycin is the preferred antibiotic for treatment or prophylaxis.

### Antibiotic treatment of pertussis: are 7 days really sufficient? [^11766cTS]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Short courses of antibiotic therapy are recommended for treatment of pertussis. We report 2 young unvaccinated infants with persistently positive Bordetella pertussis by polymerase chain reaction from nasopharyngeal swabs despite 7 days of clarithromycin (15mg/kg/d) therapy. In 1 patient, quantitative polymerase chain reaction was 7.02 (log GEq/mL) at the onset of treatment, 6.26 at the end of treatment and remained positive with 2.64 and 2.69 during and after a second 7-day course, respectively. The generally believed assumption that contagiousness of pertussis is terminated after 5 days of antibiotic treatment should be challenged, at least in young infants.

### Whooping cough in adults: an update on a reemerging infection [^111D87Ep]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Pertussis, or whooping cough, which is commonly thought of as a pediatric illness, is an underappreciated adult pathogen. Recent outbreaks highlight the significance of pertussis in adults and the risk of transmission to at-risk infants who are most susceptible to complications, including death. This article describes the recent epidemiologic shifts and reviews the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of pertussis. New vaccination recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in response to recent outbreaks and infant deaths are highlighted.

### Use of antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of pertussis [^111k9XHz]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Antibiotics are commonly used for treating confirmed cases of pertussis and also for disease prevention in outbreak situations, and there is little evidence of antibiotic resistance of Bordetella pertussis. The most commonly used antibiotic is erythromycin, but the associated side effects limit compliance and therefore efficacy. Other antibiotics, such as clarithromycin and azithromycin, have been shown to be at least as effective as erythromycin in preventing and treating pertussis, and they also have fewer side effects, which improves compliance. This article outlines the use of different antibiotics in pertussis management and their effect on preventing disease transmission and reducing disease severity and duration.

### The global pertussis initiative: process overview [^112wJkUw]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

In 2001, the Global Pertussis Initiative was established as a scientific forum to analyze the status of pertussis globally and to evaluate various immunization strategies to improve disease control. Thirty-seven multidisciplinary experts from 17 countries participated. The initiative was conducted in 3 stages: assessment of the international epidemiology, diagnosis, health and economic burden, and prevention and treatment of pertussis; evaluation and prioritization of 7 immunization strategies to address the problems; and identification of solutions to surmount potential barriers to the implementation of these strategies. A health-economic model, created for the Initiative, analyzed the cost-effectiveness of the selected immunization strategies. Discussion, debate, and consensus were facilitated via a roundtable meeting, teleconferences and use of a closed, interactive website, allowing the participants to share data, knowledge, experience, and opinion. This article describes the processes undertaken to conduct the Initiative.

### Pertussis: a disease affecting all ages [^115okZhR]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Bordetella pertussis is a highly contagious bacterium known to cause pertussis (whooping cough) and is transmitted via airborne droplets. Although childhood vaccination has dramatically reduced reported pertussis cases, the incidence of the disease has increased over the past 20 years, most notably in previously immunized adolescents and adults. Pertussis should be suspected in patients of all ages with cough who meet the clinical criteria for the disease. Diagnostic tests currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for pertussis infection have low sensitivity. Regardless of test results, physicians should treat clinically suspected pertussis with antimicrobials and report cases to their state health department. A 14-day erythromycin regimen has been the treatment of choice; however, shorter-course macrolide antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin, clarithromycin) may be as effective with fewer adverse effects and better adherence to therapy. The recently recommended tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine for adolescents and adults may decrease the incidence of pertussis in infants — the group at the greatest risk of pertussis complications.

### Pertussis: modern approaches to an ancient adversary [^11425fTj]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite widespread vaccination, the United States has seen a stark increase in pertussis cases over the past year. Disease profiles vary across age groups, with infants at the greatest risk. The development of next generation pertussis vaccines will involve updated antigenic content, novel adjuvants, and live-attenuated constructs, potentially leveraging controlled human infection models of pertussis.

### Whooping cough in 2014 and beyond: an update and review [^112tJfz6]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Pertussis, or whooping cough, has had a dramatic resurgence in the past several years and is the most common vaccine-preventable disease in the world. The year 2012 marked the most cases in the United States in > 50 years. Large outbreaks have occurred in multiple states, and infant deaths have drawn the attention of not only health-care providers but also the media. Although the disease is theoretically preventable by vaccination, it remains a challenge to control. New vaccination strategies have been implemented across different age groups and populations of patients, but vaccine coverage remains dismally low. Acellular vaccines, although safe, do not afford the same long-lasting immunity as the previously used whole-cell vaccine. Ultimately, improvements in the development of vaccines and in vaccination coverage will be essential to decrease the burden of pertussis on society. This article provides a review of pertussis infection and discusses advances related to the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of infection, as well as continued areas of uncertainty.

### Efficacy and safety of clarithromycin versus erythromycin for the treatment of pertussis: a prospective, randomized, single blind trial [^111ujx2Q]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Pertussis is still a prevalent public health problem, and antibiotic therapy may decrease disease severity and limit communicability. Erythromycin is the recommended antibiotic for treatment and prophylaxis of pertussis; however, side effects of erythromycin limit its usefulness in some patients. Clarithromycin, a newer macrolide, has good in vitro activity against Bordetella pertussis and a better side effect profile.

Goals Of The Study

To compare the microbiologic and clinical efficacy and the clinical safety of a 7-day course of clarithromycin vs. a 14-day course of erythromycin in children with pertussis.

Design

Prospective, randomized, single blind (investigator), parallel group trial.

Methods

Children from 1 month to 16 years of age presenting with a clinically defined pertussis syndrome were eligible for the study. After obtaining informed written consent, we randomized patients to receive either clarithromycin (7.5 mg/kg/dose twice a day for 7 days) or erythromycin (13.3 mg/kg/dose three times a day for 14 days). Nasopharyngeal cultures for B. pertussis were performed at enrollment and after end of treatment. Clinical assessments were performed at enrollment, at end of treatment and at a 1-month follow-up visit. Adverse event data were collected throughout the study.

Results

The clarithromycin (n = 76) and erythromycin (n = 77) groups were well-matched for age and previous pertussis immunization. Microbiologic eradication and clinical cure rates were 100% (31 of 31) for clarithromycin and 96% (22 of 23) for erythromycin. The clarithromycin group had significantly fewer adverse events [45% (34 of 76) for clarithromycin vs. 62% (48 of 77) for erythromycin; P = 0.035], and compliance with the medication regimen was significantly higher in these patients.

Conclusions

A 7-day regimen of clarithromycin and a 14-day course of erythromycin were equally effective for treatment of pertussis. Clarithromycin was better tolerated than conventional erythromycin therapy.

### Pertussis: review of epidemiology, diagnosis, management and prevention [^111neyS8]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Bordetella pertussis — the cause of pertussis or whooping cough — is an exclusively human pathogen. Disease elimination by vaccination should, therefore, be possible, but has proved elusive. Many industrialised countries with long established immunisation programs are currently seeing a resurgence of pertussis, despite universal vaccination with high uptake, with the highest burden in the least immunised age groups (infants under 6 months of age and persons over 10 years old). However, low recognition and reporting and insensitive diagnostic tests mean that the true burden of pertussis is still underestimated. Recently, efforts to improve diagnostic yield include the expanded use of polymerase chain reaction and serological tests but both have significant limitations. The range of antibiotics available for treatment and prophylaxis has expanded to include the newer macrolides, azithromycin and clarithromycin, and a range of universal and targeted vaccination strategies have been implemented or proposed. This paper reviews the current epidemiology of pertussis in developed countries, including modes of clinical presentation, diagnosis, management and potential vaccination strategies.

### Children with pertussis inform the investigation of other pertussis cases among contacts [^116SNr2Q]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Health care professional should be in alert to identify new cases of pertussis. The early recognition of pertussis index cases by health care professionals, the treatment of the cases and prophylaxis of the contacts is fundamental to control an outbreak in the community.

### Clinical characteristics and prognosis of exchange transfusion in infants with severe pertussis [^11695iY7]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The mortality of severe pertussis is high and should not be ignored in clinical practice. ET is an effective treatment method to improve the prognosis of severe pertussis patients. The higher the peak of WBC, the more severe the pulmonary hypertension, and the more organs such as the brain, heart and kidneys are involved, the worse the prognosis. Early intervention with other treatments in addition to ET may be beneficial for improving the prognosis.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis: background [^1152zHys]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute bronchitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease. The evaluation of adults with an acute cough illness or a presumptive diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bronchitis should focus on ruling out serious illness, particularly pneumonia. In healthy, nonelderly adults, pneumonia is uncommon in the absence of vital sign abnormalities or asymmetrical lung sounds, and chest radiography is usually not indicated. In patients with cough lasting 3 weeks or longer, chest radiography may be warranted in the absence of other known causes. Routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis is not recommended, regardless of duration of cough. If pertussis infection is suspected (an unusual circumstance), a diagnostic test should be performed and antimicrobial therapy initiated. Patient satisfaction with care for acute bronchitis depends most on physician — patient communication rather than on antibiotic treatment.

### Antibiotics for whooping cough (pertussis) [^112sZv2S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Whooping cough is a highly contagious disease. Infants are at highest risk of severe disease and death. Erythromycin for 14 days is currently recommended for treatment and contact prophylaxis, but is of uncertain benefit.

Objectives

To study the benefits and risks of antibiotic treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2007); MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2007); EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2007).

Selection Criteria

All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of antibiotics for treatment of, and contact prophylaxis against, whooping cough.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three to four review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial.

Main Results

Thirteen trials with 2197 participants met the inclusion criteria: 11 trials investigated treatment regimens; 2 investigated prophylaxis regimens. The quality of the trials was variable. Short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for three to five days, or clarithromycin or erythromycin for seven days) were as effective as long-term (erythromycin for 10 to 14 days) in eradicating Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) from the nasopharynx (relative risk (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.05), but had fewer side effects (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.83). Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for seven days was also effective. Nor were there differences in clinical outcomes or microbiological relapse between short and long-term antibiotics. Contact prophylaxis of contacts older than six months of age with antibiotics did not significantly improve clinical symptoms or the number of cases developing culture-positive B. pertussis.

Authors' Conclusions

Although antibiotics were effective in eliminating B. pertussis, they did not alter the subsequent clinical course of the illness. There is insufficient evidence to determine the benefit of prophylactic treatment of pertussis contacts.

### Antibiotics for whooping cough (pertussis) [^1145XPWw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Whooping cough is a highly contagious disease. Infants are the population at highest risk of severe disease and death. Erythromycin for 14 days is recommended for treatment and contact prophylaxis but this regime is considered inconvenient and prolonged. The value of contact prophylaxis is uncertain.

Objectives

To study the benefits and risks of antibiotic treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to February 2004); EMBASE (January 1974 to August 2003); conference abstracts and reference lists of articles were searched. Study investigators and pharmaceutical companies were approached for additional information (published or unpublished studies). There were no constraints based on language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of antibiotics for treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough were included in the systematic review.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least three reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial.

Main Results

Twelve trials with 1,720 participants met the inclusion criteria. Ten trials investigated treatment regimens and two investigated prophylaxis regimens. The quality of the trials was variable. Results showed that short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for three days, clarithromycin for seven days, or erythromycin estolate for seven days) were equally effective with long-term antibiotic treatment (erythromycin estolate or erythromycin for 14 days) in the microbiological eradication of Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) from the nasopharynx. The relative risk (RR) was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.05). Side effects were fewer with short-term treatment (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.83). There were no differences in clinical improvement or microbiological relapse between short and long-term treatment regimens. Contact prophylaxis (of contacts older than six months of age) with antibiotics did not significantly improve clinical symptoms or the number of cases that developed culture positive B. pertussis.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics are effective in eliminating B. pertussis from patients with the disease, rendering them non-infectious, but do not alter the subsequent clinical course of the illness. Effective regimens include: three days of azithromycin, seven days of clarithromycin, seven or 14 days of erythromycin estolate, and 14 days of erythromycin ethylsuccinate. Considering microbiological clearance and side effects, three days of azithromycin or seven days of clarithromycin are the best regimens. Seven days of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole also appeared to be effective for the eradication of B. pertussis from the nasopharynx and may serve as an alternative antibiotic treatment for patients who cannot tolerate a macrolide. There is insufficient evidence to determine the benefit of prophylactic treatment of pertussis contacts.

### MASP1 modulation as a novel therapeutic target in severe pediatric pertussis: insights from a multi-omics approach [^112k5MF8]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

While this study has made significant discoveries, there are limitations that need to be addressed in future research. First, the relatively small sample size in this study warrants further validation of the research findings in a larger population. Second, although both in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that inhibiting MASP1 can help alleviate pertussis symptoms, more clinical trials are needed to confirm the applicability of these results to humans. Furthermore, as this study primarily focused on children with severe pertussis, excluding other age groups or patients with milder symptoms may limit the generalizability of the results. Finally, while this study has uncovered the critical role of MASP1 in pertussis, further research is required to delve into its specific molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways.

Future research should aim to expand the sample size, encompassing pertussis patients of different age groups and varying severity of the disease, to validate the universality and efficacy of targeting MASP1 as a treatment approach. Moreover, advancing clinical trials to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of treatment strategies based on MASP1 inhibition in clinical practice is essential. Additionally, in-depth exploration of the specific molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways of MASP1 in the pathogenesis of pertussis can lead to the discovery of more potential therapeutic targets, refining existing treatment approaches. By integrating multi-omics data and advanced machine learning algorithms, similar methods can be applied in screening key genes in other infectious diseases, promoting the development of personalized precision medicine. Ultimately, the outcomes of this study hold promise for improving the treatment outcomes of pertussis, reducing its public health burden, and providing new scientific evidence and clinical guidance.

### Pertussis: an old disease that is still with us [^113wjLtw]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Our knowledge of pathogenesis, clinical presentation and prevention of pertussis has improved substantially over recent years. We now better understand the function of long-known virulence factors for Bordetella pertussis, and genome sequencing has identified a multitude of new proteins; their functions are yet to be elucidated. Furthermore, improved diagnostic tools have revealed the broad spectrum of disease, and new insights into the host's immune response have been gained. Finally, the development, evaluation, licensing and implementation of several new acellular pertussis vaccines with high acceptance have changed the epidemiology of pertussis in many countries (i.e. a shift towards an increasing burden of disease in adolescent persons and adults). These developments are likely to have great impact on the daily practice not only of paediatricians, but also of general practitioners, internists, gynaecologists and many other specialists in adolescent and adult medicine. The present review provides an update on recent progress.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis: background [^113ptkgp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute bronchitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease.1. The evaluation of adults with an acute cough illness or a presumptive diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bronchitis should focus on ruling out serious illness, particularly pneumonia. In healthy, nonelderly adults, pneumonia is uncommon in the absence of vital sign abnormalities or asymmetrical lung sounds, and chest radiography is usually not indicated. In patients with cough lasting 3 weeks or longer, chest radiography may be warranted in the absence of other known causes.2. Routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis is not recommended, regardless of duration of cough. If pertussis infection is suspected (an unusual circumstance), a diagnostic test should be performed and antimicrobial therapy initiated.3. Patient satisfaction with care for acute bronchitis depends most on physician-patient communication rather than on antibiotic treatment.

Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a vaccine-preventable respiratory disease with rising incidence due to declining vaccination rates and waning immunity. The most severe disease course is seen in unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated infants less than 2 months of age, accounting for the largest burden of hospitalization and death, but adolescents and adults play an important role in pertussis transmission and outbreaks. Prompt recognition and diagnosis remain critical for hospitalists in the management of pertussis disease and prevention.

### Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor agonism reduces Bordetella pertussis-mediated lung pathology [^115vAq25]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Recent pertussis resurgence represents a major public health concern. Currently, there are no effective treatments for critical pertussis in infants. Recent data have demonstrated the potential of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) agonism in the treatment of infectious diseases. We used the murine Bordetella pertussis model to test the hypothesis that treatment with S1PR agonist AAL-R reduces pulmonary inflammation during infection. AAL-R treatment resulted in reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and attenuated lung pathology in infected mice. These results demonstrate a role for sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling in B. pertussis-mediated pathology and highlight the possibility of host-targeted therapy for pertussis.

### The incidence, duration, risk factors, and age-based variation of missed opportunities to diagnose pertussis: a population-based cohort study [^114wgCRr]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Pertussis is a respiratory infection caused by the fastidious, gram-negative coccobacillus Bordetella pertussis. Pertussis is associated with a long-lasting cough. It is spread person to person primarily through respiratory droplets and is extremely contagious among susceptible individuals. – Historically, pertussis was a common childhood illness. Until the 1940s, ∼250,000 cases were reported annually, with a mortality rate approaching 10%. After the introduction of the whole-cell pertussis vaccine, the incidence of pertussis declined, reaching a nadir in the United States in 1976. However, due to concerns about reactions associated with whole-cell vaccine, – an acellular vaccine was introduced in the 1990s, but this vaccine was less effective. Coinciding with the introduction of a less-effective vaccine, the number of pertussis cases reported in the United States has increased. – Other reasons for the increase in cases include lower vaccination rates and the emergence of strains not included in the vaccine.

Because pertussis is extremely contagious, it is critical to diagnose cases early to prevent further transmission. Delays in diagnosing pertussis have been associated with outbreaks, especially in healthcare settings. – Early identification is important for 3 reasons. First, if patients can be identified early enough, treatment may ameliorate symptoms. Second, treatment within the first 3 weeks can prevent the spread of pertussis. Finally, earlier identification of cases (ie, without delay) can help identify individuals who have been exposed to pertussis to facilitate chemoprophylaxis. Unfortunately, efforts involving chemoprophylaxis and treatment are limited because substantial transmission has usually occurred prior to diagnosis. Adults and adolescents may be difficult to diagnose, especially if they were vaccinated as children because they may experience milder symptoms. Although delays in diagnosing pertussis, in the context of outbreaks, are commonly reported, the incidence, duration, and risk factors for delays remain unknown. In this study, we used a population-based approach to estimate the incidence and duration of diagnostic delays associated with pertussis and to describe potential risk factors associated with patients experiencing a diagnostic delay.

### The incidence, duration, risk factors, and age-based variation of missed opportunities to diagnose pertussis: a population-based cohort study [^113YUd2o]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our results demonstrate that patients with pertussis often experience diagnostic delays. For example, 18% of pertussis patients had a delay of at least 20 days, and the average delay was 12 days. These delays have important implications for patient health because, if caught quickly, pertussis is treatable, and early treatment can also prevent transmission of the disease. On average, patients had almost 2 visits prior to diagnosis, and some had many more visits. At each of these visits, multiple healthcare professionals and other patients were potentially exposed to pertussis, and between these visits, many community and household exposures undoubtably occurred.

The frequency and duration of diagnostic delays varied across age groups. In general, the percentage of patients experiencing a delay tended to increase with age from 2–4 years up to adulthood (≥ 18 years). Both the number of missed opportunities per patient and the duration of delays increased monotonically from age < 2 years through adulthood. Thus, diagnostic delays for pertussis among adults appear to be both longer and more frequent compared to younger children. Pertussis has long been viewed as a childhood illness. Thus, it is not surprising that older individuals are more likely to experience a diagnostic delay. Although most hospitalizations and deaths occur among infants, – in the postvaccination era, cases commonly occur among adolescents and adults. Indeed, diagnosing pertussis in adults is more difficult because these cases may present with mild cough and other respiratory symptoms. This is further complicated because cough is a leading cause of outpatient visits. Up to 17% of adolescents and adults with a prolonged history of cough (eg, > 2 weeks) have pertussis. Thus, pertussis should be part of the differential diagnosis for patients with prolonged cough. While patients with symptoms longer than a few weeks may no longer benefit from treatment themselves, identification of these cases will help the public health response. Specifically, more timely diagnosis can facilitate contact tracing, help minimize contacts, and inform the administration of chemoprophylaxis among exposures.

Background and Epidemiology of Pertussis

Pertussis is an acute respiratory disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. Classic pertussis disease is characterized by three phases of illness: catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent. During the catarrhal phase, infected persons experience coryza (inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nasal cavities), mild occasional cough, and low-grade fever. The paroxysmal phase is characterized by spasmodic cough, posttussive vomiting, and inspiratory whoop. Symptoms slowly improve during the convalescent phase, which generally lasts 7–10 days, but can last for months. Factors that affect the clinical presentation of pertussis include age, the level of immunity, history of vaccination, and use of antimicrobials early during the course of the illness.

B. pertussis is transmitted primarily from person to person through aerosolized respiratory droplets generated by coughing or sneezing. Persons with pertussis are most infectious during the catarrhal and early paroxysmal phases of illness. Pertussis generally is treated with antibiotics, which are used to control the signs and symptoms and to prevent infected persons from spreading the infection to others. Recommended antibiotics for pertussis include azithromycin, clarithroymycin, erythromycin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Guidance for the treatment of pertussis has been published previously. Guidance on postexposure prophylaxis of pertussis is available at.

### Pertussis in young infants throughout the world [^1163nHTp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

TREATMENT OF PERTUSSIS IN YOUNG INFANTS

Our group in California (consisting of epidemiologists at the California Department of Public Health and pediatric infectious diseases specialists) has been carrying out studies on infant pertussis for > 6 years. We have described factors that are associated with pulmonary hypertension and death. These factors are as follows: high and rapidly rising WBC count with lymphocytosis, heart rate > 170 beats per minute, respiratory rate > 70 breaths per minute and onset of pneumonia within 5 days of disease onset, lower birth weight, premature birth, early age of onset of illness, decreased pulse oxygen saturation, seizures, encephalitis, receipt of steroids, receipt of nitric oxide, intubation, receipt of exchange transfusion, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy. Obviously, many of these factors relate to treatment. Sorting out which factors actually increase the risk of death is difficult. In one study, multivariate regression analysis of illness characteristics noted that low birth weight, very high WBC count, and pulmonary hypertension correlated with death. Similar analysis of treatment characteristics indicated that intubation and nitric oxide treatment correlated with death. In a classification tree analysis, a WBC count of ≥ 46 000 cells/µL and a birth weight of < 2821 g were indicators for death.

Our group's ongoing study findings (unpublished data) suggest to us that the usual treatments for nonpertussis pulmonary hypertension (nitric oxide, ECMO) and other ICU care (steroids) may be detrimental in the treatment of pertussis pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, it is my opinion that the mainstay of present ICU care should be intubation, assisted ventilation if necessary, and the administration of oxygen.

Our group would also recommend exchange blood transfusion for high and rapidly rising WBC count. This treatment has been useful in many individual cases. In addition to lowering the WBC count, it will decrease PT in the blood, which might lower the pulse and respiratory rates. Unfortunately, exchange transfusion needs to be carried out before cardiogenic shock or organ failure has occurred.

Of most importance in the treatment of pertussis is the administration of a macrolide antibiotic. This should be done immediately in presumptive cases without waiting for a confirmatory PCR result.

### Postinfectious cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114iQQJf]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who complain of a persistent cough lasting > 3 weeks after experiencing the acute symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection may have a postinfectious cough. Such patients are considered to have a subacute cough because the condition lasts for no > 8 weeks. The chest radiograph findings are normal, thus ruling out pneumonia, and the cough eventually resolves, usually on its own. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of postinfectious cough, including the most virulent form caused by Bordetella pertussis infection, and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice.

Methods

Recommendations for this section of the guideline were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms "cough", "postinfectious cough", "postviral cough", "Bordetella pertussis", "pertussis infection", and "whooping cough".

Results

The pathogenesis of the postinfectious cough is not known, but it is thought to be due to the extensive inflammation and disruption of upper and/or lower airway epithelial integrity. When postinfectious cough emanates from the lower airway, this is often associated with the accumulation of an excessive amount of mucus hypersecretion and/or transient airway and cough receptor hyperresponsiveness; all may contribute to the subacute cough. In these patients, the optimal treatment is not known. Except for bacterial sinusitis or early on in a B pertussis infection, therapy with antibiotics has no role, as the cause is not bacterial infection. The use of inhaled ipratropium may be helpful. Other causes of postinfectious cough are persistent inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses, which leads to an upper airway cough syndrome (previously referred to as postnasal drip syndrome), and gastroesophageal reflux disease, which may be a complication of the vigorous coughing. One type of postinfectious cough that is particularly virulent is that caused by B pertussis infection. When the cough is accompanied by paroxysms of coughing, posttussive vomiting, and/or an inspiratory whooping sound, the diagnosis of a B pertussis infection should be made unless another diagnosis is proven. This infection is highly contagious but responds to antibiotic coverage with an oral macrolide when administered early in the course of the disease. A safe and effective vaccine to prevent B pertussis is now available for adults as well as children. It is recommended according to CDC guidelines.

Conclusions

In patients who have a cough lasting from 3 to 8 weeks with normal chest radiograph findings, consider the diagnosis of postinfectious cough. In most patients, a specific etiologic agent will not be identified, and empiric therapy may be helpful. A high degree of suspicion for cough due to B pertussis infection will lead to earlier diagnosis, patient isolation, and antibiotic treatment.

### Possible options for new pertussis vaccines [^116Rhswu]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Increasing evidence that the currently available acellular pertussis vaccines are not providing optimal control of pertussis in the United States and many other countries has stimulated interest in improvements of the current vaccines and in the development of new vaccines. A better understanding of the limitations of the current vaccines and the basis for the pertussis resurgence is needed to design improved vaccines. This article outlines several alternate approaches and summarizes the challenges related to the development of new or modified vaccines.

### The incidence, duration, risk factors, and age-based variation of missed opportunities to diagnose pertussis: a population-based cohort study [^113tAEoT]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective:

To estimate the incidence, duration and risk factors for diagnostic delays associated with pertussis.

Design:

We used longitudinal retrospective insurance claims from the Marketscan Commercial Claims and Encounters, Medicare Supplemental (2001–2020), and Multi-State Medicaid (2014–2018) databases.

Setting:

Inpatient, emergency department, and outpatient visits.

Patients:

The study included patients diagnosed with pertussis (International Classification of Diseases [ICD] codes) and receipt of macrolide antibiotic treatment.

Methods:

We estimated the number of visits with pertussis-related symptoms before diagnosis beyond that expected in the absence of diagnostic delays. Using a bootstrapping approach, we estimated the number of visits representing a delay, the number of missed diagnostic opportunities per patient, and the duration of delays. Results were stratified by age groups. We also used a logistic regression model to evaluate potential factors associated with delay.

Results:

We identified 20,828 patients meeting inclusion criteria. On average, patients had almost 2 missed opportunities prior to diagnosis, and delay duration was 12 days. Across age groups, the percentage of patients experiencing a delay ranged from 29.7% to 37.6%. The duration of delays increased considerably with age from an average of 5.6 days for patients aged < 2 years to 13.8 days for patients aged ≥ 18 years. Factors associated with increased risk of delays included emergency department visits, telehealth visits, and recent prescriptions for antibiotics not effective against pertussis.

Conclusions:

Diagnostic delays for pertussis are frequent. More work is needed to decrease diagnostic delays, especially among adults. Earlier case identification may play an important role in the response to outbreaks by facilitating treatment, isolation, and improved contact tracing.

### The prevalence and clinical characteristics of pertussis-associated pneumonia among infants in Botswana [^111XBB1M]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic treatment is indicated for all cases of pertussis, regardless of the clinical presentation or the severity of the illness. While treatment of pertussis early in the course of the disease is more likely to ameliorate symptoms than treatment later in the disease course, an additional benefit of treatment of pertussis disease is the reduction of person-to-person transmission. Interrupting transmission is an important public health benefit because there is high prevalence of subclinical or mild infections among household contacts of pertussis cases, which may play a critical role in the maintenance of ongoing transmission of pertussis.

Immunization against pertussis in pregnancy has been shown to decrease the risk of pertussis infection and the severity of pertussis disease among young infants. An additional benefit to pertussis immunization in pregnancy may be the prevention of illnesses that are not classically associated with pertussis. Given that pertussis vaccination in pregnancy is highly effective (~ 85% efficacy) in preventing pertussis disease among young infants, it is also reasonable to anticipate that the majority of pertussis-associated pneumonia cases in this study could have been prevented by pertussis immunization in pregnancy.

This study has a number of strengths. B. pertussis was tested for in a large number of infants with pneumonia in an African country with long-standing high uptake of the wP vaccine. The study was prospective and conducted over 5 years, thus minimizing the possibility that seasonal variation and the cyclical pattern of pertussis might influence the results. This study also has several important limitations. It was conducted at a single referral center and the results may not be generalizable to non-tertiary care centers. Furthermore, patients with more severe pneumonia may have died before admission to hospital, and consequently some cases of pertussis may have been missed. The small sample size of HIV-infected infants limits our ability to draw definitive conclusions about the prevalence of B. pertussis among infants with pneumonia in this population. Finally, the study did not include infants < 1 month of age, an age group that is highly susceptible to severe pertussis infection.

### Pertussis detection in children with cough of any duration [^113Q31bD]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Several findings of the current study were important for clinical practice: (a) laboratory confirmed pertussis can be present in children irrespective of cough duration; (b) children with pertussis with different cough durations have clinical features that are influenced by the child's age and immunization state; and(c) those with chronic cough have nonspecific cough, lacking characteristic symptoms. This may suggest that in the context of the likely underestimation of the burden of pertussis, the "one-size-fits-all" clinical pertussis case definition is no longer optimal to recognize this disease in a population and large comprehensive studies of children with all types of cough is required to confirm or refute our findings. This may make substantial inroads into increasing both the sensitivity and specificity in pertussis diagnosis, will impact public health.

This study also suggests that amoxicillin maybe an alternative for children with marolide-resistant B.pertussis infection. But these analysis were only based on the in vitro test, as the dose and course of treatment were not clear. Clinical studies should be designed and performed to confirm that this alternative drug could eliminate the bacteria in vivo effectively.

### Pertussis detection in children with cough of any duration [^113SvYSi]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of pertussis, or whooping cough, in clinical practice continues to be a challenge worldwide as the symptoms are variable. Pragmatically, it is an overlooked cause of cough in children after several decades of universal immunization. The symptoms and its subsequent clinical diagnosis are influenced by age and presence of underlying co-morbidities such as rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, etc. In addition, immunization status or history of natural infection, presence of passively acquired antibody, and antibiotic treatment may also have a role.

Pertussis is caused by the fastidious Gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis. It is estimated that there are 30 to 50 million cases of pertussis worldwide every year, leading to more than 300,000 deaths. Pertussis is a class B reportable infectious disease in China (according to the epidemiological characteristics and damage degree, the law of the People's Republic of China on the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases divides infectious diseases into three categories: A, B and C). According to data from the Chinese infectious disease reporting system, the incidence of pertussis has been less than 1 per 100 000 since the 1990s with only 2183 and 2517 pertussis cases being reported in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In China, pertussis is mainly diagnosed by the physicians based on the typical clinical symptoms, as most of the Chinese hospitals do not have dedicated specific tests for pertussis(e.g. bacterial culture, serology test and molecular methods). Thus the reported low incidence may be related to the clinical and laboratory methods used for diagnosis, suggesting an underestimation of the disease prevalence.

### Clinical definitions of pertussis: summary of a global pertussis initiative roundtable meeting, February 2011 [^1178hZWE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

HOW DO ADVANCES IN DIAGNOSTICS IMPACT CLINICAL PRACTICE?

In persons with pertussis, the median time from cough onset to seeking medical care differs by age group. For example, in 1 study setting, children aged 7–12 years were seen after 7.8 days of coughing, whereas adolescents aged 13–18 years were seen after 12.5 days and adults 17.3 days after symptoms began [and Riffelmann M, et al. unpublished data]. The interval from the onset of cough to when the patient seeks medical care has a major effect on the laboratory diagnosis of B. pertussis infection. Culture obtained during the first 3 weeks of cough has 100% specificity, but low sensitivity, ranging from 20% to 80%, when compared with PCR and/or serology. In general, culture and PCR sensitivity is inversely related to age. Other factors that may influence the sensitivity of culture are the type and quality of specimen, the type of transport media, and the duration of transport (optimally within 48 hours).

### Clinical definitions of pertussis: summary of a global pertussis initiative roundtable meeting, February 2011 [^112enVt3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Existing clinical case definitions of pertussis are decades old and based largely on clinical presentation in infants and children, yet an increasing burden is borne by adolescents and adults who may manifest distinct signs/symptoms. Therefore, a "one-size-fits-all" clinical case definition is no longer appropriate. Seeking to improve pertussis diagnosis, the Global Pertussis Initiative (GPI) developed an algorithm that delineates the signs/symptoms of pertussis most common to 3 age groups: 0–3 months, 4 months to 9 years, and ≥ 10 years. These case definitions are based on clinical presentation alone, but do include recommendations on laboratory diagnostics. Until pertussis can be accurately diagnosed, its burden will remain underestimated, making the introduction of epidemiologically appropriate preventive strategies difficult. The proposed definitions are intended to be widely applicable and to encourage the expanded use of laboratory diagnostics. Determination of their utility and their sensitivity and/or specificity versus existing case definitions is required.

### Analysis of clinical characteristics of severe pertussis in infants and children: a retrospective study [^1139LzCK]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

With the development of modern medicine, the incidence of many infectious diseases has significantly decreased, along with their threat to human health. However, the incidence of pertussis (whooping cough) shows an increasing trend. This phenomenon is known as "pertussis resurgence". Severe pertussis can cause sudden infant death, which is not completely avoidable. Currently, the reported mortality rate of pertussis is 1.2–3.0%. There are two circumstances contributing to this. First, this mortality occurs in part because the pathogenesis and lethality mechanisms of pertussis are not completely clear. Second, some clinicians often lack sufficient understanding of the clinical characteristics and risk factors for severe pertussis and thus do not focus their attention on these factors.

In the last few years, the number of pediatric patients with pertussis treated by our hospital has increased. This has included many severe cases and deaths. In this study, we employed a retrospective study design to analyze the clinical data of pediatric patients with pertussis treated by the department of pediatrics at Ditan Hospital in the 2 years of 2016 and 2017 in order to examine the clinical characteristics of pertussis and provide a clinical basis for the prevention and treatment of severe pertussis.

### Pertussis toxin promotes pulmonary hypertension in an infant mouse model of Bordetella pertussis infection [^113QFE4o]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Pertussis, caused by Bordetella pertussis, is a reemerging disease that can produce severe disease manifestations in infants, including pulmonary hypertension (PH). B. pertussis-induced PH is a major risk factor for infection-induced death, but the molecular mechanisms promoting PH are unknown and there is no effective treatment. We examined B. pertussis-induced PH in infant and adult mouse models of pertussis by Fulton index, right heart catheterization, or Doppler echocardiogram. Our results demonstrate that B. pertussis-induced PH is age related and dependent on the expression of pertussis toxin by the bacterium. Hence, pertussis toxin-targeting treatments may ameliorate PH and fatal infant infection.

### Pertussis in young infants throughout the world [^112k5aEC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

In typical pertussis in young infants, the child will appear deceptively well; he or she will have coryza, sneezing, and a mild cough. There is no fever. This progresses to gagging, gasping, eye bulging, bradycardia, cyanosis, and vomiting. There is leukocytosis with lymphocytosis and apneic episodes. Deaths relate to leukocytosis, pulmonary hypertension, and pneumonia. The source of pertussis in young infants is most often a family member with cough illness that is not recognized as pertussis. Diagnosis is based on culture/polymerase chain reaction and leukocytosis with lymphocytosis. Treatment depends on macrolide antibiotic therapy and intubation, with assisted ventilation and oxygen. Prevention is based on prophylactic macrolide treatment, immunization starting at 6 weeks of age, and immunization of all pregnant women in the second or third trimester.

Identifying the determinants of the clinical presentation of pertussis is important for the purposes of diagnosis, therapy, and control and for predicting the disease's clinical course and choosing an appropriate case definition for surveillance. Potential determinants include vaccination status, antibiotic treatment, age at diagnosis, and sex, although the available data are inconsistent. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical course of pertussis in unvaccinated and vaccinated children in a well-defined and strictly studied population and to identify determinants of the disease's clinical presentation.

Methods

The clinical presentation of pertussis was studied in children who participated in a randomized, controlled clinical trial of efficacy of acellular pertussis vaccine. The children belonged to the same birth cohort and were followed from infancy to 6 years of age in 3 distinct periods (stages 1, 2, and 3). Children had received 1 of 2 three-component acellular pertussis vaccines produced by 2 manufacturers (diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis from, Chiron Biocine [DTaP CB]; DTaP from SmithKline Beecham [DTaP SB]) or a diphtheria-tetanus vaccine only (DT; Chiron Biocine). Pertussis was confirmed through culture or serology. For each pertussis episode, information was collected on age at onset, sex, type of vaccine received, antibiotic treatment, culture results, duration of cough, spasmodic cough, and other symptoms. The simultaneous effect of potential determinants of clinical presentation of pertussis on the duration of cough and spasmodic cough was studied through analysis of variance models.

Results

The analysis was conducted on 788 laboratory-confirmed cases of pertussis. The median duration of cough in DT recipients varied from 52 to 61 days across the 3 stages, whereas the median duration of cough in DTaP recipients varied from 29 to 39 days. The median duration of spasmodic cough varied from 20 to 45 days in DT recipients and from 14 to 29 days in DTaP recipients. The results of the analysis of variance models showed that vaccination against pertussis reduced the length of cough from 3 to 10 days and the length of spasmodic cough from 4 to 8 days. Culture-positive patients had a cough 11 to 22 days longer and a spasmodic cough 12 to 22 days longer than culture-negative patients. Children who received an antibiotic had a duration of cough 6 to 11 days longer and spasmodic cough 4 to 13 days longer than untreated patients. Girls had a duration of spasmodic cough 7 days longer than boys only after 3 years of age. Age was directly related to duration of cough, whereas it was inversely related to duration of spasmodic cough after 3 years of age.

Conclusions

Duration of cough can be greatly influenced by vaccination status. A positive culture for Bordetella pertussis is more frequently found in patients with long duration of cough, and antibiotic therapy may be a marker of severe disease. Gender may affect the clinical presentation of pertussis only after infancy. Pertussis in older children may be characterized by short duration of spasmodic cough. These results should be taken into account in the clinical evaluation of patients with suspected pertussis. Clinical case definitions for the purpose of surveillance based on the presence of 2 weeks of spasmodic cough may not be appropriate where pertussis vaccination uptake is high.

### Leukopheresis therapy for severe infantile pertussis with myocardial and pulmonary failure [^114UimVh]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe an infant with severe pertussis successfully treated with leukopheresis.

Design

Case report.

Setting

Pediatric intensive care unit of a children's hospital.

Patient

Five-wk-old female with pertussis complicated by cardiorespiratory failure.

Interventions

Single leukopheresis treatment.

Measurements and Main Results

Normalization of the white blood cell count and marked cardiorespiratory improvement after treatment; patient survived.

Conclusion

Given the temporal association between treatment and improvement, we hypothesize that the markedly elevated white blood cell count has a major role in the cardiopulmonary compromise.

### Pertussis in the newborn: certainties and uncertainties in 2014 [^117WQXNw]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Bordetella pertussis infection remains a serious potential health risk to infants, specially in those too young to be vaccinated. Over the recent years, numerous sources highlighted a widespread resurgence, making it, again, a challenging disease. Globally, pertussis is ranked among the 10 leading causes of childhood mortality. This review summarizes the most recent literature and will address the most important aspects that pediatricians and neonatologists must be familiar with, when treating a newborńs pertussis infection.

Data extraction and risk of bias assessment

Using data extraction forms designed specifically for this review, MF extracted information on study design, participants, interventions or exposures, and outcomes measured. JS double-checked the accuracy of data extraction. Two authors (MF, JS) independently assessed the risk of bias in the included studies, using the Cochrane collaboration risk of bias tool for RCTs, cohort studies and case-control studies as appropriate. We assessed each domain of bias (e.g. sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome, selective reporting for RCTs) and assigned it one of the following three judgments: low risk of bias (plausible bias that was unlikely to seriously alter the results), high risk of bias (plausible bias that seriously weakened confidence in the results), or unclear risk of bias (plausible bias that could have raised some doubt about the results) when there was insufficient information to make a judgment. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assign the overall quality of evidence for each outcome to one of four levels – high, moderate, low, or very low – according to factors including within-study risk of bias (methodological quality), directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effect estimates and risk of publication bias.

### MASP1 modulation as a novel therapeutic target in severe pediatric pertussis: insights from a multi-omics approach [^116FUAbQ]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

This study investigated the role of MASP1 in pertussis infection using the human bronchial epithelial cell line HBE135-E6E7 in vitro. By manipulating MASP1 expression levels through overexpression and knockdown, the study confirmed MASP1's function in pertussis infection. The results demonstrated that MASP1 overexpression exacerbated pertussis-induced cell damage, adding to the understanding of MASP1's involvement in cellular inflammatory responses from previous studies. While MASP1 has traditionally been recognized as an immune response regulator, this research further established its direct role in airway epithelial cell injury. This deepened insight into MASP1's cellular actions not only paves the way for potential cell protection strategies but also sheds light on our comprehension of its function at the cellular level.

Using a mouse model of pertussis infection, this study evaluated the impact of inhibiting MASP1 expression on infection symptoms. The findings revealed that MASP1 inhibition significantly alleviated symptoms caused by pertussis bacteria, reducing bacterial burden and tissue damage in the lungs and airways. This aligns with prior research on MASP1's role in inflammatory responses and, for the first time in an animal model, validates the potential of MASP1 as a therapeutic target. These discoveries suggest that through targeted MASP1 regulation, the severity of pertussis infection can be effectively controlled, offering new avenues for future clinical treatments.

This study reveals that children with pertussis exhibit significantly decreased nasal and pharyngeal microbial diversity compared with healthy children, with an increase in the abundance of specific pathogenic bacterial groups. This finding aligns with previous research on the impact of infectious diseases on microbial diversity. However, utilizing more refined metagenomic data, this study further elucidates specific changes in bacterial communities and their association with disease severity. For instance, an increase in the abundance of specific bacterial groups, such as B. pertussis, correlates positively with disease severity. Clinical treatment guidelines indicate that macrolide antibiotics (such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin) have consistently been effective and are among the primary treatment options for pertussis patients. Short-term antibiotic treatments (azithromycin for 3 to 5 days or clarithromycin or erythromycin for 7 days) are as effective as long-term erythromycin treatment (10 to 14 days) in eradicating B. pertussis from the nasopharynx. Therefore, routine antibiotic treatment may be one of the key factors contributing to the greater diversity of nasopharyngeal microbiota in children with pertussis. Consequently, the aforementioned bioinformatic investigation offers new insights for future microbiota-targeted intervention strategies, suggesting that modulating microbiota composition could provide an avenue for early-stage intervention in the progression of pertussis.

### Pertussis (whooping cough) [^117R1TCx]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In the absence of systematic vaccination with pertussis vaccine, essentially every person will suffer whooping cough during infancy or childhood; many will suffer serious sequelae or die. No medical intervention is risk-free, but modern pertussis vaccines are both effective and safe — indeed, vastly safer than avoiding vaccination. Pertussis is an endemic and highly contagious disease; outbreaks will continue to occur. In an outbreak, vaccinated children are less likely to be infected; if infected, illness will be less severe [51–53, 332]. Unvaccinated children are at much higher risk of infection and, if infected, at much higher risk of adverse outcome. A number of approaches to new vaccines with more durable protection are under investigation.

### Azithromycin is as effective as and better tolerated than erythromycin estolate for the treatment of pertussis [^114mgK2x]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Although universal immunization against Bordetella pertussis (whooping cough) infection has resulted in dramatic reductions in the incidence of pertussis, outbreaks continue to occur in countries with excellent vaccine coverage. Treatment of infection may ameliorate symptom severity during the catarrhal phase of pertussis but has no effect on established paroxysms, emesis, or apnea if given during the paroxysmal or convalescent phases. Erythromycin, recommended for treatment of pertussis to prevent transmission of infection, is poorly tolerated because of gastrointestinal side effects. We compared the safety and efficacy of erythromycin with azithromycin for treatment of pertussis in a large, randomized, controlled trial that enrolled children from primary care practices in 1 American and 11 Canadian urban centers.

Methods

Children who were 6 months to 16 years of age and had cough illness that was suspected to be or was culture confirmed as pertussis were randomized to azithromycin (10 mg/kg on day 1 and 5 mg/kg on days 2–5 as a single dose) or erythromycin estolate (40 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses for 10 days) with stratification by center. The primary outcome measure was bacteriologic cure of infection as determined by cultures of nasopharyngeal aspirates. Culture-positive participants had a second aspirate collected at the end of therapy (days 5–7 for azithromycin, days 10–12 for erythromycin) and 1 week after therapy. Bacteriologic cure was defined as negative cultures at the end of therapy. Bacteriologic relapse was defined as a positive culture 1 week after completion of therapy and after a negative end-of-therapy culture. Secondary outcomes were pertussis diagnosed by serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), treatment-associated adverse events, compliance, and presence of clinical symptoms at the end of the treatment course. Serology was performed using standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. A participant was considered to have pertussis when the PCR was positive or a 4-fold increase in pertussis toxin antibody between baseline and follow-up visits was observed. PCR was performed using a 1046-bp ClaI DNA fragment from B pertussis. Adverse events (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, any gastrointestinal complaint, or other) were determined by a parent-completed diary that was reviewed with study personnel during study visits. Compliance was measured by review of the parent medication diary during study visits and observation of medication containers by the pharmacist at study completion. Symptoms were determined by history collected by study personnel at enrollment and subsequently from the diary. The design of the study was an equivalence trial, aimed at demonstrating that the bacteriologic failure rates with the 2 therapies did not differ by > 8%. For the safety analysis, all participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug were included. In the per-protocol efficacy analysis, all culture-positive participants with end-of-treatment cultures were considered.

Results

A total of 477 children were enrolled and randomly assigned to either azithromycin (n = 239) or erythromycin (n = 238). Of these children, 114 (24%) grew B pertussis from nasopharyngeal specimens (azithromycin group: 58 of 239 [24%]; erythromycin group: 56 of 238 [23%]); these children composed the efficacy cohort for the per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses. Serology and PCR added 52 children to the number considered to have pertussis for a total of 35% (166 of 477) of all children who presented with cough illness. In the safety analysis (antibiotic side effects, compliance) and comparison of cough symptoms after treatment, all randomized children are reported in their assigned treatment group. At end of therapy, bacterial eradication was demonstrated in all 53 patients in the azithromycin group and all 53 patients in the erythromycin group with follow-up cultures available (eradication 100%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 93.3–100). No bacterial recurrence was demonstrated in children with 1 week posttreatment nasopharyngeal cultures available (51 and 53 participants in the azithromycin and erythromycin arms, respectively [0%, 95% CI: 0–7.0; and 0%, 95% CI: 0–6.7]). No serious adverse events attributable to study drug were observed. Gastrointestinal adverse events were reported less frequently in azithromycin (18.8%; 45 of 239) than in erythromycin estolate (41.2%; 98 of 238) recipients (90% CI on difference: -29.0% to -15.7%) as a result of less nausea (2.9% vs 8.4%; 95% CI: -8.9% to -2.0%), less vomiting (5.0% vs 13.0%; 95% CI: -4.9% to -1.4%), and less diarrhea (7.1% vs 11.8%; 95% CI: -9.0% to -0.3%). Children who were randomized to azithromycin were much more likely to have complied with antimicrobial therapy over the treatment period. In the azithromycin group, 90% of children took 100% of prescribed doses, whereas only 55% of children in the erythromycin group took 100% of prescribed doses.

Conclusions

In this large, multicenter, randomized trial, we found that azithromycin is as effective as erythromycin estolate for the treatment of pertussis in children. Gastrointestinal adverse events were much more common with erythromycin treatment than azithromycin. Compliance with therapy was markedly better with azithromycin than with erythromycin in this study.

### Clinical progress note: pertussis [^116U6kAu]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

TREATMENT

Antibiotics, most specifically macrolides, have proven to be only helpful in improving symptoms if given before the onset of the paroxysmal cough (within the first 2 weeks of the illness) but are still recommended if diagnosed after this time period to eradicate bacteria from the nasopharynx to prevent spread of infection to others. Azithromycin is favored over erythromycin due to erythromycin's higher tendency to cause QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, as well as, its association with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in infants. Azithromycin still has some association with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in those less than 1 month of age, but is less likely to cause it when compared to erythromycin. Azithromycin also requires a shorter antibiotic duration of 5 days along with daily dosing, allowing for better adherence and less risk of drug‐to‐drug interactions. There have been reports of macrolide‐resistant strains in China, where trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole has now become the preferred drug of choice. However, trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole should not be used in those less than 2 months of age. Other supportive methods have been used during hospitalizations with nasogastric feeding tubes for nutrition, supplemental oxygen, and aid in clearing sputum from the respiratory tract. The routine use of bronchodilators, steroids, and antitussives are not recommended.

Those with more severe courses (respiratory distress, apnea, inability to feed) who are admitted to the hospital may require additional imaging, such as an X‐ray of the chest or echocardiogram, to evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary hypertension, respectively. Pulmonary vasodilators have proven useful in treating pulmonary hypertension. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has not improved overall survival rates, potentially because of its late initiation when organ damage has already occurred. Lastly, plasma exchange transfusions or leukapheresis have been studied as possible treatment options in patients with a rapidly rising lymphocyte count to reduce lymphocyte aggregation in the small pulmonary vessels.

Postexposure prophylaxis with azithromycin is recommended for close contacts, including household contacts and childcare providers, within 21 days of exposure, regardless of immunization status. Prophylaxis with azithromycin should also be offered to contacts beyond the household who are at high risk or will have contact with someone who is at high risk for pertussis‐associated morbidity (e.g. infants < 12 months, pregnant women). Immunization with a pertussis‐containing vaccine is also recommended in those unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated who are exposed.

### Treatment of hemolytic uremic syndrome related to Bordetella pertussis infection-is plasma exchange or eculizumab use necessary? [^113s6Rqn]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Was our case an aHUS triggered by pertussis infection or a secondary TMA due to pertussis infection? It is very difficult to make a decision; however, we consider that this patient is more likely to have had a secondary TMA rather than an aHUS based on the following reasons. First, the HUS of our patient showed spontaneous remission without PE/PI or ECZ treatment. Second, a specific genetic mutation related to complement regulation was not identified. Third, past reports do not describe recurrent HUS after the first episode and our patient did not experience HUS recurrence within 3 years after achieving remission (Table 1).

B. pertussis infection-associated HUS was first reported by Berner et al. who suspected a patient of having a CFH mutation; the patient had a fatal outcome. Therefore, treatment with PI/PE or ECZ has been performed for most reported cases with B. pertussis -related HUS (Table 1). Hence, we are unsure whether these reported patients survived due to treatment-related benefits or due to spontaneous recovery. To our knowledge, ours is the first reported case of suspected aHUS to show a spontaneous recovery, suggesting that HUS secondary to a pertussis infection is actually a secondary TMA. If all patients with potential aHUS receive PI/PE or ECZ treatment, they would probably recover. However, such treatment may be unnecessary for patients with a secondary TMA. Regardless, according to a recent report, immediate (within 24–48 h) administration of ECZ is recommended, especially for pediatric patients suspected of having aHUS. A definite understanding of the clinical presentation of HUS following a pertussis infection, and the judicious use of ECZ, is necessary to avoid unnecessary treatment.

### Severe pertussis infections in the United States, 2011–2015 [^115GCM43]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The incidence of pertussis in the United States has increased in recent years. While characteristics of severe pertussis infection have been described in infants, fewer data are available in older children and adults. In this analysis, we characterize pertussis infections in hospitalized patients of all ages.

Methods

Cases of pertussis with cough onset from 1 January 2011 through 31 December 2015 from 7 US Emerging Infections Program Network states were reviewed. Additional information on hospitalized patients was obtained through abstraction of the inpatient medical record. Descriptive and multivariable analyses were conducted to characterize severe pertussis infection and identify potential risk factors.

Results

Among 15942 cases of pertussis reported, 515 (3.2%) were hospitalized. Three hospitalized patients died. Infants aged < 2 months accounted for 1.6% of all pertussis cases but 29.3% of hospitalizations. Infants aged 2–11 months and adults aged ≥ 65 years also had high rates of hospitalization. Infants aged < 2 months whose mothers received acellular pertussis during the third trimester and children aged 2 months to 11 years who were up to date on pertussis-containing vaccines had a 43%-66% reduced risk of hospitalization. Among adolescents aged 12–20 years, 43.5% had a history of asthma, and among adults aged ≥ 65 years, 26.8% had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Conclusions

Individuals at the extreme ends of life may be the most vulnerable to severe pertussis infections, though hospitalization was reported across all age groups. Continued monitoring of severe pertussis infections will be important to help guide prevention, control, and treatment options.

### Clinical characteristics and prognosis of exchange transfusion in infants with severe pertussis [^117R5LUZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to ET, all severe pertussis patients received comprehensive treatment, such as antibiotic therapy, mechanical ventilation, treatment for pulmonary hypertension, ECMO, immunoglobulin and hormone therapy, etc. Severe pertussis often leads to severe pneumonia and respiratory failure, which requires mechanical ventilation intervention. Currently, there is no unified indication for mechanical ventilation. The treatment of pulmonary hypertension mainly uses inhaled NO, prostacyclin pathway agonists, etc. The overall survival rate of ECMO treatment is still low, and there is no consensus on the best time to start ECMO treatment for severe pertussis. Glucocorticoid can alleviate symptoms to a certain extent, but their survival benefits for severe pertussis are still controversial. A study by Hon et al. found that the proportion of hormone use in the mortality group was significantly higher than that in the surviving group. In this study, the use rate of glucocorticoid, treatment for pulmonary hypertension and vasoactive drugs in the mortality group was higher than that in the surviving group, while there was no difference in other treatments such as mechanical ventilation, immunoglobulin and ECMO. This suggested that when general treatment for severe pertussis is ineffective and glucocorticoid, pulmonary hypertension drugs and vasoactive drugs are needed, the prognosis of the child may be poor.

Our study has some limitations based on survey data. This study is a single-center, retrospective study with a relatively small number of cases in the mortality group, making it impossible to conduct a Logistic regression analysis of risk factors. In the future, we will strive to conduct multi-center, large-sample, prospective studies, which will have more clinical significance.

### A role for genomics-based studies of Bordetella pertussis adaptation [^114zueUf]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

However, as with most attempts to define drivers of pertussis disease patterns, multiple independent factors are at play. China has moved to the use of ACVs more recently than other countries. As noted above, the use of ACVs gives rise to dominance of ptxP3 strains and increased infection of noninfant age groups. Thus, the reported change in epidemiology in China might be expected regardless of whether MLVA 28 was circulating or not. The focus was the 2 years immediately postpandemic, and as discussed above, an immunity debt may allow any strain that enters this population to expand rapidly, rather than this being due to a seemingly hyper-infectious clone.

Also, the impact of macrolide resistance in B. pertussis on treatment and bacterial fitness is enigmatic as the exact role of macrolides in treating pertussis is unclear. Multiple studies report that it shortens duration of cough, but only if administered soon after cough onset, within 2 weeks at the latest, for example. Azithromycin treatment cleared B. pertussis from the nasopharynx of experimentally infected, but asymptomatic, participants in a human challenge model. Cumulatively, evidence is suggestive of macrolide treatment clearing B. pertussis from the nasopharynx and helping to shorten the period of symptoms. However, this would indicate B. pertussis is exposed to macrolides in vivo and thus is subjected to selective pressure by them; and yet macrolides have been administered to pertussis patients for decades in many countries, but resistance is almost entirely restricted to China where it has increased in incidence only recently. The absence of resistance elsewhere suggests treatment per se does not impose a strong selection for resistance, at least not prior to transmission. If resistance remains restricted to China, it suggests selection pressure is coming from other exposures to macrolides. An increase in resistance in other regions would be suggestive of the bacterium receiving selection pressure for resistance in those receiving treatment prior to transmission and indicate a change in B. pertussis infection dynamics. Thus, while widespread resistance in a region is a recent phenomenon and the longer term consequences of resistance on B. pertussis biology is unknown, surveillance of this issue is important while this uncertainty exists.

### First pertussis vaccine dose and prevention of infant mortality [^113vn38H]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

American infants are at highest risk of severe pertussis and death. We investigated the role of ≥ 1 pertussis vaccinations in preventing pertussis-related deaths and risk markers for death among infants aged < 42 days.

Methods

We analyzed characteristics of fatal and nonfatal infant pertussis cases reported nationally during 1991–2008. Infants were categorized into 2 age groups on the basis of eligibility to receive a first pertussis vaccine dose at age 6 weeks; dose 1 was considered valid if given ≥ 14 days before illness onset. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of ≥ 1 pertussis vaccine doses on outcome and risk markers.

Results

Pertussis-related deaths occurred among 258 of 45404 cases. Fatal and nonfatal cases were confirmed by culture (54% vs 49%) and polymerase chain reaction (31% vs 27%). All deaths occurred before age 34 weeks at illness onset; 64% occurred before age 6 weeks. Among infants aged ≥ 42 days, receiving ≥ 1 doses of vaccine protected against death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.11–0.74), hospitalization (aOR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.63–0.77), and pneumonia (aOR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.68–0.95). Risk was elevated for Hispanic ethnicity (aOR: 2.28; 95% CI: 1.36–3.83) and American Indian/Alaska Native race (aOR: 5.15; 95% CI: 2.37–11.2) and lower for recommended antibiotic treatment (aOR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.16–0.47). Among infants aged < 42 days, risk was elevated for Hispanic ethnicity and lower with recommended antibiotic use.

Conclusions

The first pertussis vaccine dose and antibiotic treatment protect against death, hospitalization, and pneumonia.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111oZbpS]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

CHEST guideline — adult clinical diagnosis of pertussis-associated cough: For adult patients complaining of acute cough (< 3 weeks in duration) or subacute cough (3–8 weeks), we suggest that clinicians should specifically assess for the 4 key characteristics of paroxysmal cough, posttussive vomiting, inspiratory whooping, and absence of fever in ruling in or out a clinical diagnosis of pertussis (Grade 2C). For adult patients complaining of acute or subacute cough, we suggest that clinicians consider that the cough is unlikely to be due to pertussis if the patient has a fever or the cough is not paroxysmal in nature (Grade 2C), and we suggest that clinicians consider that the cough is likely to be caused by pertussis if there is posttussive vomiting or is associated with an inspiratory whooping sound (Grade 2C). Fever is defined as any body temperature above the normal of 98.6°F (37°C).

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^11742qQo]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Restrict individuals with pertussis from the family-centered residential facility until they have completed treatment and obtained written medical clearance from a licensed clinician. A person who has pertussis is contagious until they have completed 5 days of appropriate antibiotic therapy. Facilities do not need to restrict individuals who have received effective treatment but are still coughing. Cough may persist for many weeks after the illness.
During the initial routine screening process upon facility entry, screen family members and other close contacts of children who have respiratory symptoms. Infants and young children commonly acquire pertussis from a family member who has not yet sought medical care for their illness.
Restrict individuals who have been exposed to pertussis from the facility, even if they do not have symptoms of illness, until active infection has been ruled out and preventative antibiotics have been started. Preventative antibiotics are indicated even if exposed people are up to date on immunization. Written medical clearance from a licensed clinician is required for a person who has been exposed to pertussis to be allowed to enter the facility.
Individuals exposed to pertussis who refuse or are unable to take their prescribed antibiotics should be restricted from the facility for 21 days after last pertussis exposure, even if they do not have symptoms of illness. Require written medical clearance from a licensed clinician before allowing entry.
If a guest is suspected to have pertussis, notify the program manager immediately and refer them to get a medical evaluation by their primary care physician or a licensed clinician. The program manager should notify the local health department to help identify and notify exposed guests.

### Treatment of hemolytic uremic syndrome related to Bordetella pertussis infection-is plasma exchange or eculizumab use necessary? [^113psdvq]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bordetella pertussis infection is a known trigger of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). For patients suspected of having atypical HUS, prompt plasma exchange/infusion (PE/PI) or eculizumab (ECZ) treatment is recommended.

Case presentation

We report a 1-month-old female infant who was admitted with a severe cough and a B. pertussis -positive sputum culture. She was born at 38 weeks gestation and did not have a family history of renal diseases. Hemophagocytic syndrome was suspected and she was transferred to our hospital 17 days after her initial admission. One day later, she developed acute kidney injury and was diagnosed with HUS triggered by B. pertussis infection. Her plasma complement levels were low and her kidney function continued to worsen over the next few days. However, prior to starting ECZ treatment, her kidney function improved spontaneously; she did not receive PE/PI or ECZ. She was discharged 46 days after her initial hospitalization, without complications. A genetic workup revealed no mutations in CFH, CFI, CFB, C3, MCP, THBD, or DGKE.

Conclusions

This case demonstrates that B. pertussis infection-related HUS may resolve spontaneously. The decision to treat during the acute phase is challenging because B. pertussis often affects infants suspected of having atypical HUS. However, ECZ may not be the first treatment option for patients with B. pertussis infection-related HUS unless they show an indicated genetic abnormality; if ECZ is used, early discontinuation should be considered.

### Clinical characteristics and prognosis of exchange transfusion in infants with severe pertussis [^115VEcHE]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pertussis is an acute and highly contagious respiratory disease caused by bordetella pertussis. Pertussis remains one of the leading causes of death from infectious diseases in infants, especially in infants who have not yet started vaccination. Previous clinical data reported that the incidence of pertussis admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) is approximately 2.1–18.6 per 100,000 infants, and the mortality of pertussis after ICU treatment is about 4.8%. According to our domestic hospital reports, there is no exact incidence of severe pertussis in China, but almost all cases are infants. The treatment of severe pertussis mainly involves supportive therapy, including mechanical ventilation (conventional or high-frequency), inhalation of nitric oxide (NO), exchange transfusion (ET), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Among them, ET has been reported as a method to reduce the white blood cell (WBC) load and improve the prognosis of infants. Recently, Wu et al. revealed ET could effectively reduce peripheral blood leukocytes in infant pertussis with extreme leukocytosis. Currently, there are relatively few reports on ET for severe pertussis both domestically and internationally. This study takes 45 infants diagnosed with severe pertussis and treated with ET in Hunan Children's Hospital from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2024 as the research subjects. Statistical methods such as chi-square test and t/U test were used to analyze their clinical characteristics and prognostic factors to provide a basis for the treatment of severe pertussis.

### The incidence, duration, risk factors, and age-based variation of missed opportunities to diagnose pertussis: a population-based cohort study [^113RVGrk]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

We identified 2 other potential risk factors for diagnostic delays associated with pertussis. First, prior receipt of an antibiotic commonly used to treat respiratory infections was associated with a diagnostic delay. We did not include macrolides because these drugs were used to identify pertussis cases. Assuming that these potential therapeutic interventions would be successful likely results in delayed diagnostic testing (eg, patients told to wait for these treatments to take effect). Second, diagnostic delays were also more common for patients who visited the ED, without an inpatient visit on the same day. Diagnostic errors may occur commonly in the ED setting, and revisits to an ED are often due to misdiagnosis. In the ED, physicians are often treating patients they are seeing for the first time, and they may be unaware of the patients' medical history. In addition, many patients have vague symptoms with a wide range of severity, and physicians in the ED are often interrupted. Finally, when diagnostic errors do occur, ED physicians may not be able to learn from missed opportunities to diagnose a disease because follow-up care occurs in other healthcare settings. Improving clinical suspicion for pertussis is clearly needed. Improving illness scripts among clinicians could improve diagnostic accuracy. Future work describing different clinical presentations in different clinical settings may also help strategies to decrease diagnostic delays.

Our study had several limitations. First, we relied on diagnostic codes from claims to identify pertussis cases and potential symptoms prior to diagnosis. However, we also used outpatient medications to validate our case definition, and we conducted sensitivity analyses using all visits. We only captured patients who were eventually diagnosed; thus, our findings may represent underestimates. Second, our data set was restricted to an insured population, with employer-sponsored health insurance or privately managed Medicaid coverage, and our findings may not be generalizable to uninsured populations. Third, vaccination may make it more difficult to diagnose people with pertussis, but we were not able to account for vaccination in our investigation. Finally, we grouped all adults together, but there may be specific risk factors for older adults, and these should be addressed in future work.

Despite an effective vaccine, pertussis has been reemerging both worldwide and in the United States. Given the limitations of vaccination strategies and approaches, the early identification of cases may play an important role in the public health response. However, our results show that diagnostic delays are frequent, and more work is needed to improve timely diagnostic strategies, especially among adolescents and adults.

### California pertussis epidemic, 2010 [^117Hu6yc]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2010, California experienced the highest number of pertussis cases in > 60 years, with > 9000 cases, 809 hospitalizations, and 10 deaths. This report provides a descriptive epidemiologic analysis of this epidemic and describes public health mitigation strategies that were used, including expanded pertussis vaccine recommendations.

Study Design

Clinical and demographic information were evaluated for all pertussis cases with onset from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2010, and reported to the California Department of Public Health.

Results

Hispanic infants younger than 6 months had the highest disease rates; all deaths and most hospitalizations occurred in infants younger than 3 months. Most pediatric cases were vaccinated according to national recommendations, although 9% of those aged 6 months to 18 years were completely unvaccinated against pertussis. High disease rates also were observed in fully vaccinated preadolescents, especially 10-year-olds. Mitigation strategies included expanded tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine recommendations, public and provider education, distribution of free vaccine for postpartum women and contacts of infants, and clinical guidance on diagnosis and treatment of pertussis in young infants.

Conclusions

Infants too young to be fully vaccinated against pertussis remain at highest risk of severe disease and death. Data are needed to evaluate strategies offering direct protection of this vulnerable population, such as immunization of pregnant women and of newborns. The high rate of disease among preadolescents suggests waning of immunity from the diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis series; additional studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy and duration of protection of the diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis series and the tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis series.

### Treatment of hemolytic uremic syndrome related to Bordetella pertussis infection-is plasma exchange or eculizumab use necessary? [^115sTxu2]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bordetella pertussis infection is a known trigger of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). For patients suspected of having atypical HUS, prompt plasma exchange/infusion (PE/PI) or eculizumab (ECZ) treatment is recommended.

Case Presentation

We report a 1-month-old female infant who was admitted with a severe cough and a B. pertussis-positive sputum culture. She was born at 38weeks gestation and did not have a family history of renal diseases. Hemophagocytic syndrome was suspected and she was transferred to our hospital 17days after her initial admission. One day later, she developed acute kidney injury and was diagnosed with HUS triggered by B. pertussis infection. Her plasma complement levels were low and her kidney function continued to worsen over the next few days. However, prior to starting ECZ treatment, her kidney function improved spontaneously; she did not receive PE/PI or ECZ. She was discharged 46days after her initial hospitalization, without complications. A genetic workup revealed no mutations in CFH, CFI, CFB, C3, MCP, THBD, or DGKE.

Conclusions

This case demonstrates that B. pertussis infection-related HUS may resolve spontaneously. The decision to treat during the acute phase is challenging because B. pertussis often affects infants suspected of having atypical HUS. However, ECZ may not be the first treatment option for patients with B. pertussis infection-related HUS unless they show an indicated genetic abnormality; if ECZ is used, early discontinuation should be considered.

### Treatment of hemolytic uremic syndrome related to Bordetella pertussis infection-is plasma exchange or eculizumab use necessary? [^114gGwNv]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

On the other hand, the contribution of complement system dysregulation cannot be completely ruled out in our patient. Even though genetic mutations were not identified, such genetic mutations remain undetected in 30–40% of patients with aHUS. The spontaneous remission of our patient may be due to the effect of the steroid used to treat respiratory symptoms and suspected HPS, prior to her transfer to our hospital. The patient showed decreased levels of both C3 and C4 in the acute phase. Theoretically, aHUS is characterized by abnormalities in the alternative complement pathway and may be identified by a selective C3 deficiency, with normal C4 levels. Conversely, complement levels in secondary TMA are considered to be variable due to its association with a variety of causative diseases. The low complement levels in this patient did not contradict past reports indicating that B. pertussis infections induce activation of the classical complement pathway.

The pathogenetic triggers of complement activation include immunologic disorders, genetics, infections, systemic diseases, drug administration, and mixed-cause triggers. In Japan, the revised diagnostic criteria for aHUS developed in 2015 by the Japanese Society of Nephrology and the Japan Pediatric Society excluded secondary TMA from the aHUS definition, according to the international consensus. Additionally, this new clinical guideline recommends therapeutic treatments, such as ECZ administration or plasma therapy, for patients with aHUS, but not for those with a secondary TMA. Typically, aHUS can be distinguished from other TMAs. However, this may be challenging in the acute phase of HUS onset because pertussis often affects infants < 3-months-old, before they are eligible for post-natal pertussis vaccination. Our case suggests that some cases of HUS following pertussis infection may be secondary TMAs. Conversely, we cannot completely exclude the contribution of an undetected complement regulator abnormality. Determining the appropriate treatment course during the acute phase remains challenging. Clinicians should plan treatments of their patients according to the clinical courses.

In conclusion, B. pertussis infection could be a cause of secondary TMA, not an aHUS. ECZ administration or PE/PI may not always be the first treatment option for pediatric patients with HUS secondary to a B. pertussis infection. If such treatments are used, their early discontinuation should also be considered.

### Clinical progress note: pertussis [^111eT4Xm]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Pertussis is a highly contagious bacterial respiratory disease that continues to infect individuals and cause deaths despite available vaccines. While there have been increases in case numbers every 2–5 years, 2024 proved to be a significant year in terms of both incidence and deaths from pertussis. Preliminary CDC data from 2025 shows a continuation of this trend with 8,472 pertussis cases through April — twice as many as the same time period in 2024. Given the high risk of severe disease and death among young infants and in un‐ or under‐vaccinated individuals, vaccination is a prevention strategy that remains a mainstay in protecting the most vulnerable.

### Incidence and burden of pertussis among infants less than 1 year of age [^112ujCNG]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study of diagnosed pertussis among infants less than 12 months of age in a large US managed care database, incidence rates were fairly stable but peaked in 2010. These results are consistent with trends reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Incidence was highest among younger infants (2–3 months of age) and decreased steadily from the 4th through the 12th months of age. With the exception of the first month of age, incidence rates reported in this study were slightly higher than those reported from a nationally representative surveillance system which increased incidence estimates by 15% to account for under-reporting. Only 11.4% of the infants with a claim for pertussis also had evidence of a laboratory test to confirm pertussis diagnosis, implying that most of the diagnosis were based on infants' symptoms.

The conditional logit model found that infants who were treated for respiratory symptoms or pertussis-like conditions in the 14 days before the pertussis index date had the highest odds of subsequent pertussis diagnosis, suggesting missed or delayed pertussis diagnosis. Diagnosing pertussis in a timely fashion in young infants is challenging, and these findings emphasize the importance of including pertussis in the differential diagnosis of very young infants presenting with respiratory symptoms, given the levels of pertussis disease circulating in the community.

DTaP exposure was not among the statistically significant factors associated with pertussis diagnosis in this study but was significantly associated with treatment costs. The role of DTaP vaccination is challenging to assess since protection from vaccination is not expected before the 6–7th month of life after completion of the primary series, and in this study, most of the pertussis cases occurred in the first few months of life, before infants had either started or completed the DTaP primary series. This study supports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decision to protect infants from exposure to the pertussis organism by recommending a dose of reduced-antigen Tdap vaccine to each pregnant woman between 27 and 36 weeks gestation during each pregnancy and to all people with close contact with the infants, including parents, grandparents, relatives, babysitters, nannies, daycare providers and housekeepers.

### Guidance for occupational health services in medical centers [^112Pukt9]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Pertussis prevention and exposure management in health care — more than one million adults and adolescents are estimated to contract pertussis annually in the United States, outbreaks have occurred in health care settings, and disease is spread avidly by droplets and direct contact. Tdap acellular pertussis vaccine for adults has been approved since 2005, has an efficacy ranging from 66–92%, and is recommended for health care workers. Following unprotected exposure, antibiotic prophylaxis is still recommended for vaccinees if they are likely to have contact with high-risk patients, e.g. neonates, immunocompromised patients or pregnant women, and exposed health care workers who work with high-risk patients should receive a macrolide antibiotic or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. All exposed health care workers should undergo daily symptom monitoring for 21 days following exposure, with antibiotic treatment only if symptoms of pertussis develop.

### Widespread Bordetella parapertussis infections-Wisconsin, 2011–2012: clinical and epidemiologic features and antibiotic use for treatment and prevention [^1122tDZj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

During October 2011-December 2012, concurrent with a statewide pertussis outbreak, 443 Bordetella parapertussis infections were reported among Wisconsin residents. We examined clinical features of patients with parapertussis and the effect of antibiotic use for treatment and prevention.

Methods

Patients with polymerase chain reaction results positive for B. parapertussis reported during October 2011-May 2012 were interviewed regarding presence and durations of pertussis-like symptoms and receipt of azithromycin treatment. Data regarding acute cough illnesses and receipt of azithromycin prophylaxis among parapertussis patient household members (HHMs) were also collected. Using multivariate repeated measures log-binomial regression analysis, we examined associations of treatment receipt by the HHM with the earliest illness onset and prophylaxis receipt among other HHMs with the presence of any secondary cough illnesses in the household.

Results

Among 218 patients with parapertussis, pertussis-like symptoms were frequently reported. Illness durations were significantly shorter among patients with treatment initiated 0–6 days after cough onset, compared with nonrecipients (median durations: 10 vs 19 days, P = .002). Among 361 HHMs from 120 households, compared with nonrecipients, prompt prophylaxis of HHMs was associated with no secondary cough illnesses (relative risk: 0.16; 95% confidence interval, .04-.69).

Conclusions

Bordetella parapertussis infection causes pertussis-like illness that might be misclassified as pertussis if B. parapertussis testing is not performed. Prompt treatment might shorten illness duration, and prompt HHM prophylaxis might prevent secondary illnesses. Further study is needed to evaluate antibiotic effectiveness for preventing parapertussis and to determine risks and benefits of antibiotic use.

### Uncomplicated acute bronchitis [^114fk38g]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis is an acute cough illness in otherwise healthy adults that usually lasts 1 to 3 weeks. This review describes the pathophysiology of the condition and provides a practical approach to the evaluation and treatment of adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Practical points to be made are:1. Respiratory viruses appear to cause the large majority of cases of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.2. Pertussis infection is present in up to 10% to 20% of adults with cough illness of more than 2 to 3 weeks' duration. No clinical features distinguish pertussis from nonpertussis infection in adults who were immunized against pertussis as children.3. Transient bronchial hyperresponsiveness appears to be the predominant mechanism of the bothersome cough of acute bronchitis.4. Ruling out pneumonia is the primary objective in evaluating adults with acute cough illness in whom comorbid conditions and occult asthma are absent or unlikely. In the absence of abnormalities in vital signs (heart rate > 100 beats/min, respiratory rate > 24 breaths/min, and oral body temperature > 38 degrees C), the likelihood of pneumonia is very low.5. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials do not support routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.6. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shown that inhaled albuterol decreases the duration of cough in adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis.7. Intervention studies suggest that antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis can be reduced by using a combination of patient and physician education. Decreased rates of antibiotic treatment are not associated with increased utilization, return visits, or dissatisfaction with care.

### Assuring access to safe medicines in pregnancy and breastfeeding [^116C3X9x]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

The health of the child begins with the health of the mother. Yet, there is a persistent dearth of data to support clinical decision making in pregnant and breastfeeding women, risking inadequate, inappropriate, or lack of treatment, any of which can result in significant health consequences for the mother or child. Many factors contribute to this, including the temporary nature of pregnancy. Most importantly the histories of thalidomide and diethylstilbestrol continue to cast long shadows on clinical, regulatory, and public attitudes surrounding research and medicinal treatment involving pregnant and breastfeeding women. They were the basis for "special protections" for women in rules and regulations governing research, largely preventing exploration of ethical ways to study such populations to obtain robust and reliable data. Similarly, the extreme nature of the cases in which infants were affected are likely to have been driving factors in the liability barriers to data collection by industry. Without data, regulators are unable to confidently ensure robust information in labeling.

On the other hand, there have been recent efforts to close these information gaps. For example, observational data on pertussis vaccination in pregnancy was critical in removing a "not recommended in pregnancy" categorization of pertussis vaccines in Europe. Clinical trials of vaccines to prevent H1N1 influenza during the 2009 pandemic contributed to the body of knowledge on the safety of inactivated influenza vaccines in pregnancy, which supported public health outreach that led to increased seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine coverage among pregnant women in the United States.

Still, when considering use of the majority of medicines, women and healthcare providers are placed in an impossible position — needing to make healthcare decisions in an information vacuum.

### Angioedema as a predominant symptom ofinfection [^113DZpzS]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

B. pertussis develops its pathogenic effects via several toxins, which can be assumed to play a major role even in the development of angioedema. The most relevant toxin, Pertussis toxin, is a soluble exotoxin and is known to act systemically, leading to changes in G-protein mediated cellular responses. It has also been shown to increase vascular permeability and thereby induce oedema. Pertussis toxin results in vasodilatation by reducing the contractile properties of smooth muscle cells in resistance arteries, leading to oedema.

Pertussis toxin is also responsible for lymphocytosis, which was another systemic response to B. pertussis infection seen in our patient. While neutrophilia is common in cases of bacterial infection, lymphocytosis is characteristic for B. pertussis infection and can even be used as a prognostic marker for poor outcomes.

In adults, infection with B. pertussis is likely heavily underdiagnoseddue to a few reasons. First, the clinical presentation may be atypical. Second, there has been increasing evidence to suggest that acellular vaccines introduced in the 1990s only last for 4–12 years, which leaves adolescents and adults at risk of infection. For patients in the early disease stage, PCR is the diagnostic method of choice, after 3 weeks, serological diagnosis is recommended. PCR sensitivity is lower in adults compared with children. In our patient, 7–8 weeks after symptom onset, high titres of IgG and IgA antibodies to pertussis toxin were detected, which is highly sensitive and specific for a recent pertussis infection.

Antibiotic treatment effectively eliminates the bacteria and thereby reduces the risk of transmission. However, evidence suggests that it only affects the clinical course when given during the first week of infection. Even though the patient had been suffering from cough and angioedema for 7–8 weeks at the time of diagnosis, we still decided to prescribe antibiotic treatment due to the severity and duration of symptoms and the lack of other causal treatment options. It is possible that the clinical improvement was related to the initiation of antibiotic treatment, but may also represent the natural course of the disease with spontaneous improvement of symptoms.

To conclude, therapy-resistant angioedema and coughing for several weeks should prompt early testing for possible B. pertussis infection. In the clinical routine, the focus must be placed on achieving an early diagnosis and, above all, on disease prevention by vaccination.

### Pertussis epidemic – California, 2014 [^116Lhd3X]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Pertussis incidence is likely to continue to increase in the United States. Prevention efforts should be focused on preventing severe disease and death from pertussis in young infants. The preferred strategy is vaccination of pregnant women during the third trimester of each pregnancy to provide placental transfer of maternal antibodies to the infant. Prenatal care providers are encouraged to provide Tdap to pregnant women (considered best practice) or refer patients to obtain vaccine from an alternative provider, such as a pharmacy or local public health department. Efforts should be made to eliminate barriers to receiving vaccines from prenatal care providers.

Very few mothers of infants with pertussis had received Tdap during pregnancy; many more were vaccinated after delivery, which does not confer any direct protection to the infant and is no longer a preferred strategy. Recently published data indicate that Tdap vaccination coverage among pregnant women was only 19.5% in 2012 across California Vaccine Safety Datalink sites. Similarly, in a survey conducted at 100 birthing hospitals in California during October 2013, only 25% of new mothers reported receiving Tdap during pregnancy, whereas an additional 44% received Tdap in the hospital after delivery (CDPH, unpublished data, 2013). However, efforts to increase vaccine coverage have been successful among Northern California Kaiser patients, and in the third quarter of 2014, an estimated 84% of pregnant women received Tdap vaccine in their third trimester (T. Flanagan; Northern California Kaiser; personal communications; November 26, 2014).

Prenatal care providers should vaccinate all pregnant patients with Tdap during the third trimester of each pregnancy, ideally at 27–36 weeks' gestation, as is recommended by ACIP. If Tdap cannot be administered on-site during routine prenatal care visits, CDPH encourages prenatal care providers to take the following steps: 1) provide the patient with a strong recommendation and patient-specific prescription for Tdap; 2) refer the patient to specific alternative sites for vaccine, such as pharmacies, primary care providers, or local health departments; and 3) assess Tdap status at follow-up visits to confirm and record receipt of vaccine. In addition, timely initiation of the primary DTaP infant series is essential for reducing severe disease in young infants. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, DTaP can be administered to infants at an accelerated schedule, with the first dose administered as early as age 6 weeks, when pertussis is prevalent in the community. Even 1 dose of DTaP might offer some protection against serious pertussis disease in infants.

### Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis induced by pertussis: the first case report [^116hKawj]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

The current report described cases that demonstrated infection with pertussis as a cause of AE-IPF. Infection is now considered to be a major causative factor leading to AE-IPF. While various bacteria and viruses have been studied as potential causes of AE-IPF, to the best of our knowledge, the cases presented herein constitute the first report in the literature of pertussis as the causative agent of AE-IPF.

The current case report revealed three major findings. The first finding was that consideration of pertussis infection should be noted as part of the differential diagnosis during AE-IPF. Many physicians mistakenly consider pertussis to solely present as a pediatric infection; however, recent publications have shown that pertussis is now common among adults and is often overlooked by internists. Additionally, many adult cases of pertussis do not exhibit typical symptoms and IPF patients often already exhibit persistent dry cough; thus, some physicians may be less likely to initially consider pertussis during the differential diagnosis. These factors may have led to pertussis frequently being overlooked as a potential causative pathogen in cases of AE-IPF.

The second finding was the anticipated efficacy of treatment with macrolide antibiotics. Although further discussion may be necessary, macrolide antibiotic treatment can sometimes reduce the duration or severity of symptoms in pertussis infection. When a patient exhibits AE-IPF, we do not routinely prescribe macrolide antibiotics that are known to be useful for whooping cough. Therefore, our clinical experience may influence antibiotic selection in cases of AE-IPF, because AE-IPF in the current patient may be due to pertussis infection.

Lastly, most bacterial infections of the respiratory tract are not preventable; however, pertussis is one of the few pathogens that is preventable through vaccination. Pertussis vaccination is now recommended in a wide array of developed countries. Vaccination is anticipated to be particularly effective in countries where pertussis vaccinations are not performed after adolescence, as in Japan.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^114a7MRj]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Pertussis — infection prevention and control actions in pediatric residential facilities — direct that facilities Restrict individuals with pertussis from the family-centered residential facility until they have completed treatment and obtained written medical clearance from a licensed clinician, noting that a person who has pertussis is contagious until they have completed 5 days of appropriate antibiotic therapy, and facilities do not need to restrict individuals who have received effective treatment but are still coughing. For exposures, Restrict individuals who have been exposed to pertussis from the facility until active infection has been ruled out and preventative antibiotics have been started; Preventative antibiotics are indicated even if exposed people are up to date on immunization, and Written medical clearance from a licensed clinician is required for a person who has been exposed to pertussis to be allowed to enter the facility. Individuals exposed to pertussis who refuse or are unable to take their prescribed antibiotics should be restricted from the facility for 21 days after last pertussis exposure, and Require written medical clearance from a licensed clinician before allowing entry. If a guest is suspected to have pertussis, notify the program manager immediately and refer them to get a medical evaluation by their primary care physician or a licensed clinician, and the program manager should notify the local health department to help identify and notify exposed guests.

### Use of management pathways or algorithms in children with chronic cough: systematic reviews [^1177DJmJ]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Pertussis testing in children with cough — study eligibility and indications are summarized as follows: although several studies evaluated the prevalence of recent B pertussis infection in children with cough, these did not fulfill the systematic review's inclusion criteria of cough duration; the studies reported a mean cough duration of > 4 weeks and the inclusion criteria for both studies was > 2 weeks. Nevertheless, these primary care studies suggested that appropriate tests to evaluate for recent pertussis infection should be undertaken when clinically appropriate, with the most appropriate test (culture, polymerase chain reaction, or serologic analysis) dependent on the child's age and duration of symptoms, and the 2006 ACCP guideline advocated that testing for recent B pertussis infection be undertaken when clinically suspected (eg, contact, posttussive vomiting, whoop).

Lower-risk brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) — pertussis testing: "Clinicians May Obtain Testing for Pertussis in Infants Presenting With a Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade B, Weak Recommendation)". Benefits include "Identify a potentially treatable infection", "Monitor for progression of symptoms, additional apneic episodes", and "Potentially prevent secondary spread and/or identify and treat additional cases", while harms/costs include "Cost of test", "Discomfort of nasopharyngeal swab", and the possibility that "Rapid testing not always available" and "False reassurance from negative results". The benefit–harm assessment states that "The benefits of identifying and treating pertussis and preventing apnea and secondary spread outweigh the cost, discomfort, and consequences of false test results and false reassurance; the benefits are greatest in at-risk populations (exposed, underimmunized, endemic, and during outbreaks)". Clinically, "Pertussis infection has been reported to cause ALTEs in infants… color change followed by respiratory pause", and such infants "can be afebrile and may not develop cough or lower respiratory symptoms for several days afterward". Testing decisions should consider "potential exposures, vaccine history… awareness of pertussis activity in the community, and turnaround time for tests". If available, "Polymerase chain reaction testing for pertussis on a nasopharyngeal specimen… offers the advantage of rapid turnaround time to results", while culture "will take days to yield results but may still be useful in the face of identified risk of exposure".

### New pertussis vaccination strategies beyond infancy: recommendations by the global pertussis initiative [^111c627L]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The Global Pertussis Initiative, an expert scientific forum, was established to address the ongoing problems associated with pertussis disease worldwide.

Methods

The group analyzed pertussis disease trends, developed recommendations to improve disease control through expanded vaccination strategies, and proposed solutions to barriers to implementation and support of research activities.

Results

Bordetella pertussis infection is endemic and continues to be a serious problem among unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated infants. In addition, the reported incidence of pertussis disease is increasing in adolescents and adults, who not only experience a considerable health burden themselves but also infect vulnerable infants.

Conclusions

Current vaccination strategies need to be reinforced. Expanded vaccination should include adding booster doses to existing childhood schedules (preschool or adolescent) and booster doses for those specific adult subgroups that have the highest risk of transmitting B. pertussis infection to infants (i.e., new parents, other contacts of newborns, and health care workers). More epidemiological studies and studies of disease transmission and the cost-effectiveness of vaccination would be valuable, and surveillance, diagnostic improvements, and educational campaigns are needed for implementation. However, as a prelude to universal adult vaccination, immediate universal adolescent vaccination should be instituted in countries in which it is economically feasible.

### Efficacy and safety of pertussis vaccination for pregnant women-a systematic review of randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^1169TstU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Recently, there has been a marked increase in the incidence of pertussis in the world, and newborn babies are at greatest risk of catching this highly infectious disease. Although pertussis vaccination in pregnancy is now recommended in several countries worldwide, pertussis vaccine has not yet been universally provided to the pregnant women. Our review findings aid evidence-based decision making for clinicians and public health commissioners, as well as for the women themselves regarding pertussis vaccination during pregnancy. Given that the existing evidence has not demonstrated that having a pertussis-containing vaccine during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of any serious maternal and perinatal complications, maternal vaccination in pregnancy should continue to be supported, especially during the outbreak period, while further research endeavours to fill knowledge gaps and strengthen evidence of the vaccination's efficacy and safety. Further studies need to focus on establishing the vaccine's efficacy and effectiveness in relation to the prevention of pertussis and pertussis-related complications in infants through large, sufficiently powered, placebo-controlled RCTs. RCTs are also required to allow subgroup analyses that investigate whether vaccine efficacy differs according to the timing of vaccine administration, types of pertussis vaccination, and/or different settings. In particular, there is currently little evidence from low-income countries, where the risk of pertussis is higher and cases are more likely to be fatal; thus, the implications for clinical practice based on the findings of this review may be different. There are also issues related to heterogeneity in the definitions of terms used to assess the safety of vaccinations that makes it difficult to compare vaccine trial results across different settings. Efforts have been made to establish a globally shared understanding of outcomes and to harmonise data collection by the Global Alignment of Immunization Safety Assessment in Pregnancy (GAIA) project supported by the Brighton Collaboration Foundation. In line with these guidelines, ongoing monitoring is vital for the continued safety evaluation of the vaccine during pregnancy.

### Clinical characteristics and prognosis of exchange transfusion in infants with severe pertussis [^114d56Vz]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In recent years, the incidence of pertussis has significantly increased in some countries and regions, including China, and severe pertussis has become one of the main causes of death related to bacterial infections in infants in pediatric ICU. Studies have shown that the younger the child, the more likely they are to progress to severe pertussis, especially infants under 3 months of age, who may require closer monitoring in the ICU. In this study, the median age of surviving group was 2 months, and that of the mortality group was 3 months, with no statistically significant difference. This is consistent with the reported age of pertussis onset, especially severe pertussis, both domestically and internationally, which may be related to the fact that infants under 3 months of age have not yet been vaccinated and have low immunity. In China, infants need to receive one dose of pertussis vaccine at 3, 4 and 5 months of age respectively. Additionally, the symptoms of small infants after infection are atypical, making it easy to misdiagnose or miss the diagnosis, which may eventually lead to severe pertussis or even death. Moreover, there were no differences between survival and mortality group in terms of gender, weight, and the number of days it took to develop severe illness. However, the overall hospitalization costs and duration of the surviving group were higher than those of the mortality group, possibly because infants in the mortality group often died during the acute phase of the disease, while those in the surviving group required more time for treatment after being transferred out of the ICU. To date, there are no unified guidelines or standards for the diagnosis and treatment of severe pertussis. In China, the definition of severe pertussis is often based on different organ dysfunctions, such as recurrent apnea, hypoxemia, pertussis encephalopathy, and cardiovascular dysfunction. A recent multicenter study from Turkey showed the the mortality rate for severe pertussis was 8%. Another domestic study indicated that the mortality rate for children with severe pertussis is 22.35%. In this study, the mortality of 45 infants with severe pertussis who received ET treatment was 22.2%. The mortality is similar to that of this domestic study. The number of cases of pertussis treated with exchange transfusion in our center in 2023 and 2024 has significantly increased compared to previous years, while the mortality decreased significantly compared to the period from 2019 to 2022.

### Use of macrolides in mother and child and risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: nationwide cohort study [^116vZ1ST]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Clinical implications and conclusions

Whether an absolute risk increase of 24.4 cases of IHPS per 1000 infants exposed to macrolides within the first two weeks of life should prompt doctors to withhold the use of macrolides in infants of this age, depends on the indication for treatment. Pertussis infection in infants is associated with serious complications and is potentially fatal if untreated. In infants younger than 6 weeks, the macrolides azithromycin and clarithromycin are the only treatment alternatives for pertussis according to recommendations from the UK Health Protection Agency and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; no other agents are recommended for this age group. It seems probable that the absolute excess risk of IHPS, a condition treatable by a relatively uncomplicated surgical procedure, is outweighed by the risks of pertussis left untreated. Conversely, if effective and safe treatment alternatives exist (for example, for other infections) or if a clear and pertinent indication for treatment is missing, macrolides are best avoided in young infants. Although the absolute risks for IHPS were smaller for maternal use of macrolides when the infant was less than 14 days old and for use in infants during days 14 to 120 after birth, they should still be considered when treatment decisions are made. Most studies, including ours, implicate erythromycin; however, no study has been able to rule out associations with other macrolide agents with certainty. Therefore, a cautious prescription practice acknowledging the possibility of a class effect seems warranted pending additional data.

### Recent developments in pertussis [^1143Ld9s]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Pertussis causes nearly 300,000 deaths in children every year. Most deaths take place in developing countries, but the infection remains a priority everywhere. Pertussis vaccination protects infants and children against death and admission to hospital, but breakthrough disease in vaccinated people can happen. In high-mortality countries, the challenge is to improve timeliness and coverage of childhood vaccination and surveillance. In regions with low mortality and highest coverage, pertussis is frequently the least well-controlled disease in childhood vaccination programmes. Some countries have reported a rise in pertussis in adolescents, adults, and pre-vaccination infants, but how much these changes are real or a result of improved recognition and surveillance remains uncertain. In response, several countries have introduced adolescent and adult acellular pertussis vaccine boosters. The effect so far is unknown; assessment is impeded by poor data. Uncertainties still persist about key variables needed to model and design vaccination programmes, such as risk of transmission from adults and adolescents to infants. New vaccination strategies under investigation include vaccination of neonates, family members, and pregnant women.

Rationale for Recommendations

In 2013, ACIP did not support a general recommendation for a routine second dose of Tdap; the rationale was described in previously published guidance. In 2019, ACIP again concluded that in light of the higher cost of Tdap relative to Td and uncertainty about the impact that receipt of multiple Tdap doses would have on pertussis control and transmission, there continues to be insufficient evidence to preferentially recommend that Tdap replace Td. However, given the reassuring safety profile and evidence of widespread use of Tdap in place of Td, to allow providers more flexibility, either Tdap or Td was recommended for use in situations when previously only Td was recommended. ACIP recommends that either Td or Tdap be used for the decennial Td booster, tetanus prophylaxis for wound management, and for additional required doses in the catch-up immunization schedule if a person has received at least 1 Tdap dose.

### The current state of pertussis vaccination in pregnancy around the world, with recommendations for improved care: consensus statements from the global pertussis initiative [^115vu1yT]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Bordetella pertussis, which causes a respiratory disease known as pertussis ("whooping cough") remains an important global challenge, with the incidence in pertussis cases increasing in recent years. Newborns and infants are at increased risk for severe morbidity and mortality from this bacterium. Vaccination in pregnancy has become an important strategy to both passively transfer immunity as well as prevent infection in pregnant persons, who are a major source of newborn infection, thus attempting to decrease the impact of this serious disease. It is considered safe for the pregnant person, the developing fetus, and the infant, and during the first 3months of life it has been shown to be highly effective in preventing pertussis. There are a variety of strategies, recommendations, and adherence rates associated with pertussis vaccination in pregnancy around the world. We summarize the 2021 Global Pertussis Initiative Annual Meeting that reviewed the current global status of pertussis vaccination in pregnancy and remaining medical and scientific questions, with a focus on vaccination challenges and strategies for obstetric and gynecologic healthcare providers.

### Treatment of pertussis | Whooping cough… [^11158xnk]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Treatment within the first 1–2 weeks is most effective for reducing symptom severity.
- Healthcare providers should consider treating prior to test results if certain circumstances are present.
- Choosing the type of antibiotic to use may depend on a number of factors, including age and antibiotic resistance patterns.
- Find more information below about who to treat, when to treat, and antibiotic selection. Early treatment can reduce severity The earlier someone, especially an infant, starts treatment the better. If someone starts treatment during the first 1 to 2 weeks before coughing paroxysms occur, symptoms may be lessened. Antibiotics won't alter the course of the illness or prevent transmission if given later in the illness. Antibiotic choice The recommended antibiotics for treatment or postexposure prophylaxis of pertussis are
- Macrolides
- Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole Important considerations Healthcare providers should choose an antibiotic after consideration that includes the
- Potential for adverse events and drug interactions
- Tolerability
- Ease of adherence to the regimen prescribed
- Recent travel to a country where macrolide resistance is common
- Cost. Treatment options vary by age Infants less than 1 month of age Use macrolides with caution. An association between orally administered erythromycin or azithromycin and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis has been reported. However, azithromycin remains the drug of choice for treatment or prophylaxis of pertussis in very young infants. The risk of developing severe pertussis and life-threatening complications outweighs the potential risk of IHPS. Monitor infants < 1 month of age who receive a macrolide for the development of IHPS and for other serious adverse events.

People 1 month of age and older Macrolides are preferred for the treatment of pertussis. Azithromycin remains one of the recommended drugs for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of pertussis but consider using an alternative drug in those who have known cardiovascular disease, including: Patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, a history of torsades de pointes, congenital long QT syndrome, bradyarrhythmias.

### Treatment… [^112zZU7w]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment Ideally, treat pertussis during the first 1 to 2 weeks before coughing paroxysms occurs. Treatment is ineffective if started late in the course of illness. Report cases of pertussis to the local public health department as soon as possible to assist with preventing additional cases. Treat early Early treatment of pertussis is most effective for reducing symptom severity. The earlier a person, especially an infant, starts treatment the better. If a person starts treatment during the first 1 to 2 weeks before coughing paroxysms occur, symptoms may be lessened. Antibiotics will not alter the course of the illness or prevent transmission if they are given later in the course of illness. A reasonable guideline is to treat Persons 1 year of age and olderwithin 3 weeks of cough onset Infants younger than 1 year of ageand pregnant women within 6 weeks of cough onset.

Antimicrobial choice The recommended antimicrobial agents for treatment or chemoprophylaxis of pertussis are
- Azithromycin
- Clarithromycin
- Erythromycin Clinicians can also use Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxasole. Clinicians should choose the antimicrobial after consideration of the
- Potential for adverse events and drug interactions
- Tolerability
- Ease of adherence to the regimen prescribed
- Cost. Treatment options vary by age Macrolides erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin* are preferred for the treatment of pertussis in persons 1 month of age and older. For persons 2 months of age and older, an alternative to macrolides is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
- Patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, a history of torsades de pointes, congenital long QT syndrome, bradyarrhythmias, or uncompensated heart failure
- Patients on drugs known to prolong the QT interval
- Patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions such as uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, clinically significant bradycardia, and in patients receiving Class IA or Class III antiarrhythmic agents.
