MOA of letrozol

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the mechanism of action of letrozole. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the target enzyme and its physiological role. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic class and binding mechanism. Next, I will examine the biochemical consequences and time course of estrogen suppression. After that, I need to connect this to downstream receptor signaling and clinical effects in breast cancer. I should also consider tissue specificity and selectivity. Finally, I will review comparative potency with other AIs, resistance biology, and off-label reproductive mechanisms, and close with a concise synthesis that ties mechanism to clinical outcomes.

> Let me first confirm the target and its biology. Letrozole inhibits aromatase (CYP19A1), the cytochrome P450 enzyme responsible for converting adrenal androgens (androstenedione and testosterone) to estrogens (estrone and estradiol), which is the predominant source of estrogen in postmenopausal women and contributes to local estrogen synthesis in breast tumor stroma, thereby supporting estrogen receptor–mediated growth signaling in ER-positive breast cancer [^112dMMg8] [^117Fnr6S] [^117QQq3D].

> I need to check the pharmacologic class and binding mechanism. Letrozole is a third-generation, nonsteroidal, reversible aromatase inhibitor of the triazole class; it competitively binds to the heme moiety within the cytochrome P450 subunit of the aromatase complex, thereby blocking substrate access and reversibly suppressing enzymatic activity across tissues [^112dMMg8] [^117Fnr6S] [^1115qWZJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical effects without quantifying biochemical consequences. Let me verify the magnitude and time course of estrogen suppression. In postmenopausal women, letrozole 2.5 mg daily reduces circulating estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate by roughly 75–95% from baseline, with maximal suppression typically achieved within 2–3 days; importantly, it does not meaningfully impair adrenal glucocorticoid or aldosterone synthesis, underscoring selective gonadal steroidogenesis inhibition [^111VcaMJ] [^112dMMg8] [^117Fnr6S].

> Next, I should review the downstream signaling effects. By depleting the ligand for estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), letrozole prevents ERα–estrogen binding, dimerization, nuclear translocation, and transcription of estrogen-responsive genes that drive proliferation and survival in ER-positive breast cancer. Unlike tamoxifen, letrozole does not exert partial agonist activity at ERα, which avoids receptor-mediated proliferative signaling and may mitigate certain resistance pathways [^112dMMg8] [^117Fnr6S] [^114jbhmp].

> I will now examine tissue specificity and selectivity. Let me think about whether effects are confined to breast and tumor. Letrozole acts systemically where aromatase is expressed — adipose tissue, liver, muscle, brain, and breast tumor stroma — reducing both circulating and intratumoral estrogen; clinically relevant suppression occurs in breast tumor tissue, aligning with its therapeutic effect in ER-positive disease, while sparing mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid pathways, consistent with observed tolerability trade-offs such as bone effects without adrenal insufficiency [^112dMMg8] [^117Fnr6S] [^113iqUb7].

> But wait, what if potency differences among third-generation AIs matter clinically? I should double-check comparative data. Letrozole demonstrates greater in vivo potency than anastrozole in several translational studies, achieving deeper suppression of estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate; however, large randomized trials have not consistently shown clinically significant differences in disease-free or overall survival between letrozole and anastrozole, suggesting a threshold effect for aromatase inhibition beyond which incremental potency may not translate into improved efficacy, though it may influence side-effect profiles and sequencing strategies [^114Yfo9b] [^113XyZds] [^111hKeHd] [^115DsM8s].

> Next, I should review resistance biology and sequencing. Let me verify whether there is non–cross-resistance between steroidal and nonsteroidal AIs. Mechanistically distinct classes (irreversible steroidal inactivators like exemestane versus reversible nonsteroidal inhibitors like letrozole) show partial non–cross-resistance in metastatic settings, enabling sequential use to prolong endocrine control; additionally, experimental models suggest that temporary letrozole withdrawal can reverse acquired resistance, providing a rationale for intermittent strategies in selected contexts, although clinical validation is limited [^113stgpM] [^114oFMhC] [^1164NqLF].

> I need to ensure I address reproductive uses, even though they are off-label in many regions. In anovulatory women, particularly with PCOS, letrozole lowers conversion of androgens to estrogens, reduces negative feedback at the hypothalamus, increases GnRH pulsatility, and augments FSH secretion to promote follicular development; guidelines increasingly endorse letrozole as first-line ovulation induction in PCOS due to higher live birth rates versus clomiphene, with safety considerations including teratogenic risk and the need to avoid use in pregnancy [^115tdTX5] [^115HHFRM] [^11777uA8].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing critical is missing. Letrozole's mechanism is best summarized as follows: it is a nonsteroidal, reversible aromatase inhibitor that competitively binds the heme of the CYP19A1 complex, rapidly and profoundly suppressing estrogen synthesis across peripheral and intratumoral sites. This ligand depletion prevents ERα-mediated transcriptional programs, thereby inhibiting proliferation and survival in ER-positive breast cancer, with clinical advantages over tamoxifen in several settings and a tolerability profile shaped by estrogen deprivation rather than receptor agonism [^112dMMg8] [^117Fnr6S] [^115zyx9a].

Letrozole is a **nonsteroidal, reversible aromatase inhibitor** [^117ThStX] that competitively binds the heme of the cytochrome P450 subunit of aromatase [^117Fnr6S], blocking the conversion of androgens to estrogens [^117Fnr6S] and thereby reducing estrogen levels in all tissues [^112dMMg8]. This estrogen deprivation **halts estrogen receptor–mediated signaling** [^117QQq3D], inhibiting proliferation and survival of estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells [^112dMMg8]. Letrozole is indicated for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer [^1137PWxi] and is also used off-label for ovulation induction in PCOS [^115tdTX5] due to its effects on the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis [^112dMMg8]. It does not directly affect adrenal corticosteroid or thyroid hormone synthesis [^112dMMg8] [^117Fnr6S].

---

## Molecular mechanism of action

- **Target enzyme**: Aromatase (CYP19A1), a cytochrome P450 enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of androgens (androstenedione and testosterone) to estrogens (estrone and estradiol) [^11113LuT] [^112dMMg8].

- **Binding site**: Letrozole competitively binds to the heme group of the cytochrome P450 subunit of aromatase, forming a reversible complex that prevents substrate access and enzymatic activity [^112dMMg8] [^117Fnr6S].

- **Inhibition**: This binding blocks the aromatization of androgens, reducing estrogen synthesis in peripheral tissues, including breast tumor tissue [^112dMMg8] [^117Fnr6S].

---

## Physiological consequences of aromatase inhibition

- **Estrogen deprivation**: Reduced estrogen levels deprive estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells of their growth signal, inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis [^114jbhmp] [^112dMMg8].

- **Hormonal feedback**: In postmenopausal women, letrozole lowers serum estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate without significantly affecting adrenal corticosteroid or thyroid hormone synthesis [^112dMMg8] [^117Fnr6S].

- **Ovarian effects**: In premenopausal women, letrozole can increase gonadotropin secretion (FSH and LH), stimulating ovarian follicular development and ovulation [^111KMQq3] [^115tdTX5].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Breast cancer**: Letrozole is indicated for adjuvant and metastatic treatment of hormone receptor–positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women, improving disease-free survival and reducing recurrence [^1137PWxi] [^115zyx9a] [^111YzutX].

- **Ovulation induction**: Off-label use in PCOS increases ovulation and pregnancy rates compared to clomiphene citrate, with lower multiple pregnancy rates [^115tdTX5] [^115HHFRM].

- **Resistance**: Resistance can occur via alternative signaling pathways (e.g. PI3K/AKT, MAPK) [^1164NqLF] [^113eXg8J]; combination therapies (e.g. CDK4/6 inhibitors) are used to overcome resistance [^113eXg8J] [^116iJzeo].

## Mechanism of action and clinical implications

| **Mechanism** | **Clinical implication** |
|-|-|
| Competitive inhibition of aromatase | Reduced estrogen synthesis |
| Estrogen deprivation | Inhibition of ER-positive breast cancer growth |
| Increased gonadotropins | Ovulation induction in PCOS |
| No effect on adrenal or thyroid hormones | Minimal endocrine disruption |

---

Letrozole's **mechanism of action** is competitive, reversible inhibition of aromatase, leading to estrogen deprivation and inhibition of estrogen-dependent breast cancer growth [^112dMMg8] [^117Fnr6S]. It is also used for ovulation induction in PCOS due to its effects on gonadotropins [^115tdTX5] [^111KMQq3].

Aromatase inhibitors vs aromatase inactivators

Nonsteroidal AIs act as competitive, reversible CYP-19/aromatase inhibitors, whereas steroidal AIs act as irreversible ('suicide') inactivators of aromatase, causing decomposing of the aromatase molecule after binding to the inactivator. Many compounds with aromatase inhibitory effects have been tested in MBC patients during the past three decades. Meanwhile, the orally administered compounds belonging to the third generation are currently used worldwide in the majority of countries. The drugs are classified as either nonsteroidal AIs (triazoles like anastrozole and letrozole) or steroidal aromatase inactivators (exemestane) because of their molecular structures and mode of action (Figure 1). Importantly, a lack of cross-resistance has been documented between these two major groups of aromatase inhibitory compounds, allowing sequential use in the metastatic setting. However, the precise mechanisms explaining the clinically observed lack of cross-resistance have not been fully clarified yet. Some of the possible explanations for this important clinical phenomenon have been discussed elsewhere.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^115yDVRN]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Postmenopausal early breast cancer — BIG 1–98 randomized comparisons: The trial tested tamoxifen alone for 5 years, letrozole alone for 5 years, or 2 years of one agent followed by 3 years of the other; with 8010 patients in the early analysis, disease-free survival was superior with letrozole (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70–0.93; log rank P = 0.003) with no interaction between PR expression and benefit and no difference in OS. Cardiovascular adverse events overall were similar (letrozole, 4.8%; tamoxifen, 4.7%), but grade 3 to 5 cardiac adverse events were significantly higher with letrozole, and thromboembolic events were significantly higher with tamoxifen. Bone fractures were more frequent with letrozole (9.5% vs. 6.5%). After median 71 months, no significant DFS improvement was seen with tamoxifen→letrozole or the reverse sequence versus letrozole alone (HR for tamoxifen followed by letrozole, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.84–1.32; HR for letrozole followed by tamoxifen, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.76–1.21).

### Aromatase inhibition in the treatment of advanced breast cancer: is there a relationship between potency and clinical efficacy? [^111wfVHN]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

The AIs have been developed for the treatment of women with breast cancer in whom ovarian function has ceased either due to the menopause or as a result of ovarian ablation, through oophorectomy or by ovarian irradiation. They prevent the formation of oestrogen from androgens in postmenopausal women through inhibition of the cytochrome P 450 enzyme, aromatase, which catalyses the conversion of androgens to oestrogens in the fat, liver and muscle cells and breast tumour tissue itself. In premenopausal women, the ovaries are the primary site of oestrogen production and AIs are not able to completely block ovarian oestrogen synthesis.

Aminoglutethimide was the first AI to become available in the late 1970s and the first to show efficacy as second-line therapy after tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with advanced hormone-responsive breast cancer. However, its toxicity and lack of selectivity for the aromatase enzyme, necessitating concomitant corticosteroid supplementation, prevented it from becoming a more widely used treatment. Formestane, a steroidal AI, became available in 1993. It was also effective for treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, but more selective than aminoglutethimide, and therefore associated with fewer side effects. However, as a result of extensive first-pass metabolism, formestane cannot be given orally and has to be administered twice-monthly by intramuscular injection, leading to reports of local reactions in up to 17% of patients.

The newer third-generation AIs, which include the nonsteroidal agents, anastrozole, letrozole and fadrozole (Japan only) and the steroidal compound, exemestane (Figure 1

Figure 1
Structures of anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane and fadrozole.), are the most recent AIs to become available for use in postmenopausal women with metastatic hormone-responsive breast tumours. These AIs show increased potency with respect to both aromatase inhibition and oestrogen suppression compared with the earlier AIs. Small but statistically significant differences in potency have also been reported between third-generation AIs.

An important question is whether or not these differences in potency between the third-generation AIs lead to clinically relevant differences in efficacy and tolerability. This paper reviews current published data on potency and clinical efficacy to determine if any such relationship exists.

### Differences between the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole – of clinical importance? [^1155Wk9W]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

In contrast to these findings, the Immediate Preoperative Anastrozole, Tamoxifen, or Combined With Tamoxifen trial did not find any significant benefit with anastrozole compared with tamoxifen. Postmenopausal women with ER+ invasive breast cancer were randomised to one of three treatment groups: neoadjuvant anastrozole (n = 113), tamoxifen (n = 108), or anastrozole plus tamoxifen (n = 109) (2005). There were no significant differences in clinical objective response rates (caliper) across treatment groups (P = 0.87; anastrozole vs tamoxifen).

The outcome of patients in need of neoadjuvant therapy may also be altered by the frequency of complete pathological responses during therapy with an AI. Although complete pathological responses have been observed in a study published by Dixon et al, these were not found in the corresponding group of patients treated with anastrozole.

### Letrozole (Femara) [^11777uA8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6

	Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on post-marketing reports, findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, Femara can cause fetal harm and is contraindicated for use in pregnant women. In post-marketing reports, use of letrozole during pregnancy resulted in cases of spontaneous abortions and congenital birth defects. Letrozole caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats and rabbits at maternal exposures that were below the maximum recommended human dose (MHRD) on a mg/m2basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy with Femara and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].

### The role of letrozole in in vitro fertilization treatment: new remedy or old mirage? [^111KMQq3]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). Medium credibility.

Aromatase inhibitors, particularly letrozole (LZ), are now established as first-line ovulation induction agents, offering an effective ovarian stimulation strategy to enhance outcomes of intrauterine insemination. In recent years, they have also emerged as potentially valuable adjuvants to gonadotropin ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization, particularly in fertility preservation in women with estrogen-responsive cancers. Their primary mechanism of action is to reduce the circulating estrogen levels by inhibiting androgen aromatization. Recent studies have provided evidence that this property may confer therapeutic advantages in other patients undergoing in vitro fertilization. In this study, evidence supporting the role of adjuvant LZ in poor responders, as a moderator of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome symptoms, and an agent for improving the luteal phase after ovarian stimulation is reviewed. The use of LZ for endometrial preparation in the frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycle is also considered.

### Aromatase inhibition in the treatment of advanced breast cancer: is there a relationship between potency and clinical efficacy? [^113bJFRj]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Two-thirds of breast tumours are oestrogen-receptor positive and 60–70% of these tumours respond to interventions that reduce the effects of oestrogen. Until recently, tamoxifen was the drug of choice for the treatment of hormone-responsive early and advanced breast cancer. However, tamoxifen is associated with increased incidences of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic disease, and many tumours eventually become resistant to treatment with tamoxifen. Thus, there is a need for alternative therapies with different mechanisms of action. In postmenopausal women, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) suppress oestrogen levels by inhibiting oestrogen synthesis via the aromatase enzyme pathway. The third-generation AIs (anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane) are more potent than the earlier AIs (aminoglutethimide, formestane and fadrozole) with respect to both aromatase inhibition and oestrogen suppression. While the earlier AIs were unable to show any benefit over megestrol acetate or tamoxifen as second- and first-line therapy, respectively, in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, third-generation AIs have shown significant benefits in both settings. Comparison of aromatase inhibition and oestrogen suppression between the third-generation AIs anastrozole and letrozole showed a small but significantly greater difference in the degree of suppression of oestrone and oestrone sulphate (but not oestradiol), with letrozole. In an open-label trial, there were no significant differences between letrozole and anastrozole for the clinical end points of time to progression (primary end point), time to treatment failure, overall survival, clinical benefit, duration of clinical benefit, time to response, duration of response or objective response rate in patients with confirmed hormone receptor-positive tumours. Together these data suggest that once a certain threshold of aromatase inhibition is reached, small differences in oestrogen suppression between the third-generation AIs do not lead to clinically significant differences in overall efficacy.

### Clinical differences among the aromatase inhibitors [^1158BHaq]. Clinical Cancer Research (2003). Low credibility.

In the United States, three third-generation aromatase inhibitors are available commercially: anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane. Anastrozole and letrozole are nonsteroidal agents, whereas exemestane is a steroid. The three agents differ in terms of structure and metabolic products and in the degree to which they suppress aromatase activity. The clinical significance of these differences is unclear. All three of the agents have been found to be equivalent or superior to megesterol acetate as a second-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. In the first-line setting, large Phase III trials have demonstrated that anastrozole and letrozole are equivalent or superior to tamoxifen in women with metastatic disease. Multiple trials with widely varying study designs have been launched in the adjuvant setting comparing the aromatase inhibitors to tamoxifen. Early results from the ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination) trial suggest a small but statistically significant improvement in disease-free survival for anastrozole compared with tamoxifen, but further follow-up is needed. This article explores the efficacy and tolerability of the aromatase inhibitors in both the metastatic and the adjuvant settings.

Novel antiestrogens vs aromatase inhibitors

The development of fulvestrant (Faslodex, AstraZeneca, Pharmaceuticals, Macclesfield, Cheshire, UK), a unique ER antagonist and downregulator has caused considerable attention. Although experience with fulvestrant in early breast cancer is limited at this point, recent head-to-head comparisons in the metastatic setting have revealed that fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscular (i.m.)/4 w) is at least as effective as anastrozole (1 mg oral (p.o.)/o.d.) with significantly improved time to progression for patients in the fulvestrant arm. Thus, the novel increased dosage of fulvestrant is a promising endocrine treatment option in all settings of breast cancer, and data for patients with early breast cancer are awaited in a short-time frame.

### Aromatase inhibitors in advanced breast cancer: there are efficacy differences [^1137Zbki]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Sir,

In the recently published review, 'Aromatase inhibition in the treatment of advanced breast cancer: is there a relationship between potency and clinical efficacy?', the author claims that differences in the potency of aromatase inhibition and oestrogen suppression among the modern aromatase inhibitors do not translate into differences in efficacy benefits.

The clinical trial results listed within the article, however, contradict the author's conclusion. Furthermore, some of the more general statements within this review must be challenged.

Dr Sainsbury claims to see no efficacy differences between letrozole and anastrozole, despite the former being associated with higher potency in aromatase inhibition and oestrogen suppression. The author makes a number of indirect comparisons of different trials to support his point: the first-line advanced breast cancer trials of anastrozole or letrozole vs tamoxifen demonstrated 'anastrozole to be at least as effective as tamoxifen', whereas 'letrozole was found to be superior to tamoxifen' in all end points including a prospectively planned survival analysis at 1- and 2-year follow-up, which is not mentioned in this review.

In a head-to-head comparison of anastrozole vs letrozole in second-line advanced breast cancer, results were comparable in all end points except overall response rate (ORR), which was more than 50% higher in patients treated with letrozole. While ORR was a secondary rather than primary end point of the trial, the higher likelihood of responding to endocrine therapy is inarguably highly relevant for women with advanced stage breast cancer, as response implies both personal relief as well as delay of more aggressive, usually cytotoxic, therapies.

Dr Sainsbury uses a subgroup analysis to challenge the results of this 713-patient trial, citing a significant superiority for letrozole only in the group of patients with undetermined hormone receptor status. Letrozole response rates in this group of patients were similar to those in the overall trial collective, not surprisingly so, as at least two-thirds of these patients are likely to bear oestrogen receptor (ER)- and/or progesterone receptor (PgR)-positive tumours. In view of the size of the ER/PgR-unknown subgroup (n = 340), the well-balanced demographics in the two trial arms overall, and the high chance of a tumour of undetermined hormone receptor status being positive renders statistical imbalance of ER/PgR status in favour of letrozole, a very unlikely explanation for the 2.5-fold increased response rate achieved with letrozole.

12.1

	Mechanism of Action

The growth of some cancers of the breast is stimulated or maintained by estrogens. Treatment of breast cancer thought to be hormonally responsive (i.e., estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive or receptor unknown) has included a variety of efforts to decrease estrogen levels (ovariectomy, adrenalectomy, hypophysectomy) or inhibit estrogen effects (antiestrogens and progestational agents). These interventions lead to decreased tumor mass or delayed progression of tumor growth in some women.

In postmenopausal women, estrogens are mainly derived from the action of the aromatase enzyme, which converts adrenal androgens (primarily androstenedione and testosterone) to estrone and estradiol. The suppression of estrogen biosynthesis in peripheral tissues and in the cancer tissue itself can therefore be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme.

Letrozole is a nonsteroidal competitive inhibitor of the aromatase enzyme system; it inhibits the conversion of androgens to estrogens. In adult nontumor- and tumor-bearing female animals, letrozole is as effective as ovariectomy in reducing uterine weight, elevating serum LH, and causing the regression of estrogen-dependent tumors. In contrast to ovariectomy, treatment with letrozole does not lead to an increase in serum FSH. Letrozole selectively inhibits gonadal steroidogenesis but has no significant effect on adrenal mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid synthesis.

Letrozole inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the heme of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of estrogen biosynthesis in all tissues. Treatment of women with letrozole significantly lowers serum estrone, estradiol and estrone sulfate and has not been shown to significantly affect adrenal corticosteroid synthesis, aldosterone synthesis, or synthesis of thyroid hormones.

Neoadjuvant setting.

Letrozole is the only AI that has been demonstrated to possess significantly superior efficacy to tamoxifen in the neoadjuvant setting, and is the only AI to have received approval from several countries for use in this setting. In a randomised, double-blind study in PMW (N = 337) with ER+ and/or PgR+ breast cancer comparing letrozole with tamoxifen, letrozole was superior to tamoxifen in overall objective response rate (55 vs 36% P < 0.001). Furthermore, breast-conserving surgery (BCS) was possible in more patients treated with letrozole (45 vs 35% P = 0.022). In another double-blind study of PMW with ER+ and/or PgR+ breast cancer ineligible for BCS, patients were randomly assigned to receive either 4 months of neoadjuvant letrozole or tamoxifen. Letrozole had a significantly better response rate (60 vs 41% P = 0.004), and letrozole-treated patients had significantly more BCS (48 vs 36% P = 0.036). Differences in response rates were most marked for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 1/2+ tumours (88 vs 21% P = 0.0004).

The Pre-operative 'Arimidex' Compared To Tamoxifen Trial was a randomised, multicenter study comparing anastrozole (n = 228) with tamoxifen (n = 223) as neoadjuvant treatment in PMW with HR+, large, operable breast cancer. Objective responses for anastrozole and tamoxifen occurred in 39.5 and 35.4% of patients, respectively (ultrasound), and 50.0 and 46.2% of patients, respectively (caliper). In the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, surgery became feasible after 3 months of hormonal therapy in 38.1 vs 29.9% of anastrozole- and tamoxifen-treated patients, respectively (P = 0.11). In patients receiving endocrine therapy only (n = 314), surgery became feasible in 43% of patients receiving anastrozole vs 30.8% receiving tamoxifen after 3 months of treatment (P = 0.04).

### KRAS-mutated, estrogen receptor-positive low-grade serous ovarian cancer: unraveling an exceptional response mystery [^113SPoed]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

We report on a woman with aggressive estrogen receptor-positive, KRAS-mutated ovarian cancer who achieved a remarkable response to combination therapy with the MEK inhibitor (trametinib) and the aromatase inhibitor (letrozole), even though the disease had failed to respond to a combination of a PI3K inhibitor and different MEK inhibitor, as well as to trametinib and the estrogen modulator, tamoxifen, and to letrozole by itself. The mechanism of action for exceptional response was elucidated by in vitro experiments that demonstrated that the fact that tamoxifen can have an agonistic effect in addition to antagonist activity, whereas letrozole results only in estrogen depletion was crucial to the response achieved when letrozole was combined with an MEK inhibitor. Our current observations indicate that subtle variations in mechanisms of action of outwardly similar regimens may have a major impact on outcome and that such translational knowledge is critical for optimizing a precision medicine strategy. KEY POINTS: This report describes the remarkable response of a patient with KRAS-mutated, estrogen receptor-positive low-grade serous ovarian cancer treated with trametinib (MEK inhibitor) and letrozole (aromatase inhibitor), despite prior progression on similar agents including tamoxifen (estrogen modulator). In vitro investigation revealed that tamoxifen can have agonistic in addition to antagonistic effects, which could be the reason for the patient not responding to the combination of trametinib and tamoxifen. The current observations suggest that drugs with different mechanisms of action targeting the same receptor may have markedly different anticancer activity when used in combinations.

### Steroidal and non-steroidal third-generation aromatase inhibitors induce pain-like symptoms via TRPA1 [^111dQGLd]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, since in clinical practice patients are treated with AIs on a daily basis over very long periods of time (up to 5 years), we asked whether exemestane or letrozole maintains the ability to evoke a TRPA1-dependent mechanical hypersensitivity and decreased grip strength on repeated administration. In Trpa1 +/+ mice, treatment with systemic exemestane (5 mg kg −1, i.p.) or letrozole (0.5 mg kg −1 i.p) (both once a day for 15 consecutive days) produced at day 1, 5, 10 and 15 a transient (from 1 to 6 h) and reproducible mechanical allodynia (Supplementary Figs 3e, 4e). Importantly, in Trpa1 −/− the proalgesic action of AIs was markedly attenuated (Supplementary Figs 3e, 4e). In addition, the decrease in the grip strength was maintained, without undergoing desensitization, over the entire time period of daily i.p. administration of exemestane or letrozole (Supplementary Figs 3f,4f). Both these effects of AIs were significantly reduced in Trpa1 −/− mice (Supplementary Figs 3f, 4f). Similar results were obtained after i.g. administration of exemestane or letrozole (once a day for 15 consecutive days at the dose of 10 mg kg −1 i.g. or 0.5 mg kg −1 i.g. respectively). Both mechanical allodynia and decreased grip strength were observed, without signs of desensitization, over the 15 days of observation in Trpa1 +/+ mice, but were markedly reduced in Trpa1 −/− mice (Figs 4e, f and 5e, f). Altogether, the present data demonstrate that both steroidal and non-steroidal third-generation AIs induce a series of pain-like effects predominantly via a TRPA1-dependent mechanism, effects that over time do not undergo desensitization, thus mimicking the chronic clinical condition.

### Tamoxifen – what next? [^1145ufbd]. The Oncologist (2004). Low credibility.

Most patients with advanced breast cancer (ABC) ultimately die due to disease progression. Consequently, treatments for ABC are predominantly palliative in nature and, therefore, the tolerability profile of a given treatment is particularly relevant in these patients. While cytotoxic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy exhibit efficacy in hormone-sensitive, advanced disease, it is endocrine therapy that combines efficacy with minimal acute toxicity. Tamoxifen has been the chosen endocrine therapy for postmenopausal, hormone-sensitive, ABC for over 20 years. More recently, new endocrine agents with different mechanisms of action from tamoxifen have been introduced. Evidence indicates that the aromatase inhibitors anastrozole (Arimidex; AstraZeneca; Wilmington, DE), letrozole (Femara; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.; East Hanover, NJ) and exemestane (Aromasin; Pharmacia Corp.; Peapack, NJ) offer superior efficacy and tolerability to tamoxifen in the first-line treatment of postmenopausal, hormone-sensitive ABC. Similarly, after tamoxifen failure, fulvestrant (Faslodex; AstraZeneca), a new estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist that downregulates the ER, is at least as effective as anastrozole, is well tolerated, and is not cross-resistant with tamoxifen. Unlike tamoxifen, fulvestrant has no known agonist effects. The sequential use of such agents may prolong the time during which endocrine therapies can be used, thereby avoiding the more acute toxicities associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Indeed, a series of studies has shown that this sequential use is a relevant, active, and well-tolerated option. Establishing the comparative efficacies and optimal sequences that incorporate the newer endocrine agents will be central in determining the future role of hormonal therapy in ABC; the results of this work will determine the relative place of tamoxifen in what is a rapidly changing therapeutic environment.

### First-line endocrine treatment of breast cancer: aromatase inhibitor or antioestrogen? [^115Wnigf]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Letrozole

Letrozole was compared with tamoxifen in a randomised trial of 907 patients, whose tumours were receptor positive or unknown. Recurrence during adjuvant antioestrogen therapy or within the following 12 months or prior endocrine therapy for advanced disease precluded enrollment, and only one prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease was allowed. Letrozole treatment was found to be superior to tamoxifen, with a median TTP of 41 weeks vs 26 weeks. The median time to treatment failure, overall response rate and clinical benefit rate were significantly better in favour of letrozole (40 vs 25 weeks; 30 vs 20%, P = 0.0006 and 49 vs 38%, P = 0.001). At a recent update after a median of 32 months of follow-up, the superiority of letrozole over tamoxifen in the TTP (median, 9.4 vs 6.0 months, respectively; P < 0.0001), time to treatment failure (median, 9 vs 5.7 months, respectively; P < 0.0001), overall objective response rate (32 vs 21%, respectively; P = 0.0002) and overall clinical benefit were confirmed. Interestingly, the total duration of endocrine therapy ('time to chemotherapy') was significantly longer for first-line letrozole than for first-line tamoxifen (median, 16 months vs 9 months, P = 0.005). Similarly, the time to worsening of Karnofsky performance score was also significantly delayed with letrozole compared with tamoxifen, underscoring the palliative benefits of a first-line AI approach.

Exemestane

Exemestane has been compared with tamoxifen in 117 previously untreated breast cancers with either positive or unknown hormone receptors in a randomised phase 2 EORTC study. The overall response rate was better for exemestane than tamoxifen (44.6 vs 14.3%). Time to progression has not been analysed, as this is the primary end point of a Phase 3 extension of this ongoing study.

### Aromatase inhibition reduces insulin sensitivity in healthy men [^112btcra]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, we have shown that aromatase inhibition with anastrozole impairs insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose disposal, without affecting hepatic glucose production or lipolysis. An effect on the primary end point for the study was achieved despite recruiting 17 of a target 20 participants.

Previous investigators assessed effects of letrozole administered for 4 weeks in 18 healthy men (divided into younger and older age groups) and reported improved insulin sensitivity, inferred from changes in fasting glucose and insulin, but only in younger subjects. A subsequent study by the same investigators assessed letrozole effects over a 1-week period either alone or in combination with transdermal estradiol; hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies suggested improved insulin sensitivity in the letrozole group (although only after correction for fat free mass) but not in the group receiving concomitant estradiol replacement. However, it is difficult to conclude that estradiol suppression is metabolically advantageous in men because supraphysiological estradiol replacement resulted in LH suppression and consequently subnormal T concentrations. Furthermore, letrozole has been associated with significant, sustained reductions in both morning plasma cortisol and ACTH-stimulated cortisol, an effect that is not observed with anastrozole. It is not therefore possible to exclude an effect on glucocorticoid signaling as a mediator of any effect observed with letrozole. No previous study of the metabolic effects of aromatase inhibitors has used gold-standard stable isotope tracer euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp methodology. Other studies relying upon fasting glucose and insulin measurements have failed to demonstrate an effect of aromatase inhibition upon insulin sensitivity, but this may reflect the lower sensitivity of the methodology.

### Aromatase inhibitors: are there differences between steroidal and nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors and do they matter? [^115RtpTE]. The Oncologist (2008). Low credibility.

Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are approved for use in both early- and advanced-stage breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Although the currently approved "third-generation" AIs all powerfully inhibit estrogen synthesis, they may be subdivided into steroidal and nonsteroidal inhibitors, which interact with the aromatase enzyme differently. Nonsteroidal AIs bind noncovalently and reversibly to the aromatase protein, whereas steroidal AIs may bind covalently and irreversibly to the aromatase enzyme. The steroidal AI exemestane may exert androgenic effects, but the clinical relevance of this has yet to be determined. Switching between steroidal and nonsteroidal AIs produces modest additional clinical benefits, suggesting partial noncrossresistance between the classes of inhibitor. In these circumstances, the response rates to the second AI have generally been low; additional research is needed regarding the optimal sequence of AIs. To date, clinical studies suggest that combining an estrogen-receptor blocker with a nonsteroidal AI does not improve efficacy, while combination with a steroidal AI has not been evaluated. Results from head-to-head trials comparing steroidal and nonsteroidal AIs will determine whether meaningful clinical differences in efficacy or adverse events exist between the classes of AI. This review summarizes the available evidence regarding known differences and evaluates their potential clinical impact.

### Letrozole and ribociclib (Kisqali Femara CO-PACK) [^111d7fWv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Ribociclib is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6. These kinases are activated upon binding to D-cyclins and are downstream of signaling pathways, which lead to cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation. The cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex regulates cell cycle progression through phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb).

In vitro, ribociclib decreased pRb phosphorylation, resulting in arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and reduced cell proliferation in breast cancer-derived lines. In vivo, treatment with single agent ribociclib in a rat xenograft model with human tumor cells led to decreased tumor volumes, which correlated with inhibition of pRb phosphorylation.

Letrozole is a nonsteroidal competitive inhibitor of the aromatase enzyme system by competitively binding to the heme of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of estrogen biosynthesis in all tissues. In postmenopausal women, estrogens are mainly derived from the action of the aromatase enzyme, which converts adrenal androgens (primarily androstenedione and testosterone) to estrone and estradiol. The suppression of estrogen biosynthesis in peripheral tissues and in the cancer tissue itself can therefore be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme.

In studies, using patient-derived estrogen receptor positive breast cancer xenograft models, combination of ribociclib and antiestrogen (e.g., letrozole) therapies resulted in increased tumor growth inhibition compared to each drug alone.

### Epigenetic mechanisms in breast cancer therapy and resistance [^117QQq3D]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fulvestrant disrupts ERα dimerization and nuclear localization, resulting in its degradation and a complete block of ERα-mediated transcriptional activity. Fulvestrant-mediated immobilization of ERα in the nuclear matrix is associated with the repression of transcription and subsequent degradation of ERα. A phase III trial with luminal breast cancer patients who did not previously receive hormone therapy demonstrated that fulvestrant treatment results in superior progression-free survival compared with AIs. Nevertheless, poor physicochemical properties and the need for muscular administration limit its clinical potential. Currently, new orally available SERDs and a novel group of ERα-targeting agents that combine SERM and SERD features are under clinical development(Table 1).

Table 1
Targeting epigenetic mechanisms deregulated in endocrine-resistant breast cancer as new therapeutic avenues.

In post-menopausal women, E2 is no longer synthesized in the ovaries. Instead, it is produced from the aromatization of testosterone and androstenedione in several tissues including the liver, subcutaneous fat, and the stroma surrounding normal breast cells, as well as by breast epithelial cells and fibroblasts of primary breast tumors. AIs act to reduce elevated E2 levels in breast cancer tissue through the inhibition of aromatase activity and can be classified as steroidal or non-steroidal. While steroidal AIs bind irreversibly with aromatase, non-steroidal AIs bind competitively and reversibly with aromatase. Two reversible non-steroidal AIs (letrozole, anastrozole) and one irreversible steroidal AI (exemestane) are currently approved for clinical use. Compared to tamoxifen, which is typically prescribed for pre-menopausal breast cancer patients, fulvestrant and AIs are mainly reserved for post-menopausal cases alone or in combination with other endocrine or targeted agents such as CDK4/6 inhibitors.

### Are all aromatase inhibitors the same? A review of controlled clinical trials in breast cancer [^113CGwpM]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Five years of tamoxifen therapy has been the standard of care for the adjuvant treatment of estrogen receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer for many years and was the first hormonal treatment for postmenopausal women with advanced or metastatic disease. The third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) anastrozole, exemestane, and letrozole offer new treatment options, although their efficacy has not been compared directly in randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in any breast cancer treatment setting.

Objective

The goal of this article was to review the results of recent randomized, controlled clinical trials of the AIs in the settings of neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and advance d/metastatic breast cancer.

Methods

MEDLINE was searched for descriptions of randomized, controlled clinical trials published from 1990 to 2005 using the terms breast cancer, aromatase, aromatase inhibitor, anastrozole, exemestane, and letrozole. Abstracts from the proceedings of several oncology meetings held between 2001 and 2005 were searched to capture relevant emerging data.

Results

In 2 Phase III trials comparing an AI with tamoxifen for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women, disease-free survival was significantly improved with anastrozole and letrozole compared with tamoxifen as initial adjuvant treatment (P = 0.01 and P = 0.003, respectively). A switch to either anastrozole (2 Phase III trials) or exemestane (1 Phase III trial) after 2 to 3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy was more effective in reducing the risk of recurrence than continued tamoxifen therapy (P = 0.006, P < 0.002, and P < 0.001, respectively); data on switching to letrozole are expected soon. In another Phase III trial, letrozole was found to improve disease-free survival in the extended adjuvant setting (P ≤ 0.001) and was the only AI consistently more effective than tamoxifen in the neoadjuvant setting. In 3 Phase III studies (1 letrozole vs tamoxifen, 2 anastrozole vs tamoxifen), both anastrozole and letrozole were more efficacious than tamoxifen in the first-line setting, and some patients receiving letrozole had better overall response rates compared with those receiving anastrozole in the second-line setting (19.1% vs 12.3%, respectively; P = 0.013). In a patient-preference study, those receiving letrozole reported fewer adverse events than those receiving anastrozole (43% vs 65%; P < 0.003), and more patients preferred letrozole to anastrozole (68% vs 32%; P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Currently, anastrozole and letrozole are associated with the most complete data over the breast cancer care continuum, with efficacy in early-stage, locally advanced, and metastatic disease. In-direct comparisons suggest stronger evidence for the use of letrozole compared with other AIs for breast cancer in postmenopausal women who require estrogen-deprivation therapy. Data from randomized, double-blind comparative studies will help clarify the differences between AIs.

### Aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer: different structures, same effects? [^114iLVKU]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have become the first-choice endocrine drugs for postmenopausal breast cancer patients since they are associated with superior activity and better general tolerability when compared with tamoxifen both in the adjuvant and metastatic settings. As a consequence, the question is no more if a postmenopausal patient should have AIs as part of her adjuvant treatment, but when should it be started or which one should be preferentially used. Newer compounds, generally defined as third-generation AIs, are biochemically more selective and potent when compared with older ones, and they also show superior clinical activity. As yet, no large randomised study has been published comparing the three third-generation AIs on the market. Nevertheless, both laboratory and clinical data suggest that the steroidal (exemestane) and non-steroidal (anastrozole, letrozole) AIs may have slightly different toxicity profiles, probably due to the low androgenic action of the formers. While waiting for randomised data on clinical efficacy of third-generation AIs, such differences may help select the best drug in elderly patients with a low cumulative risk of relapse and a significant amount of co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease or osteoporosis.

### Letrozole therapy alone or in sequence with tamoxifen in women with breast cancer [^111YzutX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

The aromatase inhibitor letrozole, as compared with tamoxifen, improves disease-free survival among postmenopausal women with receptor-positive early breast cancer. It is unknown whether sequential treatment with tamoxifen and letrozole is superior to letrozole therapy alone.

Methods

In this randomized, phase 3, double-blind trial of the treatment of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women, we randomly assigned women to receive 5 years of tamoxifen monotherapy, 5 years of letrozole monotherapy, or 2 years of treatment with one agent followed by 3 years of treatment with the other. We compared the sequential treatments with letrozole monotherapy among 6182 women and also report a protocol-specified updated analysis of letrozole versus tamoxifen monotherapy in 4922 women.

Results

At a median follow-up of 71 months after randomization, disease-free survival was not significantly improved with either sequential treatment as compared with letrozole alone (hazard ratio for tamoxifen followed by letrozole, 1.05; 99% confidence interval [CI] 0.84 to 1.32; hazard ratio for letrozole followed by tamoxifen, 0.96; 99% CI, 0.76 to 1.21). There were more early relapses among women who were assigned to tamoxifen followed by letrozole than among those who were assigned to letrozole alone. The updated analysis of monotherapy showed that there was a nonsignificant difference in overall survival between women assigned to treatment with letrozole and those assigned to treatment with tamoxifen (hazard ratio for letrozole, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.02; P = 0.08). The rate of adverse events was as expected on the basis of previous reports of letrozole and tamoxifen therapy.

Conclusions

Among postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer, sequential treatment with letrozole and tamoxifen, as compared with letrozole monotherapy, did not improve disease-free survival. The difference in overall survival with letrozole monotherapy and tamoxifen monotherapy was not statistically significant. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00004205.)

### Differences between the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole – of clinical importance? [^114Yfo9b]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Among third-generation AIs, letrozole seems to produce the most extensive estrogen suppression. Results from an intrapatient crossover study revealed that letrozole (2.5 mg daily) consistently resulted in more potent aromatase inhibition compared with 1.0 mg anastrozole. In PMW undergoing primary treatment for locally advanced ER+/PgR+ breast cancer, letrozole suppressed pretreatment tumour levels of estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), and estrone sulfate (E1S) by 97.6, 90.7, and 90.1%, respectively (Figure 2A). This level of suppression is superior to that previously reported for anastrozole using the same methods: 89.0, 83.4, and 72.9%, respectively. Direct comparisons of reanalyzed samples also found superior suppression of plasma estrogen levels with letrozole compared with anastrozole, E2 (average suppression by 95.2 vs 92.8% P = 0.018), E1 (98.8% suppression vs 96.3% P = 0.003), and E1S (98.9% suppression vs 95.3% P = 0.003) (Figure 2B). Recently, confirmed that letrozole reduces plasma estrogen levels to a greater degree than does anastrozole at clinical doses. The results of these two translational studies, and, raise the question of whether differences in potency translate into differences of clinical importance. Although it has been postulated by some authors that aromatase inhibition above a defined level (f. eks. 90% inhibition) might not increase the clinical efficacy, the lessons we learned from clinical studies through the last 3 decades suggest that estrogen suppression and clinical efficacy are tightly correlated also above 90% aromatase inhibition in vivo. One example is the head-to-head comparison of aminoglutethimide (aromatase inhibition: 90%) and letrozole (aromatase inhibition: > 99%) showing clearly superiority of letrozole in the setting of advanced breast cancer. However, because of the very different side-effect profiles of aminoglutethimide and letrozole when given in the clinically established doses, with the latter being much less toxic, an influence of compliance problems during aminoglutethimide treatment on the study results cannot be excluded.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) ovulation induction — letrozole recommendations specify that letrozole should be the first-line pharmacological treatment for ovulation induction in infertile anovulatory women with PCOS, with no other infertility factors. The use of letrozole is still off- label in many countries. Letrozole should not be given where there is any possibility of a pre-existing pregnancy, though there is no evidence for increased teratogenicity compared to other ovulation induction agents.

### First-line endocrine treatment of breast cancer: aromatase inhibitor or antioestrogen? [^114jbhmp]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Antioestrogens and AIs have distinct mechanisms of action

Tamoxifen (antioestrogen) and aromatase inhibition (oestrogen deprivation) are distinct approaches to oestrogen-dependent breast cancer and efficacy, tolerability and toxicity differences stem from these pharmacological fundamentals. Unlike tamoxifen, AIs do not exhibit intrinsic hormonal properties but affect oestrogen receptor (ER) function indirectly by blocking the conversion of adrenal androgens to oestrogen in the peripheral (i.e. nonovarian) tissues of postmenopausal women, including the breast itself. When deprived of oestrogens, ERs cannot bind to DNA, and are therefore incapable of direct involvement in signalling. As a consequence, the side effects of AIs stem from oestrogen deprivation – for example, bone loss and atrophic vaginitis. In contrast, tamoxifen has an intrinsic endocrine action by binding to ERs with high affinity and activating ER dimerisation and DNA binding. Tamoxifen-bound ER has altered gene-regulatory properties referred to as SERM. In several normal tissues, tamoxifen-bound ER is active and promotes, for example, bone mineralisation and endometrial proliferation. In these instances, tamoxifen is acting as an 'oestrogen mimic' or receptor agonist. As a consequence, the serious side effects of tamoxifen are remarkably similar to oestrogen replacement therapy (ERT) – venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, stroke and endometrial cancer. Like ERT, maintenance of bone mineral density is an advantage of tamoxifen. These agonist effects may, however, limit efficacy. Aromatase inhibitors do not interact with ER; so potential resistance mechanisms related to SERM agonist effects on tumour cells are avoided. Preclinical models with MCF7 xenografts engineered to overexpress aromatase, as well as models of tamoxifen-dependent tumour growth, support this explanation for the therapeutic advantage of AIs.

First-line therapy for advanced disease

This discussion will focus on anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane. Fadrozole, a second-generation nonsteroidal AI, has been shown to be equivalent to tamoxifen but inferior to letrozole in advanced breast cancer, and will not be discussed further, as drug approval is restricted to Japan.

### The potency and clinical efficacy of aromatase inhibitors across the breast cancer continuum [^114mQah1]. Annals of Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

The strategy of using estrogen suppression to treat breast cancer led to the development of aromatase inhibitors, including the third-generation nonsteroidal compounds anastrozole and letrozole, and the steroidal compound exemestane. Aromatase inhibitors potently inhibit aromatase activity and also suppress estrogen levels in plasma and tissue. In clinical studies in postmenopausal women with breast cancer, third-generation aromatase inhibitors were shown superior to tamoxifen for the treatment of metastatic disease. Studies of adjuvant therapy with aromatase inhibitors include (i) head-to-head studies of 5 years of the aromatase inhibitor versus 5 years of tamoxifen monotherapy; (ii) sequential therapy of 2–3 years of tamoxifen followed by an aromatase inhibitor (or the opposite sequence) versus 5 years of tamoxifen monotherapy; (iii) extended therapy with an aromatase inhibitor after 5 years of tamoxifen; and (iv) sequential therapy with an aromatase inhibitor versus aromatase inhibitor monotherapy. Recent results from the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination and Breast International Group 1–98 trials advocate using an aromatase inhibitor upfront. This article examines the clinical data with aromatase inhibitors, following a brief summary of their pharmacology.

### Anastrozole has an association between degree of estrogen suppression and outcomes in early breast cancer and is a ligand for estrogen receptor α [^114bmxr9]. Clinical Cancer Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine if the degree of estrogen suppression with aromatase inhibitors (AI: anastrozole, exemestane, letrozole) is associated with efficacy in early-stage breast cancer, and to examine for differences in the mechanism of action between the three AIs.

Experimental Design

Matched case-control studies [247 matched sets from MA.27 (anastrozole vs. exemestane) and PreFace (letrozole) trials] were undertaken to assess whether estrone (E1) or estradiol (E2) concentrations after 6 months of adjuvant therapy were associated with risk of an early breast cancer event (EBCE). Preclinical laboratory studies included luciferase activity, cell proliferation, radio-labeled ligand estrogen receptor binding, surface plasmon resonance ligand receptor binding, and nuclear magnetic resonance assays.

Results

Women with E1 ≥ 1.3 pg/mL and E2 ≥ 0.5 pg/mL after 6 months of AI treatment had a 2.2-fold increase in risk (P = 0.0005) of an EBCE, and in the anastrozole subgroup, the increase in risk of an EBCE was 3.0-fold (P = 0.001). Preclinical laboratory studies examined mechanisms of action in addition to aromatase inhibition and showed that only anastrozole could directly bind to estrogen receptor α (ERα), activate estrogen response element-dependent transcription, and stimulate growth of an aromatase-deficient CYP19A1-/- T47D breast cancer cell line.

Conclusions

This matched case-control clinical study revealed that levels of estrone and estradiol above identified thresholds after 6 months of adjuvant anastrozole treatment were associated with increased risk of an EBCE. Preclinical laboratory studies revealed that anastrozole, but not exemestane or letrozole, is a ligand for ERα. These findings represent potential steps towards individualized anastrozole therapy.

### Fulvestrant: an oestrogen receptor antagonist with a novel mechanism of action [^114C8HAt]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

THE NEED FOR ALTERNATIVE ENDOCRINE THERAPIES

In patients with hormone-sensitive advanced breast cancer, endocrine therapy is better tolerated than cytotoxic chemotherapy, while being equally effective. However, there are specific risks associated with endocrine treatments. For example, tamoxifen treatment is associated with a 2–4-fold increased risk of endometrial cancer, attributable to its oestrogen-like, partial agonist activity. The 'Arimidex', Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial showed a significantly greater incidence of ischaemic cerebrovascular events (2.1 vs 1.0%; P = 0.0006) and venous thromboembolic events (3.5 vs 2.1%; P = 0.0006) with tamoxifen, compared with the aromatase inhibitor (AI) anastrozole. A number of other antioestrogens grouped together under the term SERMS have also been associated with partial agonist properties.

The AIs letrozole and exemestane may have an unfavourable effect on plasma lipid levels, and androgenic side effects have been reported with exemestane. Megestrol acetate, historically the most widely used progestin, is associated with weight gain and fluid retention and the high-dose oestrogen diethylstilboestrol is commonly associated with nausea, oedema, vaginal bleeding and cardiac problems.

The sequential use of well-tolerated hormonal therapies has become common clinical practice for the treatment of advanced breast cancer, where maintenance of quality of life is a primary aim. For this to be effective, it is necessary that the mechanism of action of newer agents differ from those previously used. This prerequisite prevents the sequential use of therapies belonging to the same class, and that therefore demonstrates cross-resistance with each other. Therefore, for some time, a search has been under way for an antioestrogen that lacks partial agonist properties and that has a mechanism of action different from tamoxifen.

### Should aromatase inhibitors be used as initial adjuvant treatment or sequenced after tamoxifen? [^115bQYeG]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Our assumptions on carryover do not have a major effect for the first 10 years of follow-up, except for the extended treatment strategies, which would appear more favourable if there was no carryover. Of course, the duration of treatment is longer here, and a fairer comparison would be against upfront or sequencing strategies with the same duration of treatment. If this were done, the model again predicts that an AI upfront strategy is optimal. Optimal duration of treatment with an AI is a key outstanding question for which there are currently no data. Hopefully this will be addressed in future trials.

Currently, there are also no data for the key comparison of an AI upfront vs sequencing after tamoxifen. The BIG 1–98 trial is scheduled to provide such data in 2008 for letrozole and the TEAM study will have data for exemestane, but this is likely to mature even later.

These gaps in our knowledge provide the rationale for the modelling we have done, but again we emphasize that models should be used as interim measures to guide current thinking and practice. They will be superseded by the actual trial data once it becomes available.

Acceptability and side effects are also part of an overall evaluation. Overall, the AIs are better tolerated than tamoxifen, with fewer hot flushes, gynaecologic symptoms, and thromboembolic events, but more joint symptoms and fractures. For most women, this would favour using an AI initially, but the differential side-effect profiles may lead to different decisions in individual cases.

### Differences between the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole – of clinical importance? [^111UKfAq]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Influence on distant metastasis

Indirect information from the ATAC and BIG 1–98 trials indicates that differences in clinical efficacy exist between anastrozole and letrozole in the initial adjuvant setting. Both AIs improve DFS compared with tamoxifen in patients with HR+ disease. The most common type of recurrence seen 2 to 3 years post surgery is DM, a well-recognised predictor of breast cancer survival. Only letrozole has been shown to significantly reduce early DM events (30% reduction in the risk of DM at 2 years). A significant reduction in DM events was also seen with anastrozole in HR+ patients but only at 100 months of follow-up. In contrast, exploratory analysis of the ATAC trial confirmed that most of the early benefit with anastrozole was not in the prevention of distant disease; at 2.5 years, there was a 7% benefit in the prevention of DM.

### Aromatase inhibition in the treatment of advanced breast cancer: is there a relationship between potency and clinical efficacy? [^111csLmP]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

The third-generation AIs are more potent inhibitors of the aromatase enzyme and cause greater oestrogen suppression than older agents such as aminoglutethimide, fadrozole and formestane. This is linked to an increase in the clinical efficacy of the third-generation AIs relative to the previous standard comparators in both the second- and first-line settings. In contrast, small changes in potency between anastrozole and letrozole are not associated with clinically relevant differences in their efficacy in the treatment of hormone-sensitive advanced breast cancer, suggesting the existence of a threshold of oestrogen suppression above which no further improvements in clinical efficacy can be gained.

Aromatase inhibitors in metastatic disease

The role of aromatase inhibitors in metastatic disease has been reviewed elsewhere. However, the picture has changed in recent years, since today most patients with metastatic, ER-positive breast cancer have already experienced progression on adjuvant aromatase inhibition.

While previous studies revealed the superiority of aromatase inhibitors compared with tamoxifen, the fact that most patients with ER+ tumors that relapse today have received an aromatase inhibitor for adjuvant therapy changes the scenario. As for patients relapsing say > 1 year following termination of adjuvant therapy, re-implementation of the aromatase inhibitor may be a reasonable choice. In contrast, patients relapsing on treatment or shortly after terminating adjuvant therapy need alternative treatment options. Note that tamoxifen as well as fulvestrant may have antitumor effects in patients where aromatase inhibitors fail, and the steroidal compound exemestane has been shown effective among patients becoming resistant to a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. Interestingly, a randomized trial demonstrated a similar efficacy of fulvestrant and exemestane among patients where anastrozole or letrozole fail. Notably, most previous studies administered fulvestrant at a dose of 250 mg injections. While a later study revealed benefit from fulvestrant 500 mg injections compared with anastrozole in first line, the data on fulvestrant 500 mg are not ample. Therefore, the data are insufficient to conclude that fulvestrant is superior to aromatase inhibitors, both in the first- and second-line setting. However, fulvestrant is generally well tolerated in this patient population, and the adherence to therapy is ensured by the depot i.m. injections in patients where poor compliance could be a problem.

Currently, there is no general consensus regarding optimal sequencing of endocrine therapy for metastatic breast cancer. However, for patients with metastatic ER+ breast cancer, it remains important to extend endocrine treatment for as long as their disease responds, prior to implementing chemotherapy.

### Mechanisms of aromatase inhibitor resistance [^114qjgLw]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2015). Medium credibility.

Oestrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)) breast cancer is a major cause of cancer death in women. Although aromatase inhibitors suppress the function of ER and reduce the risk of recurrence, therapeutic resistance is common and essentially inevitable in advanced disease. This Review considers both genomic and cell biological explanations as to why ER(+) breast cancer cells persist, progress and cause an incurable, lethal, systemic disease. The design and outcomes of clinical trials are considered with the perspective that resistance mechanisms are heterogeneous, and therefore biomarker and somatic mutation-based stratification and eligibility will be essential for improvements in patient outcomes.

Direct comparison of the third-generation aromatase inhibitors: anastrozole vs letrozole as second-line therapy

Anastrozole (1 mg o.d.) and letrozole (2.5 mg o.d.) were compared as second-line treatment for advanced breast cancer with hormone receptor-positive or unknown receptor status in postmenopausal women who had progressed on tamoxifen in a multicentre, open-label, randomised Phase III–IV study. The primary end point was TTP and secondary end points included OR rate, response duration, duration of clinical benefit, TTF, time to response and overall survival (OS).

A total of 713 postmenopausal patients were randomly allocated to either letrozole 2.5 mg o.d. (n = 356) or anastrozole 1 mg o.d. (n = 357). Patient characteristics were well balanced between treatment groups. A total of 48% of patients had hormone receptor-positive tumours. Efficacy end points are shown in Table 3

Table 3
Efficacy data in patients randomised to anastrozole or letrozole (Rose et al, 2002). In the overall population, anastrozole was similar to letrozole for TTP (P = 0.920), TTF (P = 0.761) and OS (P = 0.624). The only differences between anastrozole and letrozole were for OR rate in both the overall population and the unknown receptor status subgroup, which were higher in the letrozole vs the anastrozole group (overall population: 19.1 vs 12.3%, odds ratio = 1.70, P = 0.014; unknown receptor status subgroup: 20.8 vs 8.4%, respectively). However, in patients with confirmed hormone receptor-positive tumours there was no difference in OR between anastrozole and letrozole (28/167 [16.8%] vs 30/173 [17.3%], respectively). As the overall population included patients with unknown receptor status, it is possible that in this unknown receptor group there was a greater number of patients randomised to letrozole who had hormone receptor-positive tumours and who would respond to letrozole. If this was the case, it could account for the higher OR rate with letrozole in the overall population. Presently, the number of patients with unknown receptor status in each group has not been published. Furthermore, no results for TTP in the hormone receptor-positive population have been published to date, so the relative efficacy of anastrozole and letrozole for this end point is uncertain.

Direct comparison of third-generation aromatase inhibitors, anastrozole and letrozole: oestrogen suppression

The study in which anastrozole was directly compared with letrozole was a small-scale, randomised, double-blind, cross-over trial. In all, 12 postmenopausal women with oestrogen receptor-positive metastatic tumours suitable for treatment with AIs were enroled into the study. Six patients received 6 weeks of anastrozole (1 mg o.d.) followed by 6 weeks of letrozole (2.5 mg o.d.), while the other six received 6 weeks of letrozole followed by 6 weeks of anastrozole. Compared with anastrozole, letrozole showed small but significantly increased suppression of oestrone and oestradiol sulphate concentrations (Figure 3

Figure 3
Plasma oestrogen levels in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.), but as discussed above, there was no difference in suppression of oestradiol.

The Femara anastrozole clinical evaluation trial (FACE)

Although the ATAC and BIG 1–98 trials have provided an extensive data set for anastrozole and letrozole in early breast cancer, no head-to-head trial of these two AIs has been conducted in this setting. The ongoing FACE trial was designed to prospectively address potential efficacy and safety differences. This phase III open-label, randomised, multicenter study includes node-positive patients randomised to receive either early adjuvant letrozole or anastrozole. The primary objective is to compare DFS at 5 years. Secondary objectives are to assess safety, OS, time to DM, and time to contralateral breast cancer. The trial was designed to differentiate between the two drugs in the shortest possible time by enrolling patients at increased risk of early recurrence of breast cancer, so that the number of events required to initiate analysis will be obtained more quickly. The results may help refine treatment strategies for PMW with breast cancer.

### The potency and clinical efficacy of aromatase inhibitors across the breast cancer continuum [^116tmFir]. Annals of Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

pharmacology and in vitro aromatase inhibition

Aromatase inhibitors may be separated into two distinct classes: steroidal and nonsteroidal compounds. Characteristically, steroidal inhibitors bind to the substrate-binding site in an irreversible manner, leading to degradation of the protein–drug complex. The exact binding mechanism is still a subject of research. The two steroidal compounds extensively evaluated for clinical use were the second-generation compound formestane (4-hydroxyadrostenedione) and the third-generation compound exemestane.

In contrast to steroidal inhibitors, nonsteroidal compounds bind to the P450 site of the aromatase complex. These compounds may be divided into compounds of the aminoglutethimide class and those of the imidazole/triazole class. Apart from aminoglutethimide itself, the aminoglutethimide class includes compounds such as rogletimide as well as the separate-enantiomer of aminoglutethimide; due to toxicity, none of these compounds are in clinical use. The imidazole/triazole class includes the second-generation compound fadrozole and the third-generation compounds anastrozole and letrozole.

In vitro evaluations of aromatase inhibitors have been carried out using placental as well as ovarian microsomal fractions, breast cancer homogenates, and breast-derived fibroblasts. Briefly, the results may be summarized as follows: all second- and third-generation compounds express a much higher potency compared with aminoglutethimide in experimental systems. Second, the relative potency in general is higher for compounds of the imidazole/triazole class compared with steroidal compounds, consistent with the need for higher drug doses of the latter compounds in the clinic. Third, comparing the third-generation triazole derivatives anastrozole and letrozole, letrozole showed a significantly higher potency with respect to aromatase inhibition in breast homogenates and breast fibroblasts. Finally, while in general the novel third-generation compounds possess a higher potency compared with the second-generation compounds, some in vitro studies actually revealed a somewhat higher potency for fadrozole compared with letrozole. This underscores the fact that in vivo efficacy depends not on direct potency alone but is also subject to influence by other parameters, in particular pharmacokinetics.

Differences in the mechanism and potency of AI-induced estrogen suppression

In vitro results

Several studies evaluating the reduction of aromatisation in vitro have compared the potency of third-generation AIs.used two ex-vivo assays of aromatase activity in particular fractions of breast cancer tissue and in mammary fibroblast cell cultures. Aromatase activity was effectively inhibited in both particular fractions of breast cancers and cultures of mammary adipose tissue fibroblasts. In another study by, immunohistochemical analyses revealed that treatment with anastrozole or letrozole resulted in significant decreases in progesterone receptor (PgR) expression, a marker for estrogen function.demonstrated that in rodent cells, normal human adipose fibroblasts, and human cancer cell lines, letrozole was consistently 10–30 times more potent than anastrozole in its ability to inhibit intracellular aromatase. It is important to note, however, that in vitro assays may not accurately reflect the degree of inhibition produced/achieved in vivo.

Animal models

An intratumoural aromatase model system in mice was developed to mimic postmenopausal ER+ breast cancer. This animal model takes into account the importance of locally produced (intratumoural) aromatase, as well as the fact that breast cancer occurs mainly in PMW. Although these mice (ovariectomised, athymic, and immunosuppressed nude mice) have no significant peripheral estrogen production capability and no adrenal androgen production, AI efficacy is assessed after inoculation with human breast carcinoma cells transfected with the human aromatase gene (MCF-7 arom cells). Using this aromatase xenograft model, letrozole was shown to be more effective than tamoxifen in suppressing breast tumour growth without causing endometrial proliferation. Additionally, tumours continuing to progress on tamoxifen therapy remained sensitive to second-line therapy with letrozole.

### Plasma letrozole concentrations in postmenopausal women with breast cancer are associated with CYP2A6 genetic variants, body mass index, and age [^114ZMNHL]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

The associations between plasma letrozole concentrations and CYP2A6 and CYP3A5 genetic variants were tested in the Exemestane and Letrozole Pharmacogenomics (ELPH) trial. ELPH is a multicenter, open-label prospective clinical trial in women randomly assigned (n≈250 in each arm) to receive 2 years of treatment with either oral letrozole (2.5 mg/day) or oral exemestane (25 mg/day). CYP2A6 and CYP3A showed effects on letrozole metabolism in vitro. DNA samples were genotyped for variants in the CYP2A6 and CYP3A5 genes. Plasma letrozole concentrations showed high interpatient variability (> 10-fold) and were associated significantly with CYP2A6 genotypes (P < 0.0001), body mass index (BMI) (P < 0.0001), and age (P = 0.0035). However, CYP3A5 genotypes showed no association with plasma letrozole concentrations. These data suggest that CYP2A6 is the principal clearance mechanism for letrozole in vivo. CYP2A6 metabolic status, along with BMI and age, may serve as a biomarker of the efficacy of letrozole treatment or a predictor of adverse effects.

### Differences between the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole – of clinical importance? [^1115qWZJ]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Adjuvant endocrine therapy has an important role in postmenopausal women (PMW) with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. Efficacy of anti-hormonal treatment of early breast cancer is based on the fact that estrogens may stimulate the growth of residual cancer cells or contribute to the initiation of a new primary cancer over time.

Selective estrogen-receptor (ER) modulators, such as tamoxifen, have been the gold standard of care for women with HR+ breast cancer for the last 30 years. Tamoxifen therapy for 5 years can reduce the odds of recurrence and death by 47 and 26%, respectively.

Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have now replaced tamoxifen as the standard of care for adjuvant endocrine therapy in the treatment of PMW with hormone-sensitive breast cancer. Three generations of AIs have been developed during the last 3 decades. Of these, the third-generation AIs have more favorable tolerability profiles and are more selective and/or potent compared with first- and second-generation agents. There are two broad categories of third-generation AIs. The reversible non-steroidal agents include anastrozole and letrozole (triazole derivatives). The third agent, exemestane, is an androstenedione derivative that functions as an irreversible steroidal inhibitor (or inactivator). The triazole derivatives bind to the cytochrome P-450 component of the aromatase enzyme, whereas the steroidal compound exemestane binds to the substrate-binding pocket of the aromatase enzyme, leading to its degradation (Figure 1). AIs are now widely used as first-line therapy for PMW with hormone-sensitive early breast cancer, as first-line therapy for metastatic disease, and as second-line agents in cases of tamoxifen resistance. This review emphasises the potency and emerging efficacy differences between third-generation AIs and places particular emphasis upon comparisons between anastrozole and letrozole.

### Aromatase inhibition 2013: clinical state of the art and questions that remain to be solved [^113GMZEi]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Based on the studies presented, aromatase inhibitors have now become standard adjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal breast cancer patients. However, the data summarized above raised the question of whether aromatase inhibitor monotherapy, or sequential treatment, is the optimal strategy. In the four-arm BIG 1–98 study (Table 2), 1548 patients were randomized to tamoxifen for 2 years followed by letrozole for 3 years while 2563 patients had letrozole monotherapy. At a median follow-up of 71 months from randomization, disease-free as well as overall survival were non-significantly inferior in the crossover compared with the monotherapy arm (hazard ratio (HR) of 1.05 and 1.13 respectively). Interestingly, a benefit was observed among node-positive but not among node-negative patients. In the TEAM study, tamoxifen for 2.5–3 years followed by exemestane for a total treatment duration of 5 years was compared with exemestane monotherapy. With a total of 9766 patients analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and with a median follow-up of 5.1 years, no difference in disease-free survival between patients in the two arms was recorded.

As for the BIG 1–98 study, another interesting comparison was made between patients treated with letrozole upfront for 2 years followed by tamoxifen for 3 years (n = 1540) vs letrozole monotherapy (n = 1546). Here again, no difference in outcome between patients in the two treatment arms was recorded.

Taken together, this evidence advocates the use of aromatase inhibitors in the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women. However, so far, there are no strong scientific arguments in favor of either sequential or monotherapy compared with the alternative treatment strategy. Considering the cost per quality-adjusted life year gained related to each strategy, notably this depends on the relapse risk but, in addition, patient age at diagnosis.

### Aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer in postmenopausal women [^115HS6SJ]. The Oncologist (2004). Low credibility.

Third-generation aromatase inhibitors are potent inhibitors of the aromatase enzyme, which catalyzes the last step in estrogen biosynthesis. These agents are active against breast cancer in hormone-naïve postmenopausal women and in women who have experienced failure of tamoxifen or failure of tamoxifen plus other hormonal therapy. There are two types of aromatase inhibitors, irreversible steroidal activators (e.g., exemestane) and reversible nonsteroidal imidazole-based inhibitors (e.g., anastrozole, letrozole). Recent data suggest that some women who experience failure of one type of aromatase inhibitor can subsequently derive benefit from the other type. The reason for this lack of cross-resistance is unknown. This finding of non-cross-resistance between steroidal aromatase activators and nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors offers the opportunity to increase the number of lines of hormone therapy before making the inevitable switch to more toxic chemotherapy, thus potentially improving quality of life for postmenopausal women with advanced disease. Data from postmenopausal women with advanced disease suggest that steroidal and nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors have similar tolerability profiles; however, emerging data suggest that there may be differences in their effects on end organs, which may become evident with longer term use, such as in the adjuvant or prevention settings. Steroidal agents appear to have beneficial effects on lipid and bone metabolism, whereas nonsteroidal agents may have neutral or unfavorable effects. These differences may be attributed to the androgenic effects of steroidal agents; clinical trials are currently under way to confirm these suspicions.

### Stopping treatment can reverse acquired resistance to letrozole [^1164NqLF]. Cancer Research (2008). Low credibility.

Using the intratumoral aromatase xenograft model, we have observed that despite long-lasting growth inhibition, tumors eventually begin to grow during continued letrozole treatment. In cells isolated from these long-term letrozole-treated tumors (LTLT-Ca), estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) levels were decreased, whereas signaling proteins in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade were up-regulated along with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2). In the current study, we evaluated the effect of discontinuing letrozole treatment on the growth of letrozole-resistant cells and tumors. The cells formed tumors equally well in the absence or presence of letrozole and had similar growth rates. After treatment was discontinued for 6 weeks, letrozole was administered again. Marked tumor regression was observed with this second course of letrozole treatment. Similarly, in MCF-7Ca xenografts, a 6-week break in letrozole treatment prolonged the responsiveness of the tumors to letrozole. To understand the mechanisms of this effect, LTLT-Ca cells were cultured in the absence of letrozole for 16 weeks. The resulting cell line (RLT-Ca) exhibited properties similar to MCF-7Ca cells. The cell growth was inhibited by letrozole and stimulated by estradiol. The expression of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was reduced and ERalpha and aromatase levels increased compared with LTLT-Ca cells and were similar to levels in MCF-7Ca cells. These results indicate that discontinuing treatment can reverse letrozole resistance. This could be a beneficial strategy to prolong responsiveness to aromatase inhibitors for patients with breast cancer.

### Lessons learned from a candidate gene study investigating aromatase inhibitor treatment outcome in breast cancer [^11113LuT]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer and leading cause of cancer death in womenaffecting both pre- and postmenopausal women. Most breast cancers (75%) express the estrogen receptor α (ERα) known to fuel tumor growth through estrogen signaling. Its presence renders early-stage breast cancers (i.e. tumors that have not spread beyond breast and nearby lymph nodes) amenable to endocrine therapy as the key therapeutic approach. Valid adjuvant options include the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen that competes with estrogen for the binding to ERα to block signaling, and the 3 rd generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane that remove estrogen from the signaling cascade by blocking its synthesis. AIs evolved as the standard-of-care for postmenopausal womenand have become an option for premenopausal women together with concurrent ovarian suppression. Their mechanism of action in lowering estrogen levels is particularly important for postmenopausal women, as AIs target the aromatase enzyme (CYP19A1) in peripheral nonglandular tissues (and breast tumor) to block the conversion of testosterone and androstenedione to 17β-estradiol and estrone, respectively. Current guidelines recommend 5 to 10 years of treatment to maximize risk-reduction. During this period and beyond, women continue to be at risk of recurrence and death that extends for decades following treatment. Therefore, additional biomarkers for the proper selection of drug treatment regimens are a high research priority.

Figure 6
A schematic representation of the Study of Letrozole Extension (SOLE) trial. SOLE is a phase III randomized clinical trial of continuous vs intermittent letrozole in postmenopausal women who had received 4–6 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy for hormone receptor (HR)- positive, lymph node- positive, early-stage breast cancer (BC). The rationale of SOLE trial was to test if 3-month treatment-free intervals during extended adjuvant endocrine therapy, would improve disease-free survival (DFS). The underpinning of this hypothesis is based on the theory that letrozole withdrawal for 3 months would allow a degree of estrogenic stimulation toward residual resistant disease, and subsequently the residual disease would become susceptible to letrozole reintroduction. The primary endpoint was DFS (randomization until invasive local, regional, distant recurrence or contralateral BC; 2nd malignancy; death). Postmenopausal women with prior 4–6 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy, were randomized into two arms: first arm is control which is continuous letrozole of 2.5 mg/daily for 5 years, and the second arm is intermittent letrozole of 2.5 mg/daily for 9 months in the first 1–4 years and fully at year 5. The trial concluded no difference in DFS among the two arms but for the first time pre-planned medication non-adherence is not harmful. This can provide a treatment-side effects and financial relief to many patients.

Our goal here is to propose a long-term therapeutic strategy that not only builds on past clinical experience, but also introduces a new strategic concept for adjuvant therapy to improve patient care globally. The new information from the SOLE trial is a first step forward. Firstly, the fact that a patient can stop therapy for 3 months and then restart adjuvant therapy allows compliance issues, due to side effects, to be addressed. A vigilant breast team can now offer returning to continuous adjuvant AI therapy to patients in distress. Secondly, the 3 month adjuvant window can now be used to create an advance in adjuvant therapy to reduce the micrometastatic tumor burden for those patients known to be at high risk for recurrence and death if a second five years of adjuvant therapy is not enforced. This is important, as a short-term intensive preemptive salvage therapy (Fig. 7), because cost and toxic side effects for current precision medicines (palbociclib and everolimus) will make years of combination therapy with an innovative antiestrogen therapy impractical. But how should the clinical community advance the new therapeutic innovations?

### Sequencing of aromatase inhibitors [^113stgpM]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

RATIONALE FOR SEQUENCING OF AIS

In both cases, the goal of continuing endocrine therapy for as long as possible is to prolong the control of the disease and delay the need for chemotherapy, thus also delaying its associated toxicity. Based on structural differences and different mechanisms of action among the AIs, a lack of cross-resistance between steroidal and nonsteroidal AIs has been hypothesised, thus justifying the use of different AIs in the same patient during the course of her disease.

The chemical structures of steroidal (e.g. exemestane and formestane) and nonsteroidal (e.g. anastrozole and letrozole) agents are illustrated in Figure 1. The steroidal inactivator, exemestane, has a very similar structure to the androgen substrate for aromatase, androstenedione (Figure 1); its covalent binding to aromatase results in irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. By contrast, nonsteroidal AIs bind to the haeme part of aromatase, and the inhibition is reversible. It is uncertain, however, whether this structural difference results in significant clinical differences. Both steroidal and nonsteroidal AIs effectively reduce serum oestrogen concentrations in postmenopausal patients. Intratumoural aromatase may, however, be an important additional target for inhibition, and differences between the AIs at this level cannot be excluded. Moreover, the partial androgen activity of exemestane, which is lacking with the nonsteroidal AIs, may also represent a difference relevant to sequencing. About 70–80% of all breast cancers express the androgen receptor, and androgens have been shown to have antiproliferative effects on breast cancer cell lines.

Although the pharmacological and molecular bases for their lack of cross-resistance need to be investigated further, the possibility of successfully using steroidal and nonsteroidal AIs in sequence is supported by clinical studies. The largest of these studies, which examined exemestane treatment in patients who had failed on nonsteroidal AIs, found that 6.6% of patients achieved an objective response and 17.4% prolonged disease stabilisation (⩾24 weeks), which translates to a 24% total clinical benefit rate.

### Aromatase inhibition in the treatment of advanced breast cancer: is there a relationship between potency and clinical efficacy? [^111hKeHd]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

SUMMARY

The AIs have been developed for treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive tumours and it is important that they are used to treat this group of patients. Third-generation AIs (anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane) show improved potency with respect to suppression of aromatase activity and circulating oestrogen levels compared with the older-generation AIs (aminoglutethimide, formestane and fadrozole). This increased potency correlates with improved clinical efficacy of the third-generation AIs relative to the older drugs. Thus, while formestane and fadrozole, which inhibit aromatase by < 85%, have shown no benefits over megestrol acetate or tamoxifen as second- and first-line therapy, respectively, third-generation AIs, which inhibit aromatase activity by > 96%, show significant clinical efficacy benefits over these standard second- and first-line comparators.

In contrast, direct comparison of the third-generation AIs anastrozole and letrozole has shown that although letrozole suppresses aromatase activity, oestrone and oestrone sulphate levels to a greater degree than anastrozole, these differences in potency do not translate to clinically significant differences in the efficacy of these agents for the second-line treatment of hormone-sensitive advanced breast cancer.

The fact that these marginal differences in potency between anastrozole and letrozole do not appear to produce clinically relevant differences in efficacy suggests that there may be a threshold effect for aromatase inhibition/oestrogen suppression beyond which no further improvements in clinical efficacy can be gained. Since the potency of formestane, aminoglutethimide and fadrozole fall below this threshold, the third-generation AIs show clinical efficacy benefits relative to these older agents. Of note, however, is that although clinical efficacy may be unaffected by small differences in potency, this does not preclude the fact that small differences in oestrogen suppression may lead to differences in side-effect profiles, especially with respect to cardiovascular end points or effects on bone mineral density, and this is more likely to become apparent during longer-term treatment as these drugs move into the adjuvant setting.

### Immunomodulation of FOXP3 + regulatory T cells by the aromatase inhibitor letrozole in breast cancer patients [^113vqDCy]. Clinical Cancer Research (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

We have shown previously that tumor infiltration by FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) is associated with increased relapse and shorter survival of patients with both in situ and invasive breast cancer. Because estrogen regulates Treg numbers in mice and promotes the proliferation of human Tregs, we hypothesized that blocking estrogen receptor-alpha signaling would abrogate Tregs and be associated with response to hormonal therapy and increased survival.

Experimental Design

FOXP3+ Tregs were quantified in tumor samples collected at baseline by incisional biopsy and after 6 months at definitive surgery in 83 elderly breast cancer patients (T2–4 N0–1) enrolled in a randomized phase II trial based on 6 months of primary letrozole (2.5 mg/d) or 6 months of letrozole plus oral "metronomic" cyclophosphamide (50 mg/d).

Results

Treg number ranged from 0 to 380 (median, 30) before treatment and from 0 to 300 (median, 8) after treatment. There was a significant reduction in Tregs in letrozole and letrozole-cyclophosphamide patients (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.002, respectively) after treatment. Treg number at residual histology was inversely related with response (P < 0.03 and P = 0.50, respectively) and a greater Treg reduction was observed in responding patients (P < 0.03).

Conclusion

This study suggests that aromatase inhibitors may have an indirect antitumor mechanism of action through reducing Tregs in breast tumors and may be of use in estrogen receptor-alpha-negative tumors in combination with immunotherapy approaches.

### Effects of co administration of gonadotropins and letrozole during the ovarian stimulation on IVF outcome for poor responders: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116mKtWi]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Letrozole utilizing, an aromatase inhibitor, has been examined to improve pregnancy rate in poor ovarian response women. Increasing the dose of gonadotropins and enhancement of follicles' sensitivity to androgens, are the possible mechanism of letrozole. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effect of co-administration of letrozole and gonadotropin on IVF/ICSI outcomes in poor ovarian response women.

Method

Relevant randomized controlled trials were obtained through search in several databases including PubMed, Scopus, Clinicaltrials.gov, Google scholar, and Cochrane Library. The RCTs investigating the effect of letrozole + gonadotropin versus gonadotropin reporting pregnancy outcome were selected.

Results

After analyzing 13 RCTs comprising 1692 patients, letrozole was associated with a reduction in the dose (SMD: -147.96 (-180.49, -115.42), P < 0.01) and duration (SMD: -2.82 (-4.21, -1.42), P < 0.01 of gonadotropin administration. There was no evidence of a difference between groups in the number of retrieved oocytes, clinical pregnancy rate, or live birth rate. A small reduction in the number of transferred embryos was observed (SMD: -0.26 (-0.49, -0.02), P = 0.03), though this finding should be interpreted with caution given heterogeneity across studies. Overall, no significant improvement in reproductive outcomes was demonstrated.

Conclusions

Despite the lack of significant improvement in pregnancy and live birth rate in the letrozole group, the dose and duration of gonadotropins decreased. This has the potential to reduce the side effects of gonadotropins. However, further studies are necessary to confirm its safety and whether its use translates into clinically meaningful benefits.

### Approval summary: letrozole in the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer [^111VcaMJ]. Clinical Cancer Research (2002). Low credibility.

Letrozole (Femara; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp, East Hanover, NJ) is a nonsteroidal inhibitor of aromatase enzyme complex. It inhibits the peripheral conversion of circulating androgens to estrogens. In postmenopausal women, letrozole decreases plasma concentrations of estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate by 75–95% from baseline with maximal suppression achieved within 2–3 days of treatment initiation. Suppression is dose related, with doses of ≥ 0.5 mg giving estrone and estrone sulfate values that were often below assay detection limits. At clinically used dosage, letrozole does not impair adrenal synthesis of glucocorticoids or aldosterone. In 1998, letrozole was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women, with hormone receptor positive or unknown breast cancer, who had failed one prior antiestrogen treatment (i.e., for "second-line" treatment). Approval was based on two randomized trials comparing tumor RRs of patients receiving 0.5 mg of letrozole, 2.5 mg of letrozole, and either megestrol acetate (MA) or aminoglutethimide. In the megestrol trial, 2.5 mg/day letrozole was superior to 0.5 mg of letrozole and MA (RRs 24, 13, and 16%, respectively), whereas in the aminoglutethimide trial, there was no significant difference in 2.5 mg of letrozole and 0.5 mg of letrozole RRs (20 and 17%). There was a trend toward RR superiority of 2.5 mg of letrozole over aminoglutethimide (P = 0.06). Letrozole (2.5 mg) was the dose chosen for comparison with tamoxifen in the first-line setting. In July 2000, a marketing application for first-line letrozole treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive or hormone receptor unknown locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer was submitted to the FDA. A single double-blind, double dummy, randomized, and multicenter trial compared 2.5 mg of letrozole to 20 mg of tamoxifen (456 patients/arm). Letrozole was superior to tamoxifen with regard to time to progression (TTP) and objective response rate (RR). The median TTP for letrozole treatment was 9.9 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.1–12.2] versus 6.2 months (95% CI 5.8–8.5) for tamoxifen, P = 0.0001, hazard ratio 0.713, (95% CI 0.61–0.84). RR was 32% for letrozole versus 21% for tamoxifen (odds ratio 1.74, 95% CI 1.29–2.34, P = 0.0003). Preliminary survival data (survival data are still blinded) indicate that letrozole is unlikely to be worse than tamoxifen. Both treatments were similarly tolerated. On the basis of these results, the United States FDA approved letrozole tablets, 2.5 mg/day, for first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive or hormone receptor-unknown locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The manufacturer made a commitment to provide updated information on survival.

### A comparison of letrozole and tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer [^115zyx9a]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

The aromatase inhibitor letrozole is a more effective treatment for metastatic breast cancer and more effective in the neoadjuvant setting than tamoxifen. We compared letrozole with tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment for steroid-hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women.

Methods

The Breast International Group (BIG) 1–98 study is a randomized, phase 3, double-blind trial that compared five years of treatment with various adjuvant endocrine therapy regimens in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer: letrozole, letrozole followed by tamoxifen, tamoxifen, and tamoxifen followed by letrozole. This analysis compares the two groups assigned to receive letrozole initially with the two groups assigned to receive tamoxifen initially; events and follow-up in the sequential-treatment groups were included up to the time that treatments were switched.

Results

A total of 8010 women with data that could be assessed were enrolled, 4003 in the letrozole group and 4007 in the tamoxifen group. After a median follow-up of 25.8 months, 351 events had occurred in the letrozole group and 428 events in the tamoxifen group, with five-year disease-free survival estimates of 84.0 percent and 81.4 percent, respectively. As compared with tamoxifen, letrozole significantly reduced the risk of an event ending a period of disease-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.70 to 0.93; P = 0.003), especially the risk of distant recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.88; P = 0.001). Thromboembolism, endometrial cancer, and vaginal bleeding were more common in the tamoxifen group. Women given letrozole had a higher incidence of skeletal and cardiac events and of hypercholesterolemia.

Conclusions

In postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer, adjuvant treatment with letrozole, as compared with tamoxifen, reduced the risk of recurrent disease, especially at distant sites. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00004205.)

### Fertility drugs and cancer: a guideline [^114Hueek]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Fertility drugs and cancer — evidence review methods and grading process are described as follows: A methodological specialist extracted data for outcomes identified by the task force, including exposure to infertility treatment vs. controls, fertility medications such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), human menopausal gonadotropin, letrozole, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), or clomiphene citrate (CC), and cancer outcomes (breast, ovarian, borderline ovarian tumor [BOT], thyroid, melanoma, colorectal, or uterine) with subsequent incidence/odds of diagnosis. Task force members critically assessed study strengths and limitations, assigned a quality grade using a defined rating scale, and recorded this in an evidence table; the task force chair reviewed assigned grades, determined grades when missing based on study strengths and limitations, and assessed design and methodology components including blinding, allocation concealment, appropriate control groups, intention-to-treat analysis, generalizability, and risk of bias. A consulting epidemiologist and the chair confirmed agreement with the experts' quality assessments; the task force summarized data in narrative form (characteristics, quality, benefit, conclusions), convened via email to review literature and findings, and the chair presented summaries and draft conclusions to the ASRM Practice Committee for deliberation on evidence strength and recommendation strength and for approval of summary statements and recommendations. The quality of the evidence informed the strength of the guideline's evidence, and recommendation strengths were based on both the quality and strength (confidence/certainty) of evidence, risks, benefits, and expert judgment; patient perspective and feedback were elicited during review and before publication.

### Role of aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer [^113iqUb7]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

RATIONALE FOR AROMATASE INHIBITORS IN BREAST CANCER

Oestrogen deprivation has long been an effective treatment for breast cancer, and the introduction of the antioestrogen, tamoxifen, in the 1970s produced marked improvements in breast cancer survival. Tamoxifen blocks the oestrogen receptor, whose signalling represents a critical growth and survival pathway in breast tumours. However, tamoxifen also has some partial oestrogen agonist effects, which may be detrimental, and may be associated with increased risk of uterine cancer and thromboembolism. Agonist activity may also be involved in the development of tamoxifen resistance.

An alternative approach to blocking the oestrogen receptor is to reduce levels of its ligand, oestradiol, by targeting aromatase. This enzyme converts androstenedione and testosterone to oestrone and oestradiol. It is a member of the cytochrome P 450 class and is highly expressed in the placenta and in the granulosa cells of ovarian follicles. However, it is also present in peripheral tissues, including adipose tissue, liver, muscle, brain and breast cancer tissue.

Unlike tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors do not directly interact with the oestrogen receptor but indirectly affect signalling in postmenopausal women by blocking the conversion of adrenal androgens to oestrogen in peripheral (ie non-ovarian) tissues, including the breast itself (Figure 1 ;). Enhanced aromatase activity has been observed in adipose tissue adjacent to breast cancers, and may promote growth of malignant cells. Aromatase inhibitors inhibit in situ oestrogen synthesis in both tumour and non-malignant breast tissue, and have demonstrated efficacy in suppressing peripheral oestrogen synthesis in postmenopausal women.

Aromatase inhibitors may be divided into two subtypes, steroidal and nonsteroidal. Steroidal inhibitors (eg exemestane) are analogues of androstenedione and bind irreversibly to the substrate binding site on the aromatase molecule, and are also known as enzyme inactivators. Nonsteroidal inhibitors (eg anastrozole and letrozole) bind reversibly to the haem group of the enzyme. The clinical significance of this difference in mechanism of action is uncertain at present, although it may enable the different types of agent to be used sequentially in order to prolong clinical response. Later in the supplement, Dr Bertelli discusses sequencing of therapy further.

### Role of aromatase inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer [^111X5iYU]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Estrogens play a pivotal role in the development of breast cancer. Endocrine therapy based on estrogen blockade is a well-established treatment in hormone-dependent breast cancer. Tamoxifen citrate has long been considered the "gold standard" due to its relative safety and efficacy. Aromatase inhibitors are anti-estrogen agents that target specifically the aromatase enzyme, which is the final step in the estrogen production. The first use of aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer was associated with adverse effects such as rash, drowsiness, and adrenal-gland suppression. Newer third-generation agents are emerging as potential alternatives to tamoxifen, associating clinical efficacy with a more favorable safety profile.

Objectives

The aim of this article is to review the mechanisms of actions pharmacology, adverse effects, and clinical applications of the aromatase inhibitors available in the United States.

Methods

The terms breast cancer or neoplasia, aromatase, aromatase inhibitors, third-generation, endocrine therapy, and antiestrogens were used to search MEDLINE for English-language studies published between 1966 and April 2004. A parallel search was performed at the corresponding Web site of each of the aromatase inhibitors available in the United States. Identified publications relevant to the article objectives were selected.

Results

Anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane are the 3 commercially available aromatase inhibitors approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. They have been used in several clinical scenarios, including advanced and early disease and chemoprevention, and in the neoadjuvant setting. There is evidence that aromatase inhibitors are more effective and tolerable than tamoxifen in advanced breast cancer and in the neoadjuvant setting. Based on the results of a large, randomized trial, their use in early disease and in chemoprevention is also promising. Aromatase inhibitors appear safe; however, the long-term safety profile is still unknown, especially concerning bone metabolism.

Conclusion

Third-generation aromatase inhibitors are a new treatment modality in estrogen and/or progesterone-receptor positive breast cancer. Although they are replacing the "classic" antiestrogen agents used in metastatic breast cancer, their benefit in early disease and as chemopreventive agents is not completely clear. Ongoing clinical studies should become available within the next few years and will provide additional recommendations for their use in patients with breast cancer.

### Aromatase inhibitors in advanced breast cancer: there are efficacy differences [^117LsGbR]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

In fact, the high efficacy of letrozole in ER/PgR-unknown tumours in this second-line study is consistent with results of the phase III first-line comparison of letrozole vs tamoxifen, in which the superiority of letrozole over tamoxifen was consistent among both ER/PgR-positive and -unknown patients – in contrast to the anastrozole trials that demonstrated superiority only in the ER/PgR-positive subgroup. While hard to explain, it seems that while letrozole may be effectively used in both hormone receptor-positive and -unknown patients, the efficacy of anastrozole appears limited to only those patients with a distinct expression of ER/PgR.

The efficacy of an endocrine agent in ER/PgR-unknown patients remains clinically relevant, as even today there is a pool of patients with advanced breast cancer of undetermined ER/PgR status. While Dr Sainsbury maintains that '… they [AIs] are used in this [hormone receptor-positive] group of patients', this is, in fact, not entirely true for advanced breast cancer: endocrine therapy is still widely recommended for these women with receptor-unknown advanced breast cancer, based on the fact that the majority will be endocrine responsive and a response to endocrine therapy would delay chemotherapy.

Within the summary of this review, the author introduces the notion that while the degree of oestrogen suppression beyond a certain threshold does not translate into increased antitumour efficacy, it might well result in different toxicity profiles. This statement is purely speculative and is not supported by any data available so far. We are not aware of any research demonstrating that endocrine-sensitive normal tissues, such as bone, would be more sensitive to small changes in oestrogen levels than breast cancer cells, which are well recognised for their ability to develop a pronounced hypersensitivity to small levels of oestrogen. Using bone metabolism as an example, we may point out that the less potent aromatase inhibitor anastrozole has been associated with a marked increase in fracture rates when used in early breast cancer, whereas letrozole has not.

The author of this letter is a consultant to Novartis Oncology. It would seem advisable that future reviews of the kind published by Dr Sainsbury include disclosure of the author's potential conflicts of interest as well.

### Aromatase inhibitors in the treatment and prevention of breast cancer [^1177g8JM]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the current clinical status and possible future applications of aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer.

Methods

A review of the literature on the third-generation aromatase inhibitors was conducted. Some data that have been presented but not published are included. In addition, the designs of ongoing trials with aromatase inhibitors are outlined and the implications of possible results discussed.

Results

All of the third-generation oral aromatase inhibitors — letrozole, anastrozole, and vorozole (nonsteroidal, type II) and exemestane (steroidal, type I) — have now been tested in phase III trials as second-line treatment of postmenopausal hormone-dependent breast cancer. They have shown clear superiority compared with the conventional therapies and are therefore considered established second-line hormonal agents. Currently, they are being tested as first-line therapy in the metastatic, adjuvant, and neoadjuvant settings. Preliminary results suggest that the inhibitors might displace tamoxifen as first-line treatment, but further studies are needed to determine this.

Conclusion

The role of aromatase inhibitors in premenopausal breast cancer and in combination with chemotherapy and other anticancer treatments are areas of future exploration. The ongoing adjuvant trials will provide important data on the long-term safety of aromatase inhibitors, which will help to determine their suitability for use as chemopreventives in healthy women at risk of developing breast cancer.

### Letrozole [^113sLtoJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The PCA allowed the results of letrozole for 5 years compared with tamoxifen for 5 years to be reported in 2005 after a median follow-up of only 26 months. The design of the PCA is not optimal to evaluate the effect of letrozole after a longer time (because follow-up was truncated in two arms at around 25 months). The MAA (ignoring the two sequential treatment arms) provided follow-up equally as long in each treatment and did not over-emphasize early recurrences as the PCA did. The MAA thus provides the clinically appropriate updated efficacy results in answer to the first primary question, despite the confounding of the tamoxifen reference arm by the selective crossover to letrozole. The updated results for the MAA are summarized in Table 7. Median follow-up for this analysis is 73 months.

The Sequential Treatments Analysis (STA) addresses the second primary question of the study. The primary analysis for the STA was from switch (or equivalent time-point in monotherapy arms) + 30 days (STA-S) with a two-sided test applied to each pair-wise comparison at the 2.5% level. Additional analyses were conducted from randomization (STA-R) but these comparisons (added in light of changing medical practice) were under-powered for efficacy.

ITT analysis ignores selective crossover in tamoxifen arms.

Censored analysis censors follow-up at the date of selective crossover in 632 patients who crossed to letrozole or another aromatase inhibitor after the tamoxifen arms were unblinded in 2005.

### KRAS-mutated, estrogen receptor-positive low-grade serous ovarian cancer: unraveling an exceptional response mystery [^116C8zcy]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

We report on a woman with aggressive estrogen receptor‐positive, KRAS ‐mutated ovarian cancer who achieved a remarkable response to combination therapy with the MEK inhibitor (trametinib) and the aromatase inhibitor (letrozole), even though the disease had failed to respond to a combination of a PI3K inhibitor and different MEK inhibitor, as well as to trametinib and the estrogen modulator, tamoxifen, and to letrozole by itself. The mechanism of action for exceptional response was elucidated by in vitro experiments that demonstrated that the fact that tamoxifen can have an agonistic effect in addition to antagonist activity, whereas letrozole results only in estrogen depletion was crucial to the response achieved when letrozole was combined with an MEK inhibitor. Our current observations indicate that subtle variations in mechanisms of action of outwardly similar regimens may have a major impact on outcome and that such translational knowledge is critical for optimizing a precision medicine strategy.

Key Points

This report describes the remarkable response of a patient with KRAS ‐mutated, estrogen receptor‐positive low‐grade serous ovarian cancer treated with trametinib (MEK inhibitor) and letrozole (aromatase inhibitor), despite prior progression on similar agents including tamoxifen (estrogen modulator).
In vitro investigation revealed that tamoxifen can have agonistic in addition to antagonistic effects, which could be the reason for the patient not responding to the combination of trametinib and tamoxifen.
The current observations suggest that drugs with different mechanisms of action targeting the same receptor may have markedly different anticancer activity when used in combinations.

### Aromatase inhibition in the treatment of advanced breast cancer: is there a relationship between potency and clinical efficacy? [^116GaQqc]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Two trials have investigated the efficacy of letrozole (2.5 or 0.5 mg o.d.) vs megestrol acetate 40 mg q.d. (Table 1). Results of the European trial showed the OR rate was significantly higher for patients receiving letrozole 2.5 mg than for letrozole 0.5 mg (P = 0.004) or megestrol acetate (P = 0.04) (24, 13 and 16%, respectively). Letrozole 2.5 mg was superior to letrozole 0.5 mg for TTP (P = 0.02), but not compared with megestrol acetate. At a 51-month follow-up analysis for the letrozole 2.5 mg arm, letrozole did not show significant survival benefit over megestrol acetate (Table 1). In the US trial, no significant differences were reported for TTP (Table 1) or OR rate and, contrary to the first trial, the efficacy of letrozole was not dose related. No significant survival benefit was seen for letrozole vs megestrol acetate (Table 1). It has been speculated that these contradictory findings may be the result of an imbalance of prognostic factors in favour of megestrol acetate in the latter trial.

### History of aromatase: saga of an important biological mediator and therapeutic target [^112syHsy]. Endocrine Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Aromatase is the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Initial studies of its enzymatic activity and function took place in an environment focused on estrogen as a component of the birth control pill. At an early stage, investigators recognized that inhibition of this enzyme could have major practical applications for treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer, alterations of ovarian and endometrial function, and treatment of benign disorders such as gynecomastia. Two general approaches ultimately led to the development of potent and selective aromatase inhibitors. One targeted the enzyme using analogs of natural steroidal substrates to work out the relationships between structure and function. The other approach initially sought to block adrenal function as a treatment for breast cancer but led to the serendipitous finding that a nonsteroidal P450 steroidogenesis inhibitor, aminoglutethimide, served as a potent but nonselective aromatase inhibitor. Proof of the therapeutic concept of aromatase inhibition involved a variety of studies with aminoglutethimide and the selective steroidal inhibitor, formestane. The requirement for even more potent and selective inhibitors led to intensive molecular studies to identify the structure of aromatase, to development of high-sensitivity estrogen assays, and to "mega" clinical trials of the third-generation aromatase inhibitors, letrozole, anastrozole, and exemestane, which are now in clinical use in breast cancer. During these studies, unexpected findings led investigators to appreciate the important role of estrogens in males as well as in females and in multiple organs, particularly the bone and brain. These studies identified the important regulatory properties of aromatase acting in an autocrine, paracrine, intracrine, neurocrine, and juxtacrine fashion and the organ-specific enhancers and promoters controlling its transcription. The saga of these studies of aromatase and the ultimate utilization of inhibitors as highly effective treatments of breast cancer and for use in reproductive disorders serves as the basis for this first Endocrine Reviews history manuscript.

### Anastrozole dose escalation for optimal estrogen suppression in postmenopausal early-stage breast cancer: a prospective trial [^115DsM8s]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AI) anastrozole, exemestane, and letrozole all play a major role in the adjuvant therapy of postmenopausal women with early-stage estrogen receptor-α–positive (ER+) breast cancer. The mechanisms by which all three AI inhibit tumor growth are through inhibition of aromatase, an enzyme encoded by the CYP19A1 gene and decreased estrogen production from androgenic precursors. Although all three AI are potent in terms of inhibition of in vivo aromatization, letrozole is the most potent. However, large phase III adjuvant clinical trials do not indicate any difference in efficacy among the three AI. Specifically, the MA.27 trial showed no significant difference between anastrozole and exemestane in terms of disease-free survival (DFS), and the FACE trial showed no difference between anastrozole and letrozole for DFS and overall survival.

We have previously demonstrated that there was substantial interindividual variability in the metabolism of anastrozole and its pharmacodynamic effects on estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) levels. To explore whether the degree of estrogen suppression was associated with breast cancer recurrence in women receiving adjuvant AI, we subsequently conducted a matched case-control study of postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer receiving adjuvant AI in the MA.27 (anastrozole and exemestane) and PreFace (letrozole) trials. The primary aim was to assess whether E1 and/or E2 levels after 6 months of treatment were associated with an increased risk of disease recurrence within 5 years of AI initiation [early breast cancer (EBC) event; ref.]. We found a statistically significant threefold increase in the risk of an EBC event for those taking anastrozole with both E1 ≥ 1.3 pg/mL and E2 ≥ 0.5 pg/mL, but a similar association was not found for exemestane or letrozole. Of note, in the multivariate analysis assessing E1 and E2 together, conditional logistic regression found that EBC events for women with only one of either E1 < 1.3 pg/mL or E2 < 0.5 pg/mL did not differ significantly from those with both E1 < 1.3 and E2 < 0.5 [OR = 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.69–1.58; P = 0.83]. Thus, adequate estrogen suppression (AES) was achieved if E1 and/or E2 levels were below these designated thresholds.

### Bone loss and the aromatase inhibitors [^116FjcRz]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Aromatase inhibitors

Aromatase inhibitors are potent inhibitors of oestrogen production and at present are commonly used in patients with metastatic disease and in some early breast cancer patients who are unsuitable for treatment with tamoxifen. Two types of aromatase inhibitor are currently available, which have different mechanisms of action. The nonsteroidal agents (anastrozole, letrozole and aminoglutethimide) are reversible inhibitors, while steroidal agents (exemestane and formestane) are irreversible inactivators of the aromatase enzyme. The third-generation aromatase inhibitors anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane are the most powerful drugs available resulting in approximately 96–99% enzyme inhibition. This marked reduction in oestradiol would be expected to have profound effects on bone physiology. The decision on which drugs to use in the future will depend upon the clarity of the results of trials in metastatic disease and adjuvant therapy, as well as 'head to head' comparison of the agents.

### Sequencing of aromatase inhibitors [^111uwSTN]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Since the development of the third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs), anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane, these agents have been the subject of intensive research to determine their optimal use in advanced breast cancer. Not only have they replaced progestins in second-line therapy and challenged the role of tamoxifen in first-line, but there is also evidence for a lack of cross-resistance between the steroidal and nonsteroidal AIs, meaning that they may be used in sequence to obtain prolonged clinical benefit. Many questions remain, however, as to the best sequence of the two types of AIs and of the other available agents, including tamoxifen and fulvestrant, in different patient groups.

### Cotargeting of CYP-19 (aromatase) and emerging, pivotal signalling pathways in metastatic breast cancer [^113eXg8J]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Aromatase inhibition is one of the cornerstones of modern endocrine therapy of oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+) metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole, as well as the steroidal aromatase inactivator exemestane, are the preferred drugs and established worldwide in all clinical phases of the disease. However, although many patients suffering from MBC experience an initial stabilisation of their metastatic burden, drug resistance and disease progression occur frequently, following in general only a few months on treatment. Extensive translational research during the past two decades has elucidated the major pathways contributing to endocrine resistance and paved the way for clinical studies investigating the efficacy of novel drug combinations involving aromatase inhibitors and emerging drugable targets like mTOR, PI3K and CDK4/6. The present review summarises the basic research that provided the rationale for new drug combinations involving aromatase inhibitors and the main findings of pivotal clinical trials that have already started to change our way to treat hormone-sensitive MBC. The challenging situation of oestrogen receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) MBC is also shortly reviewed to underline the complexity of the clinical scenario in the heterogeneous subgroups of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients and the increasing need for personalised medicine. Finally, we summarise some of the promising findings made with the combination of aromatase inhibitors with other potent endocrine treatment options like fulvestrant, a selective oestrogen receptor downregulator.

### Aromatase inhibitors (letrozole) for subfertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^115HHFRM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of infrequent periods (oligomenorrhoea) and absence of periods (amenorrhoea). It affects about 4% to 8% of women worldwide and often leads to anovulatory subfertility. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are a class of drugs that were introduced for ovulation induction in 2001. Since about 2001 clinical trials have reached differing conclusions as to whether the AI letrozole is at least as effective as the first-line treatment clomiphene citrate (CC).

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of aromatase inhibitors for subfertile women with anovulatory PCOS for ovulation induction followed by timed intercourse or intrauterine insemination (IUI).

Search Methods

We searched the following sources from inception to November 2017 to identify relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs): the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Pubmed, LILACS, Web of Knowledge, the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical trials register and Clinicaltrials.gov. We also searched the references of relevant articles. We did not restrict the searches by language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

We included all RCTs of AIs used alone or with other medical therapies for ovulation induction in women of reproductive age with anovulatory PCOS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted the data and assessed risks of bias. We pooled studies where appropriate using a fixed-effect model to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for most outcomes, and risk differences (RDs) for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). The primary outcomes were live birth and OHSS. Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, miscarriage and multiple pregnancy. We assessed the quality of the evidence for each comparison using GRADE methods.

Main Results

This is a substantive update of a previous review. We identified 16 additional studies for the 2018 update. We include 42 RCTs (7935 women). The aromatase inhibitor letrozole was used in all studies. Letrozole compared to clomiphene citrate (CC) with or without adjuncts followed by timed intercourseLive birth rates were higher with letrozole (with or without adjuncts) compared to clomiphene citrate (with our without adjuncts) followed by timed intercourse (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.99; 2954 participants; 13 studies; I² = 0%; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 10; moderate-quality evidence). There is high-quality evidence that OHSS rates are similar with letrozole or clomiphene citrate (0.5% in both arms: risk difference (RD) -0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.00; 2536 participants; 12 studies; I² = 0%; high-quality evidence). There is evidence for a higher pregnancy rate in favour of letrozole (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.78; 4629 participants; 25 studies; I² = 1%; NNTB = 10; moderate-quality evidence). There is little or no difference between treatment groups in the rate of miscarriage by pregnancy (20% with CC versus 19% with letrozole; OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.26; 1210 participants; 18 studies; I² = 0%; high-quality evidence) and multiple pregnancy rate (1.7% with CC versus 1.3% with letrozole; OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.16; 3579 participants; 17 studies; I² = 0%; high-quality evidence). However, a funnel plot showed mild asymmetry, indicating that some studies in favour of clomiphene might be missing. Letrozole compared to laparoscopic ovarian drillingThere is low-quality evidence that live birth rates are similar with letrozole or laparoscopic ovarian drilling (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.02; 548 participants; 3 studies; I² = 23%; low-quality evidence). There is insufficient evidence for a difference in OHSS rates (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; 260 participants; 1 study; low-quality evidence). There is low-quality evidence that pregnancy rates are similar (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.74; 774 participants; 5 studies; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). There is insufficient evidence for a difference in miscarriage rate by pregnancy (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.43; 240 participants; 5 studies; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), or multiple pregnancies (OR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 74.90; 548 participants; 3 studies; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). Additional comparisons were made for Letrozole versus placebo, Selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMS) followed by intrauterine insemination (IUI), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), Anastrozole, as well as dosage and administration protocols. There is insufficient evidence for a difference in either group of treatment due to a limited number of studies. Hence more research is necessary.

Authors' Conclusions

Letrozole appears to improve live birth and pregnancy rates in subfertile women with anovulatory polycystic ovary syndrome, compared to clomiphene citrate. There is high-quality evidence that OHSS rates are similar with letrozole or clomiphene citrate. There is high-quality evidence of no difference in miscarriage rates or multiple pregnancy rates. There is low-quality evidence of no difference in live birth and pregnancy rates between letrozole and laparoscopic ovarian drilling, although there were few relevant studies. For the 2018 update, we added good-quality trials, upgrading the quality of the evidence.

Use of aromatase inhibitors (AIs), exemestane, letrozole and anastrozole, for breast cancer therapy is associated with severe pain symptoms, the underlying mechanism of which is unknown. The electrophilic nature of AIs suggests that they may target the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channel, a major pathway in pain transmission and neurogenic inflammation. AIs evoke TRPA1-mediated calcium response and current in rodent nociceptors and human cells expressing the recombinant channel. In mice, AIs produce acute nociception, which is exaggerated by pre-exposure to proalgesic stimuli, and, by releasing sensory neuropeptides, neurogenic inflammation in peripheral tissues. AIs also evoke mechanical allodynia and decreased grip strength, which do not undergo desensitization on prolonged AI administration. These effects are markedly attenuated by TRPA1 pharmacological blockade or in TRPA1-deficient mice. TRPA1 is a major mediator of the proinflammatory/proalgesic actions of AIs, thus suggesting TRPA1 antagonists for the treatment of pain symptoms associated with AI use.

Aromatase inhibitors in the adjuvant setting

The findings from major studies comparing third-generation aromatase inhibitors with tamoxifen for adjuvant treatment are summarized in Table 2. These studies evaluated two treatment approaches, aromatase inhibitor monotherapy or sequential treatment, where 2–3 years of tamoxifen is followed by an aromatase inhibitor. In addition, one study (BIG 1–98) also included a fourth arm; patients randomized to 2 years of letrozole, followed by 3 years with tamoxifen. The rationale for the sequential approach was based on the findings from studies in the metastatic setting, revealing lack of cross-resistance between tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors; thus, the idea was that switching from tamoxifen to an aromatase inhibitor during 5 years of adjuvant therapy may prevent acquired resistance from developing. Notably, a combined meta-analysis of these data did not reveal superiority for any of the three compounds (anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane) compared with any of the two others. The key findings, based on this meta-analysis, are summarized in the following.

Regarding the two major strategies (aromatase inhibitor monotherapy for 5 years after surgery, alternatively, tamoxifen for 2–3 years to be followed by an aromatase inhibitor for 3–2 years for a total duration of 5 years), each strategy revealed superiority compared with tamoxifen monotherapy in preventing recurrence. Among 9856 patients allocated to monotherapy with either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor, following a mean duration of follow-up of 5.8 years, aromatase inhibitor monotherapy decreased relapse rate from 12.6% (for tamoxifen) to 9.6% with an aromatase inhibitor. As for survival, there was a non-significant improvement related to aromatase inhibition, but the follow-up is still too short to fully assess this end-point. Taking sequential treatment, analyzing patients from the time of randomization between continuing tamoxifen and switching to an aromatase inhibitor, the recurrence rate was reduced from 8.1 to 5% at 3 years of follow-up from randomization with a significant 0.7% reduction in breast cancer mortality among those patients receiving an aromatase inhibitor.

### Role of aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer [^115CYWBW]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Primarily, the role of the aromatase inhibitors has been investigated in postmenopausal women with breast cancer, although it is also now being assessed in premenopausal patients following ovarian ablation/suppression. Aromatase inhibitors markedly suppress endogenous oestrogens without directly interacting with oestrogen receptors, and thus have a different mechanism of action to the antioestrogen, tamoxifen. The inhibitors may be divided into subgroups according to their structure (steroidal and nonsteroidal), and there appears to be a lack of cross-resistance between the classes of aromatase inhibitors enabling them to be used sequentially and potentially to prolong endocrine hormone therapy. In addition, with increased efficacy and favourable safety and tolerability profiles, the aromatase inhibitors are starting to challenge tamoxifen as first choice endocrine treatment in a number of settings. Potential differences in side-effect profiles may appear between the steroidal and nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors when used in long-term settings. Thus, it has been suggested that the steroidal agents have favourable end organ effects; for example, the steroidal inhibitor, exemestane, has minimal negative effects on bone and lipid metabolism in animal and clinical studies. This paper provides an overview of the current and future roles of aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer treatment.

### A bovine model for examining the effects of an aromatase inhibitor on ovarian function in women [^1133zmrh]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that treatment with an aromatase inhibitor (letrozole) will terminate dominant ovarian follicle growth and result in the emergence of a new follicular wave, regardless of the stage of follicular development at the time of treatment.

Design

Prospective study.

Setting

Academic research center.

Animal(S)

Postpubertal beef heifers.

Intervention(S)

Randomized trial involving treatment with letrozole on days 1–3, 3–5, 5–7 (day 0 = pretreatment ovulation) or no treatment.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Follicular development, corpus luteum (CL) development, hormone profiles, and plasma aromatase inhibitor concentration.

Result(S)

Multiple doses of letrozole lengthened the period of follicular dominance, delayed emergence of the next follicular wave, and resulted in a larger CL regardless of the stage of the follicular wave in which treatments were initiated. No effects on circulating FSH concentrations were detected, but the stimulatory effects on the dominant follicle and CL were associated with increased plasma concentrations of LH in letrozole-treated animals. Plasma P concentrations were numerically higher throughout the luteal phase in letrozole-treated versus control heifers, but differences were not significant.

Conclusion(S)

The results provide rationale for the hypothesis that the mechanism of action responsible for the stimulatory effect of aromatase inhibitors on ovarian function involves an elevation in circulating concentrations of LH rather than FSH.

### Repurposing existing drugs for COVID-19: an endocrinology perspective [^111ZZ1RM]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Discourage use in COVID-19

Some drug classes not only may show few or no benefits for COVID-19, but may also exhibit deleterious effects that may overcome specific benefits, if any.

While estrogens may present protective effects from COVID-19, their actions in alpha and beta ERs are more complex. Specific selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), including tamoxifen and raloxifene, could theoretically be an additional target to be attempted in COVID-19, despite the lack of any specific data. While raloxifene has been researched for systemic actions, showing to be neutral in the RAAS potentially protective against lung injury, and neutral in the cardiovascular system, tamoxifen may increase risk of thromboembolic events and stroke when administered orally, and does not present any non-oral formulation. Despite the increased risk for thrombosis, which is particularly concerning in the pro-thrombotic state of COVID-19, tamoxifen, not raloxifene, is being currently studied in one clinical trial.

Aromatase inhibitors, including anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane, mitigate testosterone conversion into estrogens, as per its inherent mechanisms of action. Aromatase inhibitors have exhibited harmful effects in the RAAS and indirectly increase of 5alpha-reductase activity and DHT levels, enhancing TMPRSS2 expression. Since these effects in the RAAS and TMPRSS2 may potentialize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and increase risk of thromboembolic events, aromatase inhibitors should be discouraged as candidates for COVID-19.

Unlike estrogens, progestogens lack demonstration of any mechanism of protection from COVID-19, has suppressive effects on both innate and cell-mediated immune responses, in particular inducing T-lymphocyte cell death, apparently do not have any major effect in the RAAS, although hormones with progesterone activity compete with aldosterone in the MR. Because of the suppressing effects on T-lymphocyte, progesterone should be discouraged for COVID-19, despite being currently evaluated for COVID-19 in hospitalized men.

### Interaction between SNP genotype and efficacy of anastrozole and exemestane in early-stage breast cancer [^114ym7hh]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

The "dogma" that the three AIs are essentially the same has been revisited based on our recent data showing that anastrozole, but not exemestane or letrozole, displays an association between the degree of estrogen suppression and outcomes in early breast cancer, and that anastrozole has a mechanism of action in addition to aromatase inhibition in that it is a ligand for ERα. These findings have potential implications for the individualization of AIs therapy.

Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genomic regions that affect risks for breast cancer recurrence in women treated with AIs. However, prior studies did not systematically test whether there might be an interaction between individual AI treatment and genetic variability. In the present study, we have investigated germline genetic variation as a predictive marker for differential efficacy of the nonsteroidal AI anastrozole and the steroidal exemestane and as a prognostic marker in the adjuvant Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG) MA.27 trialin patients with hormone receptor‐positive early breast cancer. We found that a group of single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were differentially associated between anastrozole and exemestane regarding outcomes.

### Pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the newer generation aromatase inhibitors [^113o1sj4]. Clinical Cancer Research (2003). Low credibility.

The newer generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) as a class show efficacy and tolerability benefits over previously established treatments in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. At clinically administered doses, the plasma half-lives of anastrozole (1 mg once daily), letrozole (2.5 mg once daily), and exemestane (25 mg once daily) are 41–48 h, 2–4 days, and 27 h, respectively. Time to steady-state plasma levels is 7 days for both anastrozole and exemestane and 60 days for letrozole. Androgenic side effects have only been reported with exemestane. Anastrozole treatment has no impact on plasma lipid levels, whereas both letrozole and exemestane have an unfavorable effect. From indirect comparisons, anastrozole shows the highest degree of selectivity compared with letrozole and exemestane, in terms of a lack of effect on adrenosteroidogenesis. To date, there are no data suggesting any major differences in clinical efficacy between the newer generation AIs anastrozole and letrozole. Based on the observed pharmacological profiles, however, it cannot be assumed that the AIs will display the same tolerability and safety profiles when given for extended periods of time in the adjuvant setting. The effects of anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane are being investigated in the adjuvant setting, and these data will elucidate the possible long-term consequences of the pharmacological effects reported after short-term exposure.

### The potency and clinical efficacy of aromatase inhibitors across the breast cancer continuum [^116f9zGr]. Annals of Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

aromatase inhibition — state of the art and way forward

Recent head-to-head data from BIG 1–98 comparing sequential treatment with monotherapy, combined with findings in the ATAC and BIG 1–98 trials that treatment with an aromatase inhibitor reduces relapses compared with tamoxifen during the first 2 years of treatment, advocate using an aromatase inhibitor upfront. While no difference in outcome was recorded between patients receiving letrozole monotherapy, and those receiving letrozole initially then switching to tamoxifen after 2 years, these data need to be interpreted carefully due to the limited duration of follow-up from the time of switching. While previous data revealed no benefit of extending tamoxifen treatment beyond 5 years in the adjuvant setting, we do not know the optimal duration of treatment with an aromatase inhibitor or whether switching to tamoxifen or perhaps even estrogen treatment after a certain time period may be beneficial.

Regarding estrogen suppression, similar to what has been recorded with tamoxifen, there is reason to believe that many tumors developing acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors may still be sensitive to endocrine manipulation. Based on experimental evidence, suggesting that long-term estrogen deprivation may sensitize breast cancer cells to estrogen stimulation, we implemented treatment with diethylstilbestrol for patients developing resistance to aromatase inhibitors in the metastatic setting. Thirty percent of patients achieved an objective response, suggesting the potential of sequential endocrine manipulation of hormone-sensitive tumor cells.

An important question is whether one aromatase inhibitor may provide an advantage over the others. Comparing the two nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole, there is substantial evidence that letrozole causes more potent in vivo aromatase inhibition and plasma and tissue estrogen suppression. While data in the second-line metastatic setting are not straightforward, notably the one randomized study comparing letrozole versus anastrozole showed no significant differences in time to progression, the primary end point. However, letrozole was significantly superior to anastrozole in overall response rate (ORR, secondary end point) and for the two predefined covariates (visceral metastasis and ER status). No differences in ORR were shown between anastrozole and letrozole for ER-positive patients.

### Treatment of delayed male puberty: efficacy of aromatase inhibition [^114N5PrF]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that inhibition of estrogen synthesis would delay maturation of the growth plates and ultimately result in increased adult height in boys with delayed puberty. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which we treated boys with constitutional delay of puberty with testosterone plus placebo (testosterone-placebo) or with testosterone plus letrozole (testosterone-letrozole). Letrozole effectively inhibited estrogen synthesis: 17beta-estradiol concentrations increased in the testosterone-placebo group, but in the testosterone-letrozole group, no such increase was observed until letrozole treatment was discontinued. After 1.5 years, bone age had advanced by 1.7 ± 0.3 years in the testosterone-placebo group, but by only 0.9 ± 0.2 years in the testosterone-letrozole group (p = 0.02). Predicted adult height did not change significantly in the testosterone-placebo group, whereas in the testosterone-letrozole group the increase was 5.1 ± 1.2 cm (p = 0.004). Our findings suggest that, if estrogen action is inhibited in growing adolescents, adult height will increase. This observation provides a rationale for studies aimed at delaying bone maturation in several growth disorders.

### Aromatase inhibition: translation into a successful therapeutic approach [^1154A8UF]. Clinical Cancer Research (2005). Low credibility.

The development of the novel third-generation aromatase inhibitors and inactivators for breast cancer treatment is one of the most successful contemporary achievements in cancer therapy. Parallel to studies evaluating toxicity and clinical efficacy in metastatic disease, the endocrine effects of multiple compounds were evaluated, leading to the identification of the highly potent third-generation aromatase inhibitors based on estrogen deprivation and aromatase inhibition in vivo. Thus, translational studies have been of vital importance identifying the unique characteristics of these compounds. Whereas first- and second-generation aromatase inhibitors inhibit estrogen synthesis in vivo by up to 90%, the third-generation compounds anastrozole, exemestane, and letrozole were found to cause ≥ 98% aromatase inhibition. This article summarizes and discusses the "translational research" that provided the background for the implementation of the third-generation aromatase inhibitors and inactivators into large clinical trials. The need for future translational research exploiting the mechanisms of resistance to these compounds for future improvement of endocrine therapy is emphasized.

### Letrozole tablets (letrozole) [^111w1CBe]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The PCA allowed the results of letrozole for 5 years compared with tamoxifen for 5 years to be reported in 2005 after a median follow-up of only 26 months. The design of the PCA is not optimal to evaluate the effect of letrozole after a longer time (because follow-up was truncated in two arms at around 25 months). The MAA (ignoring the two sequential treatment arms) provided follow-up equally as long in each treatment and did not over-emphasize early recurrences as the PCA did. The MAA thus provides the clinically appropriate updated efficacy results in answer to the first primary question, despite the confounding of the tamoxifen reference arm by the selective crossover to letrozole. The updated results for the MAA are summarized in Table 7. Median follow-up for this analysis is 73 months.

The Sequential Treatments Analysis (STA) addresses the second primary question of the study. The primary analysis for the STA was from switch (or equivalent time-point in monotherapy arms) + 30 days (STA-S) with a two-sided test applied to each pair-wise comparison at the 2.5% level. Additional analyses were conducted from randomization (STA-R) but these comparisons (added in light of changing medical practice) were under-powered for efficacy.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^113958sA]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Testosterone suppression in males — effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) manipulation describe composition changes and training responses. Endogenous testosterone blockade in males with a GnRH agonist or antagonist to castrate concentrations results in increased body fat and decreased lean mass. In a randomized controlled trial using a GnRH antagonist plus placebo, low-dose testosterone, typical-dose testosterone, or testosterone with letrozole, decreases in lean mass were primarily due to androgen withdrawal, whereas changes in fat mass were secondary to estrogen withdrawal, and add-back testosterone at low, moderate, and high doses showed that fat-free mass, muscle volume, and strength have a dose-dependent relationship with testosterone. Despite very low levels of circulating testosterone in these hypogonadal individuals, resistance training programs are able to maintain body composition, muscle strength, and aerobic capacity.

### CDK4 / 6 inhibitors: the mechanism of action may not Be as simple as once thought [^116iJzeo]. Cancer Cell (2018). Low credibility.

CDK4/6 inhibitors are among a new generation of therapeutics. Building upon the striking success of the combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors and the hormone receptor antagonist letrozole in breast cancer, many other combinations have recently entered clinical trials in multiple diseases. To achieve maximal benefit with CDK4/6 inhibitors it will be critical to understand the cellular mechanisms by which they act. Here we highlight the mechanisms by which CDK4/6 inhibitors can exert their anti-tumor activities beyond simply enforcing cytostatic growth arrest, and discuss how this knowledge may inform new combinations, improve outcomes, and modify dosing schedules in the future.

### Control of mammary stem cell function by steroid hormone signalling [^115yYosr]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

The ovarian hormones oestrogen and progesterone profoundly influence breast cancer risk, underpinning the benefit of endocrine therapies in the treatment of breast cancer. Modulation of their effects through ovarian ablation or chemoprevention strategies also significantly decreases breast cancer incidence. Conversely, there is an increased risk of breast cancer associated with pregnancy in the short term. The cellular mechanisms underlying these observations, however, are poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that mouse mammary stem cells (MaSCs) are highly responsive to steroid hormone signalling, despite lacking the oestrogen and progesterone receptors. Ovariectomy markedly diminished MaSC number and outgrowth potential in vivo, whereas MaSC activity increased in mice treated with oestrogen plus progesterone. Notably, even three weeks of treatment with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole was sufficient to reduce the MaSC pool. In contrast, pregnancy led to a transient 11-fold increase in MaSC numbers, probably mediated through paracrine signalling from RANK ligand. The augmented MaSC pool indicates a cellular basis for the short-term increase in breast cancer incidence that accompanies pregnancy. These findings further indicate that breast cancer chemoprevention may be achieved, in part, through suppression of MaSC function.

### Letrozole tablets (letrozole) [^112dMMg8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The growth of some cancers of the breast is stimulated or maintained by estrogens. Treatment of breast cancer thought to be hormonally responsive (i.e., estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive or receptor unknown) has included a variety of efforts to decrease estrogen levels (ovariectomy, adrenalectomy, hypophysectomy) or inhibit estrogen effects (antiestrogens and progestational agents). These interventions lead to decreased tumor mass or delayed progression of tumor growth in some women.

In postmenopausal women, estrogens are mainly derived from the action of the aromatase enzyme, which converts adrenal androgens (primarily androstenedione and testosterone) to estrone and estradiol. The suppression of estrogen biosynthesis in peripheral tissues and in the cancer tissue itself can therefore be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme.

Letrozole is a nonsteroidal competitive inhibitor of the aromatase enzyme system; it inhibits the conversion of androgens to estrogens. In adult nontumor- and tumor-bearing female animals, letrozole is as effective as ovariectomy in reducing uterine weight, elevating serum LH, and causing the regression of estrogen-dependent tumors. In contrast to ovariectomy, treatment with letrozole does not lead to an increase in serum FSH. Letrozole selectively inhibits gonadal steroidogenesis but has no significant effect on adrenal mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid synthesis.

Letrozole inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the heme of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of estrogen biosynthesis in all tissues. Treatment of women with letrozole significantly lowers serum estrone, estradiol and estrone sulfate and has not been shown to significantly affect adrenal corticosteroid synthesis, aldosterone synthesis, or synthesis of thyroid hormones.

### Differences between the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole – of clinical importance? [^116CLC3L]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Breast International Group (BIG) 1–98 trial

This large international phase III, randomised, double-blind trial was independently run by the International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG), a cooperative academic group interested in an analysis of letrozole vs tamoxifen in PMW with HR+ breast cancer (ITT: N = 8010; two-arm option: tamoxifen, n = 911, letrozole, n = 917; four-arm option: tamoxifen, n = 1548, letrozole, n = 1546, tamoxifen followed by letrozole, n = 1548, letrozole followed by tamoxifen, n = 1540). The key efficacy endpoints across treatment settings are summarised in Table 2.

Initial results (N = 8010) at a median follow-up of 25.8 months demonstrated the superiority of letrozole over tamoxifen in prolonging DFS and TTR (but not OS). Letrozole-treated patients had a significant early benefit in TTDR, with a 27% reduction in risk for DM at 25.8 months' median follow up. A retrospective study (N = 7707) of BIG 1–98 confirmed these results; there was a pronounced 30% reduction in early DM (at 2 years) with letrozole compared with tamoxifen (87 vs 125 events, respectively). Based on the superiority of letrozole vs tamoxifen at 25.8 months, the IBCSG decided to unblind the tamoxifen monotherapy arm only and to allow patients the choice to crossover to letrozole therapy; 619 (25.2%) made the informed choice (with counseling) to crossover to the letrozole arm. As a result of the crossover, in addition to the ITT analysis, a censored analysis was performed to account for crossover patients. Analysis of ITT patients at a median follow-up of 76 months of letrozole or tamoxifen monotherapy demonstrated a continued significant benefit in DFS (HR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.78–0.99; P = 0.03) and TTDR (HR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.72–1.00; P = 0.05) with letrozole. There were 40 fewer deaths with letrozole, demonstrating an emerging survival benefit (303 vs 343; HR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.75–1.02; P = 0.08). In the censored analysis, accounting for patients who crossed-over to letrozole, letrozole-treated patients had benefit in DFS (HR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74–0.99), TTDR (HR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.68–0.96), and OS (HR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.69–0.94). However, the IBCSG concluded that early crossover to letrozole possibly biased the ITT analysis in favour of tamoxifen and the censored analysis in favour of letrozole, making accurate assessments of OS difficult. To adjust for this potential bias, an additional inverse probability of censoring weighted analysis was carried out to provide a more accurate estimate of the clinical benefit of letrozole. The results demonstrated that 5 years of letrozole significantly improved DFS by 15% (HR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.76–0.96) and OS by 17% (HR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.7–0.97; P < 0.05), reflecting the statistics that might have been observed in the absence of selective crossover. It is important to note that with the emergence of significantly improved treatments, the issue of crossover is being addressed in many trials and is not unique to this trial.

### Aromatase inhibition reduces insulin sensitivity in healthy men [^112XESkj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Accordingly, this study with anastrozole is less susceptible than previous studies with letrozole to the criticism that metabolic sequelae are attributable to T excess rather than estrogen deficiency, although we cannot exclude an effect related to the modest (mean 4.4 nmol/L) rise in total T. In men and postmenopausal women, local generation and action of estradiol in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle is likely to be more physiologically relevant than distant action. Plasma concentration of estradiol does not necessarily reflect tissue concentration, as evidenced by the similar breast tissue levels observed in pre- and postmenopausal women, despite markedly divergent plasma concentrations. In previous aromatase inhibitor studies in men in whom supraphysiological plasma T concentrations were achieved, the greater delivery of substrate androgens may have limited the desired effect of minimizing local estrogen generation and action in target tissues. It would be desirable to directly assess the effects of aromatase inhibition on target tissue sex steroid hormone concentration.

Anastrozole resulted in a significant reduction in total cholesterol, in contrast to previous studies, which have shown the opposite effect upon LDL cholesterol in healthy younger men or no effect in older men with mild hypogonadism. These conflicting findings may reflect differences in the populations studied as well as the less pronounced elevation in plasma T observed in our study.

The rise in systolic BP and lower heart rate observed during aromatase inhibitor treatment was unexpected and contrasts with lower diastolic BP and elevated heart rate as well as reduced baroreflex sensitivity in aromatase knockout mice. Estrogens are likely to exert hemodynamic effects at both a central and peripheral level, potentially in a gender-specific manner, demanding a further detailed assessment of the consequences of aromatase inhibition.

In summary, as hypothesized, in healthy men aromatase inhibition resulted in decreased insulin sensitivity, primarily manifest as reduced peripheral glucose disposal. No significant effects on hepatic glucose production or lipolysis were observed. These results suggest suppression of estrogen action in skeletal muscle is the principal mechanism through which aromatase inhibitors exert a deleterious effect on glucose metabolism. This lends support to the hypothesis that, in male androgen deficiency, insulin resistance is largely a consequence of reduced aromatase substrate availability and consequent local estrogen deficiency in target tissue. The metabolic consequences for patients treated with aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer deserve closer investigation.

### Aromatase inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer [^114E2pXd]. Endocrine Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Estradiol, the most potent endogenous estrogen, is biosynthesized from androgens by the cytochrome P450 enzyme complex called aromatase. Aromatase is present in breast tissue, and intratumoral aromatase is the source of local estrogen production in breast cancer tissues. Inhibition of aromatase is an important approach for reducing growth-stimulatory effects of estrogens in estrogen-dependent breast cancer. Steroidal inhibitors that have been developed to date build upon the basic androstenedione nucleus and incorporate chemical substituents at varying positions on the steroid. Nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors can be divided into three classes: aminoglutethimide-like molecules, imidazole/triazole derivatives, and flavonoid analogs. Mechanism-based aromatase inhibitors are steroidal inhibitors that mimic the substrate, are converted by the enzyme to a reactive intermediate, and result in the inactivation of aromatase. Both steroidal and nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors have shown clinical efficacy in the treatment of breast cancer. The potent and selective third-generation aromatase inhibitors, anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane, were introduced into the market as endocrine therapy in postmenopausal patients failing antiestrogen therapy alone or multiple hormonal therapies. These agents are currently approved as first-line therapy for the treatment of postmenopausal women with metastatic estrogen-dependent breast cancer. Several clinical studies of aromatase inhibitors are currently focusing on the use of these agents in the adjuvant setting for the treatment of early breast cancer. Use of an aromatase inhibitor as initial therapy or after treatment with tamoxifen is now recommended as adjuvant hormonal therapy for a postmenopausal woman with hormone-dependent breast cancer.

### Are differences in the available aromatase inhibitors and inactivators significant? [^117ThStX]. Clinical Cancer Research (2001). Low credibility.

Aromatase inhibitors are endocrine agents with a different mode of action than tamoxifen against breast tumors. In postmenopausal women, estrogen concentrations are maintained primarily via aromatase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme that acts at the final step in the estrogen synthesis pathway. The first clinically available aromatase inhibitor, aminoglutethimide, was introduced for the second-line treatment of advanced breast cancer in the late 1970s. Despite proven efficacy in this setting, its widespread use was limited by its overall toxicity and its lack of selectivity for the aromatase enzyme. This led to the search for novel, more effective, and less toxic aromatase inhibitors. As a result, several aromatase inhibitors with a high degree of selectivity for aromatase and improved tolerability have become clinically available for the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer: (a) anastrozole; (b) letrozole; (c) fadrozole; (d) formestane; and (e) exemestane. Of these, formestane and exemestane are steroidal nonreversible aromatase inhibitors, also known as aromatase inactivators, whereas fadrozole, anastrozole, and letrozole are nonsteroidal reversible aromatase inhibitors. These agents differ in pharmacokinetics, selectivity, and potency, although all are more selective than aminoglutethimide. Some differences in adverse effect profile are also noticeable between and within these two classes of agents. The clinical significance of these differences is not yet evident but may well prove to be relevant in the long-term adjunctive setting.

### Differences between the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole – of clinical importance? [^113XyZds]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Aromatase inhibition is the gold standard for treatment of early and advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women suffering from an estrogen receptor-positive disease. The currently established group of anti-aromatase compounds comprises two reversible aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole and letrozole) and on the other hand, the irreversible aromatase inactivator exemestane. Although exemestane is the only widely used aromatase inactivator at this stage, physicians very often have to choose between either anastrozole or letrozole in general practice. These third-generation aromatase inhibitors (letrozole/Femara (Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland) and anastrozole/Arimidex (AstraZeneca, Pharmaceuticals, Macclesfield, Cheshire, UK)), have recently demonstrated superior efficacy compared with tamoxifen as initial therapy for early breast cancer improving disease-free survival. However, although anastrozole and letrozole belong to the same pharmacological class of agents (triazoles), an increasing body of evidence suggests that these aromatase inhibitors are not equipotent when given in the clinically established doses. Preclinical and clinical evidence indicates distinct pharmacological profiles. Thus, this review focuses on the differences between the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors allowing physicians to choose between these compounds based on scientific evidence. Although we are waiting for the important results of a still ongoing head-to-head comparison in patients with early breast cancer at high risk for relapse (Femara Anastrozole Clinical Evaluation trial; 'FACE-trial'), clinicians have to make their choices today. On the basis of available evidence summarised here and until FACE-data become available, letrozole seems to be the best choice for the majority of breast cancer patients whenever a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor has to be chosen in a clinical setting. The background for this recommendation is discussed in the following chapters.

Considering first-line treatment of metastatic disease, letrozole significantly improved outcome compared with tamoxifen, while for anastrozole, the results were conflicting. In addition, indirect comparison suggests improved efficacy of letrozole versus anastrozole for presurgical therapy. While there is so far no major difference between anastrozole and letrozole monotherapy with respect to improvement of DFS compared with tamoxifen, over 100 months of follow-up, there is no evidence of any improvement in OS for anastrozole compared with tamoxifen. In contrast, a nonsignificant trend (P = 0.08) for improved survival is observed for letrozole at a median follow-up of 76 months. In contrast to patients in the ATAC study, who completed assigned treatment without the option of crossing over, patients in BIG 1–98 were subject to early unblinding of the treatment code, resulting in ∼40% of patients on tamoxifen monotherapy deciding to switch to letrozole. This further highlights potential differences between anastrozole and letrozole with respect to OS benefits.

A similar comparison with respect to biochemical efficacy is not possible between anastrozole or letrozole on the one hand and exemestane on the other as no head-to-head comparison of aromatase inhibition or estrogen suppression between nonsteroidal and steroidal aromatase inhibitors has been carried out. Notably, there is clear evidence of a lack of cross-resistance between nonsteroidal compounds and exemestane; the evidence and potential mechanisms are discussed in detail elsewhere. Indeed, exemestane was as effective as fulvestrant among patients failing nonsteroidal third-generation aromatase inhibitors. Thus, another question for future studies may be the potential benefit of sequential treatment with steroidal and nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors in the adjuvant setting.
