## Question

What is the treatment for distal abdominal aorta ectatic at 2.8cm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate management of a distal abdominal aorta measuring 2.8 cm, described as ectatic, including surveillance, medical therapy, thresholds for escalation, and an explanation of why repair is not indicated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct terminology and how 2.8 cm fits within accepted definitions. Then, I should verify rupture risk and natural history at this size. Next, I will review guideline-supported surveillance intervals. After that, I need to outline core medical risk reduction and modifiable factors. Then, I should confirm clear thresholds for escalation and when to refer to vascular surgery. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like connective tissue disease and ensure the measurement technique is correct before I commit to the plan.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislabel this entity. "Ectatic" at 2.8 cm denotes a mildly enlarged aorta that has not met the anatomic definition of an aneurysm, which in the abdominal aorta typically begins at ≥ 3.0 cm, so this is not an aneurysm by standard criteria, and the term ectasia is often used variably across imaging groups, reinforcing the need to align with guideline size thresholds rather than local radiology phrasing [^116wouoh] [^112t6kUC] [^1173EqWa].

> I need to check rupture risk at this size because that drives surveillance intensity. Wait, let me verify the contemporary data on ectasia in the 2.5–2.9 cm range — these studies consistently show extremely low rupture risk, on the order of about 0.1% over five years, and virtually no aneurysm-related deaths in that window, so immediate repair is not indicated for a 2.8 cm ectatic distal abdominal aorta in the absence of symptoms or high-risk features [^116EbbV3] [^117Cpvg6] [^112u6xAz].

> Next, I should review surveillance intervals. Hold on, I should verify what major guidelines say for 2.8 cm since formal intervals are not always specified below 3.0 cm — ESC 2014 suggests re-screening at 4 years for 2.5–2.9 cm, SVS 2018 suggests considering re-screening at 10 years for 2.6–2.9 cm, and an older prospective cohort supports repeating ultrasound at about 5 years for 2.5–2.9 cm with low risk of progression, so a pragmatic, conservative approach is a repeat ultrasound in 4–5 years, with earlier imaging if new symptoms arise or risk factors change [^113Fixcd] [^117D31Qq] [^117Cpvg6].

> I should confirm that ultrasound is the appropriate modality for surveillance. The Society for Vascular Surgery recommends ultrasound as the preferred modality for AAA screening and surveillance, and I should ensure measurement technique is outer-edge to outer-edge perpendicular to flow to minimize variability, with ECG-gated CT or MRI if precise sizing is needed for suspected rapid change or anatomic complexity [^116by2QD] [^115vSRFU] [^112LcxrH].

> Now, medical management — let me think about cardiovascular risk reduction. A 2.8 cm ectatic abdominal aorta is often a marker of atherosclerotic burden, so I should treat global ASCVD risk aggressively with high-intensity statin therapy when tolerated to achieve LDL reduction > 50% and target LDL < 70 mg/dL when feasible, add antihypertensive therapy to maintain blood pressure at or below 130/80 mmHg, implement smoking cessation with structured support, and reinforce diet, weight, and activity goals. Observational data in thoracic aortic ectasia and atherosclerotic aneurysms support statins for slowing growth and improving outcomes, though evidence in infrarenal ectasia is indirect, so I should frame this as risk-factor modification rather than a proven disease-modifying therapy in ectasia per se [^1149eUM9] [^115f159d].

> But wait, what if risk factors are accelerating progression? I should double-check which features predict progression from ectasia to aneurysm — larger initial diameter, active smoking, and COPD increase risk, so I will document these at baseline and counsel strongly on smoking cessation and pulmonary care, and I may shorten the surveillance interval to 3 years in active smokers or those with COPD given observed higher progression rates in cohort data [^115FVKkA] [^113z9pVz].

> I need to ensure clear escalation thresholds. Hold on, I should verify alignment with guideline repair triggers — repair is not indicated for a 2.8 cm ectatic aorta. Surveillance should transition to standard AAA intervals once the diameter reaches ≥ 3.0 cm (every 3 years), then every 12 months at 4.0–4.9 cm, and every 6 months at ≥ 5.0 cm in men or ≥ 4.5 cm in women, with elective repair typically considered at ≥ 5.5 cm in men and ≥ 5.0 cm in women, or at smaller sizes if rapidly expanding or symptomatic, and referral to vascular surgery is appropriate when the aneurysm threshold is approached or growth exceeds about 0.5 cm in 6 months [^1173EqWa] [^113QRckf] [^116tmPVe] [^111ftsZY].

> Let me consider special populations. If the patient has a heritable thoracic aortic disease such as Marfan, Loeys-Dietz, or vascular Ehlers-Danlos, I should not rely on standard abdominal thresholds, and instead consider earlier intervention at smaller diameters (often around 4.5–5.0 cm depending on syndrome, growth, and anatomy), necessitating baseline and periodic whole-aorta imaging and multidisciplinary care, so I should ask about family history and features suggesting connective tissue disease before finalizing a low-frequency surveillance plan [^113eqzwN] [^114GmFrS] [^114tNKXt].

> Hmm, wait a minute — did I imply there is zero benefit to closer surveillance in all ectatic patients? I should clarify that while rupture risk is negligible, a subset will progress to aneurysm over time, with cohort data suggesting roughly 28% progress over a mean 4.2 years and a mean growth near 0.8 mm/year, which is why I set a default repeat ultrasound at 4–5 years and a shorter interval for smokers or those with COPD rather than abandoning surveillance altogether [^115FVKkA] [^116EbbV3].

> In summary, I should confirm the diagnosis with a standardized ultrasound measurement, repeat imaging in 4–5 years for a 2.8 cm ectatic distal abdominal aorta, implement aggressive cardiovascular risk reduction with high-intensity statin, strict blood pressure control, smoking cessation, and lifestyle modification, monitor more frequently if smoking or COPD are present, and escalate to standard AAA surveillance intervals once ≥ 3.0 cm, with vascular surgery referral as size or growth approaches guideline thresholds. Surgical repair is not indicated at 2.8 cm absent symptoms or high-risk features [^115vSRFU] [^113Fixcd] [^117D31Qq] [^1149eUM9] [^1173EqWa] [^116tmPVe].

For a 2.8 cm distal abdominal aorta, management is **surveillance only** [^117Cpvg6] because this size is below the aneurysm threshold and carries a **negligible rupture risk** [^117Cpvg6]. No **repair or endovascular intervention** is indicated. Ultrasound follow-up in 3–5 years is reasonable, with earlier imaging if clinical status changes or new risk factors emerge [^117Cpvg6] [^113Fixcd]. Optimize cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, lipids, smoking cessation) [^1149eUM9] and address modifiable risks, as no medication slows aortic dilation at this size [^1173XGxC]. Routine referral to vascular surgery is not needed unless the aorta enlarges to ≥ 3.0 cm or the patient becomes symptomatic [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance and natural history

Clinical significance — a 2.8 cm distal abdominal aorta is considered **mildly ectatic** and below the 3.0 cm threshold for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) [^112u6xAz]. Natural history — ectatic aortas of this size have a **negligible rupture risk** and grow slowly (approximately 0.82 mm/year) [^116EbbV3]; most do not progress to aneurysm within 5 years [^116EbbV3].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

- Surveillance — no intervention is recommended for a 2.8 cm distal abdominal aorta; surveillance is the standard approach [^113Fixcd].
- Imaging intervals — ultrasound every 3–5 years is reasonable; earlier imaging if clinical status changes or new risk factors arise [^notfound].
- Repair thresholds — elective repair is not indicated until the diameter reaches ≥ 5.5 cm in men or ≥ 5.0 cm in women, or if rapid growth (> 0.5 cm/year) or symptoms occur [^117PnjVq] [^11127htc].

---

## Medical management and lifestyle modifications

- Blood pressure control — target < 130/80 mmHg to reduce shear stress and slow dilation [^111otkA1].
- Lipid management — high-intensity statins are recommended for atherosclerotic disease to reduce cardiovascular events, though they do not directly slow ectasia growth [^1149eUM9] [^1173XGxC].
- Smoking cessation — strongly recommended to reduce growth and rupture risk [^notfound].
- Cardiovascular risk — optimize overall risk, as ectasia reflects systemic atherosclerosis and increases cardiovascular morbidity [^112u6xAz].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgical intervention is **not indicated** at 2.8 cm. Repair is considered only when the aorta reaches the thresholds above or if the patient becomes symptomatic.

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

- Imaging modality — ultrasound is preferred for surveillance due to safety, cost, and accuracy [^113SA2ts].
- Frequency — ultrasound every 3–5 years; earlier if clinical status changes or new risk factors emerge [^113QRckf].
- Patient education — instruct patients to seek care promptly for new abdominal or back pain, or other concerning symptoms [^111cE85N].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| 2.8 cm distal abdominal aorta | Surveillance ultrasound every 3–5 years |
| Blood pressure control | Target < 130/80 mmHg |
| Lipid management | High-intensity statin if indicated |
| Smoking cessation | Strongly recommended |
| Surgical intervention | Not indicated unless ≥ 5.5 cm (men) or ≥ 5.0 cm (women) or rapid growth/symptoms |

---

A 2.8 cm distal abdominal aorta warrants **surveillance only**, with ultrasound every 3–5 years and aggressive cardiovascular risk factor management [^113Fixcd]. No intervention is indicated unless the aorta enlarges to ≥ 3.0 cm or the patient becomes symptomatic.

Blunt traumatic thoracic aortic injury (BTAI) management patterns and outcomes — Anatomic segments involved include the proximal ascending aorta (8%–27%), aortic arch (8%–18%), and distal descending thoracic aorta (11%–21%). In one series, all grade 1 injuries were managed medically with a 0% mortality rate, and current SVS guidelines recommend expectant management of grade 1 injuries and repair of all other grades. Trauma studies report that 32% of BTAIs are managed nonoperatively with an associated mortality rate of 25%; overall mortality was higher with nonoperative management (35.0% versus 11.2%; P < 0.001) while aortic-related mortality was similar (9.8% versus 5.0%; P = 0.119). Outcomes of grade 1 and 2 injuries were similar between nonoperative management and TEVAR (P > 0.05), whereas grade 3 and 4 BTAIs are at high risk of progression and rupture and should be treated in an urgent manner.

Descending thoracic aorta — natural history and management principles indicate slow average growth (0.19 ± 0.07 cm/year), a historical tipping point around 7 cm, and more recent data showing the tipping point for an exponential rise in rupture risk at 60 mm; rupture of the descending aorta usually occurs above 60 mm and 55–60 mm is an appropriate threshold for descending aortic intervention. Descending aortic dissections rupture only infrequently (< 10%) under proper anti-impulse therapy, and patients with acute dissection involving the descending aorta show an acute increase in diameter with a 23% increase in the proximal thoracic aorta at the index event. Management notes specify that the descending aorta requires specific rules, often ruptures without dissecting, dissection occurs at very small diameters (below 50 or even 40 mm) making a diameter criterion for prevention infeasible, and if endovascular treatment is likely to achieve a favourable result in the presence of high-risk features, lower thresholds are reasonable.

Symptomatic unruptured AAA — Approximately 6% to 22% of treated aneurysms are symptomatic but unruptured. Symptoms considered high risk for impending rupture include pain in the back, abdomen, or flank, sometimes radiating to the groin. Patients presenting with such symptoms should be admitted to an ICU for arterial BP monitoring, tight BP control, medical optimization, and AAA repair, ideally in 24 to 48 hours to reduce risk of free rupture.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture risk by size and evidence base — Historically, the risk of rupture was reported to be 0.5% to 5% for aneurysms ≤ 5 cm in maximum diameter, 3% to 15% for aneurysms 5 cm to 6.9 cm, and ≥ 30% for aneurysms ≥ 8 cm; multiple trials that are now > 2 decades old evaluating early repair for AAAs measuring 4.0 cm to 5.4 cm found no survival benefit but an increased risk of subsequent reintervention; accordingly, a threshold of ≥ 5.5 cm is acceptable for men with infrarenal AAA, women had higher rates of aneurysm rupture and aneurysm-related deaths than men with a mean maximum aneurysm diameter at rupture of 5.0 cm in women and 6.0 cm in men, and in women ASI (aneurysm diameter [cm]/BSA [m2]) has been shown to be more predictive of rupture risk than maximum diameter.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) epidemiology and growth — A complex interplay of hereditary and environmental risk factors contributes to AAA, most notably older age, male sex, smoking, and a positive family history. Lifetime risk for AAA is 8.2% in men and 10.5% in current smokers. At least 10% to 25% of patients with AAA have a family member with the same condition. The growth of AAA is nonlinear, with a mean rate of 2.6 mm/y for AAA < 5.0 cm, and may accelerate in the setting of smoking or a family history of AAA, and smoking may have a greater impact on growth in women than in men. Smoking history is defined as lifetime use of ≥ 100 cigarettes. Ultrasound screening should be targeted toward those at the greatest risk for AAA and growth, with the goal of preventing rupture and associated mortality.

Blunt abdominal aortic injury — approach selection reports that both endovascular and open approaches have been described for BAAI and analyses of large trauma databases reveal no significant differences in mortality rates between the two; aortic zone 2 and 3 injuries appeared to be more amenable to endovascular approaches, while most grade 4 injuries were treated with open surgery; currently, no FDA-approved devices are available specifically for treating trauma in the abdominal aorta, so clinical judgment and experience are paramount when choosing an endovascular solution.

There is variation in the management of small aneurysms in the United States today, with some surgeons moving forward with elective repair and others practice ongoing surveillance. Literature exists to suggest that small aneurysms are repaired at a higher rate than should be considered acceptable, and this represents a deviation from current standards of care. To best understand the optimal care of this patient population, this article aims to evaluate the current management of small aneurysms, review contemporary guidelines and the literature behind them, and assess the appropriateness of surgical management of small aneurysms.

Objective

The European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) has developed clinical practice guidelines for the care of patients with aneurysms of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries in succession to the 2011 and 2019 versions, with the aim of assisting physicians and patients in selecting the best management strategy.

Methods

The guideline is based on scientific evidence completed with expert opinion on the matter. By summarising and evaluating the best available evidence, recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of patients have been formulated. The recommendations are graded according to a modified European Society of Cardiology grading system, where the strength (class) of each recommendation is graded from I to III and the letters A to C mark the level of evidence.

Results

A total of 160 recommendations have been issued on the following topics: Service standards, including surgical volume and training; Epidemiology, diagnosis, and screening; Management of patients with small abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), including surveillance, cardiovascular risk reduction, and indication for repair; Elective AAA repair, including operative risk assessment, open and endovascular repair, and early complications; Ruptured and symptomatic AAA, including peri-operative management, such as permissive hypotension and use of aortic occlusion balloon, open and endovascular repair, and early complications, such as abdominal compartment syndrome and colonic ischaemia; Long term outcome and follow up after AAA repair, including graft infection, endoleaks and follow up routines; Management of complex AAA, including open and endovascular repair; Management of iliac artery aneurysm, including indication for repair and open and endovascular repair; and Miscellaneous aortic problems, including mycotic, inflammatory, and saccular aortic aneurysm. In addition, Shared decision making is being addressed, with supporting information for patients, and Unresolved issues are discussed.

Conclusion

The ESVS Clinical Practice Guidelines provide the most comprehensive, up to date, and unbiased advice to clinicians and patients on the management of abdominal aorto-iliac artery aneurysms.

Ectasia terminology in aortic imaging — Many radiologists use "ectatic" rather than "dilated" to describe a mildly enlarged aorta, others use "ectatic" for an abnormal aortic shape such as a "tortuous" aorta, and some imaging groups use "ectasia" for larger aortas such as those 4.5 cm to 5.4 cm in diameter, which overlaps with what most experts would consider to be an aneurysm. In the coronary arteries, "ectasia" is typically used to describe diffuse (rather than focal) dilation, which may lead to clinical uncertainty when applied to the aorta.

PAU open surgical repair versus endovascular repair — In patients who require repair of a PAU in the ascending aorta or proximal aortic arch (zones 0–1), open surgical repair is recommended (Class 1, Level C‑LD). In patients who require repair of a PAU in the distal aortic arch (zones 2–3), descending thoracic aorta, or abdominal aorta, either open surgical repair or endovascular repair is reasonable, based on anatomy and medical comorbidities (Class 2a, Level C‑LD). Results of open surgical repair of the ascending aorta and proximal arch can be reasonably applied to PAU, but currently there is no FDA‑approved device for endovascular repair of the ascending aorta or proximal arch. The risk of procedure‑related and in‑hospital death is lower for endovascular compared with open repair of PAU in the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta, although longer‑term data are similar for both operative approaches.

Background

Decision-making related to the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is complex. Aneurysms present with varying risks of rupture, and patient-specific factors influence anticipated life expectancy, operative risk, and need to intervene. Careful attention to the choice of operative strategy along with optimal treatment of medical comorbidities is critical to achieving excellent outcomes. Moreover, appropriate postoperative surveillance is necessary to minimize subsequent aneurysm-related death or morbidity.

Methods

The committee made specific practice recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. Three systematic reviews were conducted to support this guideline. Two focused on evaluating the best modalities and optimal frequency for surveillance after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). A third focused on identifying the best available evidence on the diagnosis and management of AAA. Specific areas of focus included (1) general approach to the patient, (2) treatment of the patient with an AAA, (3) anesthetic considerations and perioperative management, (4) postoperative and long-term management, and (5) cost and economic considerations.

Results

Along with providing guidance regarding the management of patients throughout the continuum of care, we have revised a number of prior recommendations and addressed a number of new areas of significance. New guidelines are provided for the surveillance of patients with an AAA, including recommended surveillance imaging at 12-month intervals for patients with an AAA of 4.0 to 4.9 cm in diameter. We recommend endovascular repair as the preferred method of treatment for ruptured aneurysms. Incorporating knowledge gained through the Vascular Quality Initiative and other regional quality collaboratives, we suggest that the Vascular Quality Initiative mortality risk score be used for mutual decision-making with patients considering aneurysm repair. We also suggest that elective EVAR be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality and conversion rate to open surgical repair of 2% or less and that perform at least 10 EVAR cases each year. We also suggest that elective open aneurysm repair be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality of 5% or less and that perform at least 10 open aortic operations of any type each year. To encourage the development of effective systems of care that would lead to improved outcomes for those patients undergoing emergent repair, we suggest a door-to-intervention time of < 90 minutes, based on a framework of 30–30–30 minutes, for the management of the patient with a ruptured aneurysm. We recommend treatment of type I and III endoleaks as well as of type II endoleaks with aneurysm expansion but recommend continued surveillance of type II endoleaks not associated with aneurysm expansion. Whereas antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for patients with an aortic prosthesis before any dental procedure involving the manipulation of the gingival or periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended before respiratory tract procedures, gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures, and dermatologic or musculoskeletal procedures unless the potential for infection exists or the patient is immunocompromised. Increased utilization of color duplex ultrasound is suggested for postoperative surveillance after EVAR in the absence of endoleak or aneurysm expansion.

Conclusions

Important new recommendations are provided for the care of patients with an AAA, including suggestions to improve mutual decision-making between the treating physician and the patients and their families as well as a number of new strategies to enhance perioperative outcomes for patients undergoing elective and emergent repair. Areas of uncertainty are highlighted that would benefit from further investigation in addition to existing limitations in diagnostic tests, pharmacologic agents, intraoperative tools, and devices.

Internal iliac and common iliac artery aneurysms in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) — growth, rupture risk, and outcomes are quantified with post-repair considerations. Common iliac artery aneurysms grew at an average rate of 2.9 mm/y, and no iliac aneurysm ≤ 3.8 cm ruptured; 41.7% of patients with internal iliac artery aneurysms had a concomitant AAA, with 1 rupture at ≤ 3 cm and 4 ruptures at diameters ≤ 4 cm. In the Dutch Surgical Aneurysm Audit (n = 857 treated iliac artery aneurysms), the median size at elective repair was 4.3 cm, whereas ruptures presented at a median 6.8 cm. Meta-analyses reported buttock claudication with unilateral (27%) and bilateral (36%) internal iliac artery exclusion, and a 10% occurrence of erectile dysfunction in men, while other ischemic events were rare at < 1%. In AAA undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), common iliac artery diameter ≥ 18 mm was associated with higher type Ib endoleaks (7.2% versus 3.2%; P = 0.01) and late reinterventions (19% versus 11.8%; P = 0.01), with increased odds of composite EVAR failure (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2–2.7) and need for reintervention (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.15–3.3). After open AAA repair, common iliac arteries ≥ 18 mm tended to dilate over time, warranting consideration of bifurcated grafting rather than aorto-aortic tube grafting.

Acute type A aortic dissection — root management, predictors, and cannulation: A structured algorithmic approach using aortic valve resuspension showed a mortality rate of only 8.1% compared with 23.1% with root replacement, and two meta-analyses reported excellent durability with reoperation rates 1.4% to 2.1% per patient-year and low thromboembolism and bleeding rates (1.4%/patient-year). An aortic root diameter of > 4.5 cm has been shown to be a risk factor for late reintervention. Risk and technique data note that right hemarch replacement was an independent predictor for a favorable surgical outcome, the open-distal technique was associated with better short- and midterm survival than the clamp-on technique but with greater cerebrovascular complications, and superior survival was reported when no cross-clamp use, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, and only antegrade perfusion after aortic perfusion were used; open distal anastomosis is also associated with higher rates of complete false-lumen thrombosis. For arterial access, an STS database study and two meta-analyses found an increased risk of short- and short-term mortality with femoral compared with axillary cannulation; if initial femoral cannulation is required for hemodynamic instability or anatomic constraints, it is recommended to centrally cannulate after the distal anastomosis has been completed to maximize reestablishment of true lumen flow.

### Risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm after ectatic aorta detection from initial screening [^115FVKkA]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Current abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surveillance guidelines lack any follow-up recommendations after initial abdominal aortic screening diameter of less than 3.0 cm. Some reports have demonstrated patients with late AAA formation and late ruptures after initial ultrasound screening detection of patients with an aortic diameter of 2.5 to 2.9 cm (ectatic aorta). The purpose of this study was to determine ectatic aorta prevalence, AAA development, rupture risk, and risk factor profile in patients with detected ectatic aortas in a AAA screening program.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of all patients screened for AAA from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2016, within a regional health care system was conducted. Screening criteria were men 65 to 75 years of age that smoked a minimum of 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. An ectatic aorta was defined as a maximum aortic diameter from 2.5 to 2.9 cm. An AAA was defined as an aortic diameter of 3 cm or greater. Patients screened with ectatic aortas who had subsequent follow-up imaging of the aorta with a minimum of 1-year follow-up were analyzed for associated clinical and cardiovascular risk factors. All data were collected through December 3,/2018. A logistic regression of statistically significant variables from univariate and χ 2 analyses were performed to identify risks associated with the development of AAA from an initially diagnosed ectatic aorta. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess survival data. A P value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

From a screening pool of 19,649 patients, 3205 (16.3%) with a mean age of 72.1 ± 5.3 years were identified to have an ectatic aorta from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2016. The average screening ectatic aortic diameter was 2.6 ± 0.1 cm. There were 672 patients (21.0%) with a mean age of 73.0 ± 5.7 years who received subsequent imaging for other clinical indications and 193 of these patients (28.7%) with ectatic aortas developed an AAA from the last follow-up scan (4.2 ± 2.5 years). The average observation length of all patients was 6.4 ± 2.9 years. No ruptures were reported, but 27.8% of deaths were of unknown cause. One patient had aortic growth to 5.5 cm or greater (0.15%). Larger initial screening diameter (P < .01), presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P < .01), and active smoking (P = 0.01) were associated with AAA development.

Conclusions

Patients with diagnosed ectatic aortas from screening who are active smokers or have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are likely to develop an AAA.

### Screening and management of abdominal aortic aneurysm… [^111Awvv2]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Once an AAA is identified, the question is how to proceed. Periodic surveillance every two to three years is warranted for those with 3. 0- to
3. 9-cm AAAs because they rarely rupture. 6 For 4. 0- to
5. 4-cm AAAs, two clinical trials 7, 8 have demonstrated that immediate surgical repair does not improve overall survival compared with periodic surveillance. Based on these trial outcomes, it is generally safe to refer patients with AAAs of 5. 0 cm or larger. For patients with aortic aneurysms 5. 5 cm or larger in diameter, the risk of rupture increases progressively with size, and mortality with aneurysm rupture is about 80 percent. 9 Elective open surgical repair in those fit for surgery is the accepted standard of care. In coming years, the more unsettled issue will be the role of endovascular repair in the management of AAA. The impetus for developing this technique was the expectation that for aneurysms 5.

5 cm or larger, endovascular repair would reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality, speed recovery, and improve long-term survival compared with open surgical repair. Early results from two European clinical trials. 10, 11 showed that 30-day mortality with endovascular repair in patients with an AAA of 5. 5 cm or larger was substantially lower than for surgical repair. However, in follow-up studies 12–14 from both trials, these early survival advantages disappeared after one to one and one half years. Because endovascular aneurysm repair has risks of late complications, results after four to five years of follow-up will be needed to determine the long-term outcomes with endovascular repair. In a 2005 report 14 from a U. S. endovascular repair registry, more than one half of endovascular repairs were for aneurysms 5. 4 cm or smaller.

Because clinical trials have not shown a survival advantage for early surgical repair compared with periodic surveillance, it is not clear whether endovascular repair for small aneurysms is superior to either. Trials are underway in the United States and Europe to examine this question. How will physicians, given what is and is not known about interventions for AAA, provide the patient with informed advice about options. The physician should encourage surveillance when it is prudent. When intervention is indicated, surgical repair is still the standard of care. When advising patients about the option of endovascular repair, long-term outcomes from ongoing clinical trials should provide the best guidance for the appropriate role of this intervention.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) risk factors and growth — Strong risk factors include smoking history, older age, male sex, and family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, and additional risk factors include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, white race, inherited vascular connective tissue disorder, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Lifetime risk for AAA is 8.2% in men and 10.5% in current smokers, and at least 10% to 25% of patients with AAA have a family member with the same condition. AAA growth is nonlinear, with a mean rate of 2.6 mm/y for AAA < 5.0 cm, may accelerate in the setting of smoking or a family history of AAA, and smoking may have a greater impact on growth in women than in men; ultrasound screening should be targeted toward those at the greatest risk for AAA and growth with the goal of preventing rupture and associated mortality.

Recommendations for aneurysm screening — Randomized trials of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening showed benefit: four trials including 127,891 men and 9342 women aged 65 to 79 years found ultrasound screening reduced aneurysm-related mortality, with benefit beginning within 3 years and persisting up to 15 years, and screening was associated with reduced risk for AAA rupture and emergency surgery. In the MASS trial over 13 years there was a 42% reduction in AAA-related mortality, an estimated 216 men needed to be invited to screening to save one death during 13 years, and roughly half of ruptures had an initial diameter of 2.5 to 2.9 cm. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in 2005 recommended a one-time abdominal ultrasound for men aged 65 to 75 years with a history of smoking, and in 2014 updated to one-time screening for men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked (grade B) with selective screening for those who have never smoked (grade C); screening was not recommended for women aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked (grade D), and evidence was insufficient for women aged 65 to 75 years with a smoking history. In the absence of a smoking history, prevalence drops to 2%; among women of similar age with a past smoking history prevalence is 0.8%, in current smokers prevalence is 5%, and in women who have never smoked AAA prevalence is < 0.60%. Under the SAAAVE amendment, Medicare began offering one-time ultrasound screening for men aged 65 to 75 years if they had smoked ≥ 100 cigarettes and for men and women with a family history of AAA disease as part of the Welcome to Medicare exam, and originally the order could be placed only by the primary care physician within 6 months of activation of Medicare benefits.

### Abstract… [^114cSBhC]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

21, 22 In patients 70 years and younger, these three-month event rates are nearly identical with stenting and endarterectomy. After three months, carotid artery stenting and carotid endarterectomy are equivalent. 23 Carotid endarterectomy within two weeks of symptom onset in patients with carotid artery stenosis greater than 50% reduces the risk of stroke with a number needed to treat of 5 over five years. Transcarotid artery revascularization is a newer surgical approach for carotid stenosis. In transcarotid artery revascularization, carotid artery stents are placed by incising the affected artery. During the procedure, the carotid artery is clamped proximal to the stenosis, and the distal carotid flow is reversed using an extracorporeal circuit to the femoral vein. This protects the cerebral arteries while the backflow removes atherosclerotic debris released from the surgery.

In a single-arm study of transcarotid artery revascularization in patients at high risk of complications from endarterectomy, only 2. 3% of patients experienced stroke or death within 30 days of surgery.
25. CLI and acute limb ischemia are the strongest indications for revascularization. Revascularization is a treatment option for patients with lifestyle-limiting claudication who do not respond to other guideline-directed therapies. Revascularization is not beneficial in patients with incidentally discovered PAD. 3 Surgical interventions, including bypass grafting, endarterectomy, and angioplasty with or without stenting, have similar outcomes based on limited evidence. Endovascular revascularization is associated with fewer complications than bypass grafting; therefore, it may be more appropriate for patients with significant comorbidity and associated increased surgical risk.
32.

33 Renal artery stenting does not improve outcomes compared with optimal medical therapy
34. Despite the lack of prospective evidence, some vascular surgeons recommend considering renal artery revascularization in patients with significant clinical effects from stenosis. Patients with unilateral stenosis, normal renal function, and abrupt onset or worsening of severe hypertension despite more than three antihypertensive medications are typically considered for intervention. Other possible indications for renal artery stenting include patients with bilateral stenosis and rapidly declining renal function and younger patients with fibromuscular dysplasia affecting the renal artery.

### The ectatic aorta: no benefit in surveillance [^111q6Z1r]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

To determine if patients presenting with an infrarenal aorta of 25–30 mm in diameter benefit from continued ultrasound surveillance, and if so to identify the frequency required.

Methods

All patients in the Leicestershire abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening program with an initial AAA diameter of 25–30 mm and who had undergone two or more surveillance scans were identified (345 patients). The primary endpoint was death from AAA rupture, referral for elective repair, or presentation with rupture. This information together with the duration of surveillance was recorded.

Results

A total of 345 patients were followed up for mean of 4.25 years (1–11). At 5 years surveillance, there was a 97% freedom from referral for repair or death from rupture.

Conclusion

Patients presenting with an AAA diameter 25–30 mm may be safely deferred any further surveillance for a period of 5 years.

Penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer (PAU) begins with ulceration of an atherosclerotic plaque leading to focal disruption of the aortic intima that allows blood to penetrate into the medial layer and is often associated with an intramural hematoma (IMH) of variable size. PAUs most often appear in the middle or distal descending thoracic aorta, less frequently in the aortic arch and abdominal aorta, and rarely in the ascending aorta; they can vary in size with multiple PAUs often present, and the true incidence is estimated to account for 2% to 7% of all AAS cases. Patients typically are older (> 70 years of age) and present more often with extensive and diffuse atherosclerotic disease with common comorbidities such as hypertension, tobacco use, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal insufficiency; PAU can also occur in younger patients with connective tissue disorders and men are more commonly affected than women. The natural history is not well defined and can include stability, enlargement, or progression to IMH, dissection, pseudoaneurysm, or aortic rupture, with a reported risk of rupture up to 40%.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)–related aortic aneurysm — statin therapy is addressed with prior guideline direction and supporting data. Based on the AHA/ACC "2018 Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol", a high-intensity statin for > 50% reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) for patients < 75 years of age with clinical ASCVD was recommended, and if a high-intensity statin cannot be used, a moderate-intensity statin can be initiated; the 2016 AHA/ACC peripheral artery disease guideline gave a COR 2a recommendation to achieve an LDL goal of < 70 mg/dL in noncoronary atherosclerotic disease. From the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration, combining 5 RCTs of 39,612 patients over median 5.1 years, more intensive cholesterol lowering reduced major cardiovascular events by an additional 15% beyond less intensive therapy. In nonatherosclerotic-related thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA), statin therapy may prevent growth and adverse remodeling, and a propensity-matched analysis of 1,348 patients with thoracic aortic ectasia showed a possible benefit with statin therapy in the reduction of aortic growth rate as well as aortic complications; in a retrospective cohort of TEVAR for aneurysmal disease including 2,267 patients, 1,148 (64%) received preoperative statins and preoperative statin therapy was associated with significantly lower perioperative complication rates and 5-year mortality.

### Management of abdominal aortic aneurysm disease: similarities and differences among cardiovascular guidelines and NICE guidance [^111ujFQh]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

The development of endovascular techniques has improved abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) management over the past 2 decades. Different cardiovascular societies worldwide have recommended the endovascular approach as the standard of care in their currently available guidelines. While endovascular treatment has established its role in daily clinical practice, a new debate has arisen regarding the indications, appropriateness, limitations, and role of open surgery. To inform this debate, the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched from 2010 to May 2020; the systematic search identified 5 articles published between 2011 and 2020 by 4 cardiovascular societies and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Four debatable domains were assessed and analyzed: diagnostic methods and screening, preoperative management, indications and treatment modalities, and postoperative follow-up and endoleak management. The review addresses controversial proposals as well as widely accepted recommendations and "gray zone" issues that need to be further investigated and analyzed, such as screening in women, medical management, and follow-up imaging. While the recommendations for AAA management have significant overlap and agreement among international cardiovascular societies, the NICE guidelines diverge regarding the role of open repair in aortic disease, recommending conventional surgery in most elective cases.

Small abdominal aortic aneurysms, up to 5.5 cm in diameter, are very common. Ultrasonography is the most cost-effective method of detecting these aneurysms and keeping them under surveillance, because the natural history is 1 of continued expansion. The expansion rate is in the range 0.25 to 0.35 cm/y and is fastest in current smokers. From a study of expansion rates, it has been possible to formulate guidelines for the intervals at which surveillance should occur. Although the evidence from randomized trials indicates that early, open, elective surgery for small aneurysms does not save lives, when aneurysms exceed 5.5 cm in diameter, either open or endovascular surgery is recommended. To prevent small aneurysms reaching the 5.5-cm threshold, new treatments to reduce the expansion rate by > 50% need to be designed, based on the underlying pathologic processes: proteolysis and inflammation. Any proposed treatments, including statins, will need to be tested in clinical trials.

Thoracic aortic dimensions and aneurysm management in asymptomatic screening populations — Normal aortic size increases with age, with at 70 years of age the normal ascending aorta 3.5 cm and the descending aorta 2.7 cm; the upper limit of normal is 4.2 and 3.2 cm, respectively. Aortic enlargement should not be called an aneurysm until the size is > 50% larger than normal, and there is no evidence of benefit or recommendation for screening individuals for thoracic aortic aneurysm unless there is a clear family history or known genetic defect associated with aortic disease. Measurement should be of the outside of the aorta in a plane strictly perpendicular to the blood flow. Management of BP and lipids is recommended for individuals with an aneurysm to decrease the rate of further expansion, but the data come primarily from patients with familial risk, and there is little evidence to suggest that reporting mild/moderate aortic dilation affects health outcomes. Monitoring recommendations include annually or biannually based on size, type, and location in the context of annual lung cancer screening, and consideration of surgical repair is recommended for patients with an ascending or descending aortic size of ≥ 5.5 cm (unless there is a familial syndrome).

PAU open surgical repair versus endovascular repair — In patients who require repair of a PAU in the ascending aorta or proximal aortic arch (zones 0–1), open surgical repair is recommended, while in patients who require repair of a PAU in the distal aortic arch (zones 2–3), descending thoracic aorta, or abdominal aorta, either open surgical repair or endovascular repair is reasonable, based on anatomy and medical comorbidities. Midterm outcomes after endovascular repair of PAU have shown a 4% to 8% risk of endoleak and a 5% risk of new PAU formation, and one-year mortality rates for patients treated with endovascular versus open repair are similar. Results of open surgical repair of the ascending aorta and proximal arch can be reasonably applied to PAU; although cases of ascending aortic stenting have been reported, currently there is no FDA-approved device for endovascular repair of the ascending aorta or proximal arch, and the risk of procedure-related and in-hospital death is lower for endovascular compared with open repair of PAU in the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta, although longer-term data are similar for both operative approaches.

ACC/AHA 2022 — Initial management of blunt traumatic abdominal aortic injury (BAAI) provides directive statements as follows: In patients with grade 1 to 2 BAAI without malperfusion, anti-impulse therapy, if clinically tolerated, and repeat imaging is recommended to reduce risk of injury progression. In patients with grade 4 BAAI, repair should be performed to address life-threatening aortic injury. In patients with grade 2 BAAI and associated malperfusion, it is reasonable to consider repair. In patients with BAAI, treatment with either endovascular or open repair is reasonable and depends on degree of injury, aortic anatomy, and the patient's overall clinical status. In patients with grade 3 BAAI, it may be reasonable to consider repair to reduce risk of progression to life-threatening injury. In patients with BAAI, the usefulness of routine application of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) for hemorrhage control is unclear and, in some cases, may cause harm.

Ascending aortic dilation and aneurysm thresholds — Increase in risk at 4.0 cm to 4.4 cm is used to justify classifying the aorta as dilated, and an abrupt increase at a diameter of ≥ 4.5 cm is used to justify classifying it as an aneurysm; using this approach, of the MESA database subjects, only 2.6% would be considered to have a dilated aorta and only 0.2% to have an aneurysm. A dilated ascending aorta being ≥ 4.0 cm is stated and is consistent with guidance in which aortic dilation was defined as an aorta diameter of > 4.0 cm. In clinical settings the term dilation is preferred to ectasia for mild aortic enlargement, but some imaging groups use ectasia for larger aortas such as 4.5 cm to 5.4 cm, which overlaps with what most experts would consider an aneurysm.

Loeys-Dietz syndrome imaging — baseline and surveillance: In patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, a baseline TTE is recommended to determine the diameters of the aortic root and ascending aorta, and 6 months thereafter to determine the rate of aortic growth; if the aortic diameters are stable, annual surveillance TTE is recommended. In patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome and a dilated or dissected aorta and/or arterial branches at baseline, annual surveillance imaging of the affected aorta and arteries with MRI or CT is recommended. In patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, a baseline MRI or CT from head to pelvis is recommended to evaluate the entire aorta and its branches for aneurysm, dissection, and tortuosity. In patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome without dilation of the aorta distal to the aortic root or ascending aorta and without dilated or dissected arterial branches, surveillance imaging from chest to pelvis with MRI (or CT) every 2 years is reasonable, but imaging may be more frequent depending on family history. In patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome without dilation of the cerebral arteries on initial screening, periodic imaging surveillance for cerebral aneurysms with MRI or CT every 2 to 3 years is reasonable.

Marfan syndrome interventions — replacement of primary (nondissected) aneurysms of the aortic arch, descending, and abdominal aorta: In patients with Marfan syndrome and a nondissected aneurysm of the aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, or abdominal aorta of ≥ 5.0 cm, surgical intervention to replace the aneurysmal segment is reasonable. Using a 5.0-cm diameter threshold for surgery, as is used for the aortic root, is reasonable, and in patients at acceptable risk for operative repair or with a long life expectancy, operative intervention to resect primary (nondissected) aneurysms involving the arch, descending, or abdominal aorta is reasonable at an aortic diameter threshold of ≥ 5.0 cm, depending on the patient's age, rate of aortic growth, family history, and surgical risk. Type B aortic dissection occurs in about 10% of Marfan patients, often in the absence of significant dilation of the descending aorta.

### Editor's choice-risk of rupture and all cause mortality of abdominal aortic ectasia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116EbbV3]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To clarify the natural history of abdominal aortic ectasia (AAE) measuring 25–29 mm in maximum diameter, and to determine the optimal follow up based on the growth, risk of rupture, and overall mortality of AAE.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, and Google Scholar.

Review Methods

This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of AAE in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, and Google Scholar were searched, with the help of a health sciences librarian, up to 11 August 2021. Studies with longitudinal outcomes of AAE (prevalence, annual growth rate, aneurysmal enlargement, rupture, aneurysm related death, and all cause mortality) were included. Meta-analyses were conducted with a random effects model RESULTS: Twelve studies describing a total of 8 369 patients were eligible. The prevalence at population based settings was 3.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4–4.0); annual growth rate was 0.82 mm/year (95% CI 0.20–1.45). The estimated risks of aortic diameters exceeding 30 mm and 55 mm in five years were 45.0% (95% CI 28.5–61.5) and 0.3% (95% CI 0–0.6) respectively, while those beyond five years were 70.2% (95% CI 46.9–93.6) and 5.2% (95% CI 2.2–8.2). The rates of rupture and aneurysm related death were minimal until five years (0.1% and 0.1%, respectively) and beyond (0.4% and 0.2%, respectively). Overall mortality was 7.5% (95% CI 3.9–11.0) and 17.3% (95% CI 9.5–25.1) up to and beyond five years. Overall mortality from three studies showed no statistical difference between AAE and aneurysms (hazard ratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.32–1.21; p = .16). Cancer (35.0%) and cardiovascular diseases (31.9%) were major causes of death.

Conclusion

AAE carries minimal risk of aneurysm related lethal events during the first five years, but a similar overall mortality risk as abdominal aortic aneurysm. Cancer and cardiovascular diseases are leading causes of death in patients with AAE.

AAA rupture risk and size thresholds — Historically, rupture risk was 0.5% to 5% for aneurysms < 5 cm, 3% to 15% for 5 cm to 6.9 cm, and ≥ 30% for ≥ 8 cm. Trials did not find a survival benefit for repair of aortic aneurysms measuring 4.0 cm to 5.4 cm, and based on these data a threshold of ≥ 5.5 cm is acceptable for men with infrarenal AAA. The mean maximum aneurysm diameter at rupture was 5.0 cm in women and 6.0 cm in men. Indexing aneurysm size to body surface area using aneurysm size index (ASI equals aneurysm diameter [cm]/BSA [m^2]) has in women been shown to be more predictive of rupture risk than maximum diameter.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm management thresholds and evidence — Some controversy exists regarding treatment strategies for patients who present with an AAA between 4.0 and 5.4 cm, and in UKSAT and ADAM the 30-day operative mortality in the immediate surgery groups (5.5% UKSAT, 2.1% ADAM) led to an early disadvantage in survival with no statistically significant difference in long-term survival between the immediate OSR and surveillance groups. Currently, nearly 80% of all AAAs are treated by endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in the United States. The CAESAR and PIVOTAL trials compared immediate EVAR with surveillance for AAAs between 4.1 and 5.4 cm and 4.0 and 5.0 cm and found no survival benefit for early EVAR, and a Cochrane database review demonstrated no advantage to immediate repair by open surgery or EVAR for small AAAs (4.0–5.5 cm). Patients with an asymptomatic fusiform AAA > 5.4 cm should be considered for repair and surveillance is recommended for smaller aneurysms, with an individualized approach for patients with an AAA > 5.4 cm who are of advanced age or have significant comorbid conditions, while young, healthy patients, particularly women, with an AAA between 5.0 and 5.4 cm or those with rapid expansion of small fusiform AAAs may benefit from early repair.

Early detection of abdominal aortic aneurysms potentially can save many lives by preventing aneurysm rupture. Screening programs, however, have yet to be proven as an efficient means of accomplishing this goal and improving overall life expectancy. Until more information is available, selective high-risk screening may be the only viable option. Recently, 2 large prospective studies have better defined the utility of screening programs and have provided guidelines for the safe nonoperative management of small aneurysms. Using ultrasound surveillance, these can be followed up at 3- to 12-month intervals, depending on their size, with operative intervention reserved for aneurysms that enlarge rapidly, become symptomatic, or reach 5.5 cm in diameter.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) morphology and growth — risk features and thresholds are detailed, noting saccular AAAs are rare with limited natural history data, and in a Dutch registry 7,659 patients with AAA included 6.1% saccular AAA; among saccular aneurysms with acute presentation, 25% had diameters < 5.5 cm and 8.4% had diameters < 4.5 cm, whereas in fusiform AAA these were 8.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Pooled surveillance data show growth rates range from 1.5 mm/y to 2 mm/y for AAA of 3.0 cm to 3.9 cm and from 3.3 mm/y to 5.7 mm/y for AAA of 4.0 cm to 5.9 cm at baseline; major early-treatment trials excluded aneurysms that grew ≥ 7 mm in 6 months or > 10 mm in 12 months. Accordingly, aneurysms with size increases of ≥ 0.5 cm in 6 months or ≥ 1 cm in 1 year are considered rapidly growing and may warrant consideration of repair, and elective repair for patients presenting with saccular AAA is recommended by the Society for Vascular Surgery although specific size guidance is lacking.

### Fate of the ectatic infrarenal aorta: expansion rates and outcomes [^117Cpvg6]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The natural history of the ectatic infrarenal aorta remains undetermined. While surveillance protocols have been proposed for true aneurysms, no recommendations are currently available for ectatic aortas. The purpose of this study is to define the natural history and recommend surveillance protocols for the infrarenal aorta 2.5–2.9 cm in diameter. Screening of 12,500 yielded 223 patients with an infrarenal abdominal aorta 2.5–2.9 cm in diameter at a university-affiliated VA medical center. All patients were prospectively followed by ultrasound from August 1993 through October 2000 and expansion rates were calculated by comparing the first and last study. Multivariate analysis of risk factors classically associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm was performed. Current data suggest that ectatic infrarenal aortas expand slowly, do not rupture, and rarely meet criteria for operative repair. No risk factors linked to the development of aneurysms were identified. On the basis of this study we recommend that patients with ectatic aortas have a repeat ultrasound 5 years after the initial study.

### Long term outcomes in men screened for abdominal aortic aneurysm: prospective cohort study [^112u6xAz]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this study, baseline screening identified 5.1% of men with an aneurysm (≥ 30 mm) and 8.2% with an aortic diameter of 25–29 mm, which has been termed ectatic aorta. A previous study found a prevalence of 7.5% of ectatic aorta in a similar aged cohort using similar criteria for diameter, but included a distal renal/aortic antero-posterior diameter ratio of more than 1.2 as an alternative definition. A key issue dealt with by our study is whether men with an ectatic aorta have an excess risk of poor outcomes. The mortality rate in our cohort during follow-up was low and deaths due to aneurysm were rare. However, increasing aortic diameter at screening was associated with increased mortality from vascular disease or cancer and increased risk of hospital admissions, mainly related to circulatory and respiratory diseases and certain forms of cancer. The increased morbidity was noted not only in those with aortic aneurysm at initial screening but also in those with ectatic aortas, a small proportion of whom were also discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of aneurysm during follow-up. These relations held after adjustment for several potential confounders.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm surveillance — Surveillance imaging should use ultrasound examinations unless other imaging modalities are specifically indicated. Some authors have suggested that there is no need to observe patients with an initial aortic diameter < 3 cm, given their low risk for rupture; however, in a 12-year analysis of 1121 men 65 years of age or older, 13.8% of aortas with an initial diameter of 2.6 to 2.9 cm exceeded 5.5 cm at 10 years. Among patients with an aortic diameter between 3.0 and 3.4 cm, 21% had reached 5.5 cm at 3 years; and of those with a diameter between 3.5 and 3.9 cm, 10.5% exceeded 5.5 cm or required surgery within 2 years, with rupture occurring in 1.4%. Two randomized controlled trials and a follow-up study demonstrated that a policy of surveillance until aneurysm diameter exceeds 5.5 cm is safe and associated with a rupture rate of 1% per year.

Kommerell's diverticulum — association, imaging, measurement, and size thresholds are described as follows: Variant aortic arch anatomy is associated with thoracic aortic aneurysm/disease, including "33% of patients with right-sided aortic arch having concomitant TAA" and that an aberrant right subclavian artery "occurred in 2% to 8% of those patients"; if an aberrant subclavian artery is detected without thoracic aorta imaging, "a dedicated CT or MRI to evaluate for an associated aortic aneurysm is reasonable". Reported rupture/dissection has occurred for diverticula "ranging from 4.0 cm to 10 cm (mean size, 5.0 cm)". For assessment, "2 diameter measurements should be obtained" on cross-sectional imaging — the "diverticulum orifice" and the "combined diameter of the diverticulum and adjacent descending thoracic aorta" — and repair "has been suggested when the orifice diameter is ≥ 3 cm or the combined diameter of the diverticulum and adjacent descending thoracic aorta is > 5.0 cm". Additional context notes it "may be present in 20% to 60% of patients with an aberrant right or left subclavian artery", with rupture/dissection risk "as high as 50% in case series", and that separate guidelines "recommend surgical intervention… when the diverticulum orifice is > 3.0 cm" or the combined diameter "is > 5.0 cm".

### 2014 ESC guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of aortic diseases: document covering acute and chronic aortic diseases of the thoracic and abdominal aorta of the adult. the task force for the diagnosis and treatment of aortic diseases of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [^113Fixcd]. European Heart Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for abdominal aortic aneurysm, more specifically with respect to indications for rescreening, ESC 2014 guidelines recommend to consider re-screening patients with an abdominal aortic diameter of 2.5–2.9 cm after 4 years.

Abdominal aortic and iliac aneurysms — rupture risk thresholds, surveillance, and repair: CLASS I — Patients with infrarenal or juxtarenal AAAs measuring 5.5 cm or larger should undergo repair to eliminate the risk of rupture (Level of Evidence: B). CLASS I — Patients with infrarenal or juxtarenal AAAs measuring 4.0 to 5.4 cm in diameter should be monitored by ultrasound or computed tomographic scans every 6 to 12 months to detect expansion (Level of Evidence: A). CLASS IIa — Repair can be beneficial in patients with infrarenal or juxtarenal AAAs 5.0 to 5.4 cm in diameter, and repair is probably indicated in patients with suprarenal or type IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms larger than 5.5 to 6.0 cm (Level of Evidence: B). CLASS IIa — In patients with AAAs smaller than 4.0 cm in diameter, monitoring by ultrasound examination every 2 to 3 years is reasonable (Level of Evidence: B). CLASS III — Intervention is not recommended for asymptomatic infrarenal or juxtarenal AAAs if they measure less than 5.0 cm in diameter in men or less than 4.5 cm in diameter in women (Level of Evidence: A).

Ascending aortic diameter — risk thresholds, definitions, and prevalence: Aortic repair would be recommended at a diameter of ≤ 5.0 cm, even though this size would not be large enough to be termed an aneurysm. In 201 patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) followed for 10 to 15 years, baseline diameters of 4.5 cm to 4.9 cm were associated with a significantly increased risk of aneurysm, dissection, or sudden death (P < 0.001) compared with < 4.5 cm. To assess risk below the traditional 5.5 cm threshold for prophylactic aortic repair, analysis of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) reported that, relative to ≤ 3.4 cm, a diameter of 4.0 cm to 4.4 cm conferred an 89-fold increased risk of dissection, and a diameter of ≥ 4.5 cm conferred a 6,000-fold increased risk. These data support defining 4.0 cm to 4.4 cm as dilated and ≥ 4.5 cm as aneurysm, with only 2.6% of MESA subjects having a dilated aorta and only 0.2% an aneurysm. This definition of a dilated ascending aorta being ≥ 4.0 cm is consistent with guidance defining aortic dilation as an aortic diameter of > 4.0 cm, and in clinical settings the term dilation is preferred to ectasia for mild aortic enlargement.

ACC/AHA abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surveillance — ultrasound intervals by diameter are specified as follows: In patients with an AAA of 3.0 cm to 3.9 cm, surveillance ultrasound is recommended every 3 years to assess for interval change. In men with an AAA of 4.0 cm to 4.9 cm and in women with an AAA of 4.0 cm to 4.4 cm, surveillance ultrasound is recommended annually to assess for interval change. In men with an AAA of ≥ 5.0 cm and women with an AAA of ≥ 4.5 cm, surveillance ultrasound is recommended every 6 months to assess for interval change.
