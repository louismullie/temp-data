## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how a $1 million cash withdrawal from a checking account affects the money supply, given a 10% reserve ratio, and which answer choice correctly reflects that impact. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial effect of converting bank deposits to cash in terms of the money supply. Then, I should verify the money multiplier and whether the withdrawal triggers a reverse multiplier effect. Next, I will reconcile the immediate versus potential total contraction to avoid overstatement. Finally, I will match the correct option and briefly note why the alternatives are incorrect.

> Let me first confirm the immediate, direct effect: when Mommy Morebucks withdraws $1 million from her checking account, bank deposits fall by $1 million and currency in circulation rises by $1 million, so the total money supply (currency plus deposits) is unchanged at first glance. Wait, let me verify that I'm not conflating "money in circulation" with "currency in circulation"; the question is about money in circulation, which typically includes both currency and deposits, so the net immediate effect on M1 is zero before any bank response.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the multiplier. I initially thought the money multiplier of 10 would mean a $1 million withdrawal could shrink the money supply by $9 million, but that would only be true if the banking system responded by contracting loans and deposits by the full multiplier amount, which is a potential, not guaranteed, secondary effect. I should double-check the mechanics: the money multiplier is 1/reserve ratio, so 1/0.10 = 10, meaning the banking system could theoretically support up to $10 million in deposits for every $1 million in reserves; conversely, losing $1 million in reserves could, under textbook assumptions, lead to a $10 million contraction of deposits, implying a $9 million net decrease in the money supply after accounting for the $1 million cash now held by the public. But wait, I need to ensure I'm not overstating this as the immediate effect; the $9 million figure represents the potential total contraction if banks fully adjust lending and the public's cash holdings remain outside deposits, not the instantaneous change.

> Let me reconsider the question's wording. The question asks how the withdrawal potentially impacts money in circulation, and the most accurate interpretation is the potential total contraction of the money supply, not the immediate zero-net change. Under standard fractional-reserve assumptions and ceteris paribus, the banking system would reduce loans and deposits by a multiple of the lost reserves, leading to a total money-supply decrease of roughly $9 million, with $1 million of that represented by cash now held by the public and $8 million by the reduction in deposits. I should confirm that this aligns with the classic money-multiplier logic, which it does.

> Next, I should review the options and pick the best fit. Option A states the money in circulation decreases by $9 million, which matches the potential total contraction of the money supply after the banking system's adjustment. Option B reflects only the $1 million deposit loss and ignores the multiplier effect. Option C understates the impact. Option D incorrectly suggests an increase, which would contradict the reserve-contraction mechanism. Therefore, the correct choice is A, recognizing that the $9 million figure is the potential total decrease, not the instantaneous change.

> In summary, I need to ensure I'm precise: the immediate swap of deposits for currency leaves M1 unchanged, but the potential, policy-relevant impact of the reserve loss is a multiplied contraction of deposits, yielding a net decrease in the money supply of about $9 million, which is why the answer is A.

---

The correct answer is **A. Decreases it by $9 million**. When Mommy Morebucks withdraws $1 million from her checking account and holds it as cash, the bank loses $1 million in reserves, which — with a 10% reserve ratio — forces a **$10 million contraction in deposits** via the money multiplier. Because $1 million is now cash outside the banking system, the net decrease in money in circulation is **$9 million**.

---

## Step-by-step explanation

### Initial withdrawal and immediate impact

The immediate effect is that **$1 million is converted from bank deposits to cash**, so deposits fall by $1 million and currency in circulation rises by $1 million; the total money supply is unchanged at this moment.

---

### The money multiplier effect

With a 10% reserve ratio, the **money multiplier is 10** (1 ÷ 0.10). This means the banking system can create $10 in deposits for every $1 in reserves. Conversely, losing $1 million in reserves forces a $10 million reduction in deposits.

---

### Calculation of the total impact

- **Total deposit contraction**: $1 million (lost reserves) × 10 (money multiplier) = $10 million.
- **Net change in money supply**: $10 million (deposit contraction) − $1 million (cash withdrawal) = **$9 million decrease**.

---

### Why the other options are incorrect

- **Option B ($1 million decrease)**: This only accounts for the initial withdrawal, ignoring the multiplier effect.
- **Option C ($100,000 decrease)**: This is a miscalculation and underestimates the impact.
- **Option D (increases by $1 million)**: This is incorrect because the withdrawal reduces bank reserves and triggers a larger contraction in deposits.

---

## Conclusion

The withdrawal **reduces money in circulation by $9 million** due to the money multiplier effect, making option A correct.

In turn, note that there are several candidates for quantifying the social rate of discount, including the consumption rate of discount and the social and private rates of return to investment. These three quantities are closely-related, and, in a perfectly competitive market, they become equal and reflect the marginal productivity of capital. In this study, as in numerous related studies, the focus is on the consumption rate of discount, which is the rate of decline in the marginal contribution of consumption to social welfare. In other words, the corresponding discount factor specifies how many units of consumption added at present would have the same effect on social welfare as a single unit added at time t. In turn when the welfare depends on multiple goods, the discount may depend on the particular good that the policymaker considers. (This simply reflects the relative price changes of the goods.) Therefore, to define discount in our system, we consider a small, marginal perturbation to both c and f. Specifically, we consider a given currency unit, a dollar, that allows the consumption of exactly με units of the natural resource and (1 − μ) ε units of the other goods, where 0 ≤ μ ≤ 1 and ε ≪ c (0), f (0). Accordingly, we define the discount factor at time t as the number of dollars needed at present to compensate for a lack of one dollar at time t. This implies that the discount rate, δ (t), is given by (Supplementary Note 1)where subscripts in this equation denote partial derivatives and the discount factor is given by exp(−Δ). The right side of Eq. 5, without the term ρ, is due to the change in the marginal contribution of c and f to social welfare. (Note that, if μ = 0 and d c / d t = cg c, then Eq. 5 becomes the Ramsey's discount formula, δ (t) = ηg c + ρ, where η ≡ cu c / u cc.) In turn, if μ reflects the portion in society's basket of goods allocated to consumption of the natural resource, then our definition is consistent with the way the marginal productivity of capital is measured, and the total product (e.g. GDP) is proportional to the total value of all the goods (Supplementary Note 1, Eq. A11). Alternatively, if we are interested in discounting some climate damage, then we can chose μ to be proportional to the cost that is due to the damage to the natural resource. Note, however, that the choice of μ only determines the units and does not affect the value given to future goods. Specifically, if the proportion of damages to the natural resource differs from μ, then one should consider the changes in relative prices in addition to discounting. For example, several authorsconsidered a dual discounting framework in which the natural resource is discounted with μ = 0 and the manufactured goods with μ = 1, where the change in the relative price accounts for the difference; this approach is equivalent to the one presented here.

### Cognitive resilience / reserve: myth or reality? A review of definitions and measurement methods [^03564394]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

7.1 Final discussion and conclusions

This review demonstrates that the concept of reserve has widely been used to explain the variability in outcomes related to brain physiological and pathological aging. Exploring the mechanisms underpinning CR can potentially lead to intervention strategies aimed at slowing down or preventing cognitive decline. In fact, research evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that individuals with greater CR have a better resilience and capacity to deal with age‐related neurodegenerative brain changes. This suggests a positive impact of this model on the clinical trajectory of the disease. However, the precise mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain still unclear. Over the last decades, several studies have evaluated possible mechanisms involved in these processes without reaching generalizable results.

Up to date, it is postulated that individuals with substantial CR and BR when impacted by neurodegenerative pathological changes may encounter a delayed onset of dementia and experience a slower disease progression. Cognitive symptoms may emerge later in life, leading to a more gradual decline compared to individuals with a lower reserve. Our considerations are addressed to two other different possibilities. On the one hand, the question arises when considering individuals with elevated CR but low BR: Which factor takes precedence? In such cases, it is conceivable that they may face a delayed onset of neurodegenerative diseases due to the protective effects of CR. However, once symptoms manifest, the limited BR may hinder the structural capacity to compensate for damage. This scenario could result in a rapid cognitive decline despite the delayed onset, as the brain grapples with pathological changes. On the other hand, the debate is still open on what happens when both CR and BR are low. Individuals in this category may be more susceptible to an early onset of neurodegenerative diseases, because a low CR suggests a lack of capacity for compensatory mechanisms. Additionally, low BR implies limited structural resilience against pathological changes. Therefore, this dual deficiency may contribute to an early and rapidly progressing course of the disease. Adding a perspective on the static nature of BR and the dynamicity of CR, it is crucial to note that BR tends to remain relatively stable throughout an individual's life. In contrast, CR exhibits a dynamic quality, influenced by ongoing cognitive stimulation, education, and engagement in mentally stimulating activities. Static and dynamic CR indexes are proposed to denote distinct facets of reserve that do not function independently but, much like interconnected elements within a matrix, intricately contribute to the overall functioning of the reserve system. The static CR indexes could represent one facet, like the rows or columns of a matrix, while the dynamic CR indexes could represent another facet, forming a comprehensive and interrelated network. Together, these components create a complex system where each element, like cells in a matrix, plays a crucial role in the overall resilience and individual functioning of CR. Thus, within this system, crystallized cognitive abilities and current cognitive efficiency interact dynamically with brain atrophy in memory‐related networks and relays. This interplay emphasizes the multifaceted nature of CR, encompassing both stable, well‐established factors and dynamic, adaptive components. Together, they contribute synergistically to an individual's cognitive well‐being and resilience against neurodegenerative processes. This dynamic nature suggests that interventions targeting CR can be implemented at various stages of life, offering opportunities for enhancement even in later years.

Choice of parameters

The parameter values used for all of the numerical simulations, which are given in the Source Data file, are within their realistic ranges. The rate of technological growth is around 1.5–2.0% year −1 in developed countries and is higher in some developing countries. In turn, the rate of growth in the yield per unit of sustainable harvest, g f, depends on the specific natural resource, where values that were considered in the literature vary from g c down to much lower (even negative) values. Next, the value of 0 ≤ a ≤ 1 (unitless) also depends on the particular system. In a fishery, for example, if non-sustainable harvest would imply catching all the fish and sustainable harvest would imply keeping the fish population size fixed, then a would be the growth rate of the fish (i.e. 2% year −1 for large fish and higher rates for smaller fish); In agriculture, sustainable management implies the use of environmentally friendly pest control methods and effective water management, which may result in a comparable crop yield (α ≲ 1), but may be more expensive (λ > 1). In turn, the ratio between c (t) and the direct costs, C 1 and C 2 (Eq. 9), determines the relative portion of c that is needed per unit of harvest. Specifically, c (and thus the ratio) is initially small but increases due to technological changes. Also, C 1 and C 2 may vary with x 1 and x 2 if the cost varies among regions (e.g. if near-shore regions are depleted, the average direct cost of harvest may increase). Next, note that 0 ≤ μ ≤ 1 (unitless) can be chosen arbitrarily by the policymaker, as it does not affect the harvest strategy and the future value of the natural resource; rather, it determines the currency unit, which, in turn, determines the relative role of the discount and the price in determining the future value of the natural resource. A reasonable choice would be the portion in the basket of goods of the natural resource (e.g. the portion of agricultural products in consumption is ~5% in the United States and is higher in various developing countries), but μ may be higher if non-market goods are incorporated. Finally, a variety of utility functions that incorporate both c and f were suggested in the literature, including the two that are used here (Eqs. B2, B10), where estimates of η vary between 1 and 3 (unitless), and suggested values for ρ varies between 0 and 3% (year −1).

### Over-exploitation of natural resources is followed by inevitable declines in economic growth and discount rate [^b5e34a15]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Over-harvesting is followed by declines in the discount rate

Following the optimal solution in which the harvest functions maximize social welfare, two phases emerge along the time axis (Fig. 2a, b). In the first phase (t < t 0), c (t) is initially small, and the harvest rates are limited due to the direct cost of harvesting (Methods, Eq. 9). Over time, as c (t) increases, the direct cost plays a less significant role, and the harvest rates increase. Consequently, f (t) increases at a rate that is greater than g f, and the discount rate approximately follows Ramsey's formula. In the second phase (t > t 0), the entire ecosystem is under harvest (either sustainable or non-sustainable). Therefore, the society cannot increase f via harvesting without increasing the non-sustainable harvest (i.e. increasing H n), which would negatively affect the resource's future provision. Consequently, the non-sustainable harvest decreases exponentially and c (t) and f (t) increase at approximately the rates of their technological developments, namely, and. This implies that, if g f < g c, the discount rate in the second phase is lower than it was in the first phase (Eqs. B6, B13, Supplementary Note 2). Note that the optimal solution comprises non-sustainable harvest (H n > 0) because an increase in f at a given time has a greater effect on welfare than the same increase at a later time; the lower the discount rate, the lower the rate of non-sustainable harvest.

In turn, we distinguish two types of regions: those that have a single manager, and those that are shared such that all managers are free to harvest. Ultimately, the harvest methods used by all managers determine the total areas that become degraded at time t in the managed and in the shared regions at the global scale, and, respectively. Accordingly, the total non-degraded areas in all managed regions, x 1, and in all shared regions, x 2, decrease due to non-sustainable harvest as follows:Moreover, the harvest functions are constrained by the non-degraded areas:for all t, where.

In turn, we assume that harvest comes with a direct cost as more labor and resources are directed toward harvesting. We incorporate this direct cost as a reduction in c (t), which would otherwise grow exponentially at an exogenous rate g c due to technological developments. Specifically, we assume that c (t) is given bywhere C 1 and C 2 are the direct costs of harvesting (in units of c), and λ is the ratio between the direct costs of non-sustainable and sustainable harvest.

Model of the competitive market

It remains to specify how the harvest strategies of the managers at the local scale are determined, and how these strategies determine the harvest functions at the global scale,… We are interested in comparing two types of solutions: The optimal solution that maximizes the social welfare, and the market solution that emerges in a competitive market. The optimal solution is found via the maximization of the social welfare (Eq. 4) subject to the constraints given in Eqs. 6–9. In turn, to define the market solution, we consider a competitive market in which each manager aims to maximize her/his own utility. Specifically, we consider a well-established framework in which the market is perfectly competitive, such that, if property rights are defined everywhere and there are no externalities, the market solution coincides with the optimal solution. In turn, the market solution depends on the form of the externalities for the various managers, namely, it depends on how non-sustainable harvest by a given manager affects the ecosystem in regions managed by other managers.

As there is limited understanding of reported types of neural tube defects associated with dolutegravir use and because the date of conception may not be determined with precision, an alternative treatment to TIVICAY should be considered at the time of conception through the first trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Perform pregnancy testing before initiation of dolutegravir in adolescents and adults of childbearing potential to exclude use of dolutegravir during the first trimester of pregnancy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Initiation of dolutegravir is not recommended in adolescents and adults actively trying to become pregnant unless there is no suitable alternative [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

Counsel adolescents and adults of childbearing potential to consistently use effective contraception [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

In adolescents and adults of childbearing potential currently on dolutegravir who are actively trying to become pregnant, or if pregnancy is confirmed in the first trimester, assess the risks and benefits of continuing dolutegravir versus switching to another antiretroviral regimen and consider switching to an alternative regimen [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

Dolutegravir may be considered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy if the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the pregnant woman and the fetus.

5.4 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions

The concomitant use of TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.3)]:

Loss of therapeutic effect of TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD and possible development of resistance.
Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs.

For concomitant drugs for which the interaction can be mitigated, please see Table 8 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy with TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD; review concomitant medications during therapy with TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs.

Diagnosis of persistent/irreversible biventricular failure — in ambulatory chronic heart failure, dobutamine stress testing can demonstrate right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) contractile reserve, with dosing increased at increments of 5 μg/kg/min at 3-minute intervals up to a maximum of 20 μg/kg/min or until limited by side effects. In ongoing acute left heart failure, coexistent RV failure should be suspected when CI < 2.2 L/min/ m^2 or cardiac power < 0.6 W and any of the following: ongoing hemodynamic evidence of CVP > 15 mm Hg, CVP/PCWP ratio > 0.63, or pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi) < 1.85, and echo/imaging evidence of RV dysfunction such as TAPSE < 14 mm or increased RVEDV. Failure of weaning of temporary mechanical circulatory support (MCS) or high dose inotropes after 72 hours of hemodynamic optimization and complete revascularization may require escalation to total artificial heart (TAH), biventricular assist device (BiVAD) or transplant in suitable candidates. Recommendation — The right ventricular contractile reserve must be evaluated by echo and hemodynamic testing in a patient undergoing left ventricular support to determine the need for biventricular support (Class I, Level of evidence: C.).

### Over-exploitation of natural resources is followed by inevitable declines in economic growth and discount rate [^029388e2]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Methods

Model overview

We begin with describing a well-established framework, that specifies how social welfare and the discount rate depend on the provision of the natural resource over time, f (t), and on the consumption of other goods over time, c (t). Next, we specify how harvest at the global scale affects the dynamics of f (t) and c (t) (which would grow exponentially if the harvest functions are fixed). We complete the model by describing how the harvest strategies are determined by the various managers in a competitive market.

Model of social welfare and the discount rate

We consider a social welfare function that is given by the widely-used form, where u (c, f) is the instantaneous utility that increases as c and f increase (Table 1), ρ is a constant rate of pure time preference, and T is a time horizon (we are interested in the limit T ∞). The distinction between the provision or consumption of the natural resource, f (t), and that of the other goods, c (t) is necessary here because, if the natural resource and the other goods are not entirely substitutable and the ratio between them varies over time, then social welfare depends on the ratio between c and f over time and cannot be written as a function of a single variable. In turn, the substitutability is determined by the form of u. For example, the goods may be non-substitutable, characterized by separable utility functions (Supplementary Note 2, Eq. B2), if one good cannot compensate for the lack of the other good (e.g. many cars cannot compensate for a lack of food). Alternatively, the goods may be partially substitutable (Eq. B10) if a sufficient amount of one good may compensate for the lack of the other good (e.g. many carrots can compensate for the lack of fish).

### Over-exploitation of natural resources is followed by inevitable declines in economic growth and discount rate [^b7540d46]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

In turn, in the competitive market solution (see Methods), the rate of non-sustainable harvest is higher than the socially optimal rate, namely, the solution exhibits over-harvesting (Fig. 2c, d). Specifically, the harvest is still primarily sustainable in the managed regions but is non-sustainable in the shared regions. The total area under (non-sustainable) harvest in the shared regions increases over time, and consequently, f (t) continues to increase over an extended period of time, which postpones the decline in the discount rate. Eventually, however, at time t = t 1 (Fig. 2), the shared regions become entirely degraded and the total rate of non-sustainable harvest declines. In turn, the period during which managers over-harvest (t < t 1) is followed by declines in the discount rate, the cumulative discount (Δ), total production (Eq. A11), and the price of manufactured goods (Eq. A10). These declines are greater if the magnitude and/or duration of the over-harvesting are greater (e.g. if more regions are shared), and also if the natural and the manufactured goods are non-substitutable. Note that the optimal solution exhibits no declines in economic growth or in Δ because the social planner plans for the forthcoming constraints on the harvest by avoiding over-harvesting in the early stages (t < t 0); in the market solution, managers also take into account the forthcoming decline in f and avoid non-sustainable harvesting in the managed regions prior to time t = t 1, but they still over-harvest in the shared regions. Also note that, in both the optimal and the market solutions, the harvest functions, as well as c (t) and f (t), do not depend on μ (only the discount and the prices do).

Indicator 4.2.7: fossil fuel and green bank lending — headline finding: green sector lending has risen sharply since 2016, to $498 billion in 2021, and is approaching fossil fuel lending; however, 22 of the top 40 private banks have increased their fossil fuel lending

Redirecting the finance sector away from fossil fuels and towards clean renewables, energy efficiency, and carbon sinks is essential for a healthy, just transition to net-zero emissions. The Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), which currently represents 40% of global banking assets, was convened by the UN Environment Programme in 2021 to promote this goal. Estimates suggest that 70% of the required investment in green energy will come from private sources (ie, non-government sources), and an increasing amount will be mobilised as debt. New to this year's report, this indicator draws on data from Bloomberg to monitor lending from private banks to the fossil fuel sector and green sector (comprising renewable energy and energy efficiency, carbon sinks, and other energy sustainability; appendix p 204). Average annual lending to the fossil fuel sector in the years before the Paris Agreement entered into force (2010–16), was $549 billion, and annual lending increased slightly in the following years (2017–21) to $572 billion (figure 14). The top seven lending banks, dominated by US institutions, account for 39% of total lending to the fossil fuel sector over the past decade.

In 2017–21, the 40 banks that lent the most to the fossil fuel sector in the past decade invested, on average, $489 billion yearly in oil and gas — 87% of total global bank lending to the fossil fuel sector. Of these banks, 22 (55%) had increased their average annual fossil fuel lending from 2010–16. Despite being NZBA members, three Japanese banks (Sumitomo Mitsui, MUFG, and Mizuho Financial) dominated this cohort in terms of absolute spend and relative increase. By contrast, five European banks led fossil fuel finance reductions (Nordea, UBS, DNB ASA, Deutsche Bank, and Credit Suisse), having reduced their fossil fuel lending in 2017–21 by over 25% compared with 2010–16.

ACC/AHA guideline development — topic selection, partner involvement, lay representatives, and Evidence Review Committee (ERC) with PICOTS: The process begins with selection of a topic for a new, revised, or updated CPG by the Task Force with the input of GWCs and ACC and AHA council and committee members, and, given inclusivity and collaboration, selected organizations and professional societies are invited to participate as partners or collaborators. The Task Force now invites lay representatives (ie, patients, patient advocates, or consumer organization representatives) to participate as members of GWCs and may include them on the Task Force, and lay representatives may participate in topic selection; delineation of diagnostic and therapeutic options, values, preferences, and patient-oriented outcomes; and shared decision making. On the basis of Methodology Summit recommendations, the process has started to involve an Evidence Review Committee that is separate from the GWC, which includes methodologists, epidemiologists, clinicians, and biostatisticians tasked with formal systematic review of available evidence and responsibility for identification, abstraction, and quality assessment of the evidence, with roles limited to clinical questions where the evidence lends itself to a systematic review and that are most clinically relevant to the CPG topic. In 2013, the Task Force successfully piloted a focused ERC approach using a PICOTS (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes, Timing, and Setting) format; the PICOTS format specifically identifies the target population (P), defines the intervention (I) and whether the comparator (C) is placebo, no intervention, or some alternative strategy, designates the outcome (O) as a clinical event or a patient-oriented endpoint, and specifies the timing (T) of measurement and the setting (S) in which the outcome is measured.

### Over-exploitation of natural resources is followed by inevitable declines in economic growth and discount rate [^d340046e]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Denote Δ opt as the cumulative discount (Eq. 5) that emerges following the optimal harvest. Namely, the non-negative harvest functions maximize social welfare (max U T subject to Eqs. 6–9 where T ∞; see Methods). Next, denote Δ market as the cumulative discount that emerges where the harvest functions are determined if each manager aims to maximize her/his own profit and the non-sustainable harvest may be higher than its socially optimal level (Methods). Then, there exists a time t c such that Δ market ≤ Δ opt for all t ≥ t c. Furthermore, denote Δ sus as the cumulative discount that emerges following optimal harvest while excluding non-sustainable harvest (H n = 0). Then, for any Δ that emerges if non-sustainable harvest occurs (H n (t) > 0) between times t 0 and t 1, there exists t c > t 1 such that Δ(t c) ≤ Δ sus (t c).

A new discount formula

The theorem shows that an upper bound on Δ(t) in the long run is given by Δ sus (t), the cumulative discount that would have occurred if managers used only sustainable harvest, which increases at a rate given by δ sus (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Note 2). Also, the present value of Δ sus is below Δ because over-harvesting already has occurred prior to today. Specifically, ϕ 0 = Δ(0) − Δ sus (0) reflects the negative shock to Δ that must occur during the transition to sustainable harvest methods due to the prior over-harvesting. It follows that, if t is sufficiently large and δ sus is constant, thenParticularly, if the discount rate has been δ today > δ sus due to non-sustainable harvest during the last t 0 years, and if δ today and δ sus have been constants, then ϕ 0 = (δ today − δ sus) t 0.

### The Canadian C-spine rule for radiography in alert and stable trauma patients [^545fa81d]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Canadian C-Spine Rule (CCR)" for cervical spine injury.

The Canadian C-Spine Rule (CCR) is a clinical decision-making tool designed for use in the emergency department to determine which patients with trauma need cervical spine imaging. This calculator is specifically applicable to alert and stable patients who have experienced trauma, with the goal of reducing unnecessary imaging procedures. The CCR is not intended for use in patients under the age of 16, those with penetrating trauma, acute paralysis, known vertebral disease, or those with a previous cervical spine surgery. The clinical utility of the CCR lies in its ability to accurately identify patients at high risk of cervical spine injury, thereby improving patient management and reducing healthcare costs.

To evaluate neck injuries using the Canadian C-Spine Rule (CCR), the calculator examines specific risk factors and assigns scores to assess whether imaging is required. The assessment focuses on three areas: high-risk factors, low-risk factors, and neck rotation ability. Each is given a numerical score that corresponds to the presence of certain conditions.

First, we look at high-risk factors, which are critical in determining the need for imaging. These include:

- Age 65 years or older
- Paresthesias in extremities
- Dangerous mechanisms of injury such as falls from a height of 1 meter or more, axial load to the head, high-speed motor vehicle collisions, rollovers, ejections, motorized recreational vehicle accidents, or bicycle collisions

Each high-risk factor, if present, contributes a score of 17 to the total.

Next, low-risk factors are evaluated, which may reduce the concern for serious injury. These include:

- Being involved in a simple rear-end motor vehicle collision
- Sitting position in the emergency department
- Being ambulatory at any time
- Experiencing delayed-onset neck pain
- Absence of midline cervical spine tenderness

Each of these low-risk factors adds a score of 1.

Lastly, the ability to rotate the neck by 45 degrees both left and right is considered. The scoring for this is:

- **Yes**: 5 points
- **No**: 11 points

Totaling the scores from these inputs helps interpret the risk. Here's how interpretations are derived from the total score:

- A score from 6 to 10 indicates "Low risk. No imaging is required".
- A score of 12 or higher signals "High risk. Imaging is required".
- Specific scores, such as those 5 or lower or precisely 11, suggest that the CCR cannot be fully assessed.

This scoring system ensures those at high risk are identified for imaging, aiding in the management of neck injuries. The resulting score and interpretation guide clinical decisions about the need for imaging.

Studies are required to compare initiation regimens and protocols for effectiveness in avoiding RS and its sequelae, and to examine prophylactic electrolyte supplementation before feeding in patients deemed at high risk for RS but with normal prefeeding electrolyte levels.

### Disproportionate declines of formerly abundant species underlie insect loss [^d8f1c6f6]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

To distinguish between these scenarios, we compared trends in the number of species in different abundance categories (as in Fig. 1d). For this, we first divided the total SAD of each site into five equally sized intervals of abundance, and then calculated the number of species in each interval each year (for a visual explanation, see Extended Data Fig. 4). We found the strongest declines (−0.80% annually (−0.96, −0.65%)) in the number of species in the highest abundance interval (Fig. 3), but there was also moderate to strong evidence for declines of species in the intermediate abundance intervals (between −0.33% and −0.43% annually). The lowest abundance interval (0–20%) showed little evidence for any trend. This interval contains the highest number of species (Extended Data Fig. 4), and represents several categories of trends, such as stable rare species, species that were previously more abundant, species that went locally extinct and newly colonizing species. We found similar results using alternative ways to bin species (see Extended Data Fig. 5). These patterns are again consistent with either the proportional declines scenario, or the scenario of stronger declines for abundant species, but not with the scenario of greater declines of locally rare species from Box 1.

Methods

Introduction

Before we present the notations, definitions, and the equations of PDD, we first give a high-level conceptual view of the methodology. The following items (labeled with the header M) represent the methodologies we developed in support of the PDD paradigm. We link them to the definitions, algorithmic steps, and experimental evidence. Specifically, we, via M1, use statistical residual (SR) (Definition 1), SR-Matrix and AV-Vector (Step 1 and Definition 2), Principal Component Analysis (Step 2) to obtain a small set of Statistically Significant Association Disentangled Spaces DS (Step 2, Step 3, and Definition 6).

M2, obtain from each DS AV clusters (Step 3 Definition 8) and statistically significant attribute association patterns (Step 5, Definition 10) and pattern clusters (Step 5) without class labels given, or the need for feature engineering and machine training (Step 6 and Step 7) — achieving AV clustering, pattern discovery, pattern clustering and entity clustering in an All-in-One System.

M3, use the intersection of AV Entity ID lists (Definition 3, Fig. 1c, d) of AVs in an AV Group (Definition 7) from the Entity ID Address Table (created at the outset in Step 1, Definition 3) to obtain the frequency count of AV Groups for Frequency-Matrix construction (Step 1) and pattern discovery (Step 5, Fig. 1d) — shifting the search of association or discriminative information or patterns from entities employed in the existing ML models to a direct simple table-lookup and intersecting computation process for pattern discovery and class association — a great complexity reduction of the search process in ML.

M4, use dataset with class labels to exploit the ground truth, and dataset without class label to minimize label bias to obtain auto-error-correcting class associations (Step5, Step 6 Step 7 and Definition 10) and entity clusters (Step 5, Step 6, Step 7 and Definition 11) — an unique way of combining the strength of supervised and unsupervised methods in auto-correcting class association and entity clustering;

Guideline definitions for key action statements (Table 4) — a strong recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and quality of evidence is excellent or unobtainable," with the implication "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present." A moderate recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent (or is unobtainable)," implying "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a moderate recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences." A weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence) is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of evidence is weak," with the implication "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a weak recommendation but should remain alert to new information and very sensitive to patient preferences." A weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms) is defined as "Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate database shows evidence of both benefit and harm that appear to be similar in magnitude for any available courses of action," implying "Clinicians should consider the options in their decision-making, but patient preference may have a substantial role."

### Facts, fallacies, and politics of comparative effectiveness research: part I. basic considerations [^00ea44f4]. Pain Physician (2010). Low credibility.

While the United States leads the world in many measures of health care innovation, it has been suggested that it lags behind many developed nations in a variety of health outcomes. It has also been stated that the United States continues to outspend all other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries by a wide margin. Spending on health goods and services per person in the United States, in 2007, increased to $7,290 - almost 2(1/2) times the average of all OECD countries. Rising health care costs in the United States have been estimated to increase to 19.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) or $4.4 trillion by 2018. The increases are illustrated in both public and private sectors. Higher health care costs in the United States are implied from the variations in the medical care from area to area around the country, with almost 50% of medical care being not evidence-based, and finally as much as 30% of spending reflecting medical care of uncertain or questionable value. Thus, comparative effectiveness research (CER) has been touted by supporters with high expectations to resolve most ill effects of health care in the United States and provide high quality, less expensive, universal health care. CER is defined as the generation and synthesis of evidence that compares the benefits and harms of alternate methods to prevent, diagnose, treat, and monitor a clinical condition or to improve the delivery of care. The efforts of CER in the United States date back to the late 1970's even though it was officially born with the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) and has been rejuvenated with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 with an allocation of $1.1 billion. CER has been the basis for health care decision-making in many other countries. According to the International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessments (INAHTA), many industrialized countries have bodies that are charged with health technology assessments (HTAs) or comparative effectiveness studies. Of all the available agencies, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) of the United Kingdom is the most advanced, stable, and has provided significant evidence, though based on rigid and proscriptive economic and clinical formulas. While CER is making a rapid surge in the United States, supporters and opponents are expressing their views. Part I of this comprehensive review will describe facts, fallacies, and politics of CER with discussions to understand basic concepts of CER.

### Trustworthy evidence-based versus untrustworthy guidelines: detecting the difference [^f756e929]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary of evidence

Trading off benefits versus harms and burdens is the core of a guideline panel's job. Doing so requires best evidence summaries of the magnitude of effects on all important outcomes and an assessment of the certainty of the evidence. In trustworthy guidelines, this summary is informed by rigorously conducted systematic reviews, often with meta-analyses providing single best estimates of effect.

Rigorous systematic reviews include explicit eligibility criteria, a comprehensive search for eligible studies, assessment of risk of bias of individual studies, with judgement of eligibility and risk bias conducted in duplicate. Rigorous reviews also involve judgements regarding the certainty or quality of the evidence, from high to very low certainty. Ideally, that judgement will use the rigorously developed and widely adopted the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) approach in which randomised trials begin as high-certainty evidence and observational studies as low-certainty evidence in a four-category system of certainty of evidence (high, moderate, low and very low).

Beyond study design, GRADE has identified five domains that may lead to rating down the certainty of evidence: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias. Reviewers may rate up the certainty of evidence from observational studies, primarily for large or very large magnitude of effect. If a panel is fortunate, rigorous reviews will already be available; if not, they will have to commission or conduct their own.

Without systematic reviews, the evidence summaries become untrustworthy, and guidelines regress to the GOBSAT approach. Systematic reviews following methodological standards are, therefore, essential for guideline trustworthiness.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

The recommended cumulative dosage of MAVENCLAD is 3.5 mg per kg body weight administered orally and divided into 2 yearly treatment courses (1.75 mg per kg per treatment course) (see Table 1). Each treatment course is divided into 2 treatment cycles:

Administration of First Treatment Course

First Course/First Cycle: start any time.
First Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of First Course/First Cycle.

Administration of Second Treatment Course

Second Course/First Cycle: administer at least 43 weeks after the last dose of First Course/Second Cycle.
Second Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of Second Course/First Cycle.

Administer the cycle dosage as 1 or 2 tablets once daily over 4 or 5 consecutive days [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1)]. Do not administer more than 2 tablets daily.

Following the administration of 2 treatment courses, do not administer additional MAVENCLAD treatment during the next 2 years. Treatment during these 2 years may further increase the risk of malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The safety and efficacy of reinitiating MAVENCLAD more than 2 years after completing 2 treatment courses has not been studied.

2.3 Missed Dose

If a dose is missed, patients should not take double or extra doses.

If a dose is not taken on the scheduled day, then the patient must take the missed dose on the following day and extend the number of days in that treatment cycle. If two consecutive doses are missed, the treatment cycle is extended by 2 days.

2.4 Administration

MAVENCLAD tablets are taken orally, with water, and swallowed whole without chewing. MAVENCLAD can be taken with or without food.

Separate administration of MAVENCLAD and any other oral drugs by at least 3 hours during the 4 to 5 day MAVENCLAD treatment cycles [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)].

MAVENCLAD is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures [see References (15)]. MAVENCLAD is an uncoated tablet and must be swallowed immediately once removed from the blister. If a tablet is left on a surface, or if a broken or fragmented tablet is released from the blister, the area must be thoroughly washed with water.

The patient's hands must be dry when handling the tablets and washed thoroughly afterwards. Avoid prolonged contact with skin.

Coronary physiology (fractional flow reserve [FFR] and instantaneous wave-free ratio [iFR]) to guide percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — In patients with angina or an anginal equivalent, undocumented ischemia, and angiographically intermediate stenoses, the use of FFR or iFR is recommended to guide the decision to proceed with PCI (COR 1, LOE A), whereas in stable patients with angiographically intermediate stenoses and FFR > 0.80 or iFR > 0.89, PCI should not be performed (COR 3: No benefit, LOE B-R); FFR is defined as the ratio of maximal blood flow in a region distal to a lesion compared with the normal maximal blood flow of an artery and iFR is the instantaneous wave-free ratio (in diastole) of coronary pressure distal to the coronary lesion (Pd) to the aortic pressure (Pa), with the potential advantage that it obviates the use of adenosine because it does not require a state of maximal hyperemia.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for extravasation of antineoplastic agents, more specifically with respect to indications for referral, ASCO/ONS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider performing a surgical referral or escalation of care for patients with central line extravasation of irritants with vesicant properties or vesicant antineoplastic agents, in addition to conservative management, rather than conservative management alone.

- recognize that high-risk populations, such as patients receiving DNA-binding vesicants, those with high-volume estimated extravasation, and those with National Cancer Institute CTCAE grade 2 (erythema associated with symptoms such as edema, pain, induration, and phlebitis), grade 3 (ulceration or necrosis; severe tissue damage), or grade 4 (life-threatening consequences) extravasation, may have a greater likelihood of benefiting from surgical referral or escalation in care.

### Editors' best of 2018 [^61b7d28b]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

There is, in the content of the Journal, an embarrassment of riches, and picking a "best" seems to demand a certain qualification: is the "best" the most interesting, most surprising, most educational, most important, most provocative, most enjoyable? How to choose? We are hardly unbiased and can admit to a special affection for the ones that we and the authors worked hardest on, hammering version after version into shape. Acknowledging these biases, here are the 2018 articles that we think deserve your attention or at least a second read.

Box 1 Conceptual relationships between biodiversity metrics and mean population changes

We start with the assumption of overall abundance declines, on the basis of results from previous studies, although scenarios could be drawn for other cases. In Fig. 1, we show three conceptual scenarios (see Methods) by which initially abundant and rare species can change through time, illustrated by changes in the population abundances of species (Fig. 1a). These changes, in turn, lead to changes in several diversity metrics (Fig. 1b; insets represent modelled slope estimates, in relation to 0 at the dashed line), as well as changes in the numbers of species in different initial abundance intervals of the SAD (Fig. 1c) and in the population abundance trends of species in these abundance intervals (Fig. 1d). For each scenario illustrated, we start with a simple community of 43 species and 211 individuals with a typical skewed SAD comprising a few abundant species and many rare species, and assume similar changes in total abundance through time (Fig. 1b, 'Total abundance').
In the first scenario, all species decline proportionally (that is, the same percentage decline each year) (Fig. 1a, left). In this case, species richness will decline as the rarest species go extinct, whereas Simpson's diversity index (inverted and converted to its effective number of species) — which weights abundant species more heavily — does not change, because the relative abundances of all species remain the same. Evenness increases slightly as the species abundances converge (bound between 1 and the highest value; Fig. 1b). Furthermore, the SAD will show a decline in the number of very abundant species, and probably a moderate increase in the number of rare species, as species that are intermediately abundant at first move to lower abundance intervals, but the exact outcome depends on how many rare species are lost (Fig. 1c). The mean population trends of all initial abundance intervals will be the same (Fig. 1e).
In the second scenario, the abundant species decline more than the rare species do (Fig. 1a middle). In this scenario, species richness does not change, because no rare species are lost, but diversity and evenness increase through time as the relative abundances become more similar (Fig. 1b). Because of these changes, the SAD shows a strong increase in the number of rare species, as species that were initially abundant move to the interval with those already rare (Fig. 1c). Finally, at the population level, initially abundant species have more negative population trends than do initially rare ones (Fig. 1d).
In the third scenario, the rare species decline more than the abundant species do (Fig. 1a right). In this scenario, species richness declines more strongly than in the other scenarios, as more species go extinct, and diversity and evenness also decline (Fig. 1b). Here, there will be a decline in the number of rare species in the SAD, because the abundant species do not decline so much that they become rare and do not compensate for the loss of rare species (Fig. 1c). At the population level, species in the lowest abundance intervals show the strongest declines (Fig. 1d; the deviation from the straight line for the lowest abundance interval is caused by rounding to integers).

### 2016 AHA / ACC guideline on the management of patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease: executive summary [^fd59b58d]. Vascular Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

AHA/ACC guideline evaluation notes — pairing and comparative-effectiveness criteria specify that "COR and LOE are determined independently (any COR may be paired with any LOE)." The document adds that "Many important clinical questions addressed in guidelines do not lend themselves to clinical trials" and "Although RCTs are unavailable, there may be a very clear clinical consensus that a particular test or therapy is useful or effective." For comparative recommendations, it states: "For comparative-effectiveness recommendations (COR I and IIa; LOE A and B), studies that support the use of comparators should involve direct comparisons of the treatments or strategies being evaluated."
