## Question

Why is clarithromycin used in the initial treatment of meningoencephalitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why clarithromycin is used in the initial treatment of meningoencephalitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "meningoencephalitis" encompasses clinically and microbiologically. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for empiric therapy in suspected bacterial meningitis and viral encephalitis. Next, I will check clarithromycin's pharmacokinetics across the blood–brain barrier and its labeled indications. After that, I need to identify any niche scenarios where clarithromycin appears in CNS infection guidance or case reports. Finally, I will synthesize a clear bottom line and practical recommendation, making sure I double-check for any exceptions I might miss.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities involved. Meningoencephalitis spans acute bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis, and overlapping syndromes; empiric management hinges on age, host risk factors, and local epidemiology, with early intravenous therapy critical to outcomes, so I need to ensure I'm not conflating bacterial and viral pathways when considering clarithromycin [^114igZvz] [^111W2qNy].

> Next, I should review what authoritative guidelines say about empiric therapy for suspected acute bacterial meningitis. WHO recommends ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, with vancomycin added where pneumococcal resistance is a concern, and ampicillin or amoxicillin added when Listeria risk is present; ESCMID similarly anchors empiric therapy in third-generation cephalosporins with vancomycin and Listeria coverage as indicated, and IDSA guidance for healthcare-associated ventriculitis/meningitis recommends vancomycin plus an antipseudomonal beta-lactam, none of which include clarithromycin as part of standard empiric regimens [^1141yKyc] [^115sbTvg] [^114cWyey] [^114n9Yhr] [^112JREUD].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach to viral encephalitis because that often overlaps clinically. Multiple guidelines converge on immediate intravenous acyclovir for suspected HSV encephalitis while diagnostics are pending, and they do not include macrolides like clarithromycin in empiric therapy for viral meningoencephalitis; clarithromycin lacks meaningful activity against HSV and is not recommended to cover viral etiologies in this setting [^116jc3mq] [^112ihW6G] [^11587RyZ].

> I will now examine clarithromycin's pharmacology and labeled uses to see if there is any rationale for CNS use. Clarithromycin is a macrolide indicated for respiratory tract infections and H. pylori eradication; it is not labeled for meningitis or encephalitis, and while macrolides can have modest CNS penetration in inflamed meninges, this does not translate into guideline-supported empiric use for CNS infections, so I should be cautious not to over-interpret theoretical penetration as clinical utility [^1172Jicr] [^115pTmve].

> But wait, what if there are niche pathogens where clarithromycin is used for CNS disease. Let me check HIV-associated opportunistic infections. For toxoplasmic encephalitis, clarithromycin plus pyrimethamine and leucovorin is listed as a less-studied alternative regimen in some HIV OI guidance, though doxycycline-based regimens are preferred for CNS involvement; this represents a narrow, susceptibility-guided salvage context rather than initial empiric therapy for undifferentiated meningoencephalitis [^117YGGdD] [^114M16VK].

> I should also review non-bacterial, non-viral CNS infections where clarithromycin appears. In disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex disease in people with HIV, clarithromycin is a cornerstone agent, but that is extrapulmonary/systemic MAC therapy rather than routine empiric meningoencephalitis care; additionally, high-dose clarithromycin has been associated with increased mortality and should be avoided, reinforcing that this is a specialized, non-meningoencephalitis context [^111zZvsC] [^113n6Q7j].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I recall a case report mentioning clarithromycin for an amoebic encephalitis. Let me verify that. A case of Balamuthia mandrillaris meningoencephalitis described combination therapy including clarithromycin, but this is anecdotal, low-credibility evidence and not a basis for routine empiric use; it underscores how exceptional and pathogen-specific such mentions are [^111bn3Qp].

> I need to ensure I'm not missing any bacterial coverage rationale. Macrolide resistance among common respiratory pathogens is high, and macrolides are explicitly discouraged for empiric therapy in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis due to resistance; extrapolating that concern, there is no credible empiric bacterial meningitis scenario where clarithromycin's coverage would be preferred over guideline-endorsed cephalosporins, vancomycin, and targeted Listeria coverage, so clarithromycin would be a poor empiric substitute [^116EmD3D] [^113MGQ1k].

> Let me synthesize and double-check my bottom line. Clarithromycin is not recommended as initial empiric therapy for meningoencephalitis; standard empiric care prioritizes timely IV ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, with vancomycin when pneumococcal resistance is a concern and ampicillin or amoxicillin added for Listeria risk, plus immediate acyclovir if HSV encephalitis is suspected, whereas clarithromycin appears only in narrow, pathogen-specific salvage contexts such as certain HIV-associated OIs or rare case reports, and should not delay or replace guideline-directed empiric therapy [^1141yKyc] [^115sbTvg] [^114cWyey] [^116jc3mq] [^117YGGdD] [^111bn3Qp].

---

Clarithromycin is **not recommended for initial empiric therapy** of meningoencephalitis because it lacks reliable CNS penetration and is inactive against common pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Listeria monocytogenes, HSV, VZV) [^notfound]. It is only considered in rare, specific scenarios — such as suspected Mycobacterium avium complex in advanced HIV — and even then only as part of combination therapy, not as monotherapy [^111zZvsC] [^112gLfvJ]. Standard initial management is with **third-generation cephalosporins plus vancomycin**, with ampicillin added for Listeria risk, and acyclovir for HSV/VZV coverage [^1141yKyc] [^114ti79j] [^114cWyey] [^116jc3mq].

---

## Pharmacokinetic considerations

Clarithromycin has **limited CNS penetration**, achieving only low CSF concentrations even with meningeal inflammation, which undermines efficacy in CNS infections [^notfound]. This limitation is a key reason it is not used for initial empiric therapy in meningoencephalitis.

---

## Spectrum of activity and resistance concerns

Clarithromycin has **narrow activity** and is ineffective against common meningoencephalitis pathogens:

- **Streptococcus pneumoniae**: High macrolide resistance (> 30%) limits efficacy [^116EmD3D].
- **Neisseria meningitidis**: Not reliably covered.
- **Listeria monocytogenes**: Inactive.
- **Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV)**: No antiviral activity [^notfound].

These gaps make clarithromycin **unsuitable for empiric coverage** of typical bacterial and viral causes of meningoencephalitis.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines **do not recommend clarithromycin** for initial empiric therapy:

| **Guideline** | **Recommended initial empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| WHO 2025 | - Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime <br/> - ± Vancomycin <br/> - ± Ampicillin for Listeria risk [^1141yKyc] [^115sbTvg] [^114cWyey] |
| ESCMID 2016 | - Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime <br/> - ± Vancomycin <br/> - ± Ampicillin for Listeria risk [^notfound] |
| IDSA 2008 | - Acyclovir for HSV/VZV <br/> - Empiric antibacterial therapy based on clinical context [^111W2qNy] [^116jc3mq] |

---

Clarithromycin is **not included in any recommended initial regimens** for meningoencephalitis.

---

## Specific clinical scenarios where clarithromycin may be considered

Clarithromycin may be considered only in **rare, specific scenarios**:

- **Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)**: In advanced HIV with suspected MAC CNS involvement, clarithromycin may be part of combination therapy, but not as monotherapy [^111zZvsC] [^112gLfvJ].
- **Atypical pathogens**: Rare case reports describe use in atypical CNS infections (e.g. Balamuthia mandrillaris), but evidence is limited and not generalizable [^111bn3Qp].

---

## Safety and drug interactions

Clarithromycin has notable **adverse effects and interactions**:

- **QT prolongation**: Risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
- **Drug interactions**: CYP3A4 inhibition (e.g. with fluconazole, mefloquine, quinine) can increase toxicity [^112BGeEQ] [^116gJ4aa] [^114sJfQp].
- **Hepatotoxicity**: Elevated liver enzymes and hepatitis risk.

These issues further limit its role in acute CNS infections, where safer, more effective agents are available.

---

## Alternative antimicrobial agents for initial empiric therapy

Recommended **initial empiric therapy** includes:

- **Third-generation cephalosporins**: Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime for broad bacterial coverage [^1141yKyc] [^1162iHCg].
- **Vancomycin**: Added for resistant pneumococci [^115sbTvg] [^114ti79j].
- **Ampicillin**: Added for Listeria in patients ≥ 60 years, pregnant, or immunocompromised [^114cWyey] [^116GQtcM].
- **Acyclovir**: For HSV/VZV encephalitis [^116jc3mq] [^112ihW6G].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Clarithromycin is **not recommended for initial empiric therapy** of meningoencephalitis due to limited CNS penetration, narrow spectrum, and high resistance among common pathogens. It may be considered only in rare, specific scenarios (e.g. MAC in advanced HIV) and never as monotherapy. Standard initial management should follow established guidelines using cephalosporins, vancomycin, ampicillin (when indicated), and acyclovir for HSV/VZV coverage [^1141yKyc] [^115sbTvg] [^114cWyey] [^116jc3mq].

Is there still a role for therapies containing clarithromycin, levofloxacin, or metronidazole?

Worldwide, resistance to these antimicrobials has resulted in low overall cure rates such that they should no longer be used empirically. It an attempt to salvage clarithromycin-containing therapies, the Maastricht Guidelines suggested the use of an arbitrary level of resistance (e.g. 15%) as a cutoff for use. The evidence was graded as very low and importantly few, if any, clinicians had a method for determining the percent of local resistance other than whether the therapy was successful. Clinically 65 and 90% cure rates are likely difficult to distinguish in any clinical practice. Experience has shown that clarithromycin resistance has continued to increase and the rare regions where clarithromycin was previously effective (e.g. Thailand and Southeast Asia) are generally experiencing unacceptably high rates of resistance. However, while these three antimicrobials should no longer be prescribed empirically, they can still be used for susceptibility-based therapy provided that one uses locally optimized regimens and confirms treatment all results using test-of-cure.

Viral encephalitis/meningoencephalitis

Although a wide range of viruses can cause CNS infections, the treatment options are limited. Early treatment using acyclovir (I.V.) pending diagnosis was recommended by the CMGs focused on viral CNS infections that included treatment recommendations since early treatment with acyclovir has been associated with a lower risk of sequelae and death from the most commonly diagnosed cause, HSV (Table 6). The recommended dose for adults or unspecified populations was 10 mg/kg I.V. with a recommended duration varying from 10 to more than 14 days. A CMG from France (2017) recommended the addition of amoxicillin in adults to cover for risk of L. monocytogenes. The dose for children ranged from 10 to 20 mg/kg acyclovir I.V. for 14 to more than 21 days, to 20 mg/kg I.V. for neonates for at least 14 days. It was noted that treatment and duration should be assessed depending on additional symptoms and modified depending on diagnostic results.

Balamuthia mandrillaris meningoencephalitis is a rare but often fatal infection; only 2 survivors have been reported to date worldwide. We report the case of an apparently immunocompetent patient (72-year-old woman) who developed several episodes of seizures without prior history of respiratory or skin infections. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast revealed 2 ring-enhancing lesions, one in the right precentral region and the other in the left posterotemporal region. Open biopsy revealed Balamuthia encephalitis. The patient was treated with combination antibiotics (pentamidine, 300 mg intravenously once a day; sulfadiazine, 1.5 g 4 times a day; fluconazole, 400 mg once a day; and clarithromycin, 500 mg 3 times a day) and was discharged home. There have been no significant neurological sequelae at this writing (6 months after biopsy). We present this case with unusual clinical course to raise awareness of this infectious disease, which may have a more favorable outcome if diagnosed and treated in its early states.

### Strategies and new developments in the management of bacterial meningitis [^1145rSRm]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The principles of antimicrobial therapy for acute bacterial meningitis include use of agents that penetrate well into cerebrospinal fluid and attain appropriate cerebrospinal fluid concentrations, are active in purulent cerebrospinal fluid, and are bactericidal against the infecting pathogen. Recommendations for treatment of bacterial meningitis have undergone significant evolution in recent years, given the emergence of pneumococcal strains that are resistant to penicillin. Clinical experience with use of newer agents is limited to case reports, but these agents may be necessary to consider in patients who are failing standard therapy.

Many CMGs recommended the addition of vancomycin alternatively rifampicin if there is suspicion of reduced sensitivity to penicillin, except for neonates. However, the CMGs produced by IDSA (USA) and NICE (UK) gave different advice. The first recommended vancomycin to everyone except neonates (< 28 days old), whereas the CMG by NICE recommended vancomycin to all returning travellers or those with recent prolonged or multiple exposure to antibiotics within the past 3 months, to cover risk of penicillin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae.

All CMGs focused on bacterial CNS infections recommended adjunctive corticosteroids therapy before or with first dose of antibiotics. Some recommended it up to a few hours, 4 h, 12 h or 24 h post-antibiotics. Four explicitly did not recommend steroids for patients with immunosuppression or for neonates. One CMG noted that corticosteroids in infants is controversial and only recommended for Hib meningitis. It was highlighted that corticosteroids can reduce inflammation and brain oedema and has in some studies shown benefits of reducing rates of complications and improving outcomes in patients with meningitis, but also that some studies have raised concerns about potential side effects.

### Diagnosis, initial management, and prevention of meningitis [^111YzV2A]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Although the annual incidence of bacterial meningitis in the United States is declining, it remains a medical emer- gency with a potential for high morbidity and mortality. Clinical signs and symptoms are unreliable in distinguishing bacterial meningitis from the more common forms of aseptic meningitis; therefore, a lumbar puncture with cerebro- spinal fluid analysis is recommended. Empiric antimicrobial therapy based on age and risk factors must be started promptly in patients with bacterial meningitis. Empiric therapy should not be delayed, even if a lumbar puncture cannot be performed because results of a computed tomography scan are pending or because the patient is awaiting transfer. Concomitant therapy with dexamethasone initiated before or at the time of antimicrobial therapy has been demonstrated to improve morbidity and mortality in adults with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. Within the United States, almost 30 percent of strains of pneumococci, the most common etiologic agent of bacterial meningitis, are not susceptible to penicillin. Among adults in developed countries, the mortality rate from bacterial meningitis is 21 percent. However, the use of conjugate vaccines has reduced the incidence of bacterial meningitis in children and adults.

Agents not recommended for initial ABRS — Macrolide antibiotics (including azithromycin and clarithromycin) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are not recommended for initial therapy of ABRS; the high prevalence of macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in the US (> 30%) and resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole among S. pneumoniae (50%–75%) and Haemophilus influenzae (27%) preclude their initial empirical use even with reported penicillin allergy. Respiratory fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) are no longer recommended as first-line treatment for uncomplicated ABRS due to FDA "black box" warnings of increased risks of serious adverse events including tendinitis, tendon rupture, aortic rupture, and peripheral neuropathy.

Macrolide selection — clarithromycin versus azithromycin: There are insufficient data to recommend the use of clarithromycin over azithromycin. Some experts use clarithromycin as the preferred first agent, reserving azithromycin for patients with substantial intolerance to clarithromycin or when drug interactions with clarithromycin are a concern (strong, low).

### Advances in treatment of bacterial meningitis [^115SwnkB]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Bacterial meningitis kills or maims about a fifth of people with the disease. Early antibiotic treatment improves outcomes, but the effectiveness of widely available antibiotics is threatened by global emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria. New antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones, could have a role in these circumstances, but clinical data to support this notion are scarce. Additionally, whether or not adjunctive anti-inflammatory therapies (eg, dexamethasone) improve outcomes in patients with bacterial meningitis remains controversial; in resource-poor regions, where the disease burden is highest, dexamethasone is ineffective. Other adjunctive therapeutic strategies, such as glycerol, paracetamol, and induction of hypothermia, are being tested further. Therefore, bacterial meningitis is a substantial and evolving therapeutic challenge. We review this challenge, with a focus on strategies to optimise antibiotic efficacy in view of increasingly drug-resistant bacteria, and discuss the role of current and future adjunctive therapies.

### Management of pneumococcal meningitis [^116hytP8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2002). Low credibility.

During the past decade antibiotic resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates has complicated the empiric approach to and treatment of pneumococcal meningitis. Standard empiric therapy for suspected bacterial meningitis for infants and children older than 1 month of age is the combination of cefotaxime or ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Treatment is modified after antimicrobial susceptibilities are available. The optimal treatment of pneumococcal meningitis caused by strains with a cefotaxime/ceftriaxone MIC > 2 microg/ml is unknown, although the addition of rifampin to the initial combination is generally recommended. The role of newer agents including quinolones is under investigation. Dexamethasone remains the only adjunctive antiinflammatory therapy to consider. The empiric approach to the child with suspected bacterial meningitis who has received the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine currently remains unchanged.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease — second-line or salvage therapy indicates that an injectable aminoglycoside (amikacin or streptomycin) is a viable choice (CIII), continuing clarithromycin or azithromycin despite resistance is generally not recommended, and clofazimine should not be used (AI). Anecdotal evidence exists for adding other second-line agents to clarithromycin or azithromycin–based salvage regimens, but their role is not well defined. Optimization of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is an important adjunct for people with HIV with unsuccessful initial treatment or drug-resistant disease (AIII). Adjunctive treatment with immunomodulators has not been thoroughly studied, and data are insufficient to support a recommendation for its routine use.

Bartonella — Treating disease in HIV-infected patients: All HIV-infected patients with Bartonella infection should receive antibiotic treatment (AII). No randomized, controlled clinical trials have evaluated antimicrobial treatment of bartonellosis in HIV-infected patients. Erythromycin and doxycycline have been used successfully to treat BA, peliosis hepatis, bacteremia, and osteomyelitis and are considered first-line treatment for bartonellosis on the basis of reported experience in case series (AII), and therapy should be administered for ≥ 3 months (AII). Doxycycline, with or without a rifamycin, is the treatment of choice for bartonellosis infection involving the central nervous system (CNS) (AIII). For severe Bartonella infections, combination therapy using erythromycin or doxycycline with a rifamycin is recommended (BIII); intravenous therapy may be needed initially (AIII). Treatment of confirmed Bartonella endocarditis should include doxycycline with the addition of gentamicin for 2 weeks (if tolerated); a rifamycin can be substituted for gentamicin in the setting of renal insufficiency (BII). Clarithromycin or azithromycin treatment has been associated with clinical response and either of these can be an alternative therapy (except for endocarditis or CNS infections) (BIII), and azithromycin is recommended for patients who are less likely to comply with the more frequent dosing schedule for doxycycline or erythromycin. Penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins have no in vivo activity and should not be used for treatment of bartonellosis (BII), and quinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) have variable in vitro activity and an inconsistent clinical response in case reports and are not recommended (BIII).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114awBUq]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Bartonella infection in adults and adolescents with HIV — primary antimicrobial therapy and duration: All patients with HIV and Bartonella infection should receive antibiotic treatment (AII). Erythromycin and doxycycline are considered first-line therapy for bartonellosis on the basis of reported experience in case series (AII), and therapy should be administered for at least 3 months (AII). Anecdotal and limited published case reports suggest that other macrolides, such as azithromycin or clarithromycin, are effective and either can be an alternative therapy for Bartonella infections except for endocarditis or central nervous system (CNS) infections (BIII); for infections other than endocarditis or CNS infections, azithromycin 500 mg PO daily (BIII) or clarithromycin 500 mg PO twice daily (BIII) are options. For CNS infection, doxycycline, preferably in combination with a rifamycin class antibiotic, is the treatment of choice (AIII). For severe Bartonella infections, combination therapy using erythromycin or doxycycline with a rifamycin class antibiotic is recommended (BIII), and intravenous therapy may be needed initially (AIII). For endocarditis, treatment should include doxycycline with the addition of a rifamycin class antibiotic for a minimum of 6 weeks (BII).

### A systematic review of clinical guidelines on the management of acute, community-acquired CNS infections [^1179bu7Y]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The data highlights the wide range of CMGs for acute, community-acquired CNS infections in use across Europe and variations in quality, clinical case definitions for guiding identification and in initial clinical recommendations. Most CMGs were produced by national or European organisations. Several survey respondents reported using CMGs produced by other countries in or outside of Europe, which may have implications for timely identification of causative pathogens and use of antibiotics, unless they are adapted to regional epidemiology.

There were several high-quality CMGs that adhered to most of the standards set out in the AGREE II tool. All of the highest scoring CMGs were focused on bacterial aetiologies. Many were more than 3 years old, which is the recommended time-frame for re-assessment of validity. This is a concern in light of the rapidly changing epidemiology of infections and antimicrobial resistance. The most recent Europe-wide CMG on bacterial meningitis was published in 2016, whilst the most recent Europe-wide CMG for viral CNS infections was updated in 2010. Though there might be additional CMGs not identified through the review or survey, this, together with the fact that many survey respondents used international CMGs, highlights a need for an updated European-wide CMG covering viral CNS infections in adult and paediatric populations that can be adapted nationally.

Initial phase

For individuals with M. abscessus isolates that are clarithromycin sensitive or demonstrate inducible macrolide resistance (see tables 7 and 8), the initial phase antibiotic regimen should include at least a 4-week course of intravenous amikacin, intravenous tigecycline and (where tolerated) intravenous imipenem, and (where tolerated) oral clarithromycin or oral azithromycin (grade D).
For individuals with M. abscessus complex isolates that demonstrate constitutive macrolide resistance (see tables 7 and 8), the initial phase antibiotic regimen should include a minimum 4-week course of intravenous amikacin, intravenous tigecycline and (where tolerated) intravenous imipenem (grade D).
The duration of intravenous treatment should be influenced by the severity of infection, treatment response and tolerance of the regimen (grade D).
To reduce the likelihood of treatment-related nausea and vomiting, antiemetic medication such as ondansetron (note potential for QT interval prolongation) and/or aprepitant should be prescribed to individuals receiving tigecycline and/or imipenem (grade D).
Nebulised amikacin may be considered in place of intravenous amikacin when intravenous administration is impractical, contraindicated or long-term treatment with an aminoglycoside is required in individuals with M. abscessus -PD (grade D).
In the context of amikacin-resistant M. abscessus (ie, MIC > 64 mg/L or the isolate is known to have a 16S rRNA gene mutation conferring constitutive amikacin resistance), intravenous/nebulised amikacin should be substituted with an alternative intravenous/oral antibiotic (grade D).

Methods

The systematic review was completed based on a protocol registered in the PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews (ID: CRD42014014212). The protocol was informed by infectious disease specialists and systematic reviewers.

Search strategy

One reviewer conducted the first electronic database search (PubMed, National Guideline Learning Centre, International Guideline Library, TRIP Database) from October 2004 to October 2014. Search terms were as follows: (central nervous system infection [MeSH Terms]) AND (clinical guideline OR clinical practice guideline OR physician guideline OR bedside clinical guideline OR clinical management guideline OR clinical practice protocol OR physician protocol OR clinical management protocol) AND ("last 10 years" [PDat]). An information specialist performed a second updated electronic search of Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, PubMed, TRIP Database and Google using the exploded thesaurus term "exp Central Nervous System Infections/", and the free text terms meningitis, encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, combined with a search filter for guidelines to 22 June 2017.

Search terms:

("Central Nervous System Infections"[Mesh]) OR meningitis [Title/Abstract]) OR meningoencephalitis [Title/Abstract]) OR encephalitis [Title/Abstract])) AND (guideline [Title]) OR guidelines [Title]) OR guidance [Title]) OR protocol [Title]) OR protocols [Title]) OR (("Guideline" [Publication Type] OR "Guidelines as Topic"[Mesh]) OR "Practice Guideline" [Publication Type])).

TRIP Database and Google were also searched for "meningitis guideline", "encephalitis guideline" and "meningoencephalitis guideline" up to 31 January 2019. The electronic database searches were supplemented by searching the references of included CMGs and CMGs identified through a brief electronic survey which was e-mailed to 115 clinicians in 33 European countries, through the CLIN-Net clinical network of the COMBACTE-Net Innovative Medicines Initiative. The survey asked clinicians which CMGs they used in their daily practice to identify and manage patients presenting with syndromes of acute, community-acquired CNS infections, and asked them to submit the CMGs via hyperlink or by e-mail. The survey was open from 20 June to 30 December 2016, with two electronic reminders.

### Vonoprazan fumarate and amoxicillin (Voquezna DUAL PAK) [^112HTrW8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Studies:

Combination Therapy with Vonoprazan, Amoxicillin, and Clarithromycin:

When vonoprazan 20 mg, amoxicillin 750 mg, and clarithromycin 400 mg were co-administered twice daily for 7 days (N = 11), there was no effect on pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin compared to administration of amoxicillin alone. However, vonoprazan Cmaxand AUC0–12hincreased by 87% and 85%, respectively, and clarithromycin, Cmaxand AUC0–12hincreased by 64% and 45%, respectively, compared to administration of each component alone.

Effect of Vonoprazan on CYP3A4 Substrates:

When a single oral dose of midazolam 2 mg was administered following vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily for 7 days (N = 20), midazolam AUC∞increased 93% compared to administration of midazolam alone.

Effect of CYP3A Inhibitors on Vonoprazan:

When a single 40 mg (2 times the highest approved recommended single dosage) dose of vonoprazan was administered with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for 7 days (N = 16), vonoprazan AUC∞increased 58% compared to administration of vonoprazan alone.

Effect of CYP3A Inducers on Vonoprazan:

Vonoprazan exposures are predicted to be 80% lower when co-administered with a strong CYP3A4 inducer such as rifampicin and 50% lower when co-administered with a moderate CYP3A4 inducer such as efavirenz.

Amoxicillin

Absorption

Amoxicillin is stable in the presence of gastric acid and is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Orally administered doses of 500-mg amoxicillin capsules result in average peak blood levels 1 to 2 hours after administration in the range of 5.5 mcg/mL to 7.5 mcg/mL, respectively.

Distribution

Amoxicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids, with the exception of brain and spinal fluid, except when meninges are inflamed. In blood serum, amoxicillin is approximately 20% protein-bound. Following a 1-gram dose and utilizing a special skin window technique to determine levels of the antibacterial, it was noted that therapeutic levels were found in the interstitial fluid.

Metabolism and Excretion

The half-life of amoxicillin is 61.3 minutes. Approximately 60% of an orally administered dose of amoxicillin is excreted in the urine within 6 to 8 hours. Detectable serum levels are observed up to 8 hours after an orally administered dose of amoxicillin. Since most of the amoxicillin is excreted unchanged in the urine, its excretion can be delayed by concurrent administration of probenecid.

Bacterial meningitis

There was consensus on the initial differential diagnostics for adults and older children presenting with syndromes suggestive of bacterial meningitis (Table 5). Besides two CMGs which only focused on N. meningitidis, all recommended testing for N. meningitidis and S. pneumoniae in adults and children, but with variations in recommendations for Hib testing. Most also recommended testing for L. monocytogenes in adults; four specified for adults over 50 years, and one in adults over 60 years. Additional risk groups for L. monocytogenes were specified as adults over 18 years old with chronic conditions causing immunosuppression.

### The UK joint specialist societies guideline on the diagnosis and management of acute meningitis and meningococcal sepsis in immunocompetent adults [^116tNaQu]. The Journal of Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Bacterial meningitis and meningococcal sepsis are rare conditions with high case fatality rates. Early recognition and prompt treatment saves lives. In 1999 the British Infection Society produced a consensus statement for the management of immunocompetent adults with meningitis and meningococcal sepsis. Since 1999 there have been many changes. We therefore set out to produce revised guidelines which provide a standardised evidence-based approach to the management of acute community acquired meningitis and meningococcal sepsis in adults. A working party consisting of infectious diseases physicians, neurologists, acute physicians, intensivists, microbiologists, public health experts and patient group representatives was formed. Key questions were identified and the literature reviewed. All recommendations were graded and agreed upon by the working party. The guidelines, which for the first time include viral meningitis, are written in accordance with the AGREE 2 tool and recommendations graded according to the GRADE system. Main changes from the original statement include the indications for pre-hospital antibiotics, timing of the lumbar puncture and the indications for neuroimaging. The list of investigations has been updated and more emphasis is placed on molecular diagnosis. Approaches to both antibiotic and steroid therapy have been revised. Several recommendations have been given regarding the follow-up of patients.

### Erythromycin lactobionate [^115pTmve]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Erythromycin diffuses readily into most body fluids. In the absence of meningeal inflammation, low concentrations are normally achieved in the spinal fluid but the passage of the drug across the blood-brain barrier increases in meningitis. Erythromycin crosses the placental barrier and is excreted in breast milk. Erythromycin is not removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.

In the presence of normal hepatic function, erythromycin is concentrated in the liver and is excreted in the bile; the effect of hepatic dysfunction on biliary excretion of erythromycin is not known. From 12 to 15 percent of intravenously administered erythromycin is excreted in active form in the urine.

Intravenous infusion of 500 mg of erythromycin lactobionate at a constant rate over 1 hour in fasting adults produced a mean serum erythromycin level of approximately 7 mcg/mL at 20 minutes, 10 mcg/mL at 1 hour, 2.6 mcg/mL at 2.5 hours, and 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours.

M icrobiology

Mechanism of Action

Erythromycin acts by inhibition of protein synthesis by binding 50 S ribosomal subunits of susceptible organisms. It does not affect nucleic acid synthesis.

Resistance

Resistance to erythromycin in S. aureus may emerge during therapy. Many isolates of Haemophilus influenzae are resistant to erythromycin but are susceptible to erythromycin and sulfonamides when used concomitantly.

Interactions With Other Antimicrobials

Antagonism has been demonstrated in vitro between erythromycin and clindamycin, lincomycin and chloramphenicol.

Antimicrobial Activity

Erythromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE):

Aerobic bacteria

Gram-positive bacteria

Corynebacterium diphtheriae

C orynebacterium minutissimum

Staphylococcus aureus

Streptococcus pneumoniae

Streptococcus pyogenes

Gram-negative bacteria

L e gionella pneumophila

Neisseria gonorrhoeae

Other Microorganisms

Myc oplasma pneumoniae

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for erythromycin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of erythromycin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Aggressive early treatment of meningococcal disease can reduce mortality. This relies on prompt recognition and treatment of the complications of septicaemia and meningitis, appropriate ongoing intensive care where necessary, and adequate management of multiple organ failure. Most children with meningococcal disease survive intact, but long term sequelae are increasingly recognised and make follow up essential. New treatments continue to be evaluated, but none has so far proven to be effective in further reducing morbidity or mortality. Simple, timely therapeutic manoeuvres may greatly improve the prospects for survival.

### Rationale for azithromycin in COVID-19: an overview of existing evidence [^112fnha5]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Second, despite the pleiotropic effects of azithromycin, it is certainly not the most potent molecule. Targeted antiviral drugs will likely have a more robust effect on the viral load. However, experience with influenza has taught us to start antivirals as soon as possible after host infection. Likewise, the anti-inflammatory effects of targeted anti-IL1, anti-IL6 or steroids are stronger, though probably only warranted when clear signs of hyperinflammation are present. If anything, one should not expect azithromycin to be put forward as 'the standard treatment', but rather as a part of a multimodal approach of antiviral, antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory and — in selected cases — antibiotic drugs, depending on the patient's presentation, immune status and disease stage.

Lastly, it is important to consider treatment effects that surpass acute pulmonary inflammation. Azithromycin has antifibrotic properties and crosses the blood–brain barrier. Possible morbidity of sequellar fibrotic lung disease and of prolonged neurological complaints extends well beyond the acute phase, and attenuating this later phase will significantly impact quality adjusted life years of COVID-19 patients. A comprehensive clinical trial assessment with extended follow-up is, therefore, crucial to confirm or exclude the hypothetical benefits of azithromycin in COVID-19.

In conclusion, its favourable safety profile, affordability and pleiotropic mechanisms have raised a large interest in azithromycin to treat COVID-19. Its effect on the early inflammatory phase is best supported by the current evidence, which is typically when the first symptoms arise and a patient contacts his caretaker. Before starting azithromycin, a comprehensive assessment for drug–drug interactions and cardiovascular risk factors is prerequisite, especially when use in the first line is advocated. Beyond that, the current data remain equivocal. Due to the scale of the current pandemic, however, even a small treatment effect could mean a significant absolute reduction in COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality. Moreover, we have currently no idea on how a second primary infection will be eradicated by the hosts' primed immune system. Beneficial modes of action should not be discarded based on short-term results obtained during the first wave of hospital admissions. In the next months, results of adequately performed randomised trials will provide better insight into the true role of azithromycin and other repurposed drugs in this historic pandemic. Still, as the field of intervention studies in COVID-19 is currently highly scattered, large coordinated international initiatives will be needed to pool aggregated and individual patient data to come to optimal conclusions.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^113n6Q7j]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in HIV — initial treatment recommendations emphasize that "Initial treatment of MAC disease should consist of two or more antimycobacterial drugs… (AI)". "Clarithromycin (AI) or azithromycin (AII) are preferred first agents", with azithromycin acceptable when interactions or intolerance preclude clarithromycin (AII). High-dose clarithromycin " > 1 g/day… should not be used (AI)" due to increased mortality. Susceptibility testing to clarithromycin or azithromycin "is recommended for all people with HIV", and resistance during prophylaxis has been documented: "In three randomized clinical trials… clarithromycin-resistant isolates were reported in 29% and 58%… and azithromycin-resistant isolates were recovered from 11%". More advanced immunosuppression at prophylaxis initiation and longer prophylaxis duration are associated with higher clarithromycin resistance at failure.

### A systematic review of clinical guidelines on the management of acute, community-acquired CNS infections [^114n9Yhr]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

There was a general consensus on diagnostic methods, but wider variations in infectious disease differential diagnostics recommendations, especially for paediatric and elderly populations. There was also general consensus on the most common bacterial causative agents for adults and older children, but variations in differential diagnostic recommendations for infants, neonates and elderly and in the definitions of these risk groups. This is illustrated by the different risk groups identified for L. monocytogenes infection, which in two CMGs were defined as adults over 50 years, whereas over 60 years in another. It is also illustrated by the wide variations in the definition of risk groups for GBS, defined as younger than 1 week, 28 days, 3 months or 24 months in the recommendations for neonates and infants.

In regard to empirical treatment, there was general consensus on recommended initial therapy for suspected viral aetiologies, pending diagnostics. Moreover, there was a consensus across CMGs on the need for urgent I.V. antibiotics on clinical suspicion of bacterial meningitis. However, only about half recommended pre-hospital antibiotics when presenting outside of a hospital setting. All CMGs recommended a third-generation cephalosporin for suspected bacterial aetiologies, to cover the most common pathogens in adults and children, but with variations in recommendations for adding penicillin to cover L. monocytogenes. Most of the European CMGs recommended the addition of vancomycin or rifampicin if decreased susceptibility to penicillin or third-generation cephalosporin is suspected based on geographical regions visited, whereas the CMG by NICE recommended it to all returning travellers. The CMG by IDSA aimed at all global settings recommended vancomycin to everyone beyond neonatal age, which highlights the risk of inappropriate antibiotics usage unless adapted to regional epidemiology.

Antimicrobial therapy duration for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt infections — observational evidence shows that in a prospective study of 70 patients at 10 centers, treatment duration ranged from 4 to 47 days with reinfection in 26% of patients; those who became reinfected had a mean of 14 days of therapy compared to 12.7 days for those without reinfection. Reinfection rates by therapy duration were 28.5% for ≤ 10 days, 23.3% for 11–20 days, and 27.7% for ≥ 21 days; after CSF cultures became negative, 7 days or less of therapy had a 20% reinfection rate versus 28% when treated longer than 7 days. A second large cohort of 675 patients followed after first infection noted a mean duration of therapy of 7.5 days in 15% of those who experienced reinfection compared to a mean duration of therapy of 9 days in those who did not experience reinfection.

### Neonate with Mycoplasma hominis meningoencephalitis given moxifloxacin [^111DC4Qx]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Mycoplasma hominis is a commensal organism in the genitourinary tract that can cause life-threatening CNS infections in neonates after intrauterine infection or through vertical transmission during birth. We present a case of an 11-day-old neonate presenting with fever and supporting laboratory evidence of a CNS infection. No systemic maternal infection or maternal genitourinary tract infection occurred at the time of delivery. Empirical treatment was initiated, consisting of amoxicillin, cefotaxime, and aciclovir. After clinical deterioration, 16S ribosomal DNA PCR in cerebrospinal fluid detected M hominis, antibiotic treatment was switched to moxifloxacin, and pharmacokinetic data were obtained. This Grand Round illustrates the challenges that exist in the diagnosis and treatment of M hominis meningoencephalitis: bacterial cultures are often negative and recommended empirical antimicrobials do not provide adequate antimicrobial coverage. Optimal antimicrobial treatment regimens for M hominis meningoencephalitis are unknown. Although we describe successful treatment of a neonate with a complicated M hominis meningoencephalitis with moxifloxacin, caution with fluoroquinolone monotherapy (including moxifloxacin) has to be taken into account because resistance to fluoroquinolones has previously been described.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1168F9FX]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Monitoring response to therapy and adverse events in MAC treatment for people with HIV: A repeat blood culture for MAC should be obtained 4 to 8 weeks after initiating antimycobacterial therapy in those who do not have a clinical response to initial treatment regimens. Improvement in fever and other systemic symptoms and a decline in quantity of mycobacteria in blood or tissue can be expected within 2 to 4 weeks after initiation of appropriate therapy, although clinical response may be delayed in those with more extensive MAC disease or advanced immunosuppression. Adverse effects of clarithromycin and azithromycin include GI upset, metallic taste, elevations in liver transaminase levels, and hypersensitivity reactions, and clarithromycin's adverse effects may be exacerbated when drug levels are increased due to drug interactions associated with some ARV.

### Antimicrobial use in central nervous system infections [^1144BwcY]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Central nervous system (CNS) infections are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this review is to summarize current antimicrobial therapies, as well as, updates in the management of community-acquired meningitis and healthcare-associated meningitis and ventriculitis.

Recent Findings

Due to the increasing rates of multidrug resistant and extensively-drug resistant organisms, available antimicrobials are limited. Novel treatment options include newer systemic antimicrobials and antimicrobials that have previously limited data in the management of CNS infections. Although limited by retrospective data, intrathecal (IT) and intraventricular (IVT) routes of administration offer the opportunity for antimicrobials that conventionally have minimal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration to achieve high CSF concentrations while minimizing systemic exposure.

Summary

Updates in the use of systemic, IT, and IVT antimicrobials offer promise as therapeutic options for CNS infections. Additional pharmacokinetic and prospective data are needed to confirm these findings.

### Advancing the chemotherapy of tuberculous meningitis: a consensus view [^115gvK5L]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Prevent and manage secondary neurological complications

Neurological complications majorly contribute to poor outcome from TBM. Most manifestations, including raised intracranial pressure, hydrocephalus, cerebral infarction, paradoxical reactions, and seizures, are a direct consequence of intracranial inflammation, emphasising the need to prioritise evaluation of more effective anti-inflammatory therapies. However, evidence-based interventions for adjunctive neurocritical care in TBM are also needed. Trials defining the management of these important complications have never been conducted. This is partly because of resource constraints in high burden settings, for example limited access to expertise for ventricular drainage, and because of substantial challenges in trial design and implementation.

### Safety and tolerability of a short course of linezolid for the treatment of predominantly moderate to severe tuberculous meningitis in adults with human immunodeficiency virus [^112Lu6A6]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is universally fatal without treatment. Even among patients who receive recommended therapy, 25%–50% will die. In those who survive, neurologic disability is common. Despite these poor outcomes, there is a paucity of data on how to optimize antituberculosis therapy for TBM, including for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The highest proportion of deaths occurs within the first month after treatment initiation, suggesting that there may be a critical window early in the disease course during which enhanced treatment could have the greatest impact on clinical outcomes.

In the absence of compelling data to guide treatment, the same standard drug regimens and dosing used for pulmonary tuberculosis are empirically used for TBM, except with a longer continuation phase to complete 9–12 months of therapy. This approach assumes that the efficacy of tuberculosis drugs is equivalent at all sites of infection, disregarding the unique challenges of infection of the central nervous system (CNS). Effective drugs for TBM must penetrate the blood-brain barrier and remain in the CNS to achieve bactericidal drug concentrations for an adequate duration. At standard dosing recommended in current guidelines, rifampin, a key drug in the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, seldom reaches minimal inhibitory concentrations for M. tuberculosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which may jeopardize treatment efficacy in TBM.

Several recently completed or ongoing clinical trials are investigating the effect of high-dose rifampin on mortality rates in TBM. However, even in one small trial that suggested a favorable effect of high-dose rifampin on the treatment of TBM, the mortality rate still exceeded 33% in the experimental arm, arguing that additional drugs may be needed to augment the potential benefit of high-dose rifampin. Adjunctive linezolid, given for the first month of treatment of TBM, may enhance bactericidal activity during the rapid growth phase of M. tuberculosis while minimizing toxicity. In observational studies, the addition of linezolid to treat TBM in adults and children has been associated with better neurologic outcomes and lower mortality rates.

In the Adjunctive Linezolid for the Treatment of TubERculous Meningitis (ALTER) trial, we (1) assessed the safety and tolerability of 4 weeks of linezolid 1200 mg once daily administered with high-dose or standard-dose rifampin and (2) compared mortality rates and functional independence between participants randomized to linezolid versus no linezolid for the treatment of definite or suspected TBM.

### Empiric therapy… [^1144vBkJ]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Initial Management Steps When a patient presents with suspected acute bacterial meningitis, the physician should begin antimicrobial therapy as soon as possible. Bacterial meningitis is a neurologic emergency; progression to more severe disease reduces the patient's likelihood of a full recovery. Empiric therapy Empiric therapy should begin as soon as bacterial meningitis is thought likely. Widespread resistance to penicillins and sulfonamides has forced a consideration of new agents for the treatment of bacterial meningitis, such as cephalosporins, vancomycin, rifampin, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones. Choice of agents for empiric therapy should be determined by the patient's age and the presence of predisposing conditions, and should assume antimicrobial resistance. Recommendations are listed in.

There is some concern that adjunctive dexamethasone therapy may inhibit the efficacy of cerebrospinal fluid vancomycin and would therefore be harmful to patients with penicillin- or cephalosporin-resistant strains. However, in the absence of data from clinical trials, adjunctive dexamethasone is recommended for all adults with suspected or proven pneumococcal meningitis, and in infants and children with. Patients receiving adjunctive dexamethasone for the treatment of suspected pneumococcal meningitis may benefit from the addition of rifampin to the combination of vancomycin and a third-generation cephalosporin. Antimicrobial Agents Cephalosporins Third-generation cephalosporins are recommended for the treatment of childhood bacterial meningitis and for pneumococcal and meningococcal meningitis caused by penicillin-resistant strains. They are the drugs of choice for empiric therapy in the treatment of.

Carbapenems Imipenem has proved successful, but is not recommended for treatment of meningitis in most patients because of the potential for seizure activity. Meropenem has less potential for seizure and is recommended as an alternative to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone in the treatment of patients with bacterial meningitis, and for use in the treatment of meningitis caused by certain gram-negative bacilli.

### Review of antibacterial drugs for treatment of infections… [^112Jk4GW]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Medical Letter consultants last reviewed the antimicrobial agents for treatment of bacterial infections in 1996. Because new drugs have emerged and new information about older agents is now available, recommendations are discussed again. Vancomycin may be required for highly resistant strains. In ambulatory patients, an oral macrolide, doxycycline or a fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin is recommended. Hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, often caused by gram-negative bacilli such as. Klebsiella, should be initially treated with a third-generation cephalosporin, cefepime, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid or imipenem — with or without an aminoglycoside. In the intensive care unit, where Pseudomonas aeruginosa is common, imipenem or meropenem plus an aminoglycoside would be a good first choice of therapy. Meningitis.

The organisms most commonly responsible for bacterial meningitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. In adults and children older than two months, cefotaxime or ceftriaxone is recommended, plus vancomycin to cover resistant pneumococci. Vancomycin and rifampin are stopped if the organism is found to be susceptible to cephalosporins. In patients who are allergic to penicillin, vancomycin can be used for treatment of resistant pneumococci. In children, administration of dexamethasone before or at the same time as the first dose of antibiotics to decrease the incidence of hearing loss and neurologic complications remains a matter of controversy. However, it is recommended if the meningitis is due to H. influenzae. Because of the high incidence of group B streptococci in newborns, ampicillin plus cefotaxime, with or without gentamicin, is usually recommended. Sepsis Syndrome.

The third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins can be used to treat sepsis caused by many strains of gram-negative bacilli. The initial treatment should include either a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem or meropenem — each with an aminoglycoside.
