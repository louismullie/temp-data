## Question

Maranthic endocarditis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about marantic endocarditis, also known as non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and nomenclature. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and predisposing conditions. Next, I will review clinical presentation and diagnostic strategy, including how to distinguish it from infective endocarditis. After that, I need to examine management principles, including anticoagulation and when to consider surgery. Finally, I should appraise prognosis and highlight special scenarios and pitfalls, making sure I double-check any numerical claims against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the terminology and core definition. Marantic endocarditis is synonymous with non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis, characterized by sterile, platelet–fibrin vegetations on cardiac valves without infection, most often the mitral and aortic valves, and frequently linked to hypercoagulable states such as malignancy and autoimmune disease, with emerging associations including COVID-19 and other inflammatory conditions [^7e0f855c] [^1740dad0] [^38661f90].

> I need to check the pathophysiology next. The mechanism hinges on endothelial injury plus a hypercoagulable milieu that promotes platelet aggregation and fibrin deposition on valves, yielding friable vegetations prone to embolization; immune complex deposition and cytokine-mediated endothelial activation contribute, particularly in lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome, and the embolic risk exceeds that of infective endocarditis because the vegetations lack the organizing bacterial biofilm seen in IE [^6b09dd70] [^6b99a8be] [^1740dad0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about associations without verifying frequencies. In contemporary series, malignancy and autoimmune disease dominate the etiologic landscape, with stroke as the most common presentation; for example, a 20-year Cleveland Clinic cohort found malignancy in 40.5%, SLE in 33.3%, and APS in 35.7%, with stroke in 59.5% of patients, and TEE dramatically outperformed TTE for detection, identifying NBTE in 97.1% of cases when performed [^527f218e]. I should also note that COVID-19 has been repeatedly linked to NBTE in case reports, plausibly via systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, though high-quality prevalence data are limited [^38661f90] [^1740dad0].

> Next, I should review the clinical presentation. Patients often present with embolic phenomena — most frequently ischemic stroke — and may have multi-territory infarcts or visceral infarcts, while fever and systemic infection signs are typically absent; case series document strokes, renal and splenic infarcts, and occasionally heart failure from valvular dysfunction, and cryptogenic stroke in active cancer is associated with poor survival, reinforcing the need to consider NBTE in that context [^527f218e] [^dec7b3e2] [^6404a74b].

> I will now examine the diagnostic strategy, and I need to ensure I distinguish NBTE from culture-negative infective endocarditis. Negative blood cultures are expected in NBTE, but I should double-check that I do not misclassify CNIE as NBTE; the AHA notes that CNIE includes both fastidious organisms and noninfectious etiologies such as NBTE, so a structured approach is essential [^afa96461]. TTE is first-line but has low sensitivity for small vegetations; TEE is far more sensitive and should be pursued when suspicion remains high or TTE is nondiagnostic, and in cancer patients with stroke, TEE increases the yield of identifying a cardiac source substantially compared with TTE [^527f218e] [^48ed0722] [^5f5b3f39]. Wait, let me verify the role of advanced imaging: cardiac CT can complement echocardiography by defining perivalvular anatomy and pseudoaneurysms, and in selected cases, nuclear imaging such as labeled WBC or FDG-PET may help differentiate infectious from noninfectious endocarditis, though evidence is stronger for prosthetic valve IE than for native-valve NBTE [^06673573] [^daa7ad07].

> Let me think about the differential diagnosis and how to avoid misclassification. I should confirm the absence of infection with repeated, high-quality blood cultures before antibiotics when feasible, and apply modified Duke criteria judiciously, recognizing that NBTE can fulfill clinical criteria without positive cultures; importantly, NBTE vegetations may show diffuse valve thickening and are composed of platelets and fibrin without organisms, which can aid differentiation from IE when tissue is available [^fb818cd3] [^6b99a8be]. But wait, what if the patient already received antibiotics? Prior antibiotic exposure is a common cause of culture negativity and can obscure IE, so I need to integrate timing of antibiotics, clinical course, and imaging features before labeling a case as NBTE [^afa96461].

> Now, I should review management principles. The cornerstone is therapeutic anticoagulation to reduce embolic risk, with low molecular weight heparin or warfarin commonly used; direct oral anticoagulants have limited evidence in NBTE, so I should be cautious and individualize based on comorbidities and bleeding risk, and I should confirm that anticoagulation is continued as long as the hypercoagulable driver persists [^527f218e] [^1740dad0]. I need to ensure the underlying cause is addressed, particularly cancer therapy or immunomodulation for autoimmune disease, because source control modifies thrombotic risk over time [^1740dad0].

> Hold on, I should verify surgical indications. Surgery is not routine in NBTE but is reasonable for refractory heart failure from valvular dysfunction, recurrent embolization despite anticoagulation, or very large, mobile vegetations at high embolic risk; case series and reports describe valve replacement or, in select right-sided lesions, percutaneous strategies, with decisions best made in a multidisciplinary Heart Valve Team framework [^527f218e] [^12900320]. I should double-check that preoperative imaging and anticoagulation planning are optimized to mitigate embolic complications during the perioperative period [^notfound].

> Next, I should review prognosis and make sure I cite the right figures. Mortality in NBTE is high and largely driven by the underlying disease, especially advanced malignancy; in the Cleveland Clinic series, 38.1% died with median follow-up of 8.2 months, and cryptogenic stroke in active cancer carries markedly shortened survival, underscoring the aggressive biology of cancer-associated thrombosis and the importance of early recognition [^527f218e] [^6404a74b]. Let me reconsider whether outcomes have improved over time; contemporary reviews suggest some improvement with better detection and anticoagulation, but evidence remains largely observational and heterogeneous [^afa96461].

> I should confirm special scenarios and pitfalls. NBTE can be the first manifestation of occult malignancy, prompting directed cancer screening when no other source is identified; case reports describe pancreatic, lung, ovarian, and other solid tumors uncovered after embolic events led to echocardiographic diagnosis of NBTE, so a low threshold for age-appropriate cancer evaluation is warranted [^dec7b3e2] [^f27c01b3] [^e7a5a6cd]. But wait, what if the vegetation is on the right side? Right-sided NBTE is less common but does occur, and percutaneous options may be considered when surgical risk is prohibitive, though evidence is limited to case reports and should be individualized [^12900320].

> Finally, I need to ensure the diagnostic and management algorithm is explicit and practical. Suspect NBTE in patients with embolic stroke or multi-territory infarcts, particularly with active cancer, autoimmune disease, or COVID-19, and no fever or positive cultures; obtain TTE promptly and proceed to TEE if TTE is negative or nondiagnostic; exclude infection with repeated blood cultures before antibiotics when feasible; initiate therapeutic anticoagulation and treat the underlying condition; involve cardiology, oncology, neurology, and cardiothoracic surgery early; and consider surgery for refractory heart failure, recurrent embolism despite anticoagulation, or high-risk vegetations, recognizing that prognosis hinges on control of the underlying disease and that TEE is the imaging modality of choice for detection and follow-up [^527f218e] [^1740dad0] [^5f5b3f39].

Marantic endocarditis, also known as non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE), is a **sterile, non-infectious endocarditis** characterized by fibrin-platelet vegetations on heart valves, most often the mitral and aortic valves [^6b99a8be]. It is strongly associated with **malignancy** (especially adenocarcinomas) and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome [^527f218e] [^7e0f855c]. Diagnosis relies on **echocardiography** (TEE superior to TTE) [^527f218e] and exclusion of infection with negative blood cultures [^afa96461]. Management centers on **anticoagulation** (LMWH or VKA) [^79afc14a] and treatment of the underlying disease; surgery is reserved for refractory embolism or severe valvular dysfunction [^527f218e]. Prognosis is poor, with high mortality due to embolic complications, particularly stroke [^527f218e] [^6404a74b].

---

## Pathophysiology

- **Endothelial injury**: Tumor-derived cytokines, immune complexes, or mechanical turbulence damage valve endothelium, exposing subendothelial tissue and activating platelets and coagulation cascades [^6b09dd70].
- **Hypercoagulability**: Malignancy and autoimmune states elevate circulating thrombin and fibrin, promoting platelet aggregation and fibrin deposition [^6b09dd70].
- **Vegetation formation**: Platelet-fibrin thrombi build on valves, lacking inflammatory cells or microorganisms, making them friable and embolic [^6b99a8be].

---

## Clinical associations

| **Category** | **Associated conditions** |
|-|-|
| Malignancy | - Adenocarcinomas (lung, pancreas, gastric, colon, ovary) [^6b99a8be] <br/> - Hematologic malignancies (e.g. T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia) [^8c8995b8] |
| Autoimmune diseases | - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [^527f218e] <br/> - Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) [^527f218e] <br/> - Rheumatoid arthritis [^7e0f855c] |
| Other hypercoagulable states | - Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [^notfound] <br/> - Sepsis [^notfound] <br/> - COVID-19 (reported cases) [^38661f90] |

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Embolic events**: Stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and visceral or peripheral emboli are the most common manifestations [^527f218e] [^6b99a8be].
- **Neurological symptoms**: Focal deficits, confusion, or cognitive decline from cerebral emboli [^527f218e] [^e7a5a6cd].
- **Cardiac symptoms**: Less common; valvular dysfunction may cause heart failure or murmurs [^6b99a8be] [^527f218e].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Typically absent (e.g. fever, night sweats), helping distinguish from infective endocarditis [^afa96461].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and methods

- **Echocardiography**: TTE may detect larger vegetations, but TEE has superior sensitivity and specificity, especially for small vegetations and multi-valve disease [^527f218e] [^5f5b3f39].
- **Blood cultures**: Essential to exclude infection; NBTE has consistently negative cultures [^afa96461].
- **Imaging features**: Vegetations are typically irregular, mobile, and non-destructive, often on the atrial side of the mitral valve or ventricular side of the aortic valve [^6b99a8be].
- **Modified Duke criteria**: Useful to exclude infective endocarditis; NBTE may meet clinical criteria without microbiological evidence [^fb818cd3].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The key distinction is from **infective endocarditis (IE)** [^7e0f855c], which presents with fever, positive blood cultures, and destructive valvular lesions; Libman-Sacks endocarditis in SLE/APS shares sterile vegetations but has distinct immunologic features; and atrial myxoma presents as a solitary, non-valvular mass [^notfound].

---

## Management

- **Anticoagulation**: LMWH or VKA are first-line to reduce embolic risk; DOACs are not well studied in NBTE [^527f218e] [^79afc14a].
- **Treat underlying disease**: Control malignancy or autoimmune disease to reduce hypercoagulability [^527f218e] [^576c1adf].
- **Surgical intervention**: Consider valve repair/replacement for recurrent embolism despite anticoagulation or severe valvular dysfunction [^527f218e] [^12900320].
- **Multidisciplinary care**: Involve cardiology, oncology, rheumatology, and neurology for optimal outcomes [^527f218e].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **poor**, with high mortality driven by embolic complications, especially stroke [^527f218e] [^6404a74b]. Survival is particularly grim in advanced malignancy, whereas outcomes improve with effective treatment of the underlying disease and anticoagulation [^527f218e] [^afa96461].

---

## Recent advances and controversies

Recent advances include recognition of **COVID-19-associated NBTE** [^38661f90] and exploration of multimodality imaging (CT, PET) to improve detection and differentiate NBTE from IE [^06673573] [^daa7ad07]. Controversies persist regarding the optimal anticoagulant regimen, the role of DOACs, and the timing of surgical intervention [^notfound].

---

Marantic endocarditis is a **sterile, embolic endocarditis** linked to malignancy and autoimmune disease; diagnosis hinges on echocardiography and exclusion of infection, and management focuses on anticoagulation and treating the underlying condition, with prognosis largely determined by the underlying disease and embolic burden [^527f218e] [^7e0f855c].

### Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis: a clinical and pathophysiological reappraisal [^1740dad0]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE), formerly recognized as marantic endocarditis, represents a rare cardiovascular pathology intricately linked with hypercoagulable states, notably malignancy and autoimmune disorders. Characterized by the development of sterile vegetations comprised of fibrin and platelets on cardiac valves, NBTE poses a diagnostic challenge due to its resemblance to infective endocarditis. Therapeutic endeavours primarily revolve around addressing the underlying aetiology and instituting anticoagulant regimens to forestall embolic events, with surgical intervention seldom warranted. Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis frequently coexists with malignancies and autoimmune conditions, such as lupus and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and, more recently, has been associated with COVID-19. Its pathogenesis is underpinned by a complex interplay of endothelial dysfunction, hypercoagulability, hypoxia, and immune complex deposition. Clinical manifestations typically manifest as embolic phenomena, particularly cerebrovascular accidents, bearing substantial mortality rates. Diagnosis necessitates a high index of suspicion and meticulous exclusion of infective endocarditis, often facilitated by advanced cardiac imaging modalities. Anticoagulation, typically employing low molecular weight heparin or warfarin, constitutes the cornerstone of pharmacological intervention. Surgical recourse may be warranted in instances of refractory heart failure or recurrent embolic events. Given its multifaceted nature, the management of NBTE mandates a multidisciplinary approach, with prognosis contingent upon individual clinical intricacies. Future endeavours should prioritize further research to refine therapeutic strategies and enhance patient outcomes.

### Atypical marantic endocarditis [^f27c01b3]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Marantic endocarditis is a rare non-infectious endocarditis that mostly affects the aortic and mitral valves. It is often an autopsy finding that is most commonly seen in advanced malignancies thought to be due to a hypercoagulable state. When diagnosed antemortem, it typically presents with signs and symptoms of embolisation. We report a case of a 44-year-old Caucasian man with marantic endocarditis secondary to metastatic small cell lung cancer. Our patient presented with a short history of lower back pain with no signs/symptoms of embolisation, and a pansystolic murmur on initial physical examination. Serial blood cultures were negative and transthoracic echocardiography revealed vegetation on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Further imaging in the form of MRI spine and CT thorax/abdomen/pelvis showed pulmonary lesions with liver and bony metastasis. Subsequent image-guided biopsy confirmed metastatic small cell lung cancer of T1N2M1c grade, which was treated with palliative chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

### Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis: a state-of-the-art contemporary review [^7e0f855c]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE), also known as Libman-Sacks, marantic, thrombotic, or verrucous endocarditis, is a form of non-infective endocarditis that affects cardiac structures in patients who have predisposing underlying conditions. 1 As it is rarely encountered in routine clinical practice, the condition may be overlooked or misdiagnosed. On the other hand, other similar clinical entities might be erroneously labeled as NBTE. Notwithstanding its ostensibly uncommon appearance in clinical practice, our understanding of NBTE has been expanding, especially with the advent of modern and advanced diagnostic tools that facilitate the evaluation process. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of NBTE, with a focus on the contemporary diagnostic evaluation and management.

### A contemporary 20-year Cleveland clinic experience of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis: etiology, echocardiographic imaging, management, and outcomes [^527f218e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, or marantic endocarditis, is rare. Contemporary data on the etiology, echocardiographic evaluation, and management of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis are limited.

Methods

A single-center retrospective cohort study was performed. Electronic medical records and echocardiographic records were searched for patients ages ≥ 18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis between January 1999 and November 2019. Demographic, echocardiographic, and management data were collected.

Results

Of 600,577 transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) and 89,264 transesophageal echocardiograms (TEEs), 42 patients had nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (mean age: 54 ± 14.5 years; 66.7% were female). The median duration of follow-up was 8.2 (interquartile range 3.3–24.4) months. Seventeen patients (40.5%) had malignancy, 33.3% had systemic lupus erythematosus, and 35.7% had antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Stroke was the most common presentation (59.5%). TTE enabled the diagnosis in 19 cases (45.2%), compared with TEE, which identified the condition in 33 of 34 (97.1%) cases in which it was utilized. Three-dimensional echocardiography was performed in 17 TEEs. The most common valves involved were mitral (61.9%), and aortic (23.8%) valves. Thirty-two patients were managed with anticoagulation. Ten patients underwent surgery. Sixteen (38.1%) patients died, most of whom had a diagnosis of advanced malignancy.

Conclusion

In a contemporary 20-year cohort, TTE and TEE played important roles in diagnosis, with superior diagnostic performance of TEE for nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis. Mortality was high, and advanced malignancy portended a worse prognosis. Management in most cases was therapeutic anticoagulation. In select cases, surgery provided favorable outcomes.

### Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis in a patient with COVID [^38661f90]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Background

Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE), also known as marantic or Libman-Sacks endocarditis, is a condition characterised by non-infectious vegetations attached to cardiac valves and/or endocardium. These vegetations are mainly composed of sterile platelet aggregates. The condition was first described by Zeigler in 1888 and first coined as 'non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis' by Gross and Friedberg in 1936. NBTE is mainly associated with hypercoagulable states or malignancy and typically affects the aortic or mitral valves.

COVID-19 has caused a major pandemic, with high morbidity and mortality. One of the complications of this infection is a hypercoagulable state, with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism as the most common thromboembolic events reported in the literature. We describe a unique case of COVID-19 complicated by NBTE with longitudinal multidisciplinary follow-up.

### Synchronous primary endometrial and ovarian carcinoma in a patient with marantic endocarditis [^cad225ed]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE), or marantic endocarditis, is a rare form of endocarditis found in patients with advanced malignancy and collagen-vascular disorders. There is limited information about the clinical course of patients with NBTE because the majority of cases are found at the time of autopsy.

Case

A 38-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with recent onset of chest pain and fatigue. Initial evaluation revealed cardiac valvular disease, and the patient underwent aortic valve replacement. Final pathology revealed nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis. A metastatic work-up revealed a complex pelvic mass and elevated CA 125. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy and was subsequently found to have synchronous primary endometrial and ovarian carcinoma.

Conclusion

Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis is rare and carries a high mortality. This case is unusual in that the diagnosis of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis led to the diagnosis of a gynecologic malignancy.

### Recurrent embolism in the course of marantic endocarditis [^683883fc]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Marantic or nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) associated with systemic embolism is usually a complication of advanced or terminal malignancies. We report on the case of a 46-year-old woman in whom nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE)-related cerebral embolism was the first clinical sign of ovarian neoplasm, which was diagnosed after cardiac surgery. Marantic endocarditis should alert the physician to make every effort to diagnose the possible background of this clinical phenomenon. Early identification of NBTE, treatment of the underlying disease, and the associated coagulopathy could possibly prevent cardiac surgery.

### Cryptogenic subtype predicts reduced survival among cancer patients with ischemic stroke [^6404a74b]. Stroke (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Cryptogenic stroke is common in patients with cancer. Autopsy studies suggest that many of these cases may be because of marantic endocarditis, which is closely linked to cancer activity. We, therefore, hypothesized that among patients with cancer and ischemic stroke, those with cryptogenic stroke would have shorter survival.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed all adult patients with active systemic cancer diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke at a tertiary care cancer center from 2005 through 2009. Two neurologists determined stroke mechanisms by consensus. Patients were diagnosed with cryptogenic stroke if no specific mechanism could be determined. The diagnosis of marantic endocarditis was restricted to patients with cardiac vegetations on echocardiography or autopsy and negative blood cultures. Patients were followed until July 31, 2012, for the primary outcome of death. Kaplan-Meier statistics and the log-rank test were used to compare survival between patients with cryptogenic stroke and patients with known stroke mechanisms. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis evaluated the association between cryptogenic stroke and death after adjusting for potential confounders.

Results

Among 263 patients with cancer and ischemic stroke, 133 (51%) were cryptogenic. Median survival in patients with cryptogenic stroke was 55 days (interquartile range, 21–240) versus 147 days (interquartile range, 33–735) in patients with known stroke mechanisms (P < 0.01). Cryptogenic stroke was independently associated with death (hazard ratio, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.25–2.14) after adjusting for age, systemic metastases, adenocarcinoma histology, and functional status.

Conclusions

Cryptogenic stroke is independently associated with reduced survival in patients with active cancer and ischemic stroke.

### Non-surgical extirpation of a non-infectious expanding tricuspid valve mass by percutaneous aspiration thrombectomy [^12900320]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Marantic endocarditis refers to a noninfectious lesion, usually in the aortic and mitral valves, that is most commonly seen in advanced malignancy and systemic lupus erythematosus. Inflammatory conditions, including antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), are a rare etiology making up less than 20% of reported cases. The condition is thought to be due to a hypercoagulable state and found postmortem with rates in autopsy series ranging from 0.9% to 1.6%. In comparison to infective endocarditis, marantic endocarditis has a greater tendency for valve vegetations to embolize. Common treatment modalities include anticoagulation or valve replacement. Although percutaneous aspiration thrombectomy of right-sided heart chamber thrombi exists, there are limited reports demonstrating its use with regards to treatment of right-sided endocarditis. We present the case of an older male with a history of Factor V Leiden and APS who was admitted due to a rapidly expanding mass on the tricuspid valve (TV). Despite serial blood cultures being negative, the patient received adequate antibiotic therapy for more than 4 weeks. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed an enlarged TV vegetation with an increased diameter from 10 to 30mm over 6 weeks. Due to the patient's high operative risk and concern for embolization complications, a multidisciplinary decision was made to perform percutaneous aspiration thrombectomy of the TV vegetation. Subsequent biopsy of the lesion confirmed it was noninfectious and nonmalignant. Thus, the patient was started on systemic anticoagulation for prevention of thromboembolic events.

### Psychosis due to non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis [^8c45c04e]. Age and Ageing (2010). Low credibility.

Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis or marantic endocarditis is an uncommon and frequently terminal condition. We report non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis presenting as a psychotic illness. The underlying cause was found to be adenocarcinoma of the lung. The patient was nursed on a specialist joint medical/psychiatric unit. Many medical illnesses can present with psychosis in older people: this is the first case report of this presentation in non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis.

### Marantic endocarditis and paraneoplastic pulmonary embolism [^576c1adf]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Cancer is frequently associated with a hypercoagulable state. Almost 15% of patients with cancer will suffer a thromboembolic event during their clinical course. The aetiology of this hypercoagulable state is multifactorial and includes procoagulant factors associated with malignancy as well as the host's inflammatory response. Cancer-associated thrombophilia can present as venous thromboembolism, migratory superficial thrombophlebitis, arterial thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic microangiopathy and rarely non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). In this paper, we will describe an uncommon presentation of lung cancer on a non-smoker middle-aged woman, with recent diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, who develops malignant recurrent pleural effusion, NBTE with cutaneous and neurological manifestations, with a rapid evolution into shock, culminating in death. Diagnosis of NBTE requires a high degree of clinical suspicion. The mainstay of treatment is systemic anticoagulation to prevent further embolisation and underlying cancer control whenever is possible.

### Guidelines for the use of echocardiography in the evaluation of a cardiac source of embolism [^6b99a8be]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) — associations, embolic risk, and imaging features are described as most commonly malignancy related: it "most commonly refers to noninfectious thrombotic endocarditis associated with malignancy, particularly related to solid metastatic carcinomas and lung, pancreatic, gastric, and unknown origin adenocarcinomas". In cancer, "15% of patients with cancer experience thromboembolism during their disease, and postmortem studies identify deep venous thrombosis in up to 50% of patients", and "up to 50% of patients with NBTE may incur systemic embolic events". Marantic vegetations "are composed of platelets and fibrin, uncommonly cause significant valvular dysfunction, and classically affect the atrial side of the MV and ventricular side of the aortic valve". On imaging, "Echo texture and location are not different from those of IE", but "there is usually significant and diffuse thickening of the leaflets or cusps of the involved valve in NBTE, which may help differentiate between IE and NBTE".

### Marantic endocarditis: incidental infarcts leading to diagnosis of pancreatic cancer [^dec7b3e2]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is a well-described phenomenon associated with malignancies due to hypercoaguable state. In the setting of pancreatic cancer, NBTE is more commonly diagnosed postmortem. We describe a case of a man who was diagnosed with pancreatic carcinoma after incidental finding of NBTE. Imaging incidentally revealed multiple strokes, bilateral renal and splenic infarcts, while subsequent workup for cardioembolic source demonstrated a 1.1×0.7cm mitral valve vegetation. As multiple blood cultures were sterile and patient lacked clinical signs of infection, an underlying malignancy was suspected. CT abdomen demonstrated a dilated pancreatic duct, MRI showed a 2.8×2.2cm pancreatic head mass. Endoscopic biopsy of the mass revealed pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Other than NBTE, there were no other clinical or laboratory findings to clearly suggest pancreatic cancer. Thus, incidental discovery of this mitral valve vegetation led to the diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy.

### Challenges in infective endocarditis [^3579466f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is defined by a focus of infection within the heart and is a feared disease across the field of cardiology. It is frequently acquired in the health care setting, and more than one-half of cases now occur in patients without known heart disease. Despite optimal care, mortality approaches 30% at 1 year. The challenges posed by infective endocarditis are significant. It is heterogeneous in etiology, clinical manifestations, and course. Staphylococcus aureus, which has become the predominant causative organism in the developed world, leads to an aggressive form of the disease, often in vulnerable or elderly patient populations. There is a lack of research infrastructure and funding, with few randomized controlled trials to guide practice. Longstanding controversies such as the timing of surgery or the role of antibiotic prophylaxis have not been resolved. The present article reviews the challenges posed by infective endocarditis and outlines current and future strategies to limit its impact.

### Cardiac computed tomography in cardio-oncology: primer [^06673573]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Cardiac CT for endocarditis assessment in cancer patients (infectious and nonbacterial thrombotic)

Endocarditis can be a complication of cancer and cancer-related treatments. These patients may be more prone to nosocomial infective endocarditis (IE), and a diagnosis of IE has been noted at a higher incidence in colorectal cancer patients compared with those with lung, breast, and prostate cancers, and is associated with shorter survival. In addition, there is a nonbacterial, marantic thrombotic phenotype of endocarditis thought to originate from the hypercoagulable state of certain malignancies; it can be associated with embolic events including cerebrovascular strokes and can contribute significantly to morbidity. Although TEE is considered the standard noninvasive diagnostic imaging modality, there is increasing evidence that cardiac CTA can provide complementary imaging information — aside from coronary anatomy assessment that may be required before surgery. In comparing the 2 imaging modalities, TEE provides higher sensitivity in detecting valvular vegetations — particularly those of smaller size — valve perforation, and intracardiac fistula compared with cardiac CTA. However, cardiac CTA may detect pseudoaneurysm and perivalvular lesions/abscesses with higher accuracy. The ESC 2015 Guidelines for the Management of Infective Endocarditis have integrated cardiac CTA into their modified criteria for the diagnosis of IE, including cardiac CTA detection of definite paravalvular lesions as a major imaging criteria for IE. In addition, cardiac CTA findings of pseudoaneurysm or abscess in patients undergoing surgery for IE may be independent predictors of increased mortality in long-term follow-up.

In summary, cardiac CT, even in its current applications in assessment of cardiac function and use in preplanning for percutaneous structural approaches, can yield important anatomic information of the cardiac sequalae of cancer treatment, NET-associated valvular disease, or visualizing complex cardiac infections; in addition to this, it can visualize both cardiac and extracardiac-related findings that can help determine a patient's suitability for either surgical or percutaneous approaches. Future avenues to investigate our understanding of radiation-induced valvular disease could involve evaluating RT techniques in the modern era with serial imaging combined with ECG gated protocols — either for radiation treatment or for cancer staging/surveillance purposes — to evaluate the progression of valvular remodeling from radiation treatments and carcinoid disease to better understand of the historical time course of such effects.

### Culture-negative bivalvular endocarditis with myocardial destruction in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus: a case report [^5edb88ed]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Culture-negative endocarditis (CNE) is known by many names including marantic endocarditis (ME), non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis, verrucous endocarditis, and Libman-Sacks vegetations in collagen vascular diseases, specifically, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). First described by Zeigler in 1888 and derived from the Greek marantikos, meaning "wasting away", ME typically involves a single valve with rare involvement of two or more valves. Structural valve disease is common in the SLE population and the valve abnormality usually consists of leaflet thickening with small vegetations often discovered at autopsy. The pathophysiology of vegetation formation is not entirely understood, but involves platelet deposition on a damaged endothelial surface, possibly from up-regulated cytokines and immune complex damage, with an absence of inflammatory cells. Though typically asymptomatic, there is an excess incidence of stroke, embolism, and heart failure. Valvular lesions appear to be unrelated to duration or activity of illness and may occur at any time. There are few cases of multi-valvular involvement with ME and even fewer cases that involve direct myocardial damage. We present the case of a woman with SLE admitted for an elective mitral valve repair who was found to have mitral and aortic valve culture-negative vegetations with atrial destruction. A thorough workup for a possible microbial etiology utilizing current advanced techniques was negative.

### Expert consensus for multimodality imaging evaluation of adult patients during and after cancer therapy: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^dc8be017]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2014). Medium credibility.

Valvular heart disease in oncology — etiologies and imaging guidance — notes that chemotherapeutic agents do not appear to directly affect cardiac valves; however, valvular heart disease may manifest in oncologic patients for a number of reasons, including preexisting valve lesions, concomitant radiation therapy, severe infection as a complication of chemotherapy, or CTRCD. Primary or secondary cardiac tumors may rarely affect valve function by their local effects, and nonbacterial thrombotic, or marantic endocarditis may occur and is more common with left-sided valves. Valve lesions may vary in size from microscopic to large bulky lesions leading to impaired valve coaptation and regurgitation that is occasionally severe; significant valve stenosis is infrequent, and thromboembolism from these lesions is most consequential. Valve disease may occur because of concomitant or previous radiation therapy, and cardiac imaging evaluation of patients undergoing radiotherapy should be performed according to the recent joint ASE and European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging recommendations. Chemotherapy may lead to pancytopenia and result in bacteremia and sepsis with increased risk for endocarditis, which is more likely in those with predisposing valve lesions or with indwelling central venous catheters. Valve disease may occur as a consequence of CTRCD, usually as mitral regurgitation caused by annular dilation or apical tethering in the setting of LV dysfunction and secondary LV remodeling, and secondary tricuspid regurgitation may also occur because of RV dysfunction or pulmonary arterial hypertension.

### Culture-negative bivalvular endocarditis with myocardial destruction in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus: a case report [^c99702d6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

This case raises the possibility of an alternate understanding of marantic or Libman-Sacks endocarditis. Our patient had no evidence of active infection prior to admission, and a subsequent workup including extended culture duration, serologies, histopathological examination, and PCR did not reveal a microbial etiology despite the degree of purulent destruction.

Infective endocarditis (IE) associated with three or more negative blood cultures (culture-negative endocarditis) constitutes 5% of all endocarditis cases. The reasons for culture negativity are related to technical limitations of culture (e.g. not using specialized media, antibiotic administration prior to obtaining blood cultures) or to the specific organism (e.g. fungi, fastidious bacteria), though HACEK group bacteria - formerly considered a common cause of culture-negative endocarditis - are usually isolated within 5 days with current blood culture systems.

Difficult-to-cultivate microorganisms including T. whipplei, Bartonella spp. C. burnetti, Legionella spp. and Mycobacterium spp. have been identified with serologic testing and PCR amplification. In a study of almost 2,000 patients with clinically suspected endocarditis, 21% had definite endocarditis and 13% had possible endocarditis by Duke criteria while the remainder were rejected. In the definite endocarditis group, an etiology was established in over 90% by blood and valve tissue culture, serological testing, and PCR of valve tissue. Culture negative endocarditis is less well documented by the Duke criteria than culture positive endocarditis. The reason for this difference lies, in part, with the use of positive blood cultures as a key component of the Duke criteria. Histopathology of valve tissue can also be useful in differentiating myxoma, rheumatic endocarditis, and marantic endocarditis from IE.

### Characteristics of infective endocarditis in a cancer population [^2f6a9eec]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Thirty per cent of the patients in our study had blood culture–negative endocarditis. Our group previously reported a 42% frequency of culture-negative endocarditis in a retrospective series of patients with cancer. This culture-negative rate may be due to a variety of factors including early administration of antibiotics, non-infectious aetiologies of the vegetations, and lack of use of PCR techniques to identify organisms. This yield may be increased by using reverse transcription-PCR in addition to culture, valvular biopsies, serological analysis and evaluation for non-infectious causes, including autoimmune and thrombotic. Some of these patients may have had non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis, which can be found in patients ith cancer; previous studies have shown that this form of endocarditis can be associated with an embolic phenomenon in solid-tumour cancers such as lung, pancreatic and gastric cancer. Although culture negative patients in our study were classified as definitive IE by the modified Duke's Criteria, its diagnostic specificity is estimated to only be 74% based on the results of a recent cohort study. This is further complicated by the fact that no single laboratory, imaging, nor clinical criteria can definitively diagnose marantic endocarditis. Therefore, distinguishing true culture negative IE from marantic endocarditis is challenging and often requires a high degree of clinical suspicion, with definitive distinction often made during autopsy. The use of fluoro-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT and radiolabeled WCC scintigraphy has been explored to identify underlying infectious valvular foci, although the diagnostic utility of these imaging techniques appears to be greatest with suspected prosthetic valve and cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) endocarditis.

### Outcomes of culture-negative vs. culture-positive infective endocarditis: the ESC-EORP EURO-ENDO registry [^7c1bca6d]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main results stemming from the present analysis of the EURO-ENDO registry data are the following: (i) about 1/5 patients with IE had CNIE; (ii) clinical characteristics at admission for IE were different between CNIE and CPIE patients; (iii) 30-day mortality was higher in CNIE than CPIE patients; (iv) among patients with theoretical indications for surgery, patients with CNIE were less frequently operated upon than those with CPIE; (v) no difference in 1-year survival was observed between CNIE and CPIE in the subgroup of surgically treated patients, but a lower survival for CNIE was observed in patients receiving medical treatment alone (Structured Graphical Abstract).

Culture-negative infective endocarditis: prevalence and diagnosis

Among patients with IE enrolled in the EURO-ENDO registry, 16.8% had CNIE. This is among the lowest registered frequencies of CNIE when compared with other series (where frequency ranges from 9 to 42%), possibly testifying to improved approaches to the aetiological diagnosis of IE over the years (especially in ESC-affiliated countries which enrolled the majority of patients in the registry), although the reasons may be more complex and multifactorial. Indeed, it should be remembered that CNIE is a heterogeneous condition including different types of diseases, some rare (i.e. marantic endocarditis, endocarditis related to systemic diseases, such as lupus and Behçet, IE due to fastidious microorganisms such as HACEK or nutritionally variant streptococci, IE due to intracellular bacteria not routinely cultured in blood samples), and others likely far more frequent (i.e. IE with no aetiological diagnosis because of reduced sensitivity of blood cultures collected after initiation of antimicrobial therapy). The latter may be in line with the slightly higher number of antibiotics received prior to admission by CNIE than CPIE patients in the present study that may have affected the diagnostic yield of cultures.

It could be of interest to explore in future studies whether heterogeneous antibiotic practices or other reasons may had been responsible for the higher prevalence of CNIE, we registered in non-ESC-affiliated than in ESC-affiliated countries.

### Yield of transesophageal echocardiography for nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis and other cardiac sources of embolism in cancer patients with cerebral ischemia [^8e01a694]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Cerebrovascular events occur frequently in patients who succumb to cancer, and nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is a frequent postmortem finding in these patients. Despite the excellent diagnostic accuracy of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for cardiac sources of cerebral embolism, however, the prevalence of NBTE and other cardioembolic sources in patients with cancer and cerebral ischemia has not been investigated using this modality. This study examined the frequency of cardioembolic findings in consecutive patients with cancer referred to our institution for TEE evaluation of cerebrovascular events. The study cohort comprised 51 patients, of whom 18% had marantic vegetations, and 47% and 55% of whom had definite and definite or probable cardiac sources of embolism, respectively. The present study documents, for the first time, a high frequency of marantic endocarditis and other cardioembolic sources in patients with cancer and cerebrovascular events selected for TEE. This finding has important implications for evaluation and management in this patient population.

### Guidelines for diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis in adults… [^d8d715cb]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Observational data suggest time-to-positivity of blood cultures of less than 12 hours is associated with Staphylococcus aureus IE and independently predicts hospital mortality. 11 A similar study found that a shorter TTP was associated with IE in monomicrobial Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia. 12 TTP is likely influenced by the blood culture machine and/or bottles being used and by preexposure to antibiotics.
13. In general, a combination of vancomycin or daptomycin and a β-lactam like ceftriaxone requires a careful consideration of the risks and benefits and an acknowledgment of the limitations of the evidence. 53 Most WikiGuidelines authors suggest against routine use of adjunctive aminoglycosides because of a lack of evidence of benefit with a demonstrable risk of harm. Options for definitive intravenous therapy by organism are presented in Table 2, with nuanced discussions in eAppendix 3 in Supplement 1. 54–60.

Therefore, after factoring in considerations presented in eAppendix 3 in Supplement 1, transition to oral therapy from initial intravenous therapy is a reasonable option for treating patients with IE.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^b73ebdc6]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Infective endocarditis is a potentially lethal disease that has undergone major changes in both host and pathogen. The epidemiology of infective endocarditis has become more complex with today's myriad healthcare-associated factors that predispose to infection. Moreover, changes in pathogen prevalence, in particular a more common staphylococcal origin, have affected outcomes, which have not improved despite medical and surgical advances.

Methods and Results

This statement updates the 2005 iteration, both of which were developed by the American Heart Association under the auspices of the Committee on Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis, and Kawasaki Disease, Council on Cardiovascular Disease of the Young. It includes an evidence-based system for diagnostic and treatment recommendations used by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association for treatment recommendations.

Conclusions

Infective endocarditis is a complex disease, and patients with this disease generally require management by a team of physicians and allied health providers with a variety of areas of expertise. The recommendations provided in this document are intended to assist in the management of this uncommon but potentially deadly infection. The clinical variability and complexity in infective endocarditis, however, dictate that these recommendations be used to support and not supplant decisions in individual patient management.

### Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis in a patient with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma: diagnostic challenges and management insights [^e7a5a6cd]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is characterised by sterile vegetations on heart valves and often emerges in hypercoagulable states like malignancy. It is frequently underdiagnosed and only comes to light during postmortem examination. Early diagnosis and treatment with anticoagulation can help lower mortality. We present a case of a woman in her 60s with marantic endocarditis, secondary to ovarian malignancy. She presented with a 4week history of headache, confusion and abdominal discomfort. Examination revealed cyanosis, splinter haemorrhages and abdominal tenderness. Echocardiogram showed impaired left ventricular function and suspicion of a small vegetation at the tip of the anterior mitral valve. Further investigation revealed multiple cerebellar infarcts, pulmonary embolism, splenic infarct, ascites and a pelvic mass. A biopsy of the pelvic mass and analysis of ascitic fluid was consistent with high-grade serous carcinoma of tubo-ovarian origin. Following discussion at the gynaecology multidisciplinary team meeting, she was scheduled for chemotherapy treatment.

### Marantic endocarditis (NBTE) with systemic emboli and paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration: uncommon presentation of ovarian cancer [^dc9d351a]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

We report a case in which the only presenting symptoms of the underlying ovarian malignancy were that of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration and nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis. If suspecting paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration and nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, complete physical examination, including pelvic exams in female patients is warranted. Investigations should include CT chest/abdominal/pelvis, MRI brain, and Transesophageal Echocardiogram. Early recognition will lead to early diagnosis of occult malignancy and initiation of appropriate therapy. Awareness of these complications as initial presentation for internists, gynecologists and neurologists may avoid diagnostic delay.

### Clinical indications, image acquisition and data interpretation for white blood cells and anti-granulocyte monoclonal antibody scintigraphy: an EANM procedural guideline [^daa7ad07]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular system infections

Echocardiography is readily available and accurately diagnoses bacterial endocarditis. Nevertheless, the use of radiolabelled WBC scintigraphy accurately detects infective endocarditis and extra-cardiac septic embolisms. Prosthetic vascular graft infections are also first studied by angio-CT, and labeled WBC imaging is a useful complement. The accuracy of WBC imaging for diagnosing prosthetic vascular graft infection is above 90%, and the use of [18 F]FDG is also a highly accurate alternative. No role of WBC scan has been suggested for imaging vasculitis.

Clinical indications for nuclear medicine evaluation:
Infective endocarditis (IE)
Suspected IE with doubtful ultrasound
Evaluation of septic embolism in certain IE
Evaluation of treatment response
Differential diagnosis with marantic vegetations
Vascular graft infections
Diagnosis of infection
Evaluation of extent of disease
Evaluation of disease activity
Evaluation of treatment response

Pulmonary infections

Although pulmonary uptake of labeled WBC is a normal event during the first few hours after injection, its appearance after 24 h is abnormal.

Diffuse pulmonary activity on images obtained more than 4 h after injection of labeled WBC can be due to opportunistic infections, radiation pneumonitis, pulmonary drug toxicity and adult respiratory distress syndrome. A diffuse pulmonary uptake pattern is also seen in septic patients with normal chest radiographs who have no clinical evidence of respiratory tract inflammation or infection. It is important to note that while diffuse pulmonary activity on labeled WBC images is associated with numerous conditions, it has been only very rarely described in bacterial pneumonia. Focal pulmonary uptake that is segmental or lobar is usually associated with bacterial pneumonia. This pattern can be also seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and is due to WBC accumulation in pooled secretions in bronchiectasic regions. Non-segmental focal pulmonary uptake is caused by technical artifacts caused by faulty labelling or reinjection and is usually not associated with infection and disappears within 4 h post injection.

Clinical indications for nuclear medicine evaluation:
Diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia
Differential diagnosis of infective and neoplastic lesions
Evaluation of treatment response

Central nervous system infections

The differential diagnosis of a contrast enhancing brain lesion identified on CT or MRI includes abscess, tumor, cerebrovascular accident, and even multiple sclerosis. WBC scintigraphy provides valuable information in the differential diagnosis of contrast enhancing brain lesions and in the follow-up of patients with malignant otitis. False negative results have been reported in patients receiving high doses of steroids. The use of anti-G-mAb can also be useful in these situations.

Clinical indications for nuclear medicine evaluation:
Cerebral hypodensity CT lesions with hypervascularized peripheral ring
Differential diagnosis of cerebral lesions in HIV patients

### Blood culture-negative endocarditis: a Scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^afa96461]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Causes of

From a clinical standpoint, there are 2 scenarios where BCNE occurs:
Recent antibiotic administration before obtaining blood cultures. The most common pathogens in patients given empiric therapy are generally those that are seen in the bulk of IE cases and include methicillin‐susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci.
Pathogens that do not grow in routine blood cultures from patients without prior antibiotic exposure, which includes an array of bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi.

Clinical presentation of BCNE may be different, depending on the scenario. For the minority of cases that are not related to recent antibiotic exposure as a cause of culture negativity, subacute or chronic presentation is likely. For prior antibiotic exposure cases, it would depend on the organism as to whether the presentation is acute or subacute. When the clinical presentation is not strongly suggestive of infection, it is essential to consider other noninfectious causes such as NBTE and rheumatological conditions in the differential diagnosis of BCNE. Of note, activated partial thromboplastin time prolongation is a simple and useful laboratory marker of NBTE associated with antiphospholipid syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Although noninfectious in origin, patients with NBTE can have a clinical presentation that satisfies the 2023 Duke‐ISCVID criteria without positive blood cultures and is in the differential diagnosis of BCNE.

Patients with NBTE usually present with symptomatic embolic events with no fever or systemic signs of infection. Because euthermic endocarditis due to infection is seen in a minority of patients with IE, particularly older patients, an evaluation for infective versus noninfective endocarditis is required. Two case series that have included contemporary patients with NBTE provide a clinical profile. Women predominated in both series, with a mean age of 54 and 60 years, respectively. Malignancy and connective tissue diseases were most often associated with NBTE, with stroke as the most common (54.2% and 59.5%, respectively) presentation due to hypercoagulability. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was superior to transthoracic echocardiography in identifying valvular abnormalities, most commonly vegetations. A recent multicenter case series that focused on marantic endocarditis associated with cancer demonstrated the importance of multimodality imaging (CT and 18 F‐FDG PET/CT) in both cancer and NBTE diagnoses. A systematic review and meta‐analysis that covered almost 6 decades supported the findings of the above‐cited case series that overall survival in NBTE cases associated with cancer was poor but improved in recent years.

### Acute infective endocarditis [^207d8a5b]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Acute infective endocarditis is a complex disease with changing epidemiology and a rapidly evolving knowledge base. To consistently achieve optimal outcomes in the management of infective endocarditis, the clinical team must have an understanding of the epidemiology, microbiology, and natural history of infective endocarditis, as well as a grasp of guiding principles of diagnosis and medical and surgical management. The focus of this review is acute infective endocarditis, though many studies of diagnosis and treatment do not differentiate between acute and subacute disease, and indeed many principles of diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis for acute and subacute disease are identical.

### Coagulopathy, marantic endocarditis, and cerebrovascular accidents as paraneoplastic features in medullary thyroid cancer – case report and review of the literature [^06bc2c84]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

Medullary thyroid cancers account for approximately 7% of primary thyroid malignancies and are often associated with paraneoplastic syndromes. We discuss the case of a 59-year-old man who presented with a hypercoagulable state, nonbacterial endocarditis, and recurrent strokes in the setting of widespread medullary thyroid cancer. The patient was anticoagulated and underwent thyroidectomy, modified radical neck dissection, and subsequent axillary lymphadenectomy. Despite no recurrent thromboembolic events, the patient ultimately succumbed to his disease 8 months after diagnosis and 6 months after initial thyroidectomy. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of this unique presentation in a patient with thyroid cancer. The literature pertaining to the diagnosis and management of hypercoagulability states in patients with cancer, in general, and thyroid cancer, in particular, is reviewed.

### Predictors of survival in patients with ischemic stroke and active cancer: a prospective, multicenter, observational study [^29934b6b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Cryptogenic stroke has been reported as an independent predictor of mortality in patients with ischemic stroke and active cancer. Other studies have shown plasma D‐dimer levels to be also associated with poor prognosis. Plasma D‐dimer levels are reportedly high in patients with cryptogenic stroke and active cancer; hence, these findings may reflect underlying coagulation abnormalities. The present study examined the prognostic impact of cryptogenic stroke and plasma D‐dimer levels using the multivariable model. Cryptogenic stroke was associated with poor prognosis in univariable analysis but was not significant in multivariable analysis. As mentioned earlier, plasma D‐dimer levels were higher in patients with cryptogenic stroke than in those with known causes; therefore, the result that cryptogenic stroke was associated with death may be the effect of coagulation abnormalities. Interestingly, among patients with distant metastasis or cryptogenic stroke, those with high plasma D‐dimer levels had poorer prognosis than those without. This finding supports the notion that the degree of cancer‐associated coagulation abnormalities is related to prognosis. In clinical practice, it would be helpful to use plasma D‐dimer levels, in addition to distant metastasis and cryptogenic stoke, to predict the prognosis.

For stroke subtypes, this study classified cryptogenic strokes as patients whose cause could not be confidently identified or had no apparent cause other than malignancy. However, the causative classification for patients with cancer‐associated hypercoagulability is debatable. This is attributable to the diversity of cancer‐associated stroke phenotypes. For example, if marantic endocarditis, also known as nonbacterial endocarditis, is detected by echocardiography in the population with cancer, it would be classified as cardioembolism. If blood tests confirm disseminated intravascular coagulation, it will be categorized as another determined cause. There are also cases of tumors or air embolisms. Meanwhile, even if these causes were not found by screening, they may have gone undetected. If blood tests are incomplete, disseminated intravascular coagulation may not be diagnosed. Therefore, consensus about the causative classification for patients with cancer‐associated hypercoagulability will be needed.

### Culture-negative bivalvular endocarditis with myocardial destruction in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus: a case report [^c105278f]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

There are a few limitations of our patient's initial workup that may have masked a causative agent. Legionella testing was not performed until months after surgery and she received treatment with ciprofloxacin and doxycycline prior to testing. In addition, culture and PCR testing for nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS) such as Abiotrophia species was not performed and the patient received a brief course of vancomycin during her hospital course.

While the etiology of culture negative endocarditis differs regionally, the incidence of fastidious zoonotic agents is higher in developing countries. Our region has a relatively low incidence of zoonotic agents and standard culture techniques are generally adequate to detect the etiology of endocarditis. While marantic endocarditis lacks inflammatory cells and normally involves a single valve, purulence was noted on gross inspection and histopathology.

We present a patient with extremely destructive culture negative endocarditis that remains without a definitive etiologic agent despite sophisticated and advanced technological efforts. Despite limited anti-microbial therapy, the patient has shown no evidence of relapse further strengthening the case for a non-microbial cause. To date there are no reports of such devastation attributed to marantic or Libman-Sacks endocarditis, but we raise the possibility that this could be the case.

### Diagnostic yield of echocardiography in cancer patients with ischemic stroke [^48ed0722]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

The yield of echocardiography in cancer patients with acute ischemic stroke is unknown. We identified adult patients with active systemic cancer diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke at a tertiary-care cancer center from 2005 through 2009 who underwent transthoracic (TTE) or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Two neurologists independently reviewed all clinical data, including TTE and TEE reports, and adjudicated whether echocardiographic studies revealed a definite or possible source of stroke according to pre-defined criteria. Patients were classified as having suspected cardioembolic strokes if imaging showed embolic-appearing infarcts in more than one vascular territory. Among 220 patients with cancer and ischemic stroke who underwent echocardiography, 216 (98%) had TTE and 37 (17%) had TEE. TTE revealed a definite source in 15 (7%, 95% CI 4–10%) patients and a possible source in 42 (19%, 95% CI 14–25%), while TEE revealed a definite source in 10 (27%, 95% CI 12–42%) patients and a possible source in 14 (38%, 95% CI 21–54%). In 92 patients with suspected cardioembolic strokes who underwent TTE, 6 (7%, 95% CI 1–12%) had a definite source, including 4 with marantic endocarditis, and 20 (22%, 95% CI 13–30%) had a possible source. Twenty-one of these patients also underwent TEE, which demonstrated a definite or possible source in 16 (76%, 95% CI 56–96%) patients, including marantic endocarditis in 4 (19%). The yield of TTE for detecting marantic endocarditis and other cardiac sources of stroke in cancer patients is low, but TEE may provide a higher yield in targeted patients.

Arterial thromboembolism

Arterial thromboembolic events are relatively uncommon in patients with pancreatic cancer, with an estimated incidence of 2–5%. However, a recent retrospective matched cohort of American cancer registries linked to Medicare identified 12,279 patients with pancreatic cancer and demonstrated a 6-month cumulative incidence of arterial thromboembolism of 5.9% (95% CI 5.5–6.4) compared to 2.4% (95% CI 2.1–2.7) in individuals matched by demographics and comorbidities, but without active cancer. Myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events were most common. The 6-month cumulative incidences of myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke were 2.6% (95% CI 2.3–2.8) and 3.8% (95% CI 3.5–4.8), respectively, in patients with pancreatic cancer, compared with 0.7% (95% CI 0.6–0.9) and 1.8% (95% CI 1.6–2.1) in control patients. As far as stroke is concerned, an observational retrospective multicentre study considered 17 patients admitted with stroke and pancreatic cancer and observed that, in 93% of cases, the cancer was metastatic. Moreover, brain imaging revealed disseminated infarction in 64% of cases, and echocardiography showed non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis in 25% of cases. Other reported clinical presentations of arterial thromboembolism have included mesenteric and iliofemoral artery thrombosis, upper extremity ischaemia and marantic endocarditis.– Simultaneous arterial and venous thromboembolism has also been described, but in the previously mentioned retrospective study of 1,915 patients, the incidence was only 0.1% (comprising 5.2% of all thrombotic complications).

### Recurrent embolic strokes due to antiphospholipid syndrome and non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis in a patient with basal cell carcinoma [^a4fcfe60]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-Bacterial Thrombotic Endocarditis (NBTE), also known as marantic endocarditis, outside of autoimmune disease and malignancies, is a rare disease with a prevalence of 0.9–1.6% that was described by Ziegler in 1888 as thromboendocarditis. NBTE encompasses thrombotic, inflammatory, and inflammatory with superimposed thrombotic vegetations. It is a cardiac manifestation of an underlying inflammatory process that induces endothelial lesions of the valve and endocardium. The mitral valve is the most frequently affected, followed by the aortic valve. Histologically, the lesions consist of an accumulation of immune complexes, fibrin, platelet thrombi, and mononuclear cells. The typical presentation of NBTE is valve thickening or sterile vegetation ranging from small nodules to a large warty or necrotic mass. This disease is mostly asymptomatic. Clinical manifestations mainly result from systemic arterial embolism such as stroke or transient ischemic attack. Valve dysfunction is uncommon and is usually secondary to the size and location of the endocardiac mass without significant destruction. NBTE may be associated with a hypercoagulable state or autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), rheumatoid arthritis, or malignancies. It is well known that in patients with APS, valvular manifestations are very common as well as their strict association with cerebral manifestations. We report a rare fatal case of a voluminous aortic NBTE in a patient who developed multiple embolic strokes caused by antiphospholipids antibodies (aPL). This occurred in a 78-year-old man using Apixaban for a history of atrial fibrillation. He presented with moderate aortic insufficiency, acute heart failure and was successfully treated by biological aortic valve replacement surgery.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a rare coagulative disorder with antiphospholipid antibody mediated pro-thrombotic state mainly characterised by hypercoagulable complications. Cardiac manifestations of APS include arterial or venous thromboses, valve diseases, coronary artery disease, intracardiac thrombus, pulmonary hypertension and dilated cardiomyopathy, with the functional impairment of heart valves being the most common manifestation, which commonly associated with Libman-Sacks endocarditis. Libman-Sacks endocarditis, also known as non-bacterial thrombotic, verrucous, or marantic endocarditis, originally described in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, is a well-known complication of APS. We present a successful aortic valve replacement in a 48 years old lady with aortic valve Libman-sacks endocarditis and APS who presented with acute pulmonary oedema.

Infective endocarditis (IE) — recommendation-specific supportive text highlights that empirical therapy may be necessary in high-risk presentations and that historical mortality without antibiotics was high; drug use–associated endocarditis has markedly increased and behavioral therapy alone has poor outcomes, whereas adding pharmacotherapy improves relapse rates; and clinically evident systemic emboli are common in IE. Specifically, although no RCTs have been performed regarding antibiotic therapy in IE, the mortality rate before the antibiotic age neared 100%. For drug use–associated endocarditis, its incidence has risen 12-fold over the past decade, and behavioral interventions alone for opioid use disorders are associated with > 80% returning to drug use, while adding agonist pharmacotherapy had a 50% reduction in relapse compared with behavioral therapy alone. Up to 35% of all patients with IE develop clinically evident systemic emboli.

### Echocardiographic findings in patients with temporal arteritis: apropos of one case of temporal arteritis-associated verrucous (libman-Sachs) endocarditis [^5bbb5667]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 70-year-old patient who presented with fever of unknown origin. The initial diagnosis was infective endocarditis as a mitral valve vegetation was found in a transesophageal echocardiogram. Lack of response to empiric antibiotic treatment and further diagnostic work-up established the correct diagnosis of marantic endocarditis due to temporal arteritis. Treatment with steroids and aspirin led to rapid clinical improvement and disappearance of the vegetation. Apropos of this case, we reviewed the records of 25 patients with a new diagnosis of temporal arteritis and analyzed the echocardiographic findings in comparison to those of 40 age- and sex-matched controls. Abnormal echocardiographic findings were present in 13 (52%) out of 25 patients with temporal arteritis and in 5 (12.5%) out of 40 controls (p < 0.001, chi-square test).

Pathogenesis of infective endocarditis — Infective endocarditis (IE) is the net result of interaction between the bloodstream pathogen, matrix molecules, and platelets at sites of endocardial damage, and the following sequence is thought to result in IE: formation of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE), bacteremia, adherence of bacteria in the bloodstream to NBTE, and proliferation within a vegetation. Turbulent blood flow from congenital or acquired heart disease traumatizes endothelium, creating a predisposition for deposition of platelets and fibrin that results in NBTE. Mucosal surfaces populated by dense endogenous microflora can release many different microbial species transiently into the bloodstream after trauma to sites such as the gingival crevice, oropharynx, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, urethra, or vagina; transient bacteremia caused by viridans group streptococci and other oral microflora occurs commonly with dental extractions, other dental procedures, or routine daily activities, and the microbial species entering the circulation depends on the endogenous microflora at the traumatized site. Modes of bacterial adherence serve as virulence factors in the pathogenesis of IE, with bacterial surface components in streptococci, staphylococci, and enterococci functioning as critical adhesins; some viridans group streptococci contain a fimbrial adhesion protein (FimA), a lipoprotein receptor antigen I that serves as a major adhesin to the fibrin platelet matrix of NBTE. Staphylococcal adhesins function in at least two ways: microbial surface components facilitate attachment to human extracellular matrix proteins and to medical devices that become coated with matrix proteins after implantation, and bacterial extracellular structures contribute to the formation of biofilm on the surface of implanted medical devices. Both FimA and staphylococcal adhesins are immunogenic in experimental infections, and vaccines prepared against them provide some protective effect in experimental endocarditis. Within vegetations, buried microorganisms can multiply to reach maximal microbial densities of 10^8 to 10^11 colony-forming units (CFUs) per gram of vegetation on the left side of the heart.

Q fever — clinical features of acute and chronic illness emphasize symptom timing, asymptomatic infection frequency, and endocarditis findings. Acute Q fever typically is characterized by a nonspecific febrile illness, hepatitis, or pneumonia, and asymptomatic infections have been reported in up to 60% of cases; onset of symptoms usually occurs within 2–3 weeks of exposure and symptomatic patients might be ill for weeks or months if untreated. Chronic Q fever can manifest within a few months or several years after acute infection and can follow symptomatic or asymptomatic infections; chronic disease is rare (< 5% of patients with acute infection) and is typically characterized by endocarditis in patients with preexisting risk factors such as valvular or vascular defects. Unlike acute Q fever, which has a low mortality rate (< 2%), chronic Q fever endocarditis is always fatal if untreated; routine blood cultures are negative, and vegetative lesions are visualized by echocardiography in approximately 12% of patients.

Conclusions

There is clear consensus that MDTs should drive the care of patients with IE, despite a paucity of high-quality evidence to guide these recommendations (with most studies at serious or critical risk of bias). The infrequent nature of IE means that clinical decision making should be guided by clinicians who gain and share their experience of the care of these patients. More evidence is needed to guide the development of optimal models of care delivery, clinical training, patient information and follow-up.

Infective endocarditis — etiology, prognosis, and epidemiology: Infective endocarditis may be subacute or acute; the subacute form is "most often related to infections with streptococcal species and less commonly with Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and fastidious Haemophilus sp", typically developing on abnormal valves after asymptomatic bacteremias. Acute endocarditis is more often related to S. aureus, group A hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci, or gonococci and "can develop on normal valves". "Untreated endocarditis is almost always fatal". Prosthetic valve endocarditis forms a substantial proportion of cases; although incidence "has not changed over the past 3 decades", the age at presentation has increased. Right‑sided disease is often related to intravenous drug abuse, and aortic/mitral valve endocarditis "has been associated with rapid death" due to acute valvular disruption, coronary emboli, or ring/septal abscesses.

Infective endocarditis (IE) embolization burden and timing are characterized as follows: Up to 65% of embolic events involve the CNS and > 90% of CNS emboli lodge in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery; emboli can occur before diagnosis, during therapy, or after therapy is completed, although most emboli occur within the first 2 to 4 weeks of antimicrobial therapy. The rate of embolic events decreases during and after the first 2 to 3 weeks of successful antibiotic therapy, with one study reporting the embolic rate dropped from 13 to < 1.2 embolic events per 1000 patient-days during that time. After initiation of antibiotics, only 3.1% of a cohort suffered stroke after the first week of antimicrobial therapy.

Infective endocarditis — intervention considerations (continued) include that in patients with recurrent endocarditis and continued intravenous drug use, consultation with addiction medicine is recommended to discuss the long-term prognosis for the patient's refraining from actions that risk reinfection before repeat surgical intervention is considered. In patients with IE who present with recurrent emboli and persistent vegetations despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, early surgery (during initial hospitalization and before completion of a full therapeutic course of antibiotics) is reasonable. In patients with native left-sided valve endocarditis who exhibit mobile vegetations > 10 mm in length (with or without clinical evidence of embolic phenomenon), early surgery (during initial hospitalization and before completion of a full therapeutic course of antibiotics) may be considered. In patients with IE and an indication for surgery who have suffered a stroke but have no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or extensive neurological damage, operation without delay may be considered. For patients with IE and major ischemic stroke with extensive neurological damage or intracranial hemorrhage, if the patient is hemodynamically stable, delaying valve surgery for at least 4 weeks may be considered.

### Streptococcus bovis endocarditis and colon cancer: myth or reality? A case report and literature review [^80af4757]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A relationship between infective endocarditis and colon cancer was established in 1950, and Streptococcus bovis was successfully isolated in 1970. However, this association and its pathogenesis still remain unclear. In this paper, we describe the clinical case of a patient with a history of colon cancer and infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus bovis. The role of S bovis as an aetiological agent in the development of colon cancer is intriguing but uncertain. S bovis infection should be considered a silent sign of gastrointestinal malignancy or hepatic disease. We believe that in order to demonstrate the presence of colon cancer, all patients with S bovis infection require an endoscopic investigation of the colon.

Infective endocarditis — foundational diagnostic steps and echocardiography use: In patients with the recent onset of left-sided valve regurgitation, at least 2 sets of blood culture samples should be obtained, and in suspected infective endocarditis, the Modified Duke Criteria should be used for diagnosis. Patients with infective endocarditis should be evaluated and managed with consultation with a multispecialty Heart Valve Team. In suspected infective endocarditis, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is recommended to define vegetations and hemodynamics, and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is recommended when TTE is nondiagnostic, when complications are present or suspected, or when intracardiac device leads are present. In patients undergoing valve surgery for infective endocarditis, intraoperative TEE is recommended, and for those considered for an early change to oral antibiotic therapy for stable disease, a baseline TEE before switching and a repeat TEE 1 to 3 days before completion of the oral antibiotic regimen should be performed.

Impact of dental disease, oral hygiene and procedure type — bacteremia considerations: It is stated that a relationship exists between oral hygiene/disease, procedure type, and bacteremia but that the relationship is controversial; nevertheless, available evidence supports an emphasis on maintaining good oral hygiene and eradicating dental disease to decrease bacteremia from routine activities, and in poor oral hygiene the frequency of positive blood cultures just before extraction may be similar to after extraction. Tooth extraction is thought to be the procedure most likely to cause bacteremia, with an incidence ranging from 10 to 100 percent, yet numerous other dental procedures have reported risks similar to extraction, and a precise determination of relative risks across specific procedures in patients with or without dental disease probably is not possible. Additionally, bleeding often occurs during dental procedures in patients with or without periodontal disease.

In patients with IE who present with valve dysfunction resulting in symptoms of heart failure (HF), early surgery (during initial hospitalization and before completion of a full therapeutic course of antibiotics) is indicated. In patients with left-sided IE caused by S. aureus, a fungal organism, or other highly resistant organisms, early surgery (during initial hospitalization and before completion of a full therapeutic course of antibiotics) is indicated. In patients with IE complicated by heart block, annular or aortic abscess, or destructive penetrating lesions, early surgery (during initial hospitalization and before completion of a full therapeutic course of antibiotics) is indicated. In patients with IE and evidence of persistent infection as manifested by persistent bacteremia or fevers lasting > 5 days after onset of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, early surgery (during initial hospitalization and before completion of a full therapeutic course of antibiotics) for IE is indicated. In all patients with definite endocarditis and an implanted cardiac electronic device, complete removal of the pacemaker or defibrillator systems, including all leads and the generator, is indicated.

### Culture-negative bivalvular endocarditis with myocardial destruction in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus: a case report [^ba115d71]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Broad-range PCR analysis targets commonly shared bacterial 16S rRNA genes (18S rRNA for fungi) through the use of primers. Bosshard et al compared broad-range PCR to standard microbiological techniques (Gram staining and culture) on endocardial specimens from 49 patients with good overall agreement, but 18% of patients with negative blood cultures were positive with broad range PCR. PCR provided a higher diagnostic yield and was much less affected by prior administration of antibiotics. Houpikan and Raoult performed etiologic testing on sera, blood, and valve tissue from 348 patients with infective endocarditis in France using culture in shell vial, indirect immunofluorescent antibodies, histopathology, and PCR amplication. Five patients had rare bacteria (including T. whipplei, M. hominis, Abiotrophia elegans, and Legionella pneumophila). C. burnetii is more common in France than in the United States and represented a majority (48%) of the IE diagnoses in this cohort.

A more recent study by Fournier and Raoult consisted of specimens obtained from over 750 blood culture negative endocarditis patients. Specimens underwent testing incorporating serological, molecular, and histopathological analysis including culture and PCR of cardiac valve tissue. While the majority received antibiotics prior to cultures; serologic analysis using immunofluorescence assay provided a diagnosis in almost half the patients (mostly C. burnetii followed by Bartonella species) and PCR of valvular biopsies diagnosed over 60% including 109 patients for whom serological results were negative. PCR had a higher yield from valve tissue than from blood specimens with high sensitivity for Bartonella species, C. burnetti, and T. whipplei. Among 115 patients without a documented infection, 2.5% had non-infective endocarditis including marantic endocarditis, collagen vascular diseases, angiosarcoma, and atrial myxoma. Noted limitations of PCR include contamination of tissue with amplification of background sequences leading to false positive results. In our case, a falsely negative PCR result might have been accounted for by unavailable PCR primers for a specific organism or by processing errors resulting in sample degradation.

### How would you treat tricuspid valve infective endocarditis in a patient who uses injection drugs? Grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^7365a338]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a common and morbid condition involving prolonged hospital stays, significant disability, and a high mortality rate. The current crises of injection drug use and opioid use disorder have contributed to high rates of infective endocarditis in the United States. Endocarditis in patients who inject drugs involves additional management complexity for multiple reasons. Several infective endocarditis management guidelines exist, including from the American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology. In light of the unique challenges of caring for this particular population, in 2022 the American Heart Association published a scientific statement specifically focusing on infective endocarditis in people who inject drugs. In these rounds, 2 experts in their respective fields, an infectious diseases specialist and a cardiac surgeon, discuss medical management, interventional approaches, and the value of multidisciplinary care for tricuspid valve endocarditis in a person who uses injection drugs, both in general and in relation to Mr. Y, a 30-year-old man with a history of substance use disorder, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, and right-sided endocarditis.

4 PATHOGENESIS

Decades of research have provided valuable information concerning the underlying pathogenesis of IE, although the mechanisms by which pathogens cause IE have not been fully elucidated. Currently, the development of IE and its complications is widely accepted as the result of complex interactions between microorganisms, valve endothelium, and host immune responses.

4.1 Vegetation and bacteremia

Frequently, IE is initiated by an endothelial injury that results in exposure of the subendothelial extracellular matrix that activates platelets and causes the formation of a fibrin‐platelet clot. 5 The sterile cardiac lesion consists primarily of platelets and fibrin and is called non‐bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). The pathogenesis of NBTE involves injured or inflamed endothelium, combined with a hypercoagulable state. 6 Because the vegetations in NBTE are friable, systemic EE occurs more frequently in NBTE than in IE. Trousseau's syndrome has been reported as being associated with endocarditis, and NBTE can be the first presentation that leads to the diagnosis of Trousseau's syndrome.

Subsequently, microorganisms in the blood adhere to the fibrin‐platelet clot to initiate vegetation formation. Pathogenesis also includes critical components of innate immunity and pattern‐recognition receptors on the surfaces of epithelial cells, leukocytes, and platelets that recognize the bacteria. 5 These factors result in an invasive infection resulting in the subsequent release of various cytokines. 5 The activated epithelial cells transform their original anticoagulant state into a pro‐coagulant state. Tissue factors (TF) are released by activated epithelial cells and white blood cells. Meanwhile, dead cells and bacterial cell wall complexes are associated with the activation of factor XII. These factors facilitate activation of the extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways, respectively.

4.2 Activation of coagulation and the complement and innate immune system

Coagulation has been proposed to be "at the heart" of IE. 5 The coagulation system activates the complement system in several different ways. 7 Thrombin, the cleavage product that forms as a result of the coagulation cascade, plays a fundamental role in hemostasis and bridges clotting and inflammation. The strong association between the coagulation and the innate immune system, which is referred to as immunothrombosis, 5 is maintained in a delicate balance in healthy people. When this balance is disrupted, a range of diseases, especially IE, can occur.

### Recurrent embolic strokes due to antiphospholipid syndrome and non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis in a patient with basal cell carcinoma [^47f2235a]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-Bacterial Thrombotic Endocarditis (NBTE) is a common form of aseptic thrombotic endocarditis that primarily affects mitral valves and less frequently aortic valves. NBTE is caused by systemic inflammatory reactions. This condition induces valve thickening or attached sterile mobile vegetation. NBTE is mostly asymptomatic; however, major clinical manifestations result from systemic emboli rather than valve dysfunction. When significant damage occurs, valvular insufficiency or stenosis can appear and promote heart failure occasionally requiring valve replacement surgery. NBTE is associated with hypercoagulable states, systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), antiphospholipid syndrome, or malignancies.

Case Presentation

We report successful biological aortic valve replacement surgery including cardiopulmonary bypass for a 78-year-old man with NBTE and voluminous vegetation on the aortic valve inducing moderate aortic insufficiency and acute heart failure. The histopathological analysis of the valve sample showed myxoid degeneration, fibrous remodeling, and partial necrosis without any bacteria, thus indicating marantic endocarditis. Initially, the patient presented to the emergency department with an acute stroke. He was already using Apixaban treatment for a history of atrial fibrillation and cardioembolic stroke. Because of the recurrence of stroke and appearance of aortic vegetation, the investigations were extended. The antiphospholipid antibodies were positive without any indication of bacterial endocarditis. The malignancy screening was positive for basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The surgery and postoperative course were uneventful, and the patient was discharged with vitamin K antagonists (VKA). To our knowledge, NBTE with such a volume is rare and its apparent association with BCC has not been previously reported.

Conclusion

Outside of SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome, NBTE is a rare and underdiagnosed disease associated with thromboembolic events. Adequate anticoagulation is a cornerstone of its treatment. Anticoagulation management during perioperative care and valve surgery deserves specific attention and helps to protect the patient from embolic complications. In the case of stroke and thromboembolic events of unclear cause or suspected NBTE, echocardiography and thrombophilia assessments including an immunological workup are recommended.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^7fad956c]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Recommendations for intervention for infective endocarditis (IE) — Embolic events and neurological considerations: In patients with IE who present with recurrent emboli and persistent vegetations despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, early surgery (during initial hospitalization and before completion of a full therapeutic course of antibiotics) is reasonable. In patients with native left-sided valve endocarditis who exhibit mobile vegetations > 10 mm in length (with or without clinical evidence of embolic phenomenon), early surgery (during initial hospitalization and before completion of a full therapeutic course of antibiotics) may be considered. In patients with IE and an indication for surgery who have suffered a stroke but have no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or extensive neurological damage, operation without delay may be considered. For patients with IE and major ischemic stroke with extensive neurological damage or intracranial hemorrhage, if the patient is hemodynamically stable, delaying valve surgery for at least 4 weeks may be considered.

Infective endocarditis (IE) — diagnosis recommendations emphasize that in at‑risk patients with unexplained fever, blood culture samples should be obtained, and in recent onset left‑sided valve regurgitation, at least 2 sets of blood culture samples should be obtained. In patients with suspected IE, the Modified Duke Criteria should be used for diagnosis, and patients with IE should be evaluated and managed with consultation with a multispecialty Heart Valve Team. For imaging, in patients with suspected IE, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is recommended to identify vegetations, characterize the hemodynamic severity of valvular lesions, assess ventricular function and pulmonary pressures, and detect complications. If TTE is nondiagnostic, complications have developed or are clinically suspected, or intracardiac device leads are present, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is recommended; TTE and/or TEE are recommended for reevaluation when there is a change in clinical signs or symptoms or high risk of complications. In patients undergoing valve surgery for IE, intraoperative TEE is recommended. For stable IE patients considered for an early change to oral antibiotic therapy, a baseline TEE before switching to oral therapy and a repeat TEE 1 to 3 days before completion of the oral antibiotic regimen should be performed. Additional advanced imaging recommendations include that CT imaging is reasonable when anatomy cannot be clearly delineated by echocardiography in suspected paravalvular infections, and in nosocomial Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia with a known extracardiac source, TEE might be considered to detect concomitant staphylococcal IE.

### Infectious endocarditis: diagnosis and treatment [^7c203bb3]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Infectious endocarditis results from bacterial or fungal infection of the endocardial surface of the heart and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Risk factors include the presence of a prosthetic heart valve, structural or congenital heart disease, intravenous drug use, and a recent history of invasive procedures. Endocarditis should be suspected in patients with unexplained fevers, night sweats, or signs of systemic illness. Diagnosis is made using the Duke criteria, which include clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic findings. Antibiotic treatment of infectious endocarditis depends on whether the involved valve is native or prosthetic, as well as the causative microorganism and its antibiotic susceptibilities. Common blood culture isolates include Staphylococcus aureus, viridans Streptococcus, enterococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Valvular structural and functional integrity may be adversely affected in infectious endocarditis, and surgical consultation is warranted in patients with aggressive or persistent infections, emboli, and valvular compromise or rupture. After completion of antibiotic therapy, patients should be educated about the importance of daily dental hygiene, regular visits to the dentist, and the need for antibiotic prophylaxis before certain procedures.

### Guidelines for the use of echocardiography in the evaluation of a cardiac source of embolism [^5f5b3f39]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) echocardiography — basic principles include being acquainted with patient's clinical history and pretest probability for IE (low, intermediate, high) and interpreting/reporting findings accordingly. Review previous echocardiograms to determine IE predisposing factors and confirm newly discovered periprosthetic leaks or native valve regurgitation. Echocardiography has diagnostic and prognostic value in IE and also has postdiagnostic interval monitoring value in clinical decision making. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) exhibits low sensitivity but high specificity for IE diagnosis, whereas transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) exhibits both high sensitivity and specificity; TEE identifies anatomic detail of vegetations, may determine embolic risk, and identifies perivalvular complications. TTE and TEE modalities are complementary.
