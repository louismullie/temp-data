## Question

Can rivaroxaban be used to prevent varicocele?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether rivaroxaban can be used to prevent varicocele. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about rivaroxaban's pharmacology and labeled indications. Then, I should review the pathophysiology of varicocele and whether it is a thrombotic versus structural venous disorder. Next, I will check guideline-recommended management options for varicocele to see if anticoagulation appears anywhere. After that, I need to search for any indirect or exceptional situations linking anticoagulation to varicocele care. Finally, I will weigh mechanistic plausibility and risk–benefit to reach a conclusion and confirm there's no off-label niche I am missing.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and indications of rivaroxaban. Rivaroxaban is a direct, selective factor Xa inhibitor that reduces thrombin generation and has predictable, dose-dependent effects on clotting assays; its approved uses are entirely in thrombotic conditions such as treatment and secondary prevention of DVT/PE, stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, postoperative VTE prophylaxis in orthopedics, and vascular risk reduction in CAD/PAD, with food-dependent bioavailability considerations at higher doses [^111ssemb] [^117BXDu1] [^114VbSrf].

> Now, I need to review the pathophysiology of varicocele. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: varicocele is not a thrombus disease; it is venous dilatation of the pampiniform plexus driven by valvular incompetence and reflux of warm abdominal blood into the scrotum, which over time can impair testicular function; this is a structural venous disorder rather than a coagulation cascade problem, so I should confirm that anticoagulation would not address valve failure or reflux physiology [^113YCMz3].

> Next, I should review standard-of-care management for varicocele to see if anticoagulants are recommended. Let me check guidelines and practice standards: management is conservative observation, percutaneous embolization, or surgical varicocelectomy based on indications such as pain, infertility with abnormal semen parameters, testicular asymmetry or dysfunction, and selected adolescent scenarios; none of these recommendations include using anticoagulation to treat or prevent varicocele, which strongly suggests no role for rivaroxaban in prevention of varicocele formation or progression [^113LAdTq] [^116GTVzX] [^111S2maH] [^113YCMz3].

> Wait, let me verify whether there are any indirect links where anticoagulation appears in varicocele contexts. I will now examine complications and rare scenarios: post-embolization sclerosant migration causing a left renal vein thrombus has been treated with a finite course of anticoagulation, but that anticoagulation is for the thrombotic complication and not for varicocele per se; similarly, "thrombosed varicocele" is a rare event within an existing varicocele and is not the primary pathophysiology; moreover, perioperative urologic guidance recommends against routine pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis for typical ambulatory urologic procedures, reinforcing that anticoagulation is not standard in this domain [^117Ch4ri] [^112SNt2M] [^112iseyF].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility. I should double-check: FXa inhibition cannot repair or normalize venous valve integrity, reverse venous dilatation, or prevent reflux; thus, there is no biological rationale for rivaroxaban to prevent the development of a varicocele, and introducing an anticoagulant would expose patients to bleeding risk without addressing the structural venous lesion, especially since guidelines confine rivaroxaban's role to thromboembolic disease contexts rather than venous valvular incompetence [^111ssemb] [^113iFX4a].

> But wait, what about special populations or off-label mentions. I need to check if pediatric or reproductive guidelines or the label hint at any preventive anticoagulant role for varicocele. The pediatric EAU/ESPU and adult EAU/AUA-ASRM guidance outline surgical or embolic interventions in selected patients, and the Xarelto labeling and compendia list no varicocele indication, making an off-label prevention strategy unsupported by evidence or consensus recommendations [^111S2maH] [^113LAdTq] [^116GTVzX] [^117BXDu1].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought of "variceal" prevention strategies involving beta-blockers and endoscopic ligation; hold on, I should verify that I am not conflating esophagogastric varices in cirrhosis with scrotal varicocele, because those are entirely different entities with distinct management pathways, and nothing from the variceal hemorrhage literature translates to varicocele prevention.

> Final check and conclusion: there is a fundamental mismatch between the structural venous valve failure that causes varicocele and the anticoagulant mechanism of rivaroxaban; guidelines and interventional standards do not include anticoagulation for varicocele prevention or treatment, and the only anticoagulant use is to manage rare thrombotic complications or unrelated VTE indications, so rivaroxaban should not be used to prevent varicocele [^113YCMz3] [^113LAdTq] [^116GTVzX] [^111ssemb].

Rivaroxaban is **not indicated or effective** for preventing varicocele because varicoceles result from venous valve incompetence and reflux, not thrombosis [^113YCMz3]. There is **no clinical evidence** or guideline support for anticoagulation to prevent varicocele formation or progression [^113LAdTq] [^116GTVzX], and using rivaroxaban would expose patients to unnecessary bleeding risk without benefit. Management should focus on observation, surgical ligation, or embolization when indicated [^113YCMz3].

---

## Pathophysiology of varicocele

Varicoceles are caused by **venous valve incompetence** in the pampiniform plexus, leading to reflux, venous dilation, and increased scrotal temperature that can impair testicular function and fertility [^113YCMz3]. The key mechanism is **valvular incompetence**, not thrombosis; therefore, anticoagulation does not address the underlying problem [^112RKZ2M].

---

## Mechanism of action of rivaroxaban

Rivaroxaban is a **direct factor Xa inhibitor** [^111ssemb] that reduces thrombin generation and fibrin clot formation, and is approved for VTE treatment/prevention, stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, and other thrombotic indications [^117BXDu1]. It does not affect venous valve function or reflux and therefore cannot prevent varicocele formation or progression [^113YCMz3].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding rivaroxaban and varicocele

There is **no clinical evidence** that rivaroxaban prevents varicocele formation or progression; no studies or trials have evaluated anticoagulation for this purpose [^113LAdTq], and no guidelines recommend it [^116GTVzX].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from the AUA, ASRM, and EAU do not recommend anticoagulation for varicocele prevention or treatment [^113LAdTq] [^116GTVzX]. Management is based on observation, surgical ligation, or embolization when indicated, with **no role for anticoagulation** [^112RKZ2M].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of rivaroxaban

Rivaroxaban carries a **significant bleeding risk**, including major and intracranial hemorrhage, and is contraindicated in patients with active bleeding, severe renal impairment, or hepatic disease. Using it without a clear indication therefore exposes patients to unnecessary harm [^117CffWw].

---

## Alternative and established treatments for varicocele

Established treatments include:

- **Observation**: For asymptomatic or mild cases [^116GTVzX].
- **Surgical ligation**: Microsurgical subinguinal or inguinal approaches [^113LAdTq].
- **Percutaneous embolization**: Minimally invasive occlusion of refluxing veins [^112RKZ2M].

These options are supported by evidence and guidelines, and there is **no role for anticoagulation** [^113LAdTq] [^116GTVzX].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Rivaroxaban is **not indicated or effective** for preventing varicocele because the condition is due to venous valve incompetence, not thrombosis [^113YCMz3]. There is **no evidence or guideline support** for anticoagulation in varicocele, and its use would expose patients to unnecessary bleeding risk. Management should rely on observation, surgical ligation, or embolization when appropriate [^112RKZ2M].

### A fifteen-year retrospective analysis of varicocele embolization: Evaluating success, recurrence rates and embolic agents [^113YCMz3]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). High credibility.

A varicocele is a venous dilatation due to valvular incompetence within the pampiniform plexus. Varicoceles are observed in 10–20% of the population and predominantly affect the left side. They are the most commonly identifiable abnormality in men evaluated for infertility, although there are myriad other causes. Testicular varicoceles are found in 40% of men with primary infertility and 80% of those with secondary infertility. Additionally, 2–10% of men with varicoceles report scrotal pain or discomfort.

Although the pathophysiology of varicoceles is not fully understood, it likely involves incompetent valves in the spermatic veins. This leads to the reflux of warm abdominal blood into the scrotum, causing an increase in scrotal temperature. Evidence suggests that varicoceles have a progressive, deleterious effect on testicular size, function, and fertility over time.

Varicocele diagnosis is clinical. Based on clinical findings, varicoceles are arbitrarily graded into three categories: large varicoceles are visible, medium varicoceles are palpable, and small varicoceles are only palpable during a Valsalva maneuver. Subclinical varicoceles can be visualized on ultrasound. However, there is no consensus on the optimal criteria for ultrasound diagnosis, and various classifications exist, so preference depends on the individual clinician.

Treatment options for testicular varicoceles include conservative management, percutaneous embolization, or surgical varicocelectomy. Percutaneous embolization has been utilized as a varicocele treatment since the late 1970s.

### Xarelto [^111ssemb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Xarelto is a selective inhibitor of FXa. It does not require a cofactor, such as Anti-thrombin III, for its activity. Rivaroxaban inhibits free FXa and prothrombinase activity. Although rivaroxaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation, it indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting FXa, rivaroxaban decreases thrombin generation.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Rivaroxaban produces dose-dependent inhibition of FXa activity. Clotting tests, such as prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and HepTest®, are also prolonged dose-dependently. In children treated with rivaroxaban, the correlation between anti-factor Xa and plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope close to 1. Monitoring for the anticoagulation effect of rivaroxaban using anti-FXa activity or a clotting test is not recommended.

- **Specific populations**:
	- **Renal impairment**: The relationship between systemic exposure and pharmacodynamic activity of rivaroxaban is altered in adult subjects with renal impairment compared to healthy control subjects.

	- **Hepatic impairment**: Anti-Factor Xa activity was similar in adult subjects with normal hepatic function and those with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A class). There is no clear understanding of the impact of hepatic impairment beyond this degree on the coagulation cascade and its relationship to efficacy and safety.

### Xarelto [^113d9wML]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) and reduction in the risk of recurrence of DVT and/or PE, the EINSTEIN trials excluded patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) values less than 30 mL/min at screening. However, the administration of Xarelto is expected to result in serum concentrations of rivaroxaban similar to those in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to < 50 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients with CrCl 15 to < 30 mL/min should be observed closely, and any signs or symptoms of blood loss should be promptly evaluated. Xarelto should be avoided in patients with CrCl < 15 mL/min.

- **Prophylaxis of DVT following hip or knee replacement surgery**: The combined analysis of the RECORD 1–3 clinical efficacy studies did not indicate an increase in bleeding risk for patients with CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min. However, there was a possible increase in total venous thromboemboli in this population. Similar to the EINSTEIN trials, patients with CrCl < 30 mL/min at screening were excluded, but the administration of Xarelto 10 mg once daily is expected to achieve serum concentrations of rivaroxaban similar to those seen in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to < 50 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Close observation and prompt evaluation of any signs or symptoms of blood loss are recommended for patients with CrCl 15 to < 30 mL/min, and Xarelto should be avoided in those with CrCl < 15 mL/min.

### Xarelto [^114VbSrf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The absolute bioavailability of rivaroxaban is dose-dependent. For the 2.5 mg and 10 mg doses, it is estimated to be 80% to 100% and is not affected by food. Xarelto 2.5 mg and 10 mg tablets can be taken with or without food. Xarelto 20 mg, when administered in a fasted state, has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 66%. Coadministration of Xarelto with food increases the bioavailability of the 20 mg dose, with mean AUC and Cmax increasing by 39% and 76%, respectively, when taken with food. Xarelto 15 mg and 20 mg tablets should be taken with food [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

The maximum concentrations (Cmax) of rivaroxaban appear 2 to 4 hours after tablet intake. The pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban were not affected by drugs altering gastric pH. Coadministration of Xarelto (30 mg single dose) with the H2-receptor antagonist ranitidine (150 mg twice daily), the antacid aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide (10 mL), or Xarelto (20 mg single dose) with the PPI omeprazole (40 mg once daily) did not show an effect on the bioavailability and exposure of rivaroxaban.

Absorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of drug release in the GI tract. A 29% and 56% decrease in AUC and Cmax compared to tablet form was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is released in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when the drug is released in the distal small intestine or ascending colon. Avoid administration of rivaroxaban distal to the stomach, as this can result in reduced absorption and related drug exposure.

### A fifteen-year retrospective analysis of varicocele embolization: Evaluating success, recurrence rates and embolic agents [^115QQQmX]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). High credibility.

In cases of varicocele embolization failure, several underlying mechanisms may be implicated, including incomplete venous occlusion, collateral vessel recruitment, or missed alternative venous drainage pathways. A repeat embolization procedure should be considered in technically feasible cases, particularly where persistent reflux is demonstrated. CT venography can aid in identifying residual or alternative venous channels not visualized during the initial intervention. Technical challenges typically arise in cases of varicoceles with venous collaterals that bypass competent valves in the cranial segment of the internal spermatic vein or in the presence of right-sided varicoceles. Late failure is thought to be due to the opening of persistent small venous collaterals into the internal spermatic vein. A structured approach incorporating imaging and tailored re-intervention may enhance long-term clinical outcomes in these cases.

Our findings demonstrate no significant association between the type of embolic agent used and technical success, clinical success, recurrence rates, need for re-intervention, or fertility outcomes. These results suggest that adding a sclerosing agent to coil embolization does not confer a measurable clinical advantage. Although no recurrences were observed in the small group treated with the Hourglass™ occlusion device, the limited sample size precludes definitive conclusions. These observations support using coil embolization alone as a sufficient and effective treatment modality. This is interesting economically, as the addition of sclerosant was not advantageous.

### Clinical and safety outcomes associated with treatment of acute venous thromboembolism: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116E68m5]. JAMA (2014). Low credibility.

Many anticoagulant strategies are available for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism, yet little guidance exists regarding which drug is most effective and safe.

- **Objective**: To summarize and compare the efficacy and safety outcomes associated with eight anticoagulation options: unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), or fondaparinux in combination with vitamin K antagonists; LMWH with dabigatran or edoxaban; rivaroxaban; apixaban; and LMWH alone for the treatment of venous thromboembolism.

- **Data sources**: A systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and evidence-based medicine reviews from inception through February 28, 2014.

- **Study selection**: Eligible studies were randomized trials reporting rates of recurrent venous thromboembolism and major bleeding in patients with acute venous thromboembolism. Of the 1,197 studies identified, 45 trials including 44,989 patients were included in the analyses.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Two reviewers independently extracted trial-level data, including the number of patients, duration of follow-up, and outcomes. The data were pooled using network meta-analysis.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary clinical and safety outcomes were recurrent venous thromboembolism and major bleeding, respectively.

- **Results**: Compared with the LMWH-vitamin K antagonist combination, a treatment strategy using the UFH-vitamin K antagonist combination was associated with an increased risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (hazard ratio [HR], 1.42; 95% credible interval [CrI], 1.15–1.79).

### The perils of inhibiting deficient factors [^1143KkPm]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation in patients with factor X deficiency is an area lacking substantial evidence. A patient with this deficiency was initially anticoagulated with warfarin and later switched to rivaroxaban. Warfarin may be a safer anticoagulant option than rivaroxaban for those with hereditary factor X deficiency. It is recommended that a baseline coagulation screen is performed prior to the commencement of anticoagulation.

We report a case of a previously undiagnosed factor X deficiency in an 83-year-old man who had no prior bleeding history despite multiple hemostatic challenges. He was anticoagulated with warfarin for atrial fibrillation without complications; however, a major hemorrhage occurred soon after switching to rivaroxaban.

### Antithrombotic management of venous thromboembolism: JACC focus seminar [^116TC3iW]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant public health burden, and management of anticoagulation is the mainstay of treatment for the vast majority of patients. The introduction of four direct oral anticoagulants beginning in 2010 has significantly affected the selection of anticoagulants for patients with VTE. Treatment of VTE consists of three phases: the initial treatment (first 5 to 21 days), primary treatment (first 3 to 6 months), and secondary prevention (after the initial 3 to 6 months). Oral-only anticoagulation strategies are now available, using apixaban or rivaroxaban therapy, beginning in the initial treatment phase. In addition, low-dose anticoagulation with either apixaban or rivaroxaban can be used in the secondary prevention phase for appropriate patients. The use of direct oral anticoagulants is now supported for many patients with cancer-associated VTE. Appropriate selection and monitoring of anticoagulants remain a critical element of high-quality care for patients with VTE.

Figure 1 and Table 2 present the risk differences, number needed to treat (NNT), and number needed to harm (NNH) of the five pairs of benefit–risk outcomes. The benefits exceeded the harms in each pair evaluated. In Pair 1, there were 32.5 (95% CI, −68.1 to 3.0) fewer symptomatic VTE and VTE‐related deaths compared to 8.2 (95% CI, −12.2 to 28.5) additional major bleeding events per 10,000 patients treated with rivaroxaban. Pair 2 shows 20.3 (95% CI, −13.0 to 53.6) nonfatal PE and VTE‐related deaths prevented compared to 0 (95% CI, −9.8 to 9.8) critical site and fatal bleeds.

- **Pairs 3 and 5**: The greatest differences were seen in the composite of fatal and irreversible‐harm thrombotic events prevented compared to the composite of critical site and fatal bleeding. In Pair 3, there were 38.6 (95% CI, −85.3 to 8.1) fewer fatal and irreversible nonfatal thrombotic events, with no excess fatal or critical site bleeding. Pair 5 shows a benefit of 63.0 (95% CI, −113.5 to −12.5) fewer fatal and irreversible nonfatal thrombotic events with no excess critical site and fatal bleeding.

- **Pair 4**: This pair shows little difference in thromboembolic fatal events versus fatal bleeding.

### How I treat with anticoagulants in 2012: New and old anticoagulants, and when and how to switch [^113dj6Mv]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Two novel oral anticoagulants, dabigatran and rivaroxaban, have recently been approved. They differ in many ways from warfarin, including rapid onset of action, shorter half-life, fewer drug-drug interactions, lack of need for monitoring, and no need for titration or dose adjustments. These novel agents represent a landmark shift in anticoagulant care; however, many aspects of their use will be unfamiliar to practicing clinicians, despite the imminent widespread use of these agents in the community. The management of these anticoagulants when transitioning from or back to warfarin, around surgery or in case of major hemorrhage, requires knowledge of their pharmacokinetics and mechanism of action. Unfortunately, there is a limited evidence base to inform decisions around management of these agents. We present our practice in these settings, supported where available, with literature evidence.

### Editor's choice - efficacy and safety of the new oral anticoagulants dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban in the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism: A systematic review and meta-analysis of phase III trials [^116TNLL4]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2014). High credibility.

The aim was to perform a review of the efficacy and safety of new oral anticoagulants (NOAs) in the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

This was a systematic review and meta-analysis. On March 26, 2014, Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane trial register were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the NOAs dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in VTE treatment and secondary prevention. Two investigators assessed the methodological quality of the RCTs. The main study outcomes — efficacy, safety, and net clinical benefit — were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Ten RCTs, mostly with a low risk of bias, involving nearly 38,000 patients, were identified. In six trials of treatment, NOAs were equally effective as VKAs in preventing re-occurrence of symptomatic VTE (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75–1.05). However, major bleeding occurred less often (1.08% vs. 1.73% for VKAs, RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51–0.77), leading net clinical benefit to favor NOAs (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70–0.90). Fatal bleeding occurred less often with NOAs (0.09% vs. 0.18% for VKAs), a difference that approached statistical significance (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26–1.01).

In three secondary prevention trials, NOAs reduced VTE recurrence rates to 1.32% (vs. 7.24% with placebo, RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.12–0.24) and fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) (including unexplained deaths) to 0.1% (vs. 0.29% for placebo, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.10–1.38) at the expense of clinically relevant non-major bleeding (4.3% vs. 1.8% for placebo, RR 2.32, 95% CI 1.65–3.19).

### Rivaroxaban treatment for six weeks versus three months in patients with symptomatic isolated distal deep vein thrombosis: Randomised controlled trial [^114u6izr]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

- **Objective**: To compare two different treatment durations of rivaroxaban in patients with symptomatic isolated distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

- **Design**: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

- **Setting**: 28 outpatient clinics specialising in venous thromboembolism.

- **Participants**: 402 adults (≥ 18 years) with symptomatic isolated distal DVT.

- **Interventions**: After receiving a standard dose of rivaroxaban for six weeks, participants were randomly assigned to receive either rivaroxaban 20 mg or a placebo once daily for an additional six weeks. Follow-up lasted 24 months from study inclusion.

- **Main outcomes measures**: The primary efficacy outcome was recurrent venous thromboembolism during follow-up after randomisation, defined as the composite of progression of isolated distal DVT, recurrent isolated distal DVT, proximal DVT, symptomatic pulmonary embolism, or fatal pulmonary embolism. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding after randomisation until two days from the last dose of rivaroxaban or placebo. An independent committee adjudicated the outcomes.

- **Results**: 200 adults were randomised to receive additional rivaroxaban treatment, and 202 to receive placebo. Isolated distal DVT was unprovoked in 81 (40%) and 86 (43%) patients, respectively. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 23 (11%) patients in the rivaroxaban arm and 39 (19%) in the placebo arm (relative risk 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.95; P = 0.03, number needed to treat 13, 95% confidence interval 7 to 126). Recurrent isolated distal DVT occurred in 16 (8%) patients in the rivaroxaban arm.

### Introduction: Varicoceles: a contemporary perspective [^112M4CyJ]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

In this Views and Reviews section, four groups of authors address the timely and highly relevant issue of varicoceles across the male life spectrum. Varicoceles are very prevalent among men presenting for an infertility workup. While a reduction in bulk semen parameters (including sperm concentration, motility, and morphology) has long been recognized as a deficit caused by varicoceles, in recent years, a number of investigators have shown that varicoceles can have broader, multi-faceted effects on male reproductive health. Sperm DNA integrity and other aspects of sperm function appear to be impacted by the presence of varicoceles, and varicocele correction can result in significant improvement in not only semen parameters but also fertilization and pregnancy rates.

### Surgery or embolisation for varicocele in subfertile men [^116x9ckb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

A varicocele is a meshwork of distended blood vessels in the scrotum, usually left-sided, due to dilatation of the spermatic vein. Although the concept that varicocele causes, and varicocelectomy cures, male subfertility has been around for almost fifty years, the mechanisms by which varicocele would affect fertility have not yet been satisfactorily explained, and neither have the mechanisms by which varicocelectomy would restore fertility. Furthermore, it has been questioned whether a causal relation exists at all between the distension of the pampiniform plexus and impairment of fertility.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effect of varicocele treatment on the pregnancy rate in subfertile couples.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register (searched 12 Sept 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2004), EMBASE (January 1985 to May 2004), and reference lists of articles. In addition, we hand-searched 22 specialist journals in the field from their first issue until 2004. We also checked cross-references, references from review articles, and contacted researchers in the field.

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs were included if they were relevant to the clinical question posed, if they reported pregnancy rates as an outcome measure, and if they reported data in treated (surgical ligation or radiological embolization of the internal spermatic vein) and untreated groups.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria.

### Favorable therapeutic index of the direct factor Xa inhibitors, apixaban and rivaroxaban, compared with the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran in rabbits [^111tFL9i]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). High credibility.

Apixaban is an oral, direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor in late-stage clinical development. This study assessed the effects of the direct FXa inhibitors, apixaban and rivaroxaban, versus the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, on venous thrombosis (VT), bleeding time (BT), and clotting times in rabbits.

- **Methods**: We induced the formation of a non-occlusive thrombus in VT models by placing threads in the vena cava and induced bleeding by the incision of cuticles in anesthetized rabbits. Apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran were infused intravenously to achieve a stable plasma level. Clotting times, including activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), modified PT (mPT), and thrombin time (TT), were measured.

- **Results**: Apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran exhibited dose-related efficacy in preventing VT with an EC(50) of 65, 33, and 194 nm, respectively. At doses for 80% reduction of control thrombus, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran prolonged BT by 1.13 ± 0.02, 1.9 ± 0.1, and 4.4 ± 0.4-fold, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). In the clotting assays, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran were ≥ 50-fold more potent in prolonging TT than aPTT and PT. Of the clotting assays studied, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran responded the best to mPT.

- **Conclusion**: Comparable antithrombotic efficacy was observed between apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran in the prevention and treatment of VT in rabbits.

### Surgery or embolisation for varicocele in subfertile men [^113xk4wW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

A varicocele is an almost exclusively left-sided varicosity of the pampiniform plexus of the spermatic cord, forming a tangle of distended blood vessels in the scrotum. Although the concept that varicocele causes male subfertility, and that varicocelectomy cures it, has been around for almost fifty years, the mechanisms by which varicocele would affect fertility have not yet been satisfactorily explained. Neither have the mechanisms by which varicocelectomy would resolve subfertility been sufficiently elucidated. Furthermore, it has been questioned whether a causal relation exists at all between the distension of the pampiniform plexus and impairment of fertility.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effect of varicocele treatment on pregnancy rate in subfertile couples.

- **Search strategy**: Relevant trials were identified in the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's specialised register of controlled trials. A MEDLINE search, using the group's search strategy, was performed for the period 1966–2000. Additionally, hand searching was conducted of 22 specialist journals in the field from their first issue until 2000. Cross-references and references from review articles were checked.

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs were included if they were relevant to the clinical question posed, if they reported pregnancy rates as an outcome measure, and if they reported data in treated (surgical ligation or radiological embolization of the internal spermatic vein) and untreated groups.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Six studies met the inclusion criteria for this review.

### Rivaroxaban treatment for six weeks versus three months in patients with symptomatic isolated distal deep vein thrombosis: randomised controlled trial [^117AmJsG]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

To compare two different treatment durations of rivaroxaban in patients with symptomatic isolated distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted. This study was set in 28 outpatient clinics specializing in venous thromboembolism.

The trial included 402 adults (≥ 18 years) who had symptomatic isolated distal DVT. Initially, all participants received a standard dose of rivaroxaban for six weeks. They were then randomly assigned to either continue with rivaroxaban 20 mg or switch to a placebo once daily for an additional six weeks. Follow-up was conducted over a 24-month period from the commencement of the study.

- **Main outcomes measures**: The primary efficacy outcome was the incidence of venous thromboembolism during the follow-up period following randomisation. This was defined as a composite of progression of isolated distal DVT, recurrent isolated distal DVT, proximal DVT, symptomatic pulmonary embolism, or fatal pulmonary embolism. The primary safety outcome concerned major bleeding incidents occurring after randomisation until two days following the last dose of rivaroxaban or placebo. An independent committee adjudicated the outcomes.

Results showed that 200 adults were assigned to continue rivaroxaban, while 202 received the placebo. Among these participants, isolated distal DVT was unprovoked in 81 (40%) and 86 (43%) patients, respectively. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 23 (11%) patients in the rivaroxaban group and 39 (19%) in the placebo group (relative risk 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.95; P = 0.03, number needed to treat 13, 95% confidence interval 7 to 126). The occurrence of recurrent isolated distal DVT in the rivaroxaban group was not fully reported in this excerpt.

### Xarelto [^1119Y6ds]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

There are no adequate or well-controlled studies of Xarelto in pregnant women, and dosing for pregnant women has not been established. Post-marketing experience is currently insufficient to determine a rivaroxaban-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. In an in vitro placenta perfusion model, unbound rivaroxaban was rapidly transferred across the human placenta.

- **Animal data**: Rivaroxaban crosses the placenta in animals. It increased fetal toxicity, evident by increased resorptions, decreased number of live fetuses, and decreased fetal body weight when pregnant rabbits were given oral doses of ≥ 10 mg/kg rivaroxaban during the period of organogenesis. This dose corresponds to about four times the human exposure of unbound drug, based on AUC comparisons at the highest recommended human dose of 20 mg/day. Fetal body weights decreased when pregnant rats were given oral doses of 120 mg/kg during the period of organogenesis. This dose corresponds to about 14 times the human exposure of unbound drug. In rats, peripartal maternal bleeding and maternal and fetal death occurred at the rivaroxaban dose of 40 mg/kg (about six times maximum human exposure of the unbound drug at the human dose of 20 mg/day).

### Lactation

**Risk summary**: Rivaroxaban has been detected in human milk. There are insufficient data to determine the effects of rivaroxaban on the breastfed child or on milk production. Rivaroxaban and/or its metabolites were present in the milk of rats. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's needs.

### Oral rivaroxaban for symptomatic venous thromboembolism [^117CffWw]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). High credibility.

Rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, may provide a simple, fixed-dose regimen for treating acute deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and for continued treatment, without the need for laboratory monitoring.

- **Methods**: We conducted an open-label, randomized, event-driven, noninferiority study comparing oral rivaroxaban alone (15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks, followed by 20 mg once daily) with subcutaneous enoxaparin followed by a vitamin K antagonist (either warfarin or acenocoumarol) for 3, 6, or 12 months in patients with acute, symptomatic DVT. In parallel, we carried out a double-blind, randomized, event-driven superiority study that compared rivaroxaban alone (20 mg once daily) with placebo for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had completed 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous thromboembolism. The primary efficacy outcome for both studies was recurrent venous thromboembolism. The principal safety outcome was major bleeding or clinically relevant non-major bleeding in the initial-treatment study and major bleeding in the continued-treatment study.

- **Results**: The study of rivaroxaban for acute DVT included 3,449 patients: 1,731 given rivaroxaban and 1,718 given enoxaparin plus a vitamin K antagonist. Rivaroxaban had noninferior efficacy with respect to the primary outcome (36 events [2.1%], vs. 51 events with enoxaparin-vitamin K antagonist [3.0%]; hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 1.04; P < 0.001). The principal safety outcome occurred in 8.1% of the patients in each group. In the continued-treatment study, which included 602 patients.

### Reconsidering the role of routine anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism prevention in plastic surgery [^114C2qtd]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Fondaparinux is a particularly questionable choice because it requires injection, unlike rivaroxaban and apixaban, and does not have an antidote. The lack of a reversal agent is an important difference from other anticoagulants such as heparin, enoxaparin, warfarin, and (recently) rivaroxaban and apixaban that do have antidotes (protamine sulfate, vitamin K, as well as andexanet alfa, respectively). Similar to other anticoagulants, this medication is not approved by the FDA for VTE prophylaxis in plastic surgery patients. Fondaparinux is approved for VTE prophylaxis only in orthopedic and general surgery patients judged to be at high risk of VTE. The use of anticoagulants in plastic surgery to prevent VTEs is therefore off-label. Unlike other factor Xa inhibitors such as enoxaparin, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, fondaparinux is not indicated for the treatment of acute deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism unless accompanied by warfarin.

Plastic surgeons need to be aware of the specific indications and regulatory status of these anticoagulants and the potential for liability in patients who develop bleeding. Plaintiff attorneys are actively soliciting patients who have experienced bleeding complications. A Google search is sobering.

### Aspirin plus rivaroxaban versus rivaroxaban alone for the prevention of venous stent thrombosis among patients with post-thrombotic syndrome: The multicenter, multinational, randomized, open-label ARIVA trial [^1112cZFf]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Safety outcomes included the incidence of adverse events, encompassing bleeding events and cause-specific death. Major, clinically relevant non-major, and minor bleeding events were defined according to the criteria set by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.

- **Study arms**: Eligible patients were randomly assigned, after successful stent placement, to receive either 100 mg of aspirin once daily plus 20 mg of rivaroxaban once daily or 20 mg of rivaroxaban once daily as a stand-alone treatment in a 1:1 ratio. Screening and inclusion in the study were performed by trained study personnel. During an initial treatment adjustment period of up to 2 weeks after intervention and randomization, therapeutic-dosed enoxaparin (1 mg/kg SC twice daily) could be administered instead of rivaroxaban at the investigator's discretion.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the additional benefit of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis for endovenous varicose vein interventions [^117YEgp9]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

- **Safety endpoints**: Major and minor bleeding were defined as per the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis guidelines. Of the 12 trial arms that reported on bleeding after pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, there was one instance of major bleeding associated with the coadministration of LMWH and ibuprofen. Other trials that considered minor bleeding rates noted a range from 0% to 10%. There was no significant difference in bleeding events between three days of Fondaparinux versus Rivaroxaban, nor between Rivaroxaban 10 mg OD for five days versus ten days. Of the 11 trial arms that included VTE-related mortality as an outcome, there was one VTE-related death that occurred in the mechanical thromboprophylaxis alone group following a PE from an iliofemoral DVT.

- **Risk of bias**: Studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomised Studies of Interventions tool for nonrandomized studies of interventions and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized trials. Randomized trials were generally at high or unclear risk of bias, primarily because of the lack of registered protocols, high rates of attrition, and potential for performance biases due to lack of blinding. For nonrandomized studies, there was a critical risk of selection bias through confounding by indication, as well as significant attrition bias and high potential for reporting bias.

- **Quality assessment**: In the randomized trial arms, the quality of evidence for the rates of DVT and PE were judged as moderate in light of the risk of bias.

### Oral anticoagulants in the management of venous thromboembolism [^111AMGWg]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Despite advances in diagnosis, prevention, and management, venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a common cause of morbidity and mortality. For decades, antithrombotic therapy for the prevention and treatment of VTE was limited to parenteral agents related to heparin and oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Both classes of anticoagulants are effective but have limitations, including considerable variability in dose-response, narrow therapeutic margins between the risks of thrombosis and bleeding, and the need to monitor anticoagulation intensity.

In the past decade, the introduction of new oral anticoagulants that specifically inhibit coagulation factors IIa (thrombin) or Xa has changed practice in various clinical situations, including VTE prophylaxis and treatment. This review outlines the use of the novel oral anticoagulants apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban in the prevention and treatment of VTE. Additionally, it discusses practical considerations for selecting the appropriate drug for each patient.

Although the introduction of novel anticoagulant drugs is promising, selecting the optimum strategy for an individual patient requires an understanding of the specific circumstances associated with thrombus formation and the pharmacological properties of each agent.

### Migration of sclerosant material to the left renal vein following coil embolisation of a varicocele [^117Ch4ri]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Percutaneous testicular varicocele embolisation for symptomatic and subfertile males is often preferred over surgical ligation of the gonadal vein due to its minimally invasive approach and reduced complication rate. Glues, coils, vascular plugs, balloons, and sclerosants are used in various combinations to achieve sufficient venous occlusion. Here, we report on the first known case of sclerosant material migration beyond the placement of an embolisation coil for the treatment of a varicocele, resulting in a left renal vein thrombus.

A man in his 20s presented to the emergency department two days following uncomplicated left varicocele embolisation with acute left-sided abdominal pain, found to have sclerosant material causing an ipsilateral non-occlusive left renal vein thrombus with extension towards his inferior vena cava on CT. He was treated with three months of anticoagulation, and follow-up imaging at three months showed resolution of this thrombus without renal impairment.

### The mechanism of action of rivaroxaban — an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor — compared with other anticoagulants [^112nLTzh]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

Although results of some phase III clinical trials of new oral anticoagulants are now known, it is important to understand the mechanisms of their actions. These new agents exert their anticoagulant effect via direct inhibition of a single factor within the coagulation cascade, such as factor Xa or thrombin. Rivaroxaban, the first oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor, is a small-molecule oxazolidinone derivative that binds directly and reversibly to factor Xa via the S1 and S4 pockets.

Rivaroxaban competitively inhibits factor Xa and is more than 10,000-fold more selective for factor Xa than other related serine proteases. It does not require cofactors, such as antithrombin, to exert its anticoagulant effect. Unlike indirect factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban inhibits both free and clot-bound factor Xa, as well as prothrombinase activity, thereby prolonging clotting times. Dabigatran etexilate is a direct thrombin inhibitor that inhibits both free and fibrin-bound thrombin.

Although the mechanism of action differs between the direct factor Xa and direct thrombin inhibitors, phase III studies of these new agents confirmed that both factor Xa and thrombin are viable anticoagulation targets.

### There is more than meets the eye with varicoceles: Current and emerging concepts in pathophysiology, management, and study design [^112TosTV]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Varicoceles are known to be associated with male infertility, but the mechanism of infertility and the true effect of varicocele repair remain controversial due to a lack of proper studies and the difficulty of performing proper studies. Other than infertility treatment, varicocele repairs may also be performed for a variety of reasons, including testicular pain, hypogonadism, and in adolescents who are not yet trying to conceive.

### Rivaroxaban for prevention of thrombotic events, hospitalization, and death in outpatients with COVID-19: A randomized clinical trial [^113g3YmW]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

We observed a discordance in the point estimate favoring the placebo in the intention-to-treat analysis and rivaroxaban in the safety analysis. This difference was driven largely by an excess of hospitalizations in the rivaroxaban group compared with placebo (21 versus 17) in the intention-to-treat analysis, whereas hospitalization was less frequent in the two groups in the safety analysis population (11 versus 15, respectively). We postulate that this observation was likely due to chance in the context of a lower-than-expected event rate and a disproportionate number of patients assigned to rivaroxaban not receiving or taking study medication before experiencing clinical deterioration requiring hospitalization compared with patients assigned to placebo (10 versus 2). This imbalance highlights the challenges and limitations of conducting a randomized controlled trial remotely during the pandemic, with an associated impact on medication supply chains and delivery services.

Similar to other trials, PREVENT-HD observed a low frequency of symptomatic VTE, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, and non-CNS systemic arterial embolism. Although events were marginally less frequent in the rivaroxaban group, the nominal number of events and the post hoc exploratory nature of this descriptive analysis preclude interpretation of a treatment benefit of rivaroxaban, and the number of events is insufficient to recommend thromboprophylaxis to nonhospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19. Furthermore, in the context of such a low rate of thrombosis, a difference.

### CIRSE standards of practice on varicocele embolisation [^112RKZ2M]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Percutaneous embolisation is an effective, minimally invasive means of treating a variety of benign and malignant lesions and has been successfully used to treat varicoceles since the late 1970s. Refined and expanded techniques and tools currently offer excellent outcomes for varicocele embolisation.

- **Purpose**: This document assumes that the indication for treatment is clear and approved by the multidisciplinary team (MDT) and defines the standards required for the performance of each modality, as well as their advantages and limitations. The CIRSE Standards of Practice documents are not intended to impose a standard of clinical patient care but to recommend a reasonable approach to, and best practices for, the performance of percutaneous varicocele embolisation.

- **Methods**: The writing group was established by the CIRSE Standards of Practice Committee and consisted of five clinicians with internationally recognised expertise in embolisation of male varicoceles. The writing group reviewed the existing literature on varicocele embolisation, performing a pragmatic evidence search using PubMed to search for publications in English and relating to human subjects published from 2006 to 2021. The final recommendations were formulated through consensus.

- **Conclusion**: Embolisation plays an established role in the successful management of male varicoceles. This Standards of Practice document provides up-to-date recommendations for the safe performance of varicocele embolisation.

### Potential treatment option of rivaroxaban for breastfeeding women: A case series [^1163mVLT]. Thrombosis Research (2024). High credibility.

Use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in breastfeeding women is currently challenging due to limited safety data for breastfeeding infants, and there have been no previous studies on the drug concentration in breastfeeding infants. We treated two patients, one of whom had a twin pregnancy, with venous thromboembolisms and administered rivaroxaban at our institution. Blood samples from the mothers and breastmilk samples were collected at time 0 and 2 hours after the rivaroxaban administration. Breastfeeding was conducted 2 hours after administration, and blood samples from the infants were collected 2 hours after breastfeeding (4 hours after maternal rivaroxaban administration). The milk-to-plasma (M:P) ratios were 0.27 in Case 1 and 0.32 in Case 2. The estimated relative infant dose (RID) was 0.82% in Case 1 children (1 and 2) and 1.27% in Case 2. The rivaroxaban concentration in the infant plasma was below the lower limit of quantification in all infants. Additionally, even in the high-exposure case simulation based on 5 days of breastfeeding in Case 2, the infant plasma concentration level was below the lower limit of quantification. At 3 months of follow-up, breastfeeding continued, and all infants grew and developed without any health problems, including bleeding events. The case series showed that there were no pharmacokinetic or clinical concerns for breastfeeding women or breastfed infants and provides support for rivaroxaban as a safe treatment option for these patients.

### A fifteen-year retrospective analysis of varicocele embolization: Evaluating success, recurrence rates and embolic agents [^116epF1G]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). High credibility.

Our study also highlighted the success of embolization in patients with prior failed surgical interventions. All seven patients with previous unsuccessful surgeries, including one patient who had undergone two attempted surgical repairs, were successfully treated by IR without recurrence. This finding is particularly important as it underscores the value of embolization as a salvage therapy for patients who have failed conventional surgical treatments.

Fertility outcomes are a critical consideration in varicocele treatment, particularly given the association between varicoceles and male infertility. Of the 37 patients in whom fertility was the primary concern, 51.35% achieved successful fertility (live birth) post-procedure. Nabi et al. previously demonstrated successful fertility rates of 40%; however, the follow-up in this study was only 3.6 years. In our study, 6.9% of patients continued to have fertility issues. Improvement in semen parameters following varicocele embolization is well documented. A Cochrane review published in 2004 indicated that the number needed to treat (NNT) for varicocele repair to improve fertility outcomes is 7. Our study demonstrated higher successful fertility rates than previous studies; however, this may be affected by our longer follow-up period.

In conclusion, our data confirm that varicocele embolization is a highly effective and durable treatment option with a low complication rate, even in patients who have undergone prior failed surgical intervention. The high success rate in improving fertility in sub-fertile men also reinforces embolization as a viable treatment option.

### The 2023 Society for Vascular Surgery, American Venous Forum, and American Vein and Lymphatic Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of varicose veins of the lower extremities. Part II: Endorsed by the Society of Interventional Radiology and the Society for Vascular Medicine [^114b4LyT]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). High credibility.

For patients with an asymptomatic superficial truncal vein aneurysm located more than 3 cm distal to the SFJ, endovenous ablation alone should be performed. Thromboprophylaxis in these patients reduces the risk of VTE.

Patients with symptomatic, thrombosed, or large (greater than 3 cm) aneurysms in the superficial veins are best treated with surgical excision.

- **Rationale**: Focal dilation of the saphenous veins (GSV, SSV, AAGSV, or PAGSV) that measures 20 mm or more for GSV and 15 mm for SSV, or has a diameter that is three times the upper limit of the average saphenous diameter, is considered an aneurysm. Most patients are asymptomatic or have a palpable lump at the groin or in the popliteal fossa. Many patients present only with symptoms of varicosity or CVI. Patients occasionally complain of a tender lump that can be firm if the aneurysm is thrombosed. Evaluation with duplex scanning is usually satisfactory, but congenital superficial truncal vein aneurysms may occur in patients with venous malformations, such as Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. Saphenous aneurysms may occasionally mimic femoral hernia, synovial or Baker cyst, or venous leiomyosarcoma. In these patients, further evaluation with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is warranted. When the saphenous aneurysm is near the femoral or popliteal vein, open surgical excision is indicated, with ligation or oversewing of a dilated proximal saphenous stump. In patients with symptomatic saphenous reflux, endovenous ablation, tumescent anesthesia-aided phlebectomy, or limited stripping of the distal segment is recommended.

### Safety and effectiveness of oral rivaroxaban versus standard anticoagulation for the treatment of symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis (XALIA): an international, prospective, non-interventional study [^117MmLEP]. The Lancet Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of the anticoagulant rivaroxaban for the treatment and secondary prevention of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism have been shown in phase 3 trials. However, data about rivaroxaban use in routine clinical practice are needed.

- **Methods**: XA inhibition with rivaroxaban for long-term and initial anticoagulation in venous thromboembolism (XALIA) was a multicentre, international, prospective, non-interventional study of patients with deep-vein thrombosis. The study was conducted in hospitals and community care centres across 21 countries. It investigated the safety and effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared with standard anticoagulation therapy (initial treatment with unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, or fondaparinux, usually overlapping with and followed by a vitamin K antagonist) for at least 3 months. Eligible patients were adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with an objectively confirmed diagnosis of deep-vein thrombosis and an indication to receive anticoagulation treatment for at least 3 months. Following approval of rivaroxaban for the pulmonary embolism indication, patients with deep-vein thrombosis and concomitant pulmonary embolism were also eligible, but those with isolated pulmonary embolism were not included. The type, dose, and duration of therapy for each patient were at the physician's discretion. The primary effectiveness and safety outcomes were major bleeding, recurrent venous thromboembolism, and all-cause mortality. Propensity score-adjusted analyses were done to account for potential imbalances between groups.

### Secondary prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism after initial oral anticoagulation therapy in patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism [^111Lw6Cb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Currently, little evidence is available on the length and type of anticoagulation used for extended treatment for prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with unprovoked VTE who have completed initial oral anticoagulation therapy.

- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy and safety of available oral therapeutic options (aspirin, warfarin, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)) for extended thromboprophylaxis in adults with a first unprovoked VTE, to prevent VTE recurrence after completion of an acceptable initial oral anticoagulant treatment period, as defined in individual studies.

- **Search methods**: For this review, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (March 2017) as well as the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2). We also searched trial registries (March 2017) and reference lists of relevant articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials in which patients with a first, symptomatic, objectively confirmed, unprovoked VTE, who had been initially treated with anticoagulants, were randomised to extended prophylaxis (vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), antiplatelet agents, or DOACs) versus no prophylaxis or placebo. We also included trials that compared one type of extended prophylaxis versus another type of extended prophylaxis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed quality, and extracted data. We resolved disagreements by discussion.

- **Main results**: Six studies with a combined total of 3436 patients were included in the analysis.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^113FL5uJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

In general, FDA-approved indications for each of the DOACs are comparable. Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are approved for lowering the risk of stroke and embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), as well as for the treatment and prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Unique indications include betrixaban for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized patients with an acute medical illness, and rivaroxaban in combination with aspirin to reduce major cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) or peripheral artery disease.

However, there is still uncertainty in understanding the safe and effective use of DOACs in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, specifically in atrial fibrillation (AF) with recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), AF with concomitant artificial heart valves, stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and cancer-associated thromboembolism. This section aims to clarify the use of DOACs within these patient subgroups.

### Thrombosed varicocele - a rare cause for acute scrotal pain: a case report [^112SNt2M]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Spontaneous thrombosis of varicocele is a rare cause of acute scrotal pain. Pain disproportionate to clinical features is characteristic of this condition. Spontaneous thrombus in varicoceles not responding to adequate medical therapy (7–10 days) requires varicocelectomy, which produces immediate pain relief. Histopathology can be useful in this disorder, as it helps differentiate a spontaneous complete thrombus in the acute thrombosed varicocele from an in vitro remodeled clot in a longstanding varicocele.

### A fifteen-year retrospective analysis of varicocele embolization: Evaluating success, recurrence rates and embolic agents [^1154oNAg]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Low credibility.

This retrospective cohort study was conducted at two tertiary referral interventional radiology centers, adhering to the STROBE guidelines for cohort studies. The study included consecutive adult patients who underwent varicocele embolization from April 2008 to February 2023. Eligible patients were identified through a retrospective review of procedural records and radiology reports. All adult patients undergoing the procedure during the study period were included, with no formal sample size calculation due to the retrospective nature of the study. Bilateral procedures were treated as a single entry, and a single operator with over 20 years of experience performed all procedures.

Descriptive statistics summarized patient demographics and procedural characteristics. Categorical data were presented as frequencies and percentages. Data analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 2021 (version 16) and IBM SPSS Statistics (version 30).

Data points collected included the age at the time of the procedure, date of the procedure, access site used (right internal jugular veins vs. right common femoral vein), site of occurrence, previous failed interventions, type of embolic agent used, need for re-intervention, and recurrence rate.

Technical success was measured by successful access to the gonadal vein and the successful insertion of coil/sclerosant with the abolition of flow in that gonadal vein. This definition was applied uniformly to both right- and left-sided varicocele.

Regarding the medical management of deep vein thrombosis, specifically in terms of anticoagulation choice and extended therapy, the ESVS 2021 guidelines recommend considering the use of reduced doses of DOACs, such as apixaban 2.5 mg BID or rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily. This recommendation applies to patients with unprovoked proximal DVT requiring extended anticoagulation beyond six months who are not deemed to be at very high risk of recurrence.

### Thrombosed varicocele - a rare cause for acute scrotal pain: a case report [^114mduGv]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Thrombosed varicoceles have been described as a rare cause of acute scrotal pain. Postoperative thrombus in pampiniform plexuses has been managed conservatively with intravenous antibiotics, parenteral and oral analgesics, and scrotal elevation with bed rest. Spontaneously occurring thrombi have also been reported to have been managed medically in a previous case, though the exact details of medical treatment are unclear. To date, all the cases mentioned in the literature have been managed medically without any note of surgical treatment needed in such cases.

It is interesting to note the first report in literature by Roach et al, who recommended conservative management. In their study of two patients, both underwent surgical ligation and excision of the thrombosed vein, contrary to their recommendations. Similarly, El Hennawy et al. advised conservative management, but their patient was subjected to surgery. There are two other case reports which have noted that pain usually subsides within a week of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications and scrotal rest. Here also, Doerfler et al. recommended medical management, yet their patient underwent surgery. Kleinclauss et al. were the only ones who managed their patient successfully with medical management alone. The other documentation of medical management is in post-operative varicocelectomy patients.

The summation of all the reports leads us to conclude that medical therapy may be successful if only a single superficial spermatic vein is involved, while in…

### European guidelines on peri-operative venous thromboembolism prophylaxis: First update: Chapter 12: Urology [^112iseyF]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). High credibility.

- **Recommendation 1**: In all patients undergoing ambulatory day surgery (e.g. circumcision, vasectomy, hydrocoelectomy, and ureteroscopy), the panel recommends against the use of pharmacological prophylaxis (Grade 1B) and against the use of mechanical prophylaxis (Grade 1B).

- **Rationale**: The panel understands the risk of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) in this group to be similar to the risk of VTE in the general population. Administering pharmacological or mechanical thromboprophylaxis in this context would result in only marginal reductions in VTE risk, while potentially increasing the likelihood of bleeding complications, overall healthcare expenses, and the burden of patient care.

### Clinical experience with the new oral anticoagulants for treatment of venous thromboembolism [^111GpDVZ]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

Four non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants — apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban — have been evaluated in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism. All except edoxaban have also been studied for extended secondary prophylaxis after venous thromboembolism. Rivaroxaban, and recently dabigatran, have been approved for this indication. Therefore, it is timely to review the characteristics, efficacy, and safety of these drugs with an emphasis on patients with venous thromboembolism. This review focuses on the clinical results from the phase III trials, separately for each of the drugs as compared with vitamin K antagonists. We also address the results from meta-analyses that were published recently.

Finally, the results in some special groups of interest — such as those with renal impairment, elderly patients, and patients with cancer — are reviewed, although these groups comprised only small minorities of the study populations. All four drugs demonstrated noninferiority against vitamin K antagonists in the acute treatment and clear superiority against placebo in the extended treatment (not performed with edoxaban). The risk of bleeding was generally lower with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, and the reduction of risk of intracranial hemorrhage seems to mirror the experience from atrial fibrillation trials.

In conclusion, over the past 30 years, we have transitioned from a week of hospitalization and intravenous heparin therapy, via low-molecular-weight heparin injections subcutaneously and early discharge from the hospital, to the possibility of oral treatment with these new anticoagulants.

### A fifteen-year retrospective analysis of varicocele embolization: Evaluating success, recurrence rates and embolic agents [^114nUWAK]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). High credibility.

A cohort of 225 male patients was included in the study. The mean age of patients at the time of the procedure was 33 years. Most patients, 97.34% (219 out of 225), had a left-sided varicocele. Vascular access was obtained via the right common femoral vein (RCFV) in almost all cases (224 out of 225 patients). In a single case, access was achieved through the right internal jugular vein (RIJV).

- **Indications for embolization**: The most common indication for varicocele embolization was the presence of a symptomatic varicocele (scrotal pain or discomfort), accounting for 68% (153/225) of the cases. Subfertility was the second most frequent reason for embolization, representing 16.5% (37/225) of the patients. A smaller percentage (3.56%, 8/225) underwent the procedure following an incidental finding of a varicocele, while 1.78% (4/225) had both subfertility and symptomatic varicocele. Rare indications included a history of previous spontaneous bleeding and erectile dysfunction, each accounting for 0.45% (1/225). In 7.17% (21/225) of cases, the indication for embolization was not documented.

- **Technical success**: The technical success rate of embolization procedures in this cohort was 96% (216/225). Of those unsuccessful, 22.2% (2/9) underwent successful repeat procedures, resulting in an overall technical success rate.

### Length of anticoagulation in provoked venous thromboembolism: A multicenter study of how real-world practice mirrors guideline recommendations [^112y1KYQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

For more than a decade, guidelines have recommended a limited 3 months of anticoagulation for the treatment of provoked venous thromboembolism (VTE). How closely real-world practice follows guideline recommendations is not well described.

- **Methods and results**: In our multicenter, retrospective cohort study, we evaluated trends in anticoagulation duration for patients enrolled in the MAQI 2 (Michigan Anticoagulation Quality Improvement Initiative) registry who were receiving anticoagulation for a provoked VTE. The MAQI 2 registry comprises 6 centers in Michigan that manage patients' long-term anticoagulation. We identified 474 patients on warfarin and 302 patients on direct oral anticoagulants who were receiving anticoagulation for a primary indication of provoked VTE between 2008 and 2020. Using a predefined threshold of 120 days (3 months plus a buffer period), predictors of extended anticoagulant use were identified using multivariable logistic regression. Most patients received more than 120 days of anticoagulation, regardless of which medication was used. The median (25th–75th percentile) length of treatment for patients taking warfarin was 142 (91–234) days and for direct oral anticoagulants was 180 (101–360) days. ReVTE (odds ratio [OR], 2.75 [95% CI, 1.67–4.53]), history of myocardial infarction (OR, 3.92 [95% CI, 1.32–11.7]), and direct oral anticoagulant rather than warfarin use (OR, 2.22 [95% CI, 1.59–3.08]) were independently associated with prolonged anticoagulation.

- **Conclusions**: In our cohort of patients with provoked VTE, most patients received anticoagulation for longer than the recommended 3 months.

### Benefit-risk assessment of rivaroxaban for extended thromboprophylaxis after hospitalization for medical illness [^111QUeoA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

To compare benefits and risks in the identical population and time period, both efficacy and safety outcomes were analyzed in the intention-to-treat population and included all events from randomization to day 45 inclusive. This contrasts with prior reports that used the safety population for safety outcomes. All possible efficacy and bleeding events were adjudicated by a clinical events committee blinded to treatment assignment. All ultrasounds were adjudicated by a core laboratory experienced in reading compression ultrasonography to rule in or rule out deep vein thrombosis. Analyses were performed for the total population and for the prespecified subgroups. All results were computed with incident proportions.

- **Statistical analysis**: The benefit and risk were assessed as rate differences with 95% CI per 10,000 patients, defined as the difference in proportions between the two treatments scaled to a hypothetical population of 10,000 patients to reflect benefits and risks on a population level. These rate differences can be interpreted as the number of patients in this population who would experience a particular event when treated with rivaroxaban minus that in the same population treated with a placebo. Results were shown in both forest plots and tabular forms. The 95% CI was calculated to demonstrate uncertainty only, and no hypothesis tests were conducted nor any adjustments for multiplicity applied.

The number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH) were calculated as the reciprocal of the rate differences between rivaroxaban and placebo.

### Ex vivo reversal of effects of rivaroxaban evaluated using thromboelastometry and thrombin generation assay [^113XdwJZ]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

- **Editor's key points**: There is limited information on the best treatment of bleeding in patients taking newer direct oral anticoagulants. The effects of various procoagulant factors on laboratory coagulation parameters were assessed on blood treated ex vivo with rivaroxaban or blood from rivaroxaban-treated patients. Reversal of rivaroxaban anticoagulant effects ex vivo was possible, but varied between reversal agents and the coagulation assay, indicating that clinical trials are needed to validate reversibility in vivo.

Rivaroxaban (Xarelto®; Bayer, Germany) is used as thrombosis prophylaxis and therapy instead of anticoagulants such as unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or vitamin K antagonists, because it is considered to have a wider therapeutic range and a more predictable dose-response relationship. According to the manufacturer, rivaroxaban does not require routine drug monitoring.

In the European Union, Canada, and the United States, rivaroxaban is approved for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients undergoing hip- or knee-replacement surgery, prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, treatment and prevention of recurrence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and prevention of atherothrombotic events after acute coronary syndrome. Dose reduction (15 mg once daily) is recommended or can be considered in patients with advanced renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30–49 mL min⁻¹). Although bleeding and bleeding complications in trauma and surgery are the most common…

### Monitoring the anticoagulant effect following a massive rivaroxaban overdose [^116dMib3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

Rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor approved for the prevention of stroke, prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism, and secondary prevention of acute coronary syndrome in many countries. As the use of this agent increases, so does the potential for overdose, both intentional and unintentional. Clinical data on overdoses of rivaroxaban in humans are limited. We report the case of a 42-year-old man who took an overdose of 1400 mg of rivaroxaban and describe how resolution of the anticoagulant effect was monitored using readily available coagulation assays.
