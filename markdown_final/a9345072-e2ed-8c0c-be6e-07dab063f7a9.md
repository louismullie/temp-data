## Question

Guidelines of hyperlipidemia 2024

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the 2024 hyperlipidemia guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which 2024 sources are truly authoritative and what they update. Then, I should verify the overarching principles that persist across guidelines. Next, I will examine primary prevention thresholds and intensification, followed by secondary prevention targets and nonstatin sequencing. After that, I need to check hypertriglyceridemia management, special populations, and monitoring cadence. Finally, I will reconcile differences between societies and translate this into a practical algorithm, making sure I double-check any numeric thresholds before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the key 2024 sources and what they actually represent, because I need to ensure I'm not overextending older guidance as "2024". The most impactful 2024 updates include the AACE pharmacologic guideline for dyslipidemia, the ACC/AHA/ACCP chronic coronary disease guideline, the ESC chronic coronary syndromes guideline, and the ESVS peripheral arterial disease guideline, with the ACC 2022 nonstatin ECDP and 2021 hypertriglyceridemia ECDP remaining the most current ACC pathways until superseded, so I should anchor to those while noting where 2024 adds new targets or agents [^d41448aa] [^d3f9a666] [^57a992ba] [^b3462b2f] [^4a9ff04b] [^5fae2a2f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about changing fundamentals; I should confirm the persistent principles. Across contemporary guidance, lifestyle modification remains foundational for all, statins remain first-line pharmacotherapy, and treatment intensity is risk-stratified with both percentage LDL-C reduction and absolute on-treatment LDL-C thresholds guiding escalation, which is consistent from 2018 AHA/ACC through 2022 ACC ECDP and into 2024 updates [^9f6551ae] [^5b9aa8cf] [^d41448aa].

> Next, I should review primary prevention thresholds and intensification, and I need to double-check the exact percentages. For adults 40–75 years without ASCVD or diabetes, risk is categorized as borderline 5– < 7.5%, intermediate 7.5– < 20%, and high ≥ 20% by 10-year ASCVD risk; moderate-intensity statins are reasonable in intermediate risk with risk enhancers, and high-intensity statins are recommended in high risk to achieve ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL, with consideration of ezetimibe if thresholds are not met; this aligns with ACC ECDP and is echoed in AACE 2024, which also suggests LDL-C < 70 mg/dL as a goal in higher-risk primary prevention contexts [^d83050dc] [^745e903a] [^d41448aa].

> Wait, let me verify the secondary prevention and very-high-risk targets, because this is where 2024 sources diverge from 2018. The ACC 2022 nonstatin ECDP operationalizes very-high-risk ASCVD and recommends intensifying to achieve LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL or non-HDL-C ≤ 85 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statins, with ezetimibe and then PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies as preferred next steps; the 2024 ESC chronic coronary syndromes guideline explicitly adopts LDL-C < 1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL) and ≥ 50% reduction from baseline for very high risk, and the 2024 ESVS PAD guideline mirrors this for atherosclerotic PAD, while AACE 2024 supports LDL-C < 70 mg/dL broadly and acknowledges limited evidence for < 55 mg/dL in most patients, so I should present both the ACC/ESC stricter stance and AACE's more conservative framing [^f64375f0] [^57a992ba] [^b3462b2f] [^d41448aa].

> I will now examine nonstatin sequencing and thresholds, and I should confirm expected incremental LDL-C lowering. On a statin background, ezetimibe typically lowers LDL-C by about 20–25%, PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies by about 60%, and bempedoic acid by about 18% on average; inclisiran produces roughly 48–52% LDL-C reduction but lacks completed cardiovascular outcomes trials, so guidelines variably suggest it when available with shared decision-making; ACC ECDP recommends ezetimibe first, then PCSK9 mAbs if still above threshold, and allows bempedoic acid or inclisiran in selected cases, whereas AACE 2024 suggests alirocumab, evolocumab, or bempedoic acid for ASCVD or high-risk primary prevention, reflecting a somewhat broader endorsement of PCSK9 agents in appropriate patients [^6a07677c] [^d22f675f] [^d41448aa].

> Let me consider hypertriglyceridemia management carefully, because I need to ensure I separate pancreatitis risk from ASCVD risk. For fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL, pancreatitis risk predominates and warrants a very low-fat diet, alcohol abstinence, glycemic control, and consideration of fibrates and/or prescription omega-3s; for persistent triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL despite lifestyle, especially with ASCVD or high risk, icosapent ethyl 4 g/day is recommended to reduce cardiovascular events, whereas mixed EPA/DHA preparations are not favored for ASCVD risk reduction; AACE 2024 supports EPA in appropriate patients and advises against niacin for ASCVD risk, which I should emphasize to avoid outdated practice [^593b06f6] [^4656cab7] [^d41448aa].

> But wait, what about special populations where thresholds or agents differ; I should double-check those. In adults > 75 years, evidence is limited; if already on a tolerated statin, continuation is reasonable, and initiation should be individualized with shared decision-making; in pregnancy, statins are generally discontinued and avoided during lactation; in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, LDL-C is often > 400 mg/dL and combination therapy including PCSK9 inhibitors, evinacumab, lomitapide, and possibly LDL apheresis is indicated; in CKD, PCSK9 inhibitors can be considered when indicated; and for Lp(a), ESC recommends measuring at least once in adulthood, with intensified LDL-C lowering when Lp(a) is markedly elevated, given its lifetime risk contribution [^c0d53b42] [^bae3b4e3] [^6ca3e52f] [^8119ee7c] [^ac8f904b].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence and lab methods, and I need to ensure I cite the most current guidance. Lipid panels should be checked 4–12 weeks after initiation or change in therapy to assess adherence and percent reduction, then every 3–12 months once stable; when triglycerides are elevated, calculated LDL-C may be inaccurate, so non-HDL-C or apoB should be used to guide decisions, and Martin-Hopkins or direct LDL-C methods improve accuracy in hypertriglyceridemia or very low LDL-C states [^7fc34abb] [^047845bc] [^098cf435].

> Hold on, I should verify how to reconcile differences between societies so I don't overstate any single position. ACC/AHA frameworks emphasize percent LDL-C reduction and risk-based thresholds with relatively conservative use of PCSK9 inhibitors in primary prevention, whereas ESC/EAS and vascular society guidelines adopt more aggressive absolute LDL-C targets (< 55 mg/dL) and broader PCSK9 use in very-high-risk patients; AACE 2024 sits between these, endorsing LDL-C < 70 mg/dL broadly and allowing PCSK9 agents in ASCVD or high-risk primary prevention, which I should present as acceptable variations grounded in evidence and patient preference [^5b9aa8cf] [^57a992ba] [^d41448aa].

> Let me translate this into a practical, stepwise algorithm, and I should double-check that each step aligns with cited guidance. Start with lifestyle for all; in primary prevention, use 10-year risk to guide statin intensity, escalate to ezetimibe if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL or percent reduction is inadequate after 12 weeks, and consider PCSK9 therapy in high-risk primary prevention or if LDL-C is persistently ≥ 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated therapy; in secondary prevention or very-high-risk ASCVD, target LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL and ≥ 50% reduction using statin, then ezetimibe, then PCSK9 mAbs, with bempedoic acid or inclisiran as alternatives when indicated; for triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL, prioritize pancreatitis prevention with diet and fibrates or prescription omega-3s, and for persistent triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL with ASCVD risk, add icosapent ethyl; monitor response 4–12 weeks after changes and reassess every 3–12 months thereafter [^d83050dc] [^f64375f0] [^d41448aa] [^593b06f6] [^7fc34abb].

> Finally, I should confirm the bottom line and ensure I haven't missed a key update. The 2024 theme is intensification: lower LDL-C thresholds in very-high-risk patients, earlier consideration of nonstatins when thresholds are not met, and clearer triglyceride pathways, all built on the enduring foundations of lifestyle, statins, and risk-stratified care; while some societies specify LDL-C < 55 mg/dL for very high risk, others endorse < 70 mg/dL with room for individualized goals, so shared decision-making and periodic reassessment remain essential to align therapy with patient risk, tolerance, and preferences [^57a992ba] [^d41448aa] [^5b9aa8cf].

---

The 2024 hyperlipidemia guidelines emphasize **risk-based LDL-C lowering** with statins as first-line therapy, targeting LDL-C < 70 mg/dL for high-risk and < 55 mg/dL for very high-risk patients, and adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors if goals are not met [^d41448aa] [^f64375f0]. For primary prevention, use the 10-year ASCVD risk calculator with risk enhancers and CAC scoring to guide statin intensity; for secondary prevention, use high-intensity statins and escalate to combination therapy as needed [^9f6551ae] [^d3f9a666]. Lifestyle modification is essential for all, and nonstatin therapies (ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, bempedoic acid, inclisiran) are recommended for statin-intolerant or refractory cases [^6a6709a7] [^4a9ff04b]. Triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL require pancreatitis risk reduction with very low-fat diets, fibrates, and omega-3s; icosapent ethyl is recommended for persistent triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL with ASCVD risk [^593b06f6] [^d41448aa]. Monitor lipids every 3–12 months and individualize therapy for older adults, diabetes, CKD, and familial hypercholesterolemia [^7fc34abb] [^1131aa65] [^8119ee7c] [^3bbd089b].

---

## Risk assessment and stratification

- **Primary prevention**: Use the 10-year ASCVD risk calculator, incorporating risk enhancers (family history, LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL, triglycerides ≥ 175 mg/dL, high-sensitivity CRP ≥ 2 mg/L, Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL, ankle-brachial index < 0.9) and consider coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring to refine risk and guide statin therapy [^9f6551ae] [^23104331].

- **Secondary prevention**: All patients with clinical ASCVD are categorized as high or very high risk, warranting aggressive LDL-C lowering [^f64375f0].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle therapy is **foundational for all patients** and includes:

- **Diet**: Emphasize Mediterranean or DASH diets; limit saturated fats, trans fats, refined carbohydrates, and alcohol; tailor fat intake for hypertriglyceridemia [^6a6709a7] [^593b06f6].

- **Exercise**: At least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity [^notfound].

- **Weight management**: Aim for BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m² and waist circumference < 40 inches (men) or < 35 inches (women) [^notfound].

- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended [^notfound].

## Pharmacologic management

### LDL-C lowering therapies

| **Medication class** | **Indication** | **Recommended use** |
|-|-|-|
| Statins | First-line for LDL-C lowering | - High-intensity for secondary prevention and high-risk primary prevention <br/> - Moderate-intensity for intermediate-risk primary prevention [^c0d53b42] [^d83050dc] |
| Ezetimibe | Second-line or add-on therapy | Add if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL (high risk) or ≥ 55 mg/dL (very high risk) despite maximally tolerated statin [^bf6de20a] [^f64375f0] |
| PCSK9 inhibitors (alirocumab, evolocumab) | Third-line or add-on therapy | Consider if LDL-C remains above threshold despite statin ± ezetimibe, or in statin-intolerant patients [^cd83235d] [^4a9ff04b] |
| Bempedoic acid | Alternative or add-on therapy | Consider in statin-intolerant patients or as adjunct therapy [^4a9ff04b] |
| Inclisiran | Emerging therapy | Consider in high-risk or ASCVD patients not at LDL-C goals; outcomes trials pending [^d41448aa] [^d22f675f] |

---

### Triglyceride management

- **Severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL)**: Prioritize pancreatitis risk reduction with very low-fat diet, fibrates, and omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA 2–4 g/day) [^593b06f6].

- **Persistent hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 150 mg/dL) with ASCVD risk**: Add icosapent ethyl 4 g/day to reduce cardiovascular events [^d41448aa].

- **Avoid**: Niacin, fenofibrate, and over-the-counter omega-3 supplements for cardiovascular risk reduction [^c3281582].

---

## Special populations

- **Older adults (≥ 75 years)**: Individualize statin therapy; consider moderate-intensity statins if tolerated [^c0d53b42].

- **Diabetes mellitus**: High-intensity statins for ages 40–75 years; consider PCSK9 inhibitors if LDL-C remains above threshold [^9acbc92d] [^1131aa65].

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Consider PCSK9 inhibitors when indicated [^8119ee7c].

- **Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)**: Aggressive LDL-C lowering with combination therapy; consider PCSK9 inhibitors, bempedoic acid, or inclisiran [^372ee1af] [^3bbd089b].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Obtain lipid panels **4–12 weeks** after initiating or changing therapy, then every 3–12 months to assess adherence and efficacy [^7fc34abb]. Adjust therapy based on **LDL-C response**, tolerability, and patient preferences [^bf6de20a].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **LDL-C targets**: < 70 mg/dL for high risk; < 55 mg/dL for very high risk [^f64375f0] [^57a992ba].

- **First-line therapy**: Statins with intensity based on risk category [^c0d53b42].

- **Second-line therapy**: Ezetimibe if LDL-C goals not met [^bf6de20a].

- **Third-line therapy**: PCSK9 inhibitors or bempedoic acid for refractory cases [^cd83235d] [^4a9ff04b].

- **Lifestyle**: Essential for all patients [^6a6709a7].

- **Triglycerides**: Aggressive management for ≥ 500 mg/dL; icosapent ethyl for persistent elevations with ASCVD risk [^593b06f6] [^d41448aa].

---

The 2024 hyperlipidemia guidelines prioritize **risk-based LDL-C lowering** with statins first-line, escalation to nonstatins when needed, and aggressive triglyceride management, all anchored in lifestyle change and individualized care.

Objective

To review the evidence and provide updated and new recommendations for the pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia to prevent adverse cardiovascular outcomes. These recommendations are intended for use by clinicians, health care team members, patients, caregivers, and other stakeholders.

Methods

This guideline was developed by a multidisciplinary task force of content experts and guideline methodologists based on systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials or cohort studies from database inception to November 7, 2023. An updated literature search was completed for any additional articles published by May 31, 2024. Clinical questions addressing nonstatin medications and patient-important outcomes were prioritized. The task force assessed the certainty of the evidence and developed recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. All recommendations were based on the consideration of the certainty of the evidence across patient-important outcomes, in addition to issues of feasibility, acceptability, equity, and patient preferences and values.

Results

This guideline update includes 13 evidence-based recommendations for the pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia focused on patient-important outcomes of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk reduction. The task force issued a good practice statement to assess the risk of ASCVD events for primary prevention in adults with dyslipidemia. The task force suggested the use of alirocumab, evolocumab, or bempedoic acid for adults who have ASCVD or who are at increased risk for ASCVD in addition to standard care. The task force suggested against the use of these medications in adults without ASCVD. There was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the addition of inclisiran. For adults with hypertriglyceridemia and ASCVD or increased risk of ASCVD, the task force suggested the use of eicosapentaenoic acid but not eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid and strongly recommended against the use of niacin. There was insufficient evidence for recommendations regarding pharmacologic management in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL). The task force suggested a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol treatment goal of < 70 mg/dL in adults with dyslipidemia and ASCVD or at increased risk of ASCVD.

Conclusions

Pharmacotherapy is recommended in adults with dyslipidemia to reduce the risk of ASCVD events. There are several effective and safe treatment options for adults with dyslipidemia who have ASCVD or at increased risk of ASCVD who need additional lipid-lowering medications. Shared decision-making discussions are essential to determine the best option for each individual.

### Guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia: how can clinicians effectively implement them? [^711bb727]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Guidelines support lowering cholesterol to decrease atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk across the entire lifespan with intensive lifestyle intervention, as well as statin and non-statin pharmacotherapy for those at highest risk. Modest improvements in the initiation, use, and adherence to statin therapy in patients with ASCVD have occurred over the past decades. However, studies continue to document a less than desired implementation of guidelines highlighting a substantial and persistent treatment gap. The success of implementation depends on the consideration of a variety of barriers that exist throughout the healthcare delivery system. Further research is needed to comprehensively evaluate these barriers in order to develop appropriate and sustainable interventions to improve guideline implementation.

### Past, present, and future standards for management of dyslipidemia [^9989c22a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Evolution of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) guidelines for lipid lowering reflects a movement toward global risk assessment, including improved identification of risk in individuals without established coronary heart disease (CHD), and toward more aggressive lipid-lowering targets to reduce CHD risk. The current guidelines, for example, identify a segment of the population without established CHD as being at high risk on the basis of criteria that indicate CHD risk equivalency, recommend a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) plasma level < 100 mg/dL as optimal in all individuals, and establish the metabolic syndrome as a secondary target for therapeutic intervention. Many questions remain for future guidelines to address: To what extent should plasma levels of LDL-C be lowered by therapy to afford optimal risk reduction? Can risk assessment be improved, e.g., by using novel risk measures (such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) to indicate patients at higher risk who may benefit from more aggressive interventions? Should the metabolic syndrome be considered a high-risk state warranting aggressive intervention irrespective of risk categorization using current scoring methods? Guidelines for lipid management represent a synthesis of constantly emerging and evolving data: ongoing efforts to improve understanding of the relation between dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease, to increase knowledge of and ability to measure other CHD risk factors, and to improve therapeutic practices and options will be reflected in future guidelines.

### Managing hypercholesterolemia in adults older than 75 years without a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association and the American Geriatrics Society [^9b5f5430]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Preamble

Since 2014, the National Lipid Association (NLA) has issued several scientific statements on key aspects of the management of lipids and lipoproteins to prevent cardiovascular disease. The current Expert Clinical Consensus, focused on the treatment of hypercholesterolemia among individuals older than 75 years without clinically manifest atherosclerotic cardio vascular disease (ASCVD), was developed as a collaboration between the NLA and the American Geriatrics Society (AGS). The governing bodies of both organizations appointed members with relevant expertise to the writing group which was jointly chaired by a representative of NLA (V. B.) and AGS (S. A.L.). The Expert Clinical Consensus was developed by a diverse group of clinical lipidologists, cardiologists, geriatricians, and pharmacists with cumulative expertise in clinical medicine, geriatrics, cardiology, endocrinology, pharmacology, clinical trials, epidemiology, health outcomes research, and public health.

The chairs and members of the writing group jointly developed a set of key clinical questions to be addressed by the panel. Once the key clinical questions were agreed upon, writing assignments were jointly determined by the group based on content expertise with a primary and secondary author assigned to each question. The literature was reviewed and recommendations were developed using the 2019 Update of the American Heart Association (AHA) / American College of Cardiology (ACC) rating system for clinical guidelines, assigning a Class of Recommendation (I‐III) and a Level of Evidence (A‐C with sub categories) for each recommendation (Figure 1). Each section and its associated recommendations were discussed in detail by the writing group. Preliminary recommendations were presented at the Annual Scientific Meeting of AGS (AGS23) in May 2023 and feedback from the audience was incorporated as appropriate. Final recommendations based on consensus of at least 60% of the expert panel were then reviewed by external peer reviewers, edited as appropriate and approved by the respective Boards of the NLA and AGS on 9/20/2024.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for management of adults with dyslipidemia-2025 update [^aca5ef1b]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Algorithm Fig. 4 — specific lifestyle recommendations for adults with dyslipidemia stratify hypertriglyceridemia by triglyceride range: "150–499 mg/dL (1.7–5.6 mmol/L)", "500–884 mg/dL (5.6–9.9 mmol/L)", and " ≥ 895 mg/dL (10 mmol/L)". For 150–499 mg/dL, the treatment priority cell states "Prioritize CVD risk + address pancreatitis risk". For 500–884 mg/dL, the treatment priority cell states "Prioritize pancreatitis risk + address CVD risk", and the same treatment priority phrase appears under ≥ 895 mg/dL. An example of required dietary management includes that at 150–499 mg/dL the fat content is "~30% of calories as fat", and at 500–884 mg/dL the fat content is "20–30 g fat/day".

### Management of obesity: office-based strategies [^dc30b138]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for obesity, more specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate pharmacotherapy for obesity in addition to lifestyle measures in nonpregnant patients with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or with a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² with any metabolic comorbidities (hypertension, T2DM, or dyslipidemia).

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for management of adults with dyslipidemia-2025 update [^b811739f]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

LDL-C pharmacologic therapy for ASCVD prevention — When managing dyslipidemia with pharmacotherapy to lower atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, it is important to determine whether the approach involves primary or secondary prevention; the latter involves individuals with known clinical ASCVD. Moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy is recommended for individuals without known ASCVD who are considered to be at high risk. The addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy should be considered if the LDL-C target is not met, and there may be a need for treatment intensification using proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or other therapies based on individualized response if the LDL-C target is not met after initial treatment. AACE suggests targeting LDL-C levels below 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), and there is limited evidence to support treatment goals of < 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) for most individuals.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1-executive summary [^708086a7]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

Various organizations and agencies have issued recommendations for the management of dyslipidemia. Although many commonalities exist among them, material differences are present as well. The leadership of the National Lipid Association (NLA) convened an Expert Panel to develop a consensus set of recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia in clinical medicine. The current Executive Summary highlights the major conclusions in Part 1 of the recommendations report of the NLA Expert Panel and includes: (1) background and conceptual framework for formulation of the NLA Expert Panel recommendations; (2) screening and classification of lipoprotein lipid levels in adults; (3) targets for intervention in dyslipidemia management; (4) atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk assessment and treatment goals based on risk category; (5) atherogenic cholesterol-non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-as the primary targets of therapy; and (6) lifestyle and drug therapies intended to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with dyslipidemia.

### Consensus clinical recommendations for the management of plasma lipid disorders in the middle east: 2021 update [^272fb669]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Disorders of plasma lipids remain key risk factors for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in the Middle East and are estimated to increase more dramatically in the next decade than in any other global region except Africa. This statement is an update to the 2016 consensus clinical recommendations for the management of plasma lipid disorders in the Middle East, following the evaluation of newer cholesterol-lowering agents in randomised controlled cardiovascular outcome trials, as well as the publication of revised international guidelines.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of regional experts was convened to update the consensus clinical recommendations for the management of plasma lipids in the Middle East. The recommendations constructed in 2016 were reviewed against emerging research since publication.

Results

Newly developed Middle East ASCVD risk categories were established using the multiple risk group categories from the recently updated international guidelines and the epidemiological evidence from the Gulf Region. These consensus recommendations support a more intensive reduction of LDL-C across cardiovascular risk categories. Alongside low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, we recommend non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a primary treatment target. Lifestyle modifications remain the first-line treatment recommendation for all patients. The first-line pharmacological treatment in patients with dyslipidaemia is statin therapy, with a number of second-line agents available. The selection of a second lipid-lowering agent for combination therapy with statin should be based on the lipid-lowering target of the patient. Guidance is also provided on the management of underlying conditions and special populations; of particular pertinence in the region are familial hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes and metabolic dyslipidaemia. New therapies have emerged from research that found positive outcomes in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The initial results of these newly researched drugs strongly indicate their inclusion as future therapies in dyslipidaemia management in the Middle East.

Conclusions

These updated consensus clinical recommendations provide practicing clinicians with comprehensive, region-specific guidance to improve the detection and management of plasma lipid disorders in patients in the Middle East.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the role of nonstatin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^4a9ff04b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Expert consensus decision pathway — scope and key questions — states that in 2021 the American College of Cardiology convened the writing committee to address current gaps in care for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering to reduce ASCVD risk, and notes that since the 2018 AHA/ACC/multisociety guideline, 3 additional nonstatin therapies — bempedoic acid, evinacumab, and inclisiran — have received FDA approval for management of hypercholesterolemia; the committee aimed to answer: in what patient populations should newer nonstatin therapies be considered; in what situations should newer nonstatin therapies be considered, that is, when is the amount of LDL-C lowering less than anticipated, less than desired, or inadequate, and which treatment options should be considered in patients who are truly statin intolerant; and, if newer nonstatin therapies are to be added, which therapies should be considered and in what order to maximize patient benefit and preference.

Management of hypercholesterolemia in pregnant and lactating individuals — treatment planning requires evaluation of cardiovascular risk and potential effects on embryonic and fetal development, and information on medication effects is limited; for very high atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk such as homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe heterozygous FH and/or underlying ASCVD on therapy, a preconception discussion with multidisciplinary input is recommended; a lipid profile before pregnancy or when pregnancy is first identified will inform the treatment plan, and if dyslipidemia is newly diagnosed, exclusion of secondary causes is necessary; in 2021 the FDA removed its strongest warning against statin use in pregnancy, but statins should be discontinued in most individuals during pregnancy and not prescribed during lactation.

Brief review of cholesterol guidelines

The management of hypercholesterolemia has undergone significant evolution since the first major U.S. national cholesterol guidelines were introduced in 1988. This progress has been driven by the advent of statin therapy and numerous clinical trials demonstrating substantial reductions in cardiovascular events. A brief review of the most recent international guidelines is essential. These include the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) multisociety guidelines, with subsequent updates reflected in the 2021 and 2022 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathways (ECDPs) on hypertriglyceridemiaand nonstatin therapies, respectively; the 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines; and the 2021 Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) guidelines. Table 2, provides an overview of the guidelines.

Table 2
Comparison of Recent International Cholesterol Statements

Two of the most significant differences across these guidelines are the approach to risk classification and treatment.

The AHA/ACC and CCS guidelines make an initial distinction between primary and secondary prevention; the AHA/ACC guidelines also separately provide recommendations for those with diabetes and severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL). In contrast, the ESC guidelines delineate patients from those with established ASCVD to those with low-calculate 10-year risk; however the guideline does make note of primary and secondary prevention in discussions of treatment.

In regard to treatment and nonstatin use, the ESC overall is more aggressive in LDL-C treatment thresholds and recommends LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL for all secondary and very-high-risk primary prevention patients. In contrast, the AHA/ACA guidelines reserve this for very-high-risk secondary prevention patients. Similarly, treating to LDL-C ≤ 70 mg/dL is recommended for a wide group of patients in ESC guidance.

In terms of therapeutic options, the biggest divergence is on the use of PCSK9 inhibitors. These are recommended for secondary and select primary prevention patients in ESC guidelinesalthough it is noteworthy that evidence of benefit in nonsecondary prevention and non-FH patients is lacking although clinical trials are ongoing. In contrast, use is limited in the ACC ECDP to secondary-prevention patients and those with likely FH.

American College of Cardiology Expert Consensus Decision Pathways (ECDPs) role and scope — ECDPs represent a key component of solution sets and are not intended to provide single correct answers to clinical questions; rather, they encourage clinicians to consider a range of important factors as they define treatment plans for their patients, seek to provide unified articulation of clinical practice guidelines, appropriate use criteria, and other related ACC clinical policy, and note that in some cases topics will be addressed in subsequent clinical practice guidelines as the evidence base evolves, whereas in other cases they will serve as stand-alone policy.

ACC nonstatin LDL-C — older adults and hypertriglyceridemia in primary prevention emphasizes that in primary prevention patients aged > 75 years, the patient-clinician discussion should consider the limited adequate RCT data, and if there is persistent hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL), clinicians should refer to the 2021 ACC ECDP on management of hypertriglyceridemia for further evaluation and management.

Conclusions — scope and evidence base for nonstatins: Since the 2018 AHA/ACC/multisociety cholesterol guidelines, several newer nonstatin agents have demonstrated LDL-C–lowering efficacy, received FDA approval, and are commercially available; there are large, ongoing randomized controlled cardiovascular outcomes trials for bempedoic acid and inclisiran, and this expert consensus decision pathway addresses gaps in guidance by building on the 2013 ACC/AHA and 2018 AHA/ACC/multisociety guidelines, with algorithms that endorse the 4 evidence-based patient management groups and assume the patient is currently taking or has attempted to take a statin as the most effective initial therapy.

Treatment recommendations

Future guidelines should harmonize ACC/AHA treatment approaches with those of contemporary international guidelines. For example, the ESC recommendation that secondary prevention patients should target an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL is a more stringent goal than current ACC/AHA guidelines and should be considered. Of note, AHA/ACC guidelines and ACC ECDP rely mainly on randomized controlled trial evidence. The ESC guidelines emphasize randomized controlled trials but take into account the totality of evidence, including nonrandomized trials and epidemiologic studies. Therefore, the more aggressive recommendations are based on data beyond clinical outcome trials. In addition, patients with high plaque burden (CAC ≥ 300) should be treated to a similar LDL-C target. In alignment with ESC and CCS guidelines, PCSK9 inhibitors should be considered in treatment algorithms for high-risk primary prevention patients, not solely for secondary prevention or those with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

There is also merit in considering pharmacotherapy for low- and moderate-risk patients with persistently elevated LDL-C despite lifestyle modification. This recommendation is supported by data from the Cholesterol Lowering in Intermediate-Risk Persons without Cardiovascular Disease (HOPE-3) trialand recent imaging studies demonstrating early, yet reversible, plaque formation in patients with dyslipidemia. The forthcoming PRECAD (Prevent Coronary Artery Disease) trial will provide further insights into this issue.

The 2021 ACC ECDP on the Management of ASCVD Risk Reduction in Patients With Persistent Hypertriglyceridemia should also remain central to future guideline updates, particularly in light of the REDUCE (Cardiovascular Risk Reduction with Icosapent Ethyl for Hypertriglyceridemia) trial results, which were published after the 2018 guidelines. This trial established the benefit of icosapent ethyl, a highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ether derivative, in reducing cardiovascular risk in those with persistent hypertriglyceridemia. However, there has been controversy about the use of a mineral oil placebo in REDUCE-IT, and conflicting data from the STRENGTH (Effect of High-Dose Omega-3 Fatty Acids vs Corn Oil on Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Patients at High Cardiovascular Risk) trial, which used corn oil and a different omega-3 fatty acid preparation. Despite this, the ACC ECDP, ESC, and CCS recommend icosapent ethyl for residual hypertriglyceridemia. In addition, the ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guidelines should offer specific recommendations for managing individuals with elevated Lp(a), in line with recent National Lipid Association guidance, which advocates initiating or intensifying therapy in those with LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL.

Primary prevention — borderline/intermediate ASCVD risk in adults aged 40–75 years without clinical ASCVD or diabetes: Patients with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL and 10-year ASCVD risk of 5% to < 7.5% were judged borderline and initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy may be considered, while those with 7.5% to < 20% are intermediate risk and the guideline recommends that such patients be considered for treatment with a moderate-intensity statin; in borderline or intermediate risk started on moderate-intensity statin, patients are recommended to achieve a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL; inadequate response is defined as < 30% reduction or LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL), for which routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted; if these thresholds are not achieved, the writing committee recommends consideration of escalation to a high-intensity statin.

### Current guidelines on screening, diagnosis and management of dyslipidaemia in childhood: a systematic review [^13a0ea15]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Early identification and treatment of lipid disorders has the potential to improve long-term cardiovascular health in affected individuals. We performed a systematic review of guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and management of dyslipidaemias in children.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, and selected websites for relevant clinical practice recommendations/guidelines, published in English/German from 01.01.2018 to 31.01.2025. We used AGREE II tool to assess guidelines' quality.

Results

Six national guidelines, mainly on familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), were included. Recommendations for universal screening for dyslipidaemias in childhood differed, ranging from the statement of insufficient evidence (n = 1) or negative recommendation of the national screening committee (n = 1) through weak (n = 2) to moderate (n = 1) recommendations to consider population screening. All organizations recommended statins as a first-line drug therapy in children with FH (strong recommendation). Behavioral intervention was mainly strongly recommended as an additional treatment component of FH, and as therapy of choice in childhood obesity related dyslipidaemia. Guidelines applied different systems to categorize certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations. 50% of guidelines scored high (> 70%) for rigor of development.

Conclusions

Current guidelines provide overall consistent recommendations for the management of childhood dyslipidaemias, but show lack of consensus regarding universal screening for early detection of lipid disorders.

Impact

Health behavior counseling is recommended for all children affected with dyslipidaemia. Statins are consistently proposed as a first-line drug therapy in pediatric familial hypercholesterolemia. Recommendations for universal screening for dyslipidaemias in childhood vary. This systematic review provides insights into current recommendations on pediatric lipid disorders, explores potential reasons for discrepancies, and indicates the need for consensus on the optimal strategy for early identification of familial hypercholesterolemia.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^1ceb2cb4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is a major causal factor in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated a dose‐dependent log‐linear relationship between plasma LDL‐C concentrations and risk of ASCVD events; this relationship is replicated in Mendelian randomization studies. In addition to the magnitude of LDL‐C exposure, long‐term exposure to persistently elevated LDL‐C is recognized as a key contributor to a person's ASCVD risk.

Management of LDL‐C levels is central to ASCVD prevention strategies, beginning with the recommendation of a heart‐healthy lifestyle for all individuals. In those at increased ASCVD risk, pharmacologic lipid‐lowering therapy is advocated, with statin therapy recommended as the first‐line agent for both primary and secondary prevention. However, for many high‐risk patients with elevated LDL‐C, individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), and/or those who have limiting statin‐associated adverse effects, nonstatin therapies as part of a multidrug regimen are often needed to achieve LDL‐C thresholds.

Pooled analyses of lipid‐lowering therapies have shown a linear association between achieved LDL‐C levels and absolute coronary heart disease event rates. Every 1.0‐mmol/L (39‐mg/dL) reduction in LDL‐C confers an ≈22% reduction in the risk of major vascular events, with the lower threshold beyond which benefit ceases yet to be defined. Nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapies to assist with LDL‐C reduction are now available. Current American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Multisociety and European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) guidelines recommend the addition of ezetimibe and/or anti‐PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) monoclonal antibodies to statins in individuals who require further LDL‐C lowering according to the level of risk. Since the publication of the most recent guidelines, bempedoic acid, an ATP‐citrate lyase inhibitor, and inclisiran, a small interfering RNA that targets PCSK9 mRNA, have received regulatory approval for LDL‐C lowering in combination with statins, with pending cardiovascular outcome studies in the case of inclisiran. To acknowledge these new nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapies, in 2022, the ACC published an Expert Consensus Decision Pathway (ECDP) statement to provide guidance on their use across various ASCVD risk groups.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) on statin therapy for secondary prevention — initiation and intensity guidance: High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated in adults aged ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD who are not receiving statin therapy, or increased from low or moderate intensity; when high intensity is contraindicated or adverse-effect risk is present, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be used as the second option, if tolerated, with an objective of a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C for moderate intensity and ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for high intensity. For individuals aged > 75 years, evidence supports continuation of statin therapy in those already taking and tolerating it, data support the use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals with clinical ASCVD aged > 75 years, and it is reasonable to consider initiation of high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals aged > 75 years with decisions based on expected benefit and competing comorbidities. Patients with clinical ASCVD are defined from RCT inclusion criteria and subgroups include those at very high risk, those not at very high risk, and those with baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

1.6 Cholesterol/Lipid management

Aggressive lowering of LDL‐C remains a pillar of CCD management. The 2018 AHA/ACC/Multisociety Guideline emphasized an LDL‐C threshold of ≤ 70 mg/dL or lower in individuals at high risk of ASCVD and to consider the use of non‐statin LDL‐C lowering medications. The 2019 ESC/EAS Dyslipidemia Guideline advocated for an even lower threshold LDL‐C of < 55 mg/dL or an LDL‐C lowering > 50%, whichever is lower. In 2022, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Expert Consensus Decision Pathway (ECDP) on the role of non‐statin therapies for LDL‐C lowering in the management of ASCVD risk discussed three Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved non‐statin therapies (bempedoic acid, evinacumab, inclisiran, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies), which were not previously recommended in the 2018 American Heart Association (AHA)/ACC cholesterol guideline.

The ECDP also recommends that for patients at very high risk of ASCVD, or those with ASCVD confirmed to have familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), adding nonstatin therapies if their LDL‐C levels are 55 mg/dL or higher, on a background of high‐intensity statin treatments is recommended. For those with ASCVD who are not considered at very high risk or who have LDL‐C levels over 190 mg/dL without confirmed FH, a higher threshold — over 70 mg/dL for LDL — triggers the addition of nonstatin therapies alongside the maximum tolerated statin treatments. Ezetimibe with or without PCSK9 inhibitor monoclonal antibodies is the recommended first choice for a nonstatin agent if the desired LDL‐C reduction is < 25%; otherwise a monoclonal antibody PCSK9 inhibitor may be preferred.

Figure 2
Overview of Triglyceride Management Adapted From the 2022 Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on the Management of ASCVD Risk Reduction in Patients With Persistent Hypertriglyceridemia

Used with permission of the publisher. ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; TG = triglycerides.

Although this patient's triglycerides are the primary concern, his LDL-C is well below 100 mg/dL, which may reduce the urgency for statin therapy. However, if triglycerides remain elevated and the patient's ASCVD risk increases (ie, a 10-year risk ≥ 5% or a diagnosis of diabetes), statin therapy should be initiated or intensified and would likely provide the greatest benefit for ASCVD risk reduction. In such cases, statins are recommended to target appropriate LDL-C or non-HDL-C thresholds, as they offer protection against both cardiovascular events and further elevations in triglycerides. In the setting of hypertriglyceridemia, LDL-C calculations may be less accurate (especially if the older Friedewald calculation is used), and a more accurate assessment of atherogenic risk may require the usage of non-HDL-C and/or ApoB to help decide on the intensity of lipid lowering. In these cases, it is important to emphasize the role of non-HDL-C and/or ApoB as elevations in either should prompt consideration of statin therapy prior to triglyceride-specific lowering agents such as omega-3 fatty acids or fibrates.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: paradigm shifts in managing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk [^efb5fedd]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults represents a major shift from prior cholesterol management guidelines. The new guidelines include data from individual randomized trials as well as the most comprehensive meta-analyses, and introduce several major paradigm shifts, which include: aiming for ASCVD risk reduction as opposed to targeting LDL-C levels, advocating for the use of evidence-based doses of statins as first line therapy, and utilizing a new risk calculator and risk cut point to guide initiation of statin therapy. These major changes have created controversy and confusion among the medical community, with some clinicians hesitant to embrace the shift. We review the evidence that forms the basis for these major changes, compare them to other major lipid guidelines, and recommend an integrated approach to managing dyslipidemia to decrease atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) management and monitoring — the goal for LDL-C lowering is defined as percentage responses relative to baseline; the expected percent reduction with high-intensity statin therapy is ≥ 50% and should be used to assess clinical efficacy, and a threshold of LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL is useful to determine whether to intensify lipid management; the maximum percentage change occurs within 4 to 12 weeks after initiation of or change in lipid-lowering therapy, and obtaining lipid profiles every 3 to 12 months is associated with improved adherence and identification of those needing intensification; because the Friedewald equation can underestimate LDL-C with elevated triglycerides, other measurement approaches (eg, Martin/Hopkins) may be desirable.

Dyslipidemia therapeutic recommendations — statin initiation, monitoring, targets, and escalation: A high-intensity statin should be started along with therapeutic lifestyle changes to attain ≥ 50% reduction of baseline LDL-C. Lipids should be rechecked within 12 weeks of initiating therapy, and if the LDL-C, or non-HDL-C concentration remains > 70 mg/dL or > 100 mg/dL, respectively, the statin dose should be increased with the goal of lowering LDL-C to < 70 mg/dL and non-HDL-C to < 100 mg/dL. If these targets cannot be achieved with maximally tolerated statin therapy, then these considerations should include a more potent statin or the addition of ezetimibe, and when treatment goals are not met despite these strategies, bempedoic acid, or pharmacotherapy targeting PCSK9 should be considered.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical ASCVD at very high risk on statin therapy for secondary prevention — LDL-C thresholds and nonstatin considerations: Adults with clinical ASCVD at very high risk should be treated first at the maximally tolerated statin intensity. If patients have achieved ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and LDL-C < 55 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 85 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue statin therapy and monitor adherence and LDL-C response. In view of trial evidence and very low LDL-C levels achieved with nonstatin therapies, a lower LDL-C threshold of LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≤ 85 mg/dL) is recommended by the writing committee, and preference should be given to therapies with demonstrated cardiovascular outcomes benefits. Individuals who achieve LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL experience lower event rates than those with higher LDL-C, there appears to be no LDL-C level below which benefit ceases, and lifelong very low LDL-C levels in the range of 15–30 mg/dL are associated with a lower incidence of ASCVD without adverse effects.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

ACC 2022 expert consensus — treatment thresholds and statin efficacy indicators: The writing committee endorsed the evidence-based findings regarding indicators of efficacy, including ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for high-intensity statin therapy doses and 30% to 49% reduction for moderate-intensity doses. It judged it appropriate to continue to provide levels of LDL-C or "thresholds", in terms of both percentage LDL-C reduction from baseline and absolute on-treatment LDL-C measurement, which, if not achieved by adherent patients, would serve as factors to consider in decision-making regarding further therapy. Throughout this guidance, absolute LDL-C levels are considered as "thresholds" for considering the addition of nonstatin therapies, and not LDL-C goals, and these are not firm triggers for adding medication but are factors that may be considered within the broader context of an individual patient's clinical situation.

### A critical appraisal of lipid management in the post-statin era: comparison on guidelines, therapeutic targets, and screening in a case-based framework of lipid management [^872e3368]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

This review discusses current options for LLT and summarizes recent major guidelines for lipid management. Furthermore, it seeks to close the divide between evidence-based guidelines and the complex scenarios often encountered in everyday clinical practice, providing actionable guidance for evaluation and management of ASCVD risk. By interpreting current recommendations and emphasizing the role of newer therapies, this work aims to equip clinicians with the knowledge necessary to make personalized, informed treatment decisions to optimize patient outcomes (Central Illustration).

Central Illustration
Comprehensive Evaluation of Cardiovascular Risk and Management of Hyperlipidemia

The treatment of dyslipidemia starts with a clinician patient discussion to assess goals, potential, and options. The cornerstone of risk assessment is the use of clinically available risk-estimation calculators. Risk should further be personalized based on actors such as lipids, hypertension, diabetes, family history, and past medical history as well as imaging for subclinical atherosclerosis. Treatment begins with lifestyle modifications, and the degree of LDL-C lowering should be tailored to the risk of the patient with low LDL-C treatment thresholds for higher-risk patients. Statins remain the foundation of lipid-lowering therapy with additional medications added as needed based on achieved LDL-C levels, treatment goals, and adverse effects. Reassessment of therapy should be an ongoing process as should risk assessment and clinician patient discussions.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: what was done well and what could be done better [^d6e129d4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Five years after convening the expert panel, the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was released. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued the guideline on the basis of a systematic review of cholesterol treatment trials performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This report critically appraises the guideline and provides our view of what was done well and what could be done better. In particular, we propose that the guideline succeeds in prioritizing statin therapy, expanding the focus to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including stroke), and emphasizing absolute cardiovascular risk to determine eligibility for statin therapy. We contend that the guideline could be enhanced by refining the use of lipid goals rather than removing them, enhancing guidance on evaluation of cholesterol, and broadening the concept of age underpinning risk-based decision making to include vascular and physiological age. We further suggest that the next guideline panel could comprehensively review current best evidence, build on existing guidelines, and cultivate broader national and international consensus. Overall, we aim to continue discussions about the important contributions and shortfalls of the guideline and create momentum for effective implementation and timely updates.

### Lipids and CVD management: towards a global consensus [^f65a5e3d]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is currently the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and its incidence is likely to increase. Multiple risk factors contribute to CVD. Elevated LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels, low HDL-cholesterol levels, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and smoking are key modifiable risk factors. Such risk factors are present in 80–90% of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. For many factors, modification can significantly reduce CVD incidence. For example, statin-induced LDL-C reductions reduce cardiovascular events by 24–37% and smoking cessation reduces CHD mortality by 36%. The need to identify and treat these risk factors has led many national and local groups to develop clinical practice guidelines for management of CVD. Although the aim of such guidelines is to provide practitioners with a framework to identify, prioritize, and manage patients, the plethora of guidelines can cause confusion. In addition, research indicates that guidelines are not being optimally implemented. This review considers these practical issues, highlights the common goals shared by many guidelines, and focuses on how these can be best achieved. It also highlights areas where the guidelines differ and discusses points to consider when selecting the most appropriate recommendation.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to patients with ASCVD (chronic coronary syndrome), ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate moderate-intensity statin therapy with the aim of achieving a 30–49% reduction in LDL-C levels to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events if high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^96000a0d]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

AACE 2023 type 2 diabetes lipid management — intensification and hypertriglyceridemia thresholds — advises that in persons with T2D, additional laboratory testing of lipid levels should be undertaken at frequent intervals (every 6–12 weeks) to direct titration of the statin or addition of an adjunct therapy, with less frequent testing once goals are consistently achieved. If lipid targets cannot be achieved with maximally tolerated statin therapy, the addition of the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe (10 mg/day) should be considered; if goals are still not met, a bile sequestrant (colesevelam, colestipol, cholestyramine) or bempedoic acid is an option, and in extreme risk patients there may be a need for more aggressive therapy with a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) or inclisiran. Management of hypertriglyceridemia is important with a goal of < 150 mg/dL in persons with T2D, and for severe hypertriglyceridemia (TG levels ≥ 500 mg/dL) a very low-fat diet may be required in addition to a fibrate and/or prescription omega-3 fatty acid; for refractory cases, if fasting TG level remains > 1000 mg/dL, niacin may be needed to lower TG levels and reduce the risk of pancreatitis, although niacin does not reduce ASCVD and can worsen glycemia, and over-the-counter fish oil supplements are not approved by the FDA for hypertriglyceridemia.

### Lipid association of India 2023 update on cardiovascular risk assessment and lipid management in Indian patients: consensus statement IV [^a24e60ef]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

In 2016, the Lipid Association of India (LAI) developed a cardiovascular risk assessment algorithm and defined low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in Indians. The recent refinements in the role of various risk factors and subclinical atherosclerosis in prediction of ASCVD risk necessitated updating the risk algorithm and treatment goals.

Methods

The LAI core committee held twenty-one meetings and webinars from June 2022 to July 2023 with experts across India and critically reviewed the latest evidence regarding the strategies for ASCVD risk prediction and the benefits and modalities for intensive lipid lowering. Based on the expert consensus and extensive review of published data, consensus statement IV was commissioned.

Results

The young age of onset and a more aggressive nature of ASCVD in Indians necessitates emphasis on lifetime ASCVD risk instead of the conventional 10-year risk. It also demands early institution of aggressive preventive measures to protect the young population prior to development of ASCVD events. Wide availability and low cost of statins in India enable implementation of effective LDL-C-lowering therapy in individuals at high risk of ASCVD. Subjects with any evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis are likely to benefit the most from early aggressive interventions.

Conclusions

This document presents the updated risk stratification and treatment algorithm and describes the rationale for each modification. The intent of these updated recommendations is to modernize management of dyslipidemia in Indian patients with the goal of reducing the epidemic of ASCVD among Indians in Asia and worldwide.

### A mechanism-based operational definition and classification of hypercholesterolemia [^8be94bff]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). Medium credibility.

In contrast to strong evidence-based clinical recommendations for lipid-lowering treatment, there is no analogous definitive diagnostic definition of hypercholesterolemia and its various subtypes. For many clinicians, guideline indications for hypolipidemic treatment can become broadly conflated with hypercholesterolemia in a non-specific sense. In this statement, we propose a unified definition and mechanism-based classification of hypercholesterolemia, which in turn should help to stratify patients and guide efficient diagnosis without interfering with the current strategies of ASCVD risk reduction.

### Review of clinical practice guidelines for the management of LDL-related risk [^5bef850b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Managing risk related to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is vital in therapy for patients at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events given its important etiologic role in atherogenesis. Despite decades of research showing reduction of ASCVD risk with multiple approaches to lowering of LDL cholesterol, there continue to be significant gaps in care with inadequate numbers of patients receiving standard of care lipid-lowering therapy. Confusion regarding implementation of the multiple published clinical practice guidelines has been identified as one contributor to suboptimal management of LDL-related risk. This review summarizes the current guidelines for reduction of LDL-related cardiovascular risk provided by a number of major professional societies, which have broad applicability to diverse populations worldwide. Statements have varied in the process and methodology of development of recommendations, the grading system for level and strength of evidence, the inclusion or exclusion of expert opinion, the suggested ASCVD risk assessment tool, the lipoproteins recommended for risk assessment, and the lipoprotein targets of therapy. The similarities and differences among important guidelines in the United States and internationally are discussed, with recommendations for future strategies to improve consistency in approaches to LDL-related ASCVD risk and to reduce gaps in implementation of evidence-based therapies.

Inclisiran — an siRNA targeting PCSK9 for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering in adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy — has labeled dosing of 284 mg subcutaneous (SC) on day 1, day 90, and then every 6 months by a clinician, with mean LDL-C reduction per prescribing information of 48%-52%. The label lists no contraindications and no drug–drug interactions; adverse effects include injection site reaction, arthralgia, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, bronchitis, pain in extremities, and dyspnea. Use during pregnancy/lactation states no safety data in humans; avoid use. Cardiovascular outcomes trials are not yet completed, with ORION-4 estimated to complete in 2026 and VICTORION-2P estimated to complete in 2027; other considerations include robust LDL-C reduction, cost, requirement for SC administration by a clinician, and prior authorization.

### Practice-guidelines-lipid-management.pdf… [^561fd35e]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Using an interactive, online, shared decision-making tool should be considered when counseling patients.
- For patients without CVD, nonfasting lipid testing is recommended only every 5 to 10 years because levels vary minimally over 1 year.
- Nonstatin medications as monotherapy or combined with statins are not recommended for primary prevention.
- In adults older than 75 years, lipid testing or cardiovascular risk calculations should not be performed and statins should not be routinely started for primary prevention. From the AFP Editors. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally, and lipid level testing is one aspect of screening to assess risk. Options for testing and treatment have grown complex as more tests and lipid-lowering agents become available. The Canadian PEER group for primary care released guidelines for preventing and managing CVD through lipid management.

Acknowledging the many competing demands on family physicians, the guideline considers the "time needed to treat, " meaning the time clinicians spend implementing recommendations. The guideline is summarized in a two-page reference and a free online tool can facilitate shared decision-making conversations about risks and interventions. SubscribeFrom $180

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the role of nonstatin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^bf6de20a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) not at very high risk on statin therapy for secondary prevention — treatment targets and next steps: The writing committee considered a desirable response to therapy as having achieved ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL). Meta-analysis in this patient population has shown a 22% proportional risk reduction for major vascular events for each 38-mg/dL (1-mmol/L) reduction in LDL-C, and this is true even if baseline LDL is < 77 mg/dL (2 mmol/L). After achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline, further reductions in LDL-C should be discussed with the patient if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL. If patients who are not at very high risk have a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue statin therapy and continue to monitor adherence to medications and lifestyle modifications and ongoing LDL-C response to therapy. If a patient has a less-than-anticipated response (< 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL or non–HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL), routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted; if LDL-C lowering remains inadequate, the patient and clinician should enter a discussion focused on shared decision-making regarding the addition of a nonstatin medication to the current regimen, and if no additional medication is chosen, it is reasonable to continue current therapy with ongoing monitoring. Although there is a gap in RCT evidence in this group, the writing committee supports consideration of adding ezetimibe 10 mg daily as the initial nonstatin agent, given the benefits on ASCVD outcomes and demonstrated safety of ezetimibe in patients with ACS treated with ezetimibe plus simvastatin versus simvastatin monotherapy.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

ACC 2022 expert consensus — LDL-C measurement methods, alternatives, and monitoring: The writing committee endorses use of the Friedewald equation, given that the majority of RCTs used this method and that it is the most widely available means in clinical practice, while acknowledging that there can be significant discrepancies in levels of directly measured versus calculated LDL-C within the same sample, especially at lower LDL-C levels. Newer methods should be considered by health systems and laboratories whenever possible, and the use of the Martin-Hopkins method provides a more accurate assessment of LDL-C in individuals with very low levels of LDL-C or with hypertriglyceridemia; a new method proposed by investigators at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute may also be more precise, but additional validation is needed. If therapy is adjusted, the writing committee emphasizes the importance of monitoring the LDL-C response within 4 to 12 weeks, and the algorithms include use of non-HDL-C thresholds as an additional alternative for decision-making.

### Cholesterol treatment guidelines update [^04f4afe9]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Hypercholesterolemia is one of the major contributors to atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease in our society. The National Cholesterol Education Program of the National Institutes of Health has created a set of guidelines that standardize the clinical assessment and management of hypercholesterolemia for practicing physicians and other professionals in the medical community. In May 2001, the National Cholesterol Education Program released its third set of guidelines, reflecting changes in cholesterol management since their previous report in 1993. In addition to modifying current strategies of risk assessment, the new guidelines stress the importance of an aggressive therapeutic approach in the management of hypercholesterolemia. The major risk factors that modify low-density lipoprotein goals include age, smoking status, hypertension, high-density lipoprotein levels, and family history. The concept of "CHD equivalent" is introduced-conditions requiring the same vigilance used in patients with coronary heart disease. Patients with diabetes and those with a 10-year cardiac event risk of 20 percent or greater are considered CHD equivalents. Once low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is at an accepted level, physicians are advised to address the metabolic syndrome and hypertriglyceridemia.

Diabetes aged 40–75 years — statin response targets and nonstatin discussion: For patients aged 40–75 years with diabetes who have elevated 10-year ASCVD risk and high-risk features or diabetes-specific risk enhancers, use of high-intensity statin therapy (anticipated LDL-C reduction ≥ 50%) is supported. If response is achieved with ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue current therapy and monitor. If high-intensity statin therapy results in < 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL), the clinician and patient should enter a discussion focused on shared decision-making regarding the addition of a nonstatin medication, and if no additional medication is pursued, it is reasonable to continue current therapy and monitoring.

### Dyslipidemia: management using optimal lipid-lowering therapy [^3863e47a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate current approaches and explore emerging research related to dyslipidemia management.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (2004-April 2012) was searched for randomized controlled trials using the terms dyslipidemia and lipid-lowering therapy or statin (> 1000 hits). Separate searches (MEDLINE, Google) identified meta-analyses (2010–2011), disease prevalence statistics, and current consensus guidelines (2004-July 2011). Additional references were identified from the publications reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language articles on large multicenter trials were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines for the reduction of cardiovascular risk recommend the attainment of specific low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) target values, based on an individual's 10-year risk of coronary heart disease or global risk. For most patients unable to achieve recommended lipid level goals with therapeutic lifestyle changes, statins are the first option for treatment. Results of large, well-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that statins are effective in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in diverse populations, including patients with diabetes and the elderly, and that intensive statin therapy provides more effective lipid goal attainment and significantly greater risk reduction in patients with coronary artery disease. Statin therapy is generally well tolerated but may increase the risk of myopathy. Statin use has been associated with increases in hepatic transaminases and an increased risk of diabetes, although the absolute risk of diabetes is low compared with the risk reduction benefit. Combination therapy including a statin may be appropriate for certain populations, but the risk reduction benefits of combination therapy remain unclear. Ezetimibe is an important treatment option for patients with hypercholesterolemia who do not tolerate intensive statin therapy. Although fibrates or niacin improves overall lipid profiles in patients with hypertriglyceridemia or dyslipidemia who are receiving statin therapy, their efficacy in reducing cardiovascular risk remains questionable and their use raises safety and tolerability concerns.

Conclusions

Intensifying lifestyle changes and statin dose should be utilized first in patients not achieving their LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^26480d9e]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

The leadership of the National Lipid Association convened an Expert Panel to develop a consensus set of recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia in clinical medicine. An Executive Summary of those recommendations was previously published. This document provides support for the recommendations outlined in the Executive Summary. The major conclusions include (1) an elevated level of cholesterol carried by circulating apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], termed atherogenic cholesterol) is a root cause of atherosclerosis, the key underlying process contributing to most clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events; (2) reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol will lower ASCVD risk in proportion to the extent that atherogenic cholesterol is reduced. This benefit is presumed to result from atherogenic cholesterol lowering through multiple modalities, including lifestyle and drug therapies; (3) the intensity of risk-reduction therapy should generally be adjusted to the patient's absolute risk for an ASCVD event; (4) atherosclerosis is a process that often begins early in life and progresses for decades before resulting a clinical ASCVD event. Therefore, both intermediate-term and long-term or lifetime risk should be considered when assessing the potential benefits and hazards of risk-reduction therapies; (5) for patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk; (6) nonlipid ASCVD risk factors should also be managed appropriately, particularly high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus; and (7) the measurement and monitoring of atherogenic cholesterol levels remain an important part of a comprehensive ASCVD prevention strategy.

### 2023 update on European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement on homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: new treatments and clinical guidance [^6ca3e52f]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

This 2023 statement updates clinical guidance for homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH), explains the genetic complexity, and provides pragmatic recommendations to address inequities in HoFH care worldwide. Key strengths include updated criteria for the clinical diagnosis of HoFH and the recommendation to prioritize phenotypic features over genotype. Thus, a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) > 10 mmol/L (> 400 mg/dL) is suggestive of HoFH and warrants further evaluation. The statement also provides state-of-the art discussion and guidance to clinicians for interpreting the results of genetic testing and for family planning and pregnancy. Therapeutic decisions are based on the LDL-C level. Combination LDL-C-lowering therapy-both pharmacologic intervention and lipoprotein apheresis (LA)-is foundational. Addition of novel, efficacious therapies (i.e. inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, followed by evinacumab and/or lomitapide) offers potential to attain LDL-C goal or reduce the need for LA. To improve HoFH care around the world, the statement recommends the creation of national screening programmes, education to improve awareness, and management guidelines that account for the local realities of care, including access to specialist centres, treatments, and cost. This updated statement provides guidance that is crucial to early diagnosis, better care, and improved cardiovascular health for patients with HoFH worldwide.

### Achievement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol thresholds in very high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^55e0947e]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2022 American College of Cardiology Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on the Role of Nonstatin Therapies recommended more aggressive management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) compared to the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Multisociety Guideline. In congruence with European guidelines, a target LDL-C threshold of 55 mg/dL is recommended for patients with very high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Real-world status of the early implementation of this recommendation remains uncertain.

Objective

To determine the proportion of patients with very high-risk ASCVD achieving an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL and characterize differences between patients who did and did not achieve this LDL-C value.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study evaluated patients between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2023, who were ≥ 18 years old with very high-risk ASCVD from the University of Colorado Health system primary care practices. Very high-risk ASCVD was defined as a history of a major ASCVD event with at least 2 high-risk conditions.

Results

A total of 8974 patients met inclusion criteria for very high-risk ASCVD. Of these, only 21.0% achieved an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL, while 39.5% of patients achieved the previously recommended LDL-C threshold of < 70 mg/dL. More than half of patients were prescribed a high-intensity statin-based regimen.

Conclusion

Within a large, academic health-system, achievement of LDL-C threshold among patients with very high-risk ASCVD was low. Recommendations from the 2022 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway that endorse more aggressive LDL-C lowering and emphasize nonstatin therapies as an adjunct to statins are not fully implemented in real-world clinical practice.

### Cholesterol guidelines: more similar than different [^077f984c]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

A clinician has a large number of guidelines to follow. Searching the words "cardiovascular" and "guideline" on the website, www.guideline.gov yielded 502 cardiovascular guidelines, 40 alone in 2015. 1 [National Guideline Clearinghouse: Agency for Healthcare Research and 19 Quality (n.d.)] Similarly, searching the words "cholesterol" and "guideline" yielded 107 results, 6 alone in 2015. This information overload can decrease providers' self-efficacy in using guidelines, particularly if they have inconsistent messages. Moreover, a busy provider can easily be lost if the emphasis is on highlighting differences rather than similarities on the same topic. There are several guidelines for management of blood cholesterol and lipids. Despite being more similar than different, their similarities have not received as much attention as the differences between them. Unfortunately, there are still major gaps in current clinical practice even across these common themes. In this review, we will provide a brief overview of various cholesterol/lipid guidelines followed by a discussion of the differences but more importantly, similarities between them.

### 2021 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the management of ASCVD risk reduction in patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^593b06f6]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Dietary modifications and effects on triglycerides — clearance threshold and individualized intervention: Clearance of triglycerides from plasma is saturable when plasma triglyceride levels exceed approximately 500 to 700 mg/dL and further input of chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) into plasma cannot readily be removed, leading to marked hypertriglyceridemia and chylomicronemia, even after an overnight fast. Dietary recommendations should be individualized based on fasting triglyceride levels as well as the risk of pancreatitis, with increasing limitation of added sugars, total fat, and alcohol intake for individuals with more severe elevations of triglycerides and chylomicrons as well as for those at high risk for pancreatitis. In patients with elevated triglycerides, an individualized lifestyle intervention (the percent of calories from fat varied) produced a 48% reduction (interquartile range: −73 to −23; P < 0.0001) in triglyceride levels regardless of the patient's lipid-lowering medications.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to patients with ASCVD (chronic coronary syndrome), ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate high-intensity statin therapy with the aim of achieving ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C levels to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary disease.

### Cholesterol levels and cardiovascular outcomes following statin initiation for primary prevention: a cohort study [^3434cc43]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

American dyslipidemia guidelines discuss the atherogenic potential of non-HDL-C but do not incorporate non-HDL-C treatment thresholds for primary prevention, instead focusing on percent LDL-C lowering(though the 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for nonstatin therapies includes non-HDL-C thresholds). Although primary prevention risk calculators (eg, 2013 American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association Pooled Risk, 2024 Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Events [PREVENT]), incorporate non-HDL-C levels indirectly by including total cholesterol and HDL-C, none require explicit knowledge or reflection on inputting a non-HDL result into the calculator to estimate risk. As a result, to most clinicians in routine practice, the importance of non-HDL levels in risk estimates may remain unclear. European and Canadian clinical practice guidelines incorporate non-HDL-C thresholds for intensification into their treatment algorithms, along with LDL-C thresholds. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society's (CCS) 2021 dyslipidemia guideline suggests that in primary prevention, a person with intermediate CV risk should be offered a statin when LDL-C is ≥ 135 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L) or non-HDL-C ≥ 162 mg/dL (4.2 mmol/L). If a statin is initiated and LDL-C remains ≥ 77 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L) or non-HDL-C > 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L), dose adjustment or add-on therapy could then be considered. In the European Society of Cardiology guidelines, non-HDL-C is a secondary lipid target particularly in persons with diabetes or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Examining the association between non-HDL-C and LDL-C levels following statin initiation and CV risk can help elucidate the real-world implications of guideline recommendations that include non-HDL-C. We hypothesize that there is residual risk associated with achieved LDL-C below guideline-directed thresholds for intensification in the setting of non-HDL-C above recommended thresholds. Therefore, we sought to examine patterns of LDL-C and non-HDL-C lipid levels after statin initiation for primary prevention and their association with CV outcomes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Guidelines for the management of blood cholesterol were updated in the past year in the United States and Europe, reflecting a more aggressive approach to lowering low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C). 1, 2 The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) task force on practice guideline released the 2018 guideline on the management of blood cholesterol on behalf of several American societies. 1 Approximately 9 months later, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society published their 2019 guideline for the management of dyslipidemias: lipid modification to reduce cardiovascular risk. 2 The main document for the US guideline consists of 69 pages (bibliography and appendix not included), 282 references including those presented in the supplemental materials and 72 recommendations, including 29 of class I (40.3%), 25 of class IIa (34.7%), 15 of class IIb (20.9%), and 3 of class III (4.2%). 1 The US guidelines was based on an independent systematic evidence review. The main document for the European guideline was slightly shorter (59 pages) with more references (608) and a similar number of recommendations (69), including 36 of class I (52.2%), 18 of class IIa (26.1%), 10 of class IIb (14.5%), and 5 of class III (7.2%). 2

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 190 mg/dL not due to secondary causes without clinical or genetic diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia, on statin therapy for secondary prevention, follow a pathway that uses the threshold ' ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C < 100 mg/dL) on maximally-tolerated statin therapy'; if met, the figure states 'Decision for no additional medication' and to 'Monitor adherence to lifestyle modifications, medications, and LDL-C response to therapy; if persistent hypertriglyceridemia, refer to the 2021 ACC ECDP on Management of Hypertriglyceridemia'. If the threshold is not met, listed steps are '1. Evaluate and optimize lifestyle modifications, adherence to guideline-recommended statin therapy, risk factor control, and SASEs', '2. Increase to high-intensity statin therapy, if not already taking', and '3. Consider referral to lipid specialist and RD/RDN for all patients, especially for HoFH'. If still not at the threshold, the algorithm states 'Consider the following as the initial nonstatin agent and addition of other agents as needed to achieve desired reduction of LDL-C': 'Consider ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 mAb', 'May consider bempedoic acid or inclisiran', and 'May consider LDL apheresis under care of lipid specialist'; if the threshold remains unmet, it lists '1. Referral to lipid specialist 2. Referral to RD/RDN'.

ACC 2022 expert consensus — non-HDL-C and apoB indicators: Non-HDL-C represents the combination of LDL-C and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) and represents all potentially atherogenic particles, and the main protein embedded in LDL and VLDL is apolipoprotein B (apoB) which, like non-HDL-C, is a stronger indicator of atherogenicity than LDL-C alone.

### The 2018 AHA / ACC / multi-society cholesterol guidelines: looking at past, present and future [^23104331]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The authors review more than three decades of progress in providing clinicians and patients with guidance on risk assessment, patient evaluation and cholesterol management. Beginning with the National Cholesterol Education Program's Initial Adult Treatment Panel report, the cholesterol guidelines increasingly reflect the progress made in understanding the benefits of improved lifestyle and nutrition to improve lipid profiles, major risk factors and reduce ASCVD risk. Moreover, they now provide qualitative and quantitative assessment tools to guide appropriate risk reduction LDL-C lowering therapy. Use of the Pooled Cohort Equations to determine Low, Borderline, Intermediate and High 10-year ASCVD risk is now joined by recognition of conditions and biomarkers that enhance ASCVD risk. This personalizes the risk discussion for the patient. An important addition is the selective use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring to reclassify risk in patients at borderline or intermediate risk, but for whom a risk decision regarding statin therapy is uncertain. In secondary prevention, current guidelines provide criteria for determining a "very high" risk group in whom risk is especially high and in whom aggressive LDL-C lowering can be shown to provide increased absolute benefit. Current guidelines provide a comprehensive look at children and adolescents, young adults, elderly, women and issues specific to women through the life course. They provide guidance for those adults at risk due to severe hypercholesterolemia, persistent hypertriglyceridemia after secondary causes have been addressed, those with inflammatory disorders and HIV, those adults with chronic kidney disease, and those affected by issues of race/ethnicity. They conclude with a brief summary of recommendations emphasizing important concepts for providing safety with LDL-C lowering therapy. This combination of best external evidence and clinical expertise from the expert panel should provide a solid foundation for lipid management of patients at risk for or with clinical ASCVD.

### US public health gains from improved treatment of hypercholesterolemia: a simulation study of NHANES adults treated to guideline-directed therapy [^19ff4a25]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance

Hypercholesterolemia is widely undertreated.

Objective

To project anticipated improvements in treatment and outcomes under full implementation of US and European pharmacologic treatment recommendations.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The study sample included a total of 4980 adults aged 40–75 years from the 2013 through March 2020 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We estimated the number of individuals eligible to receive versus currently receiving lipid lowering therapy (LLT) after applying: (1) the AHA/ACC guideline ("2018 US guideline"); (2) the ESC/EAS guideline ("2019 EU guideline"); and (3) the ACC expert decision pathway ("2022 US pathway").

Main Outcomes and Measures

(1) Number of individuals eligible for LLT; and (2) expected reduction in LDL-C and major cardiovascular events.

Results

The study sample represented 131 million US adults. A total of 23% of the NHANES primary prevention cohort was currently using LLT compared to the 2018 US guideline/2022 US pathway (47% eligible) and the 2019 EU guideline (87% eligible). LLT use was significantly lower than the proportion of eligible patients for all therapies, including statins (66% use vs. 100% eligibility), ezetimibe (4% vs. 31–74% eligibility under the various recommendations) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) (0% vs. 11–53% eligibility). The additional overall median LDL-C reduction expected under fully guideline concordant care was 37.2 (IQR 6.7–57.6) mg/dL, 48.5 (IQR 33.0–69.9) mg/dL, and 46.8 (IQR 7.2–67.6) mg/dL based on the 2018 US guideline, 2019 EU guideline and the 2022 US pathway, respectively. These reductions in LDL-C could yield a 21–27% relative reduction in risk of major cardiovascular events.

Conclusions and Relevance

Aligning treatment of hypercholesterolemia with US and European guidelines would generate major clinical and public health gains.

### Waiting for the national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel IV guidelines, and in the meantime, some challenges and recommendations [^82f7b96a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) has provided education and guidance for decades on the management of hypercholesterolemia. Its third report (ATP III) was published 10 years ago, with a white paper update in 2004. There is a need for translation of more recent evidence into a revised guideline. To help address the significant challenges facing the ATP IV writing group, this statement aims to provide balanced recommendations that build on ATP III. The authors aim for simplicity to increase the likelihood of implementation in clinical practice. To move from ATP III to ATP IV, the authors recommend the following: (1) assess risk more accurately, (2) simplify the starting algorithm, (3) prioritize statin therapy, (4) relax the follow-up interval for repeat lipid testing, (5) designate < 70 mg/dl as an "ideal" low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target, (6) endorse targets beyond low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, (7) refine therapeutic target levels to the equivalent population percentile, (8) remove misleading descriptors such as "borderline high", and (9) make lifestyle messages simpler. In conclusion, the solutions offered in this statement represent ways to translate the totality of published reports into enhanced hyperlipidemia guidelines to better combat the devastating impact of hyperlipidemia on cardiovascular health.

### Detection and management of hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular… [^6a6709a7]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality across all racial and ethnic populations in the United States. 1, 2 Hyperlipidemia is a significant risk factor for the development of CVD. 3 Early detection and effective management of hyperlipidemia and CVD risk are critical to reduce the likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. This supplement provides practical, evidence-based guidance that can help family physicians adopt a team-based, equitable care approach to address hyperlipidemia and primary CVD prevention and significantly improve their patients' cardiovascular outcomes. CVD Risk Assessment Family physicians should consider risk factors such as age, family history, tobacco use, hypertension, diabetes and obesity when assessing a patient's risk for hyperlipidemia.

Current guidelines recommend using an estimate of the patient's 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease as a starting point for clinician-patient conversations about risk-reducing strategies. 7 This can obscure the impact of factors like social determinants of health and systemic racism, and it can exacerbate racial health disparities. Management Strategies for Hyperlipidemia LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS Lifestyle modification is the cornerstone of hyperlipidemia management. 4, 8 Patients should be encouraged to adopt a heart-healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains, engage in regular physical activity and maintain a healthy weight. Family physicians should also talk to their patients about the importance of quitting smoking and limiting alcohol consumption. Lifestyle interventions are crucial for reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and overall cardiovascular risk. 4, 9.

MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP Monitoring lipid levels can help family physicians evaluate the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions and pharmacotherapy and ensure patient adherence to prescribed therapies. 8, 12 Appropriate follow-up visits should be scheduled to adjust the treatment plan if needed and address any new barriers to medication adherence.
13. Team-Based Approach to Care A team-based approach to care is vital for detecting and managing hyperlipidemia and CVD risk. 4 By fostering clear, regular communication and strong collaboration among multidisciplinary care team members, family physicians can facilitate cohesive, patient-centered care that optimizes outcomes.

Care teams can streamline health care delivery and ensure patients receive timely interventions by using electronic health records and clinical decision support tools to incorporate hyperlipidemia and CVD risk detection and management protocols into their workflow.

ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway — clinical ASCVD with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and very high LDL-C thresholds: Patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 190 mg/dL with a clinical diagnosis or genetic confirmation of FH may be at very high risk, and intensification of therapy and the addition of nonstatin therapies should be considered if there is < 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 55 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statin therapy. Specialized therapies, such as evinacumab or lomitapide, may be needed to control LDL-C in homozygous FH with inadequate response to statins with or without ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, and LDL apheresis may be indicated in patients with clinical ASCVD and heterozygous or homozygous FH who have an inadequate response to statins with or without ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors; in the opinion of the writing committee, these therapies are best administered under the care of a lipid specialist. Separately, clinical ASCVD with persistent elevation of LDL-C ≥ 200 mg/dL without a clinical or genetic diagnosis of FH may be candidates for LDL apheresis under the care of a lipid specialist. Percent LDL-C and absolute LDL-C and non–HDL-C reductions should be the primary treatment targets for patients with clinical ASCVD and baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

### Comparing eligibility for statin therapy for primary prevention under 2022 USPSTF recommendations and the 2018 AHA / ACC / multi-society guideline recommendations: from national health and nutrition examination survey [^baa981da]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The United States Preventive Services Taskforce (USPSTF) recently released recommendations for statin therapy eligibility for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We report the proportion and the absolute number of US adults who would be eligible for statin therapy under these recommendations and compare them with the previously published 2018 American Heart Association (AHA)/ American College of Cardiology (ACC)/ Multisociety (MS) Cholesterol guidelines.

Methods

We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017–2020 of adults aged 40–75 years without prevalent self-reported atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol < 190 mg/dL. The 2022 USPSTF recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with a 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥ 10% and ≥ 1 CVD risk factor (diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, or smoking). The 2018 AHA/ ACC/ MS Cholesterol guideline recommends considering statin therapy for primary prevention for those with diabetes mellitus, or 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 20% or 10-year ASCVD risk 7.5 to < 20% after accounting for risk-enhancers and shared decision making. Survey recommended weights were used to project these proportions to national estimates.

Results

Among 1799 participants eligible for this study, the weighted mean age was 56.0 ± 0.5 years, with 53.0% women (95% confidence interval [CI] 49.7, 56.3), and 10.6% self-reported NH Black individuals (95% CI 7.7, 14.3). The weighted mean 10-year ASCVD risk was 9.6 ± 0.3%. The 2022 USPSTF recommendations and the 2018 AHA/ ACC/ MS Cholesterol guidelines indicated eligibility for statin therapy in 31.8% (95% CI 28.6, 35.1) and 46.8% (95% CI 43.0, 50.5) adults, respectively. These represent 33.7 million (95% CI 30.4, 37.2) and 49.7 million (95% CI 45.7, 53.7) adults, respectively. For those with diabetes mellitus, 2022 USPSTF recommended statin therapy in 63.0% (95% CI 52.1, 72.7) adults as compared with all adults with diabetes aged 40–75 years under the 2018 AHA/ ACC/ MS Cholesterol guidelines.

Conclusion

In this analysis of the nationally representative US population from 2017 to 2020, approximately 15% (~16.0 million) fewer adults were eligible for statin therapy for primary prevention under the 2022 USPSTF recommendations as compared to the 2018 AHA/ ACC/ MS Cholesterol guideline.
