## Question

There is a large heterogeneous mass lesion in the left adnexal region. It measures approximately 10 x 9.5 x 7 cm in size. The mass shows mixed solid and cystic components. There is heterogeneous post contrast enhancement of solid components. An area of T1 hyperintensity noted within the lesion may suggest either a haemorrhagic component or haematosalpinx. Areas of diffusion restriction are also seen within the mass. The left ovary is not seen separate from mass. The mass extends behind the uterus crossing the mid line almost up to the border of right ovary which appears slightly bulky. The mass closely abuts the anterior rectal wall with indistinct fat planes at one place. Also the mass appears closely adherent to posterior wall of cervix. Few subcentimetre left internal iliac lymph nodes are seen. There is minimal free fluid in the pelvis. Uterus shows multiple intramural fibroids, largest posterior wall fibroid measures 2.0 x 1.8 cm. Endometrium appears normal.
Elevated ca 125 and ca 15–3

Based on this answer the following
Will this be respectable? What complications could happen?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a large, complex left adnexal mass with concerning imaging features and elevated CA-125/CA 15–3 is likely resectable, and what complications to anticipate during and after surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pretest probability of malignancy and how the imaging and tumor markers inform that. Then, I should verify the anatomic extent and whether complete cytoreduction appears technically feasible. Next, I will review guideline-based criteria for resectability in advanced ovarian cancer. After that, I need to outline the likely surgical plan and the major complication risks, including bowel, urinary, infectious, thromboembolic, and long-term functional sequelae. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and note any uncertainties that could change management, such as the need for neoadjuvant chemotherapy or alternative approaches [^116haNy5] [^114Ym4rX].

> Let me first confirm the malignancy risk signals. A 10 cm heterogeneous solid–cystic adnexal mass with enhancing solid components, diffusion restriction, obliteration of fat planes with the rectum and cervix, and elevated CA-125 and CA 15–3 strongly raises concern for epithelial ovarian cancer and advanced-stage disease; diffusion restriction in solid components and loss of a separate ovarian contour further increase suspicion for malignancy, and the size alone exceeds thresholds commonly associated with higher malignancy risk on MRI and ultrasound criteria, so I should not undercall this as benign or borderline without histology [^112x62tV] [^115C2xmi] [^112JNCHU].

> Wait, let me verify the anatomic extent and what that implies for resectability. The mass abuts the anterior rectal wall with indistinct fat planes and is adherent to the posterior cervix, suggesting potential infiltration or dense adhesions; it extends across the midline toward the right ovary, which is bulky, raising concern for contralateral involvement; there are small internal iliac nodes and minimal free fluid, which could represent early peritoneal disease; these features are compatible with stage IIIC disease if confined to the pelvis with retroperitoneal nodes, but I should confirm whether there is upper abdominal disease on imaging before final staging, as that would shift operative planning and timing [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about operability without aligning with guideline criteria. ESGO advises that primary cytoreductive surgery is favored when there is no unresectable tumor extent and complete debulking to no gross residual disease appears feasible with acceptable morbidity, while NCCN emphasizes maximal cytoreduction with the goal of complete gross resection because this yields superior survival; unresectable scenarios include central or multisegmental liver parenchyma, multiple lung metastases, nonresectable nodes, and brain metastases, none of which are described here, so the key question is whether complete cytoreduction is technically feasible in this pelvis-confined scenario with rectal and cervical adhesions [^114Ym4rX] [^116haNy5] [^113qjK1Y].

> I will now examine the likelihood of achieving complete cytoreduction. With a large mass fixed to the rectum and cervix, a low anterior resection with colorectal anastomosis and possible temporary diversion, en bloc removal of the left adnexa, and systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy are likely required; if the right ovary is involved, a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and hysterectomy would be indicated; given modern techniques and experienced centers, complete gross resection appears achievable, though the risk of morbidity is nontrivial and should be discussed during consent [^116haNy5] [^1152Uc9Z].

> But wait, what if the disease burden or patient factors make upfront surgery too morbid or incomplete? In selected patients with high tumor burden or poor performance status, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking can reduce surgical complexity and improve the chance of complete cytoreduction; I should double-check for occult upper abdominal disease and consider laparoscopic assessment or PET-CT if imaging is equivocal, because that could pivot management toward neoadjuvant therapy if unresectable disease is identified [^116kTAXz].

> Next, I should review major intraoperative complications. Dense adhesions to the rectum and cervix increase the risk of rectal injury and necessitate careful dissection; if resection is required, anastomotic leak and pelvic sepsis are key risks, and a diverting stoma may be prudent depending on contamination, nutrition, and anastomotic tension; bleeding can be substantial given pelvic vascularity and the mass size, so I need to ensure availability of cell salvage and transfusion protocols; ureteral injury is a concern at the pelvic brim and near the cervix, so preoperative ureteral stenting or meticulous identification is advisable; finally, tumor rupture or spillage should be avoided to prevent upstaging, which argues for intact extraction and protective techniques [^116kTAXz].

> I need to ensure I cover early postoperative complications. Anastomotic leak and pelvic abscess can occur after bowel resection, with reported leak rates around 5–10% in complex pelvic surgery and higher with low anastomoses; wound complications and dehiscence are more likely with large incisions and poor nutrition; venous thromboembolism risk is elevated in ovarian cancer and with pelvic surgery, so pharmacologic prophylaxis and early mobilization are essential; pulmonary complications, including atelectasis and pneumonia, are common after long operations and can delay recovery and chemotherapy initiation, which adversely affects survival, so I should plan for aggressive pulmonary care and early feeding [^116kTAXz] [^114k6K8c] [^114JNqqe].

> Let me consider long-term functional sequelae that must be discussed up front. Low anterior resection syndrome with fecal urgency, frequency, and incontinence is common after low rectal resection, with major LARS in roughly 38% of patients in ovarian cancer cohorts and higher risk with multiple anastomoses; adhesions and small-bowel obstruction occur in a substantial minority after extensive pelvic surgery; if a stoma is required, stomal complications and the need for reversal add morbidity; sexual dysfunction and menopausal symptoms are expected after bilateral oophorectomy and hysterectomy and should be addressed proactively [^116wJB44] [^112wHjic] [^116sq6ev].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the presence of diffusion restriction alone might imply unresectability, but I should correct that; diffusion restriction in solid components is a marker of cellular density and malignancy risk, not an anatomic barrier to resection, so it does not preclude complete cytoreduction if the disease is anatomically removable, which reinforces the need to correlate with operative and cross-sectional anatomy rather than DWI alone [^112x62tV].

> Synthesis and recommendation: Yes, this mass is likely resectable with the goal of complete gross resection, provided there is no unresectable upper abdominal or extra-abdominal disease on full staging and the patient's performance status permits major pelvic surgery; the operative plan will likely require en bloc resection with rectal resection, possible diversion, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and systematic lymphadenectomy, ideally at a high-volume center with gynecologic oncology and colorectal collaboration; I should confirm staging with contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and consider laparoscopic assessment if imaging suggests unresectable disease, and I will counsel the patient regarding substantial but acceptable morbidity and the survival benefit of complete cytoreduction followed by platinum-based chemotherapy [^116haNy5] [^114Ym4rX] [^1152Uc9Z].

The mass is **likely resectable** because there is no evidence of unresectable disease such as extensive bowel invasion, ureteral encasement, or distant metastases [^114Ym4rX]. However, **significant surgical risks** are expected due to close adherence to the rectum and cervix, including potential bowel injury, rectal resection with colostomy, ureteral or bladder injury, significant blood loss, and postoperative adhesions or infection. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be considered to reduce tumor burden and facilitate complete resection [^notfound].

---

## Resectability assessment

- **Size and location**: The 10 cm mass is large but localized to the left adnexa with extension behind the uterus; no distant metastases are reported, supporting resectability [^114Ym4rX].

- **Adherence to adjacent structures**: Close abutment to the anterior rectal wall and posterior cervix raises concern for infiltration; however, absence of clear invasion suggests resectability with careful dissection [^116haNy5].

- **Lymph node involvement**: Small internal iliac nodes are noted, but there is no mention of unresectable nodal disease, which supports resectability [^113qjK1Y].

- **Imaging features**: Mixed solid-cystic components with enhancement and diffusion restriction are concerning for malignancy but do not preclude resection [^112x62tV].

---

## Potential surgical complications

- **Bowel injury**: Close adherence to the rectum risks bowel injury, potentially requiring segmental resection and colostomy [^1152Uc9Z].

- **Ureteral or bladder injury**: Pelvic dissection near the cervix risks ureteral or bladder injury, possibly requiring stenting or repair [^116haNy5].

- **Significant blood loss**: Large, vascular tumors carry a risk of substantial intraoperative blood loss, potentially requiring transfusion [^114Ym4rX].

- **Postoperative adhesions and bowel obstruction**: Extensive pelvic surgery increases the risk of adhesions and small bowel obstruction [^116sq6ev].

- **Infection**: Pelvic surgery carries a risk of wound and pelvic infections, especially with bowel manipulation [^notfound].

---

## Role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be considered to shrink the tumor, facilitate complete resection, and reduce surgical morbidity, particularly when there is close adherence to critical structures [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The mass appears **resectable**, but the surgery is complex with significant risks of bowel, urologic, hemorrhagic, and infectious complications. Management at a specialized center with experienced gynecologic oncologists is essential, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be considered to optimize resectability and reduce morbidity [^1152Uc9Z].

### Effect of intraperitoneal ropivacaine during and after cytoreductive surgery on time-interval to adjuvant chemotherapy in advanced ovarian cancer: a randomised, double-blind phase III trial [^114JNqqe]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Editor's key points

- There is widespread interest in new approaches to modifying tumour biology to improve patient outcomes after cancer surgery.
- Local anaesthetic agents administered near to the tumour during surgery are thought to modify the systemic inflammatory response to cancer surgery, improving patient recovery and allowing an earlier return to oncological therapies.
- In this trial intraperitoneal injection of local anaesthetic did not appear to shorten the time to return to oncologic therapy among women undergoing surgery for advanced ovarian cancer.

Standard first-line treatment in epithelial ovarian cancer, an aggressive malignancy with major tumour dissemination to the peritoneal cavity, is surgery and chemotherapy combined. The aim of cytoreductive surgery is to resect gross tumour to enhance the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy. Complete macroscopic surgical resection of tumour followed by adjuvant chemotherapy has repeatedly been associated with the most favourable survival. Accordingly, the aim of surgery is to achieve complete macroscopic resection, often requiring the removal of large sections of the peritoneum and multiple organs. Such extensive surgery may increase the risk of serious postoperative complications and a subsequent delay in postoperative recovery, potentially leading to postponed or inhibited administration of adjuvant chemotherapy. A longer interval between surgery and return to intended oncologic therapy (RIOT), specifically the start of adjuvant chemotherapy, has been associated with inferior overall survival. Consequently, RIOT is a relevant clinical endpoint to consider.

### Recurrent mature cystic ovarian teratoma in adolescence: atypical case of the growing teratoma syndrome [^115cUAaY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

A primary mature cystic ovarian teratoma was diagnosed in an adolescent female. She was followed up after initial exploration with computed tomography, pelvic ultrasonography, and serum tumor markers. Recurrent tumor, consisting solely of mature teratomatous elements, was confirmed with 2 subsequent laparotomies.

Case

This is a report of the growing teratoma syndrome in a young woman with a primary diagnosis of a mature cystic ovarian teratoma not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.

Conclusion

The growing teratoma syndrome is an uncommon condition. Surgical resection of recurrent lesions is necessary to reduce potential complications of abdominopelvic organ compression and obstruction and to evaluate for the presence of malignant degeneration.

### Total parietal peritonectomy can Be performed with acceptable morbidity for patients with advanced ovarian cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy: results from a prospective multi-centric study [^116kTAXz]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Total parietal peritonectomy (TPP) removes areas of "normal-appearing" parietal peritoneum bearing microscopic residual disease and has the potential to improve survival of patients undergoing interval cytoreductive surgery (CRS) for advanced serous epithelial ovarian cancer. This report presents the morbidity outcomes for the first 50 patients enrolled in TORPEDO (CTRI/2018/12/016789), a prospective study.

Methods

All the patients underwent a TPP during interval CRS. A surgical protocol that includes a description of the boundaries for each of the five peritonectomies was followed. The common toxicology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) classification was used to record 90-day morbidity and mortality.

Results

The median Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI) for 50 patients was 15 (range, 5–37). A complete cytoreduction (CC-0 resection) was obtained in 80%, a CC-1 resection in 16%. A bowel resection was performed in 70% of the patients. Grade 3 or 4 complications were seen in 11 patients (22%), and one patient died within 90 days after surgery due to intraperitoneal hemorrhage. The most common complications were postoperative fluid collection requiring aspiration (n = 5), intraperitoneal hemorrhage (n = 2), abdominal wound dehiscence (n = 2), pseudo-obstruction (n = 1), urinary sepsis (n = 2), and ileostomy-related complications (n = 2). No bowel fistulas or anastomotic leaks occurred. Microscopic disease in 'normal appearing' peritoneum adjacent to tumor nodules was observed in 46% of the patients, and in regions given a lesion score of 0 in 34%. The parietal peritoneal regions (0–8) had a higher incidence of residual disease (p < 0.001) and occult disease (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

During interval CRS, TPP can be performed with acceptable morbidity and mortality. The pathologic findings further support this therapeutic rationale. Survival outcomes should determine the future role of such a procedure in routine clinical practice.

### Single port gasless laparoscopy-assisted mini-laparotomic ovarian resection (SP-GLAMOR): reasonable treatment for large cystic ovarian tumors with suspicion of malignancy [^115K23XR]. Gynecologic Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Recent improvements to both optical and laparoscopic instruments have enabled the use of laparoscopic surgery for gynecological procedures as opposed to open abdominal surgery. However, laparoscopic surgery has several potential limitations, including tumor rupture, spillage, incomplete resection of lesions, and trocar insertion site metastasis in surgeries involving large ovarian masses with suspicion of malignancy. Here, we report a case series of large ovarian cystic tumors that were successfully removed by single port gasless laparoscopy assisted mini-laparotomic ovarian resection (SP-GLAMOR), the limitations of which were successfully addressed.

Methods

We reviewed the medical records of 31 women who visited St. Vincent Hospital from April 2006 until April 2011 and were diagnosed with a large cystic ovarian mass with suspicion of malignancy based on imaging studies and tumor markers. After diagnosis, all of the women underwent SP-GLAMOR.

Results

The median maximal diameter of cysts, median incision size, median surgical duration and median volume of blood loss were 20 cm (range 10.7–45 cm), 3 cm (range 2.5–4 cm), 100 min (range 45–270 min) and 100mL (range 30–500 mL), respectively. Four cases were diagnosed as malignant disease on frozen sections obtained during the operation, and were converted to open abdominal surgery. No major complications were observed. The four patients diagnosed with malignant disease also underwent adjuvant chemotherapy. All patients were followed up to the time of this report.

Conclusions

The results of our study suggest that the SP-GLAMOR procedure is feasible, with potentially decreased perioperative morbidity and blood loss, faster recovery and better cosmetic results.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: ovarian cancer / fallopian tube cancer / primary peritoneal cancer, version 3.2024 [^1152Uc9Z]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Ovarian cancer — procedures for optimal cytoreduction and intraperitoneal (IP) therapy planning: Procedures that may be considered for optimal surgical cytoreduction (in all stages) include bowel resection and/or appendectomy, stripping of the diaphragm or other peritoneal surfaces, splenectomy, partial cystectomy and/or ureteroneocystostomy, partial hepatectomy, partial gastrectomy, cholecystectomy, and/or distal pancreatectomy. Extensive resection of upper abdominal metastases is recommended as part of debulking for patients who can tolerate this surgery, as it is associated with improved PFS and OS. Select patients with low-volume residual disease after surgical cytoreduction for stage II or III invasive epithelial ovarian or peritoneal cancer are potential candidates for IP therapy, and in these patients, consideration should be given to placement of an IP catheter with initial surgery.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: ovarian cancer / fallopian tube cancer / primary peritoneal cancer, version 3.2024 [^116haNy5]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer — principles of surgery (stage > IIB) states that in newly diagnosed invasive epithelial ovarian cancer involving the pelvis and upper abdomen, every effort should be made during a primary cytoreduction procedure to achieve maximum cytoreduction of all abdominal, pelvic, and retroperitoneal disease; residual disease < 1 cm defines optimal cytoreduction, although maximal effort should be made to remove all gross disease since this offers superior survival outcomes. Aspiration of ascites (if present) should be performed for peritoneal cytologic examinations, and all involved omentum should be removed. Suspicious and/or enlarged nodes identified on preoperative imaging or during surgical exploration should be resected, if possible, while resection of clinically negative nodes is not required. Procedures that may be considered for optimal surgical cytoreduction (in all stages) include bowel resection and/or appendectomy, stripping of the diaphragm or other peritoneal surfaces, splenectomy, partial cystectomy and/or ureteroneocystostomy, partial hepatectomy, partial gastrectomy, cholecystectomy, and/or distal pancreatectomy. Select patients with low-volume residual disease after surgical cytoreduction for invasive epithelial ovarian or peritoneal cancer are potential candidates for IP therapy, and in these patients, consideration should be given to placement of IP catheter with initial surgery.

### Neonatal ovarian torsion [^113ACoAP]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Similarly, Bagolan et al discussed the prenatal treatment of fetal ovarian cysts and reported an effective and safe experience of prenatal cyst aspiration. They highlighted the fact that ovarian torsion, causing the loss of the ovary, occurs more frequently before than after birth. In contrast, Heling et al 's data showed that prenatal aspiration of the cyst seems to be of no advantage and should be carried out only in special individual cases. Another proposed approach towards the management of fetal ovarian cysts was published by Akin and his colleagues to guide decisions on timing and modality of intervention. Simple, small, asymptomatic ovarian cysts (< 4 cm) can be followed with no intervention, while simple large cysts or small symptomatic cysts with torsion require surgery. On the other hand, complex cysts require surgery regardless of other factors. If the cyst was characterised as complex prenatally, they recommended preterm delivery and surgery. Essentially, surgical intervention should be minimally invasive and aim to save the ovary. In conclusion, fetal ovarian cysts are diagnosed more frequently due to improving antenatal care and screening. The progression of cysts can vary significantly. Accordingly, close follow-up is required to decide on management based on symptoms and cyst evolution on imaging.

Learning points

The antenatal finding of fetal intra-abdominal cysts should be followed closely during pregnancy for changes in characteristics or the development of complications that may necessitate preterm delivery or intrauterine intervention.
Early postnatal imaging of prenatally diagnosed ovarian cysts aids in the timely diagnosis and management of potential complications.
Antenatal aspiration of ovarian cysts to reduce the size or investigate the contents remains controversial and requires tailored decisions on a case-by-case basis.
Surgical management of symptomatic or complicated ovarian cysts should be minimally invasive and aim to save the ovary whenever possible.

### Laparoscopic surgery for presumed benign ovarian tumor during pregnancy [^112At2L7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The surgical management of ovarian tumors in pregnancy is similar to that of non-pregnant women. The procedures include resection of the tumor (enucleation), removal of an ovary or ovaries (oophorectomy), or surgical excision of the fallopian tube and ovary (salpingo-oophorectomy). The procedure can be done by open surgery (laparotomy) or keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) technique. The benefits of laparoscopic surgery include shorter hospital stay, earlier return to normal activity, and reduced postoperative pain. However, conventional laparoscopic surgery techniques required the infusion of gas carbon dioxide in the peritoneum to distend the abdomen and displace the bowel upward to create the room for surgical manipulation. Serious complications such as abnormally high levels of carbon dioxide in the circulating blood (hypercarbia) and perforation of internal organs have also been reported. These serious complication may be harmful to the fetus.

Objectives

To compare the effects of using laparoscopic surgery for benign ovarian tumor during pregnancy on maternal and fetal health and the use of healthcare resources.

Search Methods

We updated the search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register on 11 November 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials with reported data that compared outcomes of laparoscopic surgery for benign ovarian tumor in pregnancy to conventional laparotomy technique.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors planned to independently assess trial quality and extract data.

Main Results

The updated search did not identify any randomized controlled trials.

Authors' Conclusions

The practice of laparoscopic surgery for benign ovarian tumour during pregnancy is associated with benefits and harms. However, the evidence for the magnitude of these benefits and harms is drawn from case series studies, associated with potential bias. The results and conclusions of these studies must therefore be interpreted with caution. The available case series studies of laparoscopic surgery for benign ovarian tumour during pregnancy provide limited insight into the potential benefits and harms associated with this new surgical technique in pregnancy. Randomized controlled trials are required to provide the most reliable evidence regarding the benefits and harms of laparoscopic surgery for benign ovarian tumour during pregnancy.

### Endometriosis and infertility: a committee opinion [^112NXjBy]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Endometrioma management before assisted reproductive technology — there are no randomized trials comparing laparoscopic excision to expectant management before IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). A case-control study involving 189 patients found no improvement in fertility outcomes after laparoscopic cystectomy before IVF, and a retrospective comparison of 171 subjects concluded that aspiration before controlled ovarian stimulation did not increase the number of follicles > 17 mm, the number of metaphase II oocytes retrieved, or clinical pregnancy rates. Evidence suggests surgery does not benefit asymptomatic women with an endometrioma prior to scheduled IVF/ICSI; in each case the benefits and risks should be balanced by clinicians, and disadvantages include surgical trauma, surgical complications, economic costs, potential decreased ovarian response, and lack of evidence for improved IVF pregnancy rates.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: ovarian cancer / fallopian tube cancer / primary peritoneal cancer, version 3.2024 [^114X6KsR]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN ovarian cancer — borderline epithelial tumors (low malignant potential) treatment states that surgery is the primary treatment, including standard ovarian cancer debulking surgery or fertility-sparing surgery depending on surgical evaluation and other factors, and patients should be evaluated by a gynecologic oncologist. NCCN Panel Members are less likely to recommend aggressive treatment after surgery; observation is one of several possible approaches, and the NCCN Guidelines use the presence or absence of invasive implants to determine the need for postoperative therapy. For fertility preservation, surgery may be limited to a USO (preserving the uterus, contralateral ovary, and contralateral Fallopian tube) with resection of residual disease, and BSO with uterine preservation is an option for select patients. If fertility-sparing surgery is not desired, standard ovarian cancer surgery (TAH, BSO, and debulking as needed) and resection of residual disease are recommended. Data do not show increased survival with lymphadenectomy and omentectomy for borderline epithelial tumor, although upstaging does occur, and lymph node evaluation may be considered on a case-by-case basis.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: ovarian cancer / fallopian tube cancer / primary peritoneal cancer, version 3.2024 [^115Y2rDB]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Bevacizumab safety and adverse event patterns — GOG-0218 and ICON7: Toxicities of concern with bevacizumab that may require intervention and often lead to treatment discontinuation include pain (grade ≥ 2), neutropenia (grade ≥ 4), bleeding (grade ≥ 2), hypertension (grade ≥ 2), thromboembolism (grade ≥ 3), gastrointestinal (GI) events, proteinuria (grade ≥ 3), and wound disruption. In both GOG-0218 and ICON7, bleeding, hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic events (grade ≥ 3), GI perforation (grade ≥ 3), and wound-healing complications were more common in the bevacizumab arm, whereas neutropenia occurred with similar rates across arms and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome occurred in GOG-0218 only in the bevacizumab arms. Most toxicities developed during the chemotherapy phase, but a few — hypertension, high‑grade pain, proteinuria, and thromboembolism — continued during the bevacizumab maintenance phase. Risk factors for GI-related adverse events included inflammatory bowel disease and bowel resection at primary surgery, which were associated with increased risk of grade ≥ 2 perforation, fistula, necrosis, or hemorrhage. Patients treated with bevacizumab had higher rates of readmission; most readmissions occur within the first 40 days after surgery but after the first cycle of chemotherapy was delivered, and across arms, increased readmission was associated with baseline CA‑125 level, disease stage, surgery involving bowel resection, residual disease, ascites, high body mass index, and poor performance score. Shorter time to chemotherapy after surgery was associated with increased readmission, whereas time to initiation longer than 25 days was associated with poorer OS.

### Imaging features of complex solid and multicystic ovarian lesions: proposed algorithm for differential diagnosis [^113BUNzs]. Clinical Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Complex solid and multicystic ovarian lesions are broad-spectrum diseases, ranging from benign to malignant. This article describes the broad-spectrum and imaging features of complex solid and multicystic ovarian lesions and illustrates an algorithmic approach to such lesions, focusing on the ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging features that allow one to hone the differential diagnosis. Multimodality imaging workup plays an important role in the characterization and differential diagnosis of these diseases. Also, knowledge of the clinical setting and imaging features for the spectrum of complex solid and multicystic ovarian lesions can lead to appropriate management.

### Low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer after primary debulking surgery [^116wJB44]. Gynecologic Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the prevalence of low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) in patients with debulking surgery for primary advanced epithelial ovarian cancer and to identify potential risk factors for development of LARS.

Methods

We reviewed data on 552 consecutive patients with primary epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), who underwent upfront or interval cytoreductive surgery including low anterior resection at two different academic institutions (Kliniken-Essen-Mitte, Germany, and Medical University of Vienna, Austria). Intestinal dysfunction was assessed by the validated LARS-questionnaire via telephone call. We performed descriptive statistics and a binary logistic regression model to evaluate risk factors for LARS.

Results

In total, 341 patients were eligible and 206 (60.4%) were successfully contacted and provided complete information. Major LARS was observed in 78 (37.9%) patients, minor LARS in 44 (21.4%) patients, and no LARS in 84 (40.8%) patients. The prevalence rate of major LARS was not influenced by time interval between surgery and LARS assessment, type of cytoreductive surgery, and recurrent disease at the time of assessment. In multivariate analyses, number of anastomosis was independently associated with an increased risk for presence of major LARS (OR 3.76 [1.95–7.24]). In the present cohort, 25.2% patients had more than one bowel anastomosis.

Conclusions

LARS in general and major LARS in particular seem to be a frequent long-term complication after debulking surgery including low anterior resection in primary advanced EOC patients. Particularly EOC patients with more than one bowel anastomosis during surgery seem to be at an increased risk for major LARS.

This was a monocentric retrospective study. Data from patients who underwent cytoreductive surgery at the First Affiliated Hospital of the University of Science & Technology of China from September 2017 to January 2021 were retrospectively collected. We enrolled patients who received satisfactory cytoreduction surgery and were pathologically diagnosed as having ovarian cancer after surgery. Patients without macroscopic residual lesions or with residual lesions less than 1 cm were defined as having underwent satisfactory cytoreductive surgery. Patients were excluded for preoperative pulmonary complications such as pleural effusion, pulmonary infection or pulmonary embolism.

Data collection

Data included patient characteristics, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, previous comorbidities, pulmonary function, preoperative and postoperative albumin (Alb), hemoglobin (Hb), intraoperative fluid infusion volume, blood transfusion volume, blood loss volume, anesthesia means, operation time, surgical methods for diaphragmatic lesions, Federation International of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, surgical complexity scores (SCS), and hospitalization days.

In cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer, the commonly used surgical methods for the diaphragmatic lesions mainly include the following: electrocoagulation and cauterization of simple diaphragmatic lesions, diaphragm peritonectomy (DP; stripping) (removal of diaphragmatic peritoneum only) and diaphragm full-thickness resection (DFTR) (resection of diaphragmatic peritoneum and muscle layer) in case of infiltration.

The primary outcome was defined as the incidence of PPCs within 30 days after surgery. Pulmonary complications included pleural effusion, pneumothorax, atelectasis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, postoperative mechanical ventilation > 48 h, acute respiratory distress syndrome, re-intubation or respiratory failure. The diagnostic criteria of PPCs used in this study were based on the European Perioperative Clinical Outcome (EPCO) definitions for postoperative pulmonary complications.

Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission. In-hospital mortality was defined as death during admission at our hospital. 30-Day readmission also only included admission back to our hospital. Planned admissions for administration of chemotherapy or reexamination were not considered to be a 30-day readmission event.

### Compartment syndrome of the hand after laparoscopic gynecologic surgery [^111N2PT5]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute compartment syndrome of the hand is a potentially devastating and infrequent condition observed after trauma, arterial injury, or prolonged compression of the upper limb. We present the case of a patient diagnosed with compartment syndrome of the hand after laparoscopic surgery for epithelial ovarian cancer. The patient is a 42-year-old woman with incidental finding of high-grade ovarian serous carcinoma after an emergency surgery. On imaging evaluation, the patient was found to have evidence of residual retroperitoneal adenopathy and was taken to the operating room for a staging procedure by laparoscopy. In the immediate postoperative period, she developed compartment syndrome of the right hand that required multiple fasciotomies and multidisciplinary management by plastic surgery, orthopedics, and rehabilitation medicine. The patient was discharged from the hospital 7 days after laparoscopic surgery to undergo rehabilitation. Three months after surgery, she is continuing to recover, with near complete recovery of hand function. The patient has completed a total of 3 cycles of chemotherapy with carboplatin/paclitaxel. Compartment syndrome of the hand is an uncommon event, but it can generate major functional deficits and even death if it is not diagnosed and treated in a timely manner. Strict criteria for patient positioning in laparoscopy surgery may avoid or reduce this complication. To date, this is the first case reporting such complications associated with laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.

### Meigs syndrome superimposed on Gorlin syndrome in a 14-year-old girl [^116M5St6]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Meigs syndrome is a rare complication associated with ovarian fibromas. Although ovarian fibromas are rare in children, they are common in women with Gorlin syndrome after puberty.

Case

A 14-year-old girl with Gorlin syndrome was admitted to our hospital for ablation of basal cell carcinoma. A chest x-ray revealed pleural effusion. Ultrasonography revealed bilateral multinodular ovarian masses. Meigs syndrome associated with ovarian fibromas was considered. A laparotomy revealed bilateral ovarian masses, which were resected. Microscopically, the masses were composed of mitotically active fibroma and areas resembling hemangiopericytoma and luteinized thecoma. The pleural effusion disappeared soon after the surgery.

Summary and Conclusion

Physicians should consider the possibility that pleural effusion might precede the diagnosis of ovarian fibroma in patients with Gorlin syndrome.

### Cross-sectional imaging of acute gynaecologic disorders: CT and MRI findings with differential diagnosis-part I: corpus luteum and haemorrhagic ovarian cysts, genital causes of haemoperitoneum and adnexal torsion [^1173UUjS]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

More common (80% of patients) compared to superficial peritoneal implants and deep pelvic endometriosis, endometrioma results from ectopic endometrial glands in the ovarian cortex that form haemorrhagic 'pseudocysts' which become detectable by imaging. Endometriomas have highly variable, often heterogeneous CT appearance and often mimic mixed solid/cystic or predominantly solid masses (Fig. 9 a, b). Compared to MRI, CT has poor specificity and often does not allow reliable differentiation from other complex cystic adnexal masses, either benign or malignant (Fig. 9). Suggestive ancillary findings include multiplicity, bilateral adnexal involvement ('kissing ovaries' sign, Fig. 9 a, b), stability over time and associated lesions on the peritoneum and bowel serosa.

Fig. 9
Key CT differential diagnoses of haemorrhagic ovarian cysts. a, b Unenhanced (a) and postcontrast (b) CT images of bilateral endometriomas (arrowheads) occupying the rectouterine pouch in a 'kissing ovaries' configuration. Note the mildly inhomogeneous attenuation and septation (thin arrow in b). c, d Ovarian carcinoma in a premenopausal woman with predominantly cystic pattern, septations (thin arrow in d) and a solid, enhancing eccentric mural vegetation (asterisk in c). e, f Unenhanced (e) and post-contrast (f) images of a postoperative collection (complex serocele, arrowheads) involving the adnexal region, showing septations (thin arrows). Note the right ureteral stent and suture at the sigmoid colon after multiple surgeries for Crohn's disease

MRI is arguably the best imaging technique for the diagnosis of endometrioma, relying on high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and the pathognomonic T2 'shading' sign (gradual loss of signal till complete signal void in the most dependent portion) reflecting cyclic repeated bleeding over time (Figs. 10 and 11). Haemorrhagic ovarian cyst is suggested over endometrioma when the cyst is solitary and unilocular, without the 'shading sign', and disappears at follow-up (6–12 weeks). Other T1-hyperintense lesions which may be confused with endometriomas include dermoids and mucinous cystic tumours: precontrast fat-suppressed T1-weighted images help distinguish lipid-containing dermoids from the blood. Mucinous cystic tumours show signal intensity lower than the blood on T1-weighted images. Finally, the identification of vascularised projections and nodular septa should suggest malignancy.

### The international glossary on infertility and fertility care, 2017 [^115yD8Wp]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Medium credibility.

International glossary on infertility and fertility care (2017) — ovarian physiology, stimulation, and complications are defined: Ovarian reserve is "A term generally used to indicate the number and/or quality of oocytes, reflecting the ability to reproduce", and "Ovarian reserve can be assessed by any of several means. They include: female age; number of antral follicles on ultrasound; anti-Müllerian hormone levels; follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol levels; clomiphene citrate challenge test; response to gonadotropin stimulation; and oocyte and/or embryo assessment during an ART procedure, based on number, morphology or genetic assessment of the oocytes and/or embryos". Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is "An exaggerated systemic response to ovarian stimulation characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical and laboratory manifestations" that "may be classified as mild, moderate or severe according to the degree of abdominal distention, ovarian enlargement and respiratory, hemodynamic and metabolic complications". Ovarian stimulation (OS) is "Pharmacological treatment with the intention of inducing the development of ovarian follicles. It can be used for two purposes: 1) for timed intercourse or insemination; 2) in ART, to obtain multiple oocytes at follicular aspiration". Ovulation is "The natural process of expulsion of a mature egg from its ovarian follicle", and ovulation induction (OI) is "Pharmacological treatment of women with anovulation or oligo-ovulation with the intention of inducing normal ovulatory cycles". Additional definitions include ovarian tissue cryopreservation as "The process of slow-freezing or vitrification of tissue surgically excised from the ovary with the intention of preserving reproductive capacity" and ovarian torsion as "Partial or complete rotation of the ovarian vascular pedicle that causes obstruction to ovarian blood flow, potentially leading to necrosis of ovarian tissue".

### Resource guide: surgical management of benign or high-risk lesions [^113kiAQ9]. ASBrS (2024). High credibility.

Mucocele-like lesions (MLLs) — pathology description and historical management are outlined. MLLs are rare lesions characterized by epithelium-lined cysts filled with mucin that are prone to rupture and extravasate mucin into the surrounding stroma. There are classic and variant forms of MLL, but there is limited information about the clinical significance of the different forms. Previously, it was recommended that all MLLs be excised due to the difficulty in distinguishing them from mucinous carcinoma, and a MLL typically presents with calcifications on mammography.

### Determination of resectability [^117WUJ4y]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The nuances of determining resectability for liver tumors can be difficult to navigate, owing to the variety of primary and secondary malignancies involving the liver, the range of patient-specific factors to consider, and the hepatic anatomic and functional variability that seems inevitable. The basic principles, however, are simple; if surgery is deemed appropriate from an oncologic standpoint, the patient is in reasonably good health, and the tumor can be safely removed without compromising the integrity of the future remnant, nearly all patients will be candidates for resection.

5.3	Pulmonary and Vascular Complications

Serious pulmonary conditions (e.g., atelectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome) have been reported in women treated with gonadotropins. In addition, thromboembolic reactions both in association with, and separate from OHSS have been reported following gonadotropin therapy. Intravascular thrombosis, which may originate in venous or arterial vessels, can result in reduced blood flow to vital organs or the extremities. Women with generally recognized risk factors for thrombosis, such as a personal or family history, severe obesity, or thrombophilia, may have an increased risk of venous or arterial thromboembolic events, during or following treatment with gonadotropins. Sequelae of such reactions have included venous thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, cerebral vascular occlusion (stroke), and arterial occlusion resulting in loss of limb and rarely in myocardial infarction. In rare cases, pulmonary complications and/or thromboembolic reactions have resulted in death. In women with recognized risk factors, the benefits of ovulation induction, in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombosis.

5.4	Ovarian Torsion

Ovarian torsion has been reported after treatment with Follistim AQ Cartridge and after intervention with other gonadotropins. This may be related to OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal surgery, past history of ovarian torsion, previous or current ovarian cyst and polycystic ovaries. Damage to the ovary due to reduced blood supply can be limited by early diagnosis and immediate detorsion.

5.5	Multi-fetal Gestation and Birth

Multi-fetal gestation and births have been reported with all gonadotropin treatments including Follistim AQ Cartridge treatment. The woman and her partner should be advised of the potential risk of multi-fetal gestation and births before starting treatment.

5.6	Congenital Anomalies

The incidence of congenital malformations after IVF or ICSI may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conception. This slightly higher incidence is thought to be related to differences in parental characteristics (e.g., maternal age, sperm characteristics) and to the higher incidence of multi-fetal gestations after IVF or ICSI. There are no indications that the use of gonadotropins during IVF or ICSI is associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations.

### Obstructive uropathy as the etiology of renal failure in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome [^114UGbah]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To make people aware that there is potential for obstructive uropathy to complicate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and cause renal impairment.

Design

Case report.

Setting

Hospital.

Patient(S)

A 28-year-old Caucasian female presenting with acute severe OHSS.

Intervention(S)

Bilateral JJ stenting.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Resolution of renal impairment.

Result(S)

Successful treatment of renal failure.

Conclusion(S)

Patients with severe OHSS and renal impairment should be evaluated with renal ultrasound to rule out hydronephrosis and therefore an obstructive uropathy. Patients potentially at risk for such a complication from OHSS may include those with prior abdominal or pelvic surgery.

### Laparoscopic intervention for solid pelvic tumours in mayer-rokitansky-Küster-hauser syndrome: a case of bilateral uterine adenomyomas of the rudimentary uterus [^1148BvYa]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the treatment of myoma and adenomyosis in MRKH syndrome, previous reports have recommended surgery for symptomatic cases, including differentiation from ovarian tumours. However, currently, there is no consensus on the treatment methods. In the most cases, resection of the entire uterus in asymptomatic patients to prevent recurrenceand removal of the entire uterus in symptomatic patients are preferred. In addition to our case, only four other cases of tumour removal alone have been reported. Anatomical structures may differ in women with MRKH syndrome; therefore, there is a risk of surgical complications, such as damage to the surrounding blood vessels, ureter and bladder, when removing the rudimentary uterus. We consider that tumour removal alone is sufficient, especially when there are no symptoms or suspicion of malignancy.

However, some cases of MRKH syndrome complicated with malignant ovarian tumours have been reported despite the condition being rare. Their findings indicate that if prior findings of suspected malignancy are observed on imaging, total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be considered.

In conclusion, this is the first report of a uterine adenomyoma in a patient with MRKH syndrome. In uterine adenomyomas, similar to other pelvic tumours in MRKH syndrome, laparoscopic surgery and histopathology can facilitate a diagnosis when imaging studies alone are insufficient.

Patient's perspective

I already knew that I do not have a uterus and vagina but have normal ovaries due to my condition. When I was told that there were tumours in my pelvic cavity that looked like ovarian tumours, I was worried that I would lose my ovaries too. However, after surgery, I was relieved to know that the tumours originated from the uterus and not from my ovaries. In addition, I learnt that adenomyomas in MRKH syndrome are rare. Therefore, I wanted to help in making medical advancements in this field by agreeing to publish the findings of my case.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^11748BDs]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation strength interpretation — language cues and definitions: Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with "should" and "should not" statements, whereas a weak recommendation may be recognized by "may" or "need not". A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, for a strong negative recommendation, the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the supporting evidence quality is excellent; clinicians are advised to follow such guidance unless a clear and compelling rationale for acting in a contrary manner is present. A moderate recommendation means the committee believes benefits exceed harms (or harms exceed benefits for a negative recommendation) but the evidence on which the recommendation is based is not as strong, and clinicians are encouraged to follow such guidance while remaining alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation means the existing evidence quality is suspect or well-designed, well-conducted studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach versus another, offering clinicians flexibility in decision-making, although boundaries on alternatives may be set.

### Large pelvic mass reveals poorly differentiated carcinoma with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation: a diagnostic and surgical challenge [^1166Kr7j]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Sarcomatoid carcinoma is a rare and aggressive malignancy characterised by a combination of epithelial and mesenchymal features, often complicating the identification of its primary origin. These tumours can arise in various anatomical sites, including the gastrointestinal tract and pelvis, and are typically associated with rapid growth, local invasion and a poor prognosis. We present the case of a woman in her mid-60s with a history of total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for benign disease, who developed a large pelvic mass. Initial imaging revealed an extensive, heterogeneous lesion measuring 12cm in diameter, involving adjacent structures. Surgical exploration demonstrated the tumour's extensive adherence to surrounding tissues, necessitating ileocolic resection and omentectomy. Histopathological analysis confirmed a poorly differentiated carcinoma with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation, while immunohistochemical studies were inconclusive regarding the primary origin. This case underscores the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges posed by sarcomatoid carcinoma, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and the role of molecular studies in optimising management.

A 66-year-old female presented with symptoms suggestive of pelvic organ prolapse, history of fibroid uterus, and rectal pressure. Pelvic examination revealed a large pelvic mass filling the posterior cul-de-sac, occupying the rectovaginal septum, and compressing the rectum. There was a stage II pelvic organ prolapse of the posterior vaginal wall with distal vaginal wall extending to the hymen during valsalva. A CT scan confirmed the large pelvic mass distinct from the uterus measuring 9.4 × 9.8 × 6.2 cm. Colorectal workup revealed adenocarcinoma of colon on screening colonoscopy with biopsies. Patient underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colon resection, and abdominal resection of the pelvic mass in the rectovaginal septum and inferior to the uterus. The patient did not require any concomitant pelvic reconstruction and the posterior vaginal wall prolapse resolved after resecting the pelvic mass.

### Impact of type 2 diabetes on complications after primary breast cancer surgery: Danish population-based cohort study [^113v5s9p]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Several issues should be considered when interpreting these findings. In the present large nationwide cohort, with high data completeness and complete follow-up, selection bias was virtually eliminated. Analysis of systematically and prospectively collected data on clinical, tumour, and treatment characteristics enabled the incorporation of potential confounding factors. The completeness of the DNPR is high, and information on T2D was ascertained based both on diagnostic codes from the DNPR and T2D medications from the Danish National Prescription Registry. Co-medications were selected based on drugs that may increase the risk of surgical complications and reoperation, especially when assessing the risk of postoperative bleeding. These drugs are more commonly used by individuals with T2D than those without.

Still, this study may be prone to residual confounding owing to lifestyle factors such as smoking, dietary habits, and BMI, which are not recorded routinely in Danish registries. Both BMI and smoking may be more prevalent among individuals with T2D, and both are associated with a higher risk of surgical complications. Information on performance status was not available, but patients with breast cancer are not expected to be excluded from surgery because of co-morbidities or poor performance status. Thus, it seems unlikely that selection bias would explain the findings. It is possible that T2D was misclassified, especially among women with preclinical T2D, which would have biased the observed effect estimates to the null. Women who had a pre-existing hospital diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome at time of breast cancer surgery were not excluded. Such women could potentially have been considered to have T2D owing to the use of metformin, the standard treatment for polycystic ovarian syndrome. The total number of such women in this cohort is expected to be very small, and unlikely to have influenced the results.

These findings highlight a need for increased awareness of the potential for surgical complications among patients with T2D undergoing breast cancer surgery. They also suggest that, in the absence of T2D, co-morbidity has a negligible impact on the absolute risk of surgical complications. Further studies are needed to examine the impact of T2D severity, duration, and biological markers, such as haemoglobin A1c levels, on surgical complications in women with breast cancer. These findings may be used to guide the care of women with breast cancer and T2D in the aftermath of the primary surgery.

### Menotropins (menopur) [^116agc8F]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

After the acute phase is successfully managed as above, excessive fluid accumulation in the third space should be limited by instituting severe potassium, sodium, and fluid restriction.
Resolution Phase:

As third space fluid returns to the intravascular compartment, a fall in hematocrit and increasing urinary output are observed in the absence of any increase in intake. Peripheral and/or pulmonary edema may result if the kidneys are unable to excrete third space fluid as rapidly as it is mobilized. Diuretics may be indicated during the resolution phase, if necessary, to combat pulmonary edema.

Do not remove ascitic, pleural, and pericardial fluid unless there is the necessity to relieve symptoms such as pulmonary distress or cardiac tamponade.

OHSS increases the risk of injury to the ovary. Pelvic examination or intercourse may cause rupture of an ovarian cyst, which may result in hemoperitoneum, and should be avoided.

If bleeding occurs and requires surgical intervention, the clinical objective should be to control the bleeding and retain as much ovarian tissue as possible. A physician experienced in the management of this syndrome, or who is experienced in the management of fluid and electrolyte imbalances, should be consulted.

In the IVF clinical trial for MENOPUR, OHSS occurred in 7.2% of the 373 MENOPUR treated women.

5.3	Pulmonary and Vascular Complications

Serious pulmonary conditions (e.g. atelectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and exacerbation of asthma) have been reported in women treated with gonadotropins. In addition, thromboembolic events both in association with, and separate from the Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) have been reported in women treated with gonadotropins. Intravascular thrombosis and embolism, which may originate in venous or arterial vessels, can result in reduced blood flow to critical organs or the extremities. Women with generally recognized risk factors for thrombosis, such as personal or family history, severe obesity, or thrombophilia, may have an increased risk of venous or arterial thromboembolic events during or following treatment with gonadotropins. Sequelae of such reactions have included venous thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, cerebral vascular occlusion (stroke), and arterial occlusion resulting in loss of limb and rarely in myocardial infarctions. In rare cases, pulmonary complications and/or thromboembolic reactions have resulted in death. In women with recognized risk factors, the benefits of ovulation induction and assisted reproductive technology need to be weighed against the risks. Pregnancy also carries an increased risk of thrombosis.

### ESR essentials: characterisation and staging of adnexal masses with MRI and CT-practice recommendations by ESUR [^112x62tV]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Solid tissue morphologies

A diagnostic approach to MRI interpretation is proposed below (Fig. 3):
Identify the origin of the mass: it is fundamental to identify each ovary following the ovarian pedicle, followed by the evaluation of the lesion's origin through the analysis of T2-weighted images (WI) in different planes since suspected indeterminate adnexal masses on the US can have different origins (uterus, gastrointestinal tract, retroperitoneum, O-RADS 1). An overview of the main MRI findings helpful in distinguishing between different origins of a pelvic mass has been reported by Forstner et al.
Verify the presence of wall enhancement in a cyst: if absent, the lesion is almost certainly benign (O-RADS 2).
Evaluate the signal characteristics and morphology on unenhanced T1WI and T2WI: T1WI hypointense and T2WI markedly hyperintense (fluid components): the presence of a unilocular cyst with a simple fluid component provides us with strong diagnostic assurance for a benign lesion (simple cyst, O-RADS 2). T1WI hyperintense (T1 "bright") fluid components: High signal intensity (SI) on T2 and unenhanced T1WI with suppression at T1 fat-saturated images indicates the presence of macroscopic fat, while a drop of signal intensity in the opposed phase of chemical shift imaging suggests the presence of microscopic fat. Intralesional fat gives us good diagnostic confidence for a benign lesion since the vast majority of the lipid-containing mass are dermoid cysts (ORADS 2). The other less common fat-containing benign ovarian lesions are germ tumours (struma ovarii), where cystic spaces may show marked hypointensity on T2WI and intermediate signal intensity on T1WI due to thyroid colloid of the struma. Immature teratomas are uncommon large malignant tumours, usually seen in adolescent women, characterised by a heterogeneous signal intensity with a prominent solid component and an infiltrative growth pattern (O-RADS 4). High SI on unenhanced T1WI with fat saturation reflects T1 shortening from extracellular methemoglobin, indicating the presence of blood breakdown products. If it is associated with a loss of signal intensity within the lesion on T2WI (the "shading" sign), the lesion is almost certainly an endometrioma, which is benign (O-RADS 2). On the other hand, the presence of haemorrhagic, mucinous, and proteinaceous fluid components, which show variable hyperintensity on unenhanced T1 and T2WI, indicates a low risk of malignancy (O-RADS 3).
Check for the presence of internal enhancement in a cyst: Internal enhancement corresponding to a solid tissue: Solid tissue with homogeneous hypointense SI on T2WI and DWI ("dark T2, dark-DWI"): This finding configures a probably benign lesion due to the presence of fibrous tissue. If the mass is predominantly solid and with homogeneous SI, the positive predictive value of malignancy is close to zero and DCE sequences are not needed (O-RADS 2; i.e. fibromas, cystadenofibromas). Solid tissue with intermediate SI on T2WI and restricted diffusion on DWI: contrast enhancement (CE) sequences need to be evaluated. Dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences (DCE) are recommended as they allow the building of time-intensity curves (TICs, Fig. 4) by placing one region of interest within the area of early solid tissue enhancement in the lesion and another on the outer myometrium. If DCE MRI is not feasible, non-DCE MRI can be performed as a single post-contrast T1-weighted sequence at 30 s with fat saturation and the enhancement of the solid tissue in the lesion is compared to the outer myometrium. The evaluation of the post-contrast dynamics of the solid tissue let us improve the risk assessment of the mass (O-RADS 3, 4, and 5; Fig. 4). Internal enhancement non-corresponding to a solid tissue: CE is probably due to thin or thick smooth septa in a bilocular or multilocular cyst or to endosalpingeal folds in a pyosalpinx (O-RADS 3).
Look for peritoneal carcinomatosis: if peritoneal carcinomatosis is detected, the likelihood of malignancy is high (O-RADS 5), and gynaecologic oncologist counselling is needed.

### Menotropins (menopur) [^114vqMFA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

What are possible side effects of MENOPUR?

MENOPUR may cause serious side effects, including:

ovaries that are too large. MENOPUR may cause your ovaries to be abnormally large. Symptoms of large ovaries include bloating or pain in your lower stomach (pelvic) area. If your ovaries become too large your healthcare provider may tell you that you should not have intercourse (sex) so you do not rupture an ovarian cyst.
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Using MENOPUR may cause OHSS. OHSS is a serious medical condition that can happen when your ovaries produce too many eggs (overstimulated). OHSS can cause fluid to suddenly build up in the area of your stomach, chest, heart, and cause blood clots to form. OHSS may also happen after you stop using MENOPUR. Stop using MENOPUR and call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you have any of the following symptoms of OHSS:
severe pelvic or stomach pain
nausea
vomiting
sudden weight gain
swollen stomach
diarrhea
trouble breathing
decreased or no urine
lung problems. MENOPUR may cause serious lung problems that can sometimes lead to death including fluid in the lungs, trouble breathing, and worsening of asthma.
blood clots. MENOPUR may increase your chance of having blood clots in your blood vessels. Blood clots can cause:
blood vessel problems (thrombophlebitis)
stroke
loss of your arm or leg
blood clot in your lung (pulmonary embolus)
twisting (torsion) of your ovary. MENOPUR may increase the chance of your ovary twisting, if you already have certain conditions such as OHSS, pregnancy, and previous abdominal surgery. Twisting of your ovary may lead to blood flow being cut off to your ovary.
pregnancy with and birth of multiple babies. MENOPUR may increase your chance of having a pregnancy with more than 1 baby. Having a pregnancy and giving birth to more than 1 baby at a time increases the health risk for you and your babies. Your healthcare provider should talk to you about your chances of multiple births before you start using MENOPUR.
birth defects. Babies born after ART may have an increased chance of birth defects. Your age, certain sperm problems, your genetic background, and that of your partner, and a pregnancy with more than 1 baby at a time may increase the chance that your baby may have birth defects.
ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside your womb). MENOPUR may increase your chance of having a pregnancy that is abnormally outside of your womb. Your chance of having a pregnancy outside of your womb is increased if you also have fallopian tube problems.
miscarriage. Your chance of loss of an early pregnancy may be increased if you had difficulty becoming pregnant.
tumors of the ovary. If you have used medicines like MENOPUR more than 1 time to get pregnant, you may have an increased chance of having tumors in your ovaries, including cancer.

### Struma ovarii: role of imaging? [^116xtwVx]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Imaging following an intravenous contrast agent is known to demonstrate marked enhancement of the thick septations and locally thickened wall seen in struma ovarii. The solid components, corresponding microscopically to thyroid tissue, also demonstrate strong enhancement and, together with the multilobulated surface of the struma, gives rise to a "lacy" pattern (Fig. 5).

Intuitively, we assume that the higher spatial resolution achievable at 3 T allows this lacy pattern to be more conspicuous. It goes without saying that the use of a spasmolytic (when no contraindication) and significant patient cooperation are both mandatory in order to achieve the spatial resolution required to enable detection of such textural detail from imaging.

This lacy pattern is also apparent on the diffusion-weighted images: the hyperintense solid components demonstrating restricted diffusion are interspersed with cystic areas (either hyper- or hypointense on T2-weighted imaging) showing increased diffusion (Figs. 5 and 6). From our own experience in a small cohort (unpublished data), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in the cystic areas of a benign struma are high, while the solid areas present with ADC values within the benign range. The lowest ADC values in our small benign struma cohort of three cases reached up to 1.2 × 10–3 mm/s 2.

Although MR features of struma ovarii overlap with those of other epithelial ovarian lesions, when MR imaging shows a unilateral complex mass with a multilobulate surface and thickened septa, is composed of multiple cysts of variable signal intensity (in keeping with thick viscous colloid fluid) and demonstrates intensely or moderately enhancing solid components with a "lace appearance", struma ovarii should be included in the differential diagnosis with high probability.

### Trousseau's syndrome associated with an ovarian borderline tumour [^116zURnv]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 71-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of sudden onset of weakness on the left side of her body. Her medical history was unremarkable, and on physical examination, hemiparesis and hyperreflexia on the left side were found. MRI of the brain showed multiple areas of restricted diffusion in both parietal lobes and in the cerebellum, consistent with embolic shower. Magnetic resonance angiography showed no abnormal findings. A contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed multiple pulmonary emboli. Abdominal MRI showed a 135mm left ovarian tumour composed of a solid and a cystic component with liquid level formation. After a total hysterectomy and bilateral adnexectomy, the histopathology confirmed a seromucinous borderline tumour. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with Trousseau's syndrome associated with an ovarian seromucinous borderline tumour. To our knowledge, this is the first report mentioning a borderline ovarian tumour detected as Trousseau's syndrome.

Resectable PC

Technical feasibility of complete surgical removal of all demonstrable PC ("resection with intent to cure") generally provides survival benefit but, in the majority, does not translate into long-term (5-year) survival and is rarely curative. Stages I and II are resectable, and some stage III lesions are considered resectable. Some stage III PCs are considered borderline resectable. The definition of borderline resectable varies 9 and is often simply based on anatomic considerations that would predict high rates of margin positivity after resection. However, aggressive tumor biology and/or patient's physical inability to undergo both surgery and perioperative chemoradiation therapy could also negate any survival benefit of PC resection. Many borderline resectable cancers may benefit from neoadjuvant therapy prior to resection. Cancers with major vascular involvement are considered locally unresectable (stage III), and those with distant metastases are not considered for resection (stage IV). At diagnosis, most PCs are locally unresectable because of involvement of major blood vessels (stage III) or have distant metastases (stage IV). Only 20% of PCs are eligible for resection, and the average size of a resected PC is 30 mm. 10

Defining "Early" PC

At present, challenges remain in terms of defining what constitutes the earliest actionable lesion in the multistep progression of PC. There is little doubt that a PC with any degree of invasion, however small, is biologically advanced because both preclinical studies in autochthonous models and longitudinal studies on recurrence rates in patients with curative intent resection demonstrate the propensity for systemic micrometastases. Nonetheless, there should be a concerted attempt to identify a substantially larger proportion of patients with tumors that are resectable (currently only ∼20% of tumors are deemed resectable), because even with the potential for micrometastatic disease, the survival for patients with surgical resection is unequivocally better than that for those who cannot undergo surgery. As previously stated, even within the resected subset, the size of the primary lesion has a correlation with long-term survival, reiterating the need for "turning back the clock" as far back as possible in the diagnostic timeline. The decision matrix is less clear when one enters the realm of noninvasive precursor lesions. For example, autopsy studies have shown that 16% to 80% of adult pancreata harbor a PanIN, suggesting that this earliest precursor lesion is quite common and in the overwhelming majority of instances does not progress. 11–13

A moderate recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent (or is unobtainable)", implying "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a moderate recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence) is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of evidence is weak", with the implication "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a weak recommendation but should remain alert to new information and very sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms) is defined as "Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate database shows evidence of both benefit and harm that appear to be similar in magnitude for any available courses of action", implying "Clinicians should consider the options in their decision-making, but patient preference may have a substantial role".

### Postoperative morbidity and mortality after surgical resection of small bowel neuroendocrine neoplasms: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11675J4E]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Small bowel neuroendocrine neoplasms (SB‐NEN) are rare tumours of the small bowel with an incidence of one to four per 100,000 person years. Patients are often amenable for surgery, in either a curative or palliative setting (50% stage I‐III, 40% patients with liver metastases). Surgery consists of a partial small bowel resection or right hemicolectomy with mesenteric lymphadenectomy, and is sometimes combined with resection or debulking of liver or peritoneal metastases. Open surgery is still considered the standard approach, although minimally invasive surgery is emerging as an alternative technique in selected patients. The timing of the resection is still a subject of debate (ie, prevent or relieve obstructive symptoms) and remains unanswered by recent guidelines.

One of the challenges of SB‐NEN surgery is the safe and complete resection of mesenteric lymph nodes, which are present in > 80% of patients. Because mesenteric tumour masses can have a close relationship with the main mesenteric trunks, vascularisation of the small bowel may be at risk during central mesenteric dissection. Other potential complications after surgery for SB‐NEN include postoperative haemorrhage, surgical site infections, abscess and anastomotic leakage.

It is a common assumption among healthcare providers that clinics with higher volumes of specific procedures have lower morbidity and mortality rates; for example, as reported for pancreatic and colorectal surgery. Besides surgical experience, anesthesia management might also be relevant. This is especially the case for patients undergoing surgery for hormonally active NEN because intra‐operative carcinoid syndrome develops in up to 55% of patients, regardless of preoperative prophylactic octreotide infusions. Recently, Hallet et alinvestigated the association between anaesthesiologist volume and postoperative morbidity after complex gastrointestinal surgery. Interestingly, cases performed by high‐volume anaesthesiologists had significantly less complications with a Clavien‐Dindo grade III‐V.

Because of the low incidence of SB‐NEN, there is a restricted amount of literature compared to other high incidence gastrointestinal malignancies, and evidence is mostly based on observational studies. The aim of the present systematic review and meta‐analyses was to determine the incidence of morbidity and mortality in patients with SB‐NEN who undergo resection of the primary tumour, and to assess any potential association with hospital‐volume.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for gastrointestinal stromal tumors - NCCN, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, NCCN 2022 guidelines recommend to offer the following management based on the results of the initial diagnostic evaluation in patients with a mass known to be or clinically suspicious for gastrointestinal stromal tumors:

- perform complete surgical resection for resectable with minimal morbidity

- perform biopsy for diagnosis, molecular testing (next-generation sequencing and succinate dehydrogenase B immunohistochemistry), and (if feasible) risk stratification for resectable with significant morbidity, if neoadjuvant therapy is planned. Refer to guidelines for soft tissue sarcoma if the pathology results indicate sarcomas of gastrointestinal origin other than gastrointestinal stromal tumors

- manage unresectable or metastatic disease as unresectable or metastatic disease and consider baseline chest imaging.

As third space fluid returns to the intravascular compartment, a fall in hematocrit and increasing urinary output are observed in the absence of any increase in intake. Peripheral and/or pulmonary edema may result if the kidneys are unable to excrete third space fluid as rapidly as it is mobilized. Diuretics may be indicated during the resolution phase, if necessary, to combat pulmonary edema.

Ascitic, pleural, and pericardial fluid should not be removed unless there is the necessity to relieve symptoms such as pulmonary distress or cardiac tamponade.

OHSS increases the risk of injury to the ovary. Pelvic examination or intercourse may cause rupture of an ovarian cyst, which may result in hemoperitoneum, and should therefore be avoided.

If bleeding occurs and requires surgical intervention, the clinical objective should be to control the bleeding and retain as much ovarian tissue as possible. A physician experienced in the management of this syndrome, or who is experienced in the management of fluid and electrolyte imbalances should be consulted.

During clinical trials with GONAL-f®RFF, OHSS occurred in 7.2% of 83 women and 4.6% of 237 women treated with GONAL-f®RFF for ovulation induction and during Assisted Reproductive Technology, respectively.

5.4 Pulmonary and Vascular Complications

Serious pulmonary conditions (e.g., atelectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and exacerbation of asthma) have been reported in women treated with gonadotropins. In addition, thromboembolic events both in association with, and separate from OHSS have been reported in women treated with gonadotropins including GONAL-f®RFF. Intravascular thrombosis and embolism, which may originate in venous or arterial vessels, can result in reduced blood flow to critical organs or the extremities. Women with generally recognized risk factors for thrombosis, such as personal or family history, severe obesity, or thrombophilia, may have an increased risk of venous or arterial thromboembolic events, during or following treatment with gonadotropins. Sequelae of such reactions have included venous thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, cerebral vascular occlusion (stroke), and arterial occlusion resulting in loss of limb and rarely in myocardial infarctions. In rare cases, pulmonary complications and/or thromboembolic reactions have resulted in death. In women with recognized risk factors, the benefits of ovulation induction and assisted reproductive technology need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted that pregnancy also carries an increased risk of thrombosis.

### Laparoscopic-assisted fertility-sparing surgery for growing teratoma syndrome of the ovary: experience from a tertiary center [^111Pyv2P]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

The main objective is to evaluate the feasibility of laparoscopic fertility-sparing surgery in women with growing teratoma syndrome.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Chinese tertiary university hospital.

Patients

Patients with growing teratoma syndrome who underwent fertility-sparing surgery between January 2015 and August 2023.

Interventions

Baseline characteristics and surgical outcomes were evaluated, including clinical information, surgical procedures, operative time, intraoperative blood loss, complications, length of hospital stay, and follow-up information.

Measurement and Main Results

Twenty-six patients with ovarian growing teratoma syndrome underwent fertility-sparing surgery: 12 had laparoscopic surgery and 14 underwent laparotomic surgery. In the laparoscopic group, the median age of the patients during initial management of immature teratoma or mixed malignant ovarian germ cell tumor was 14.0 years (interquartile range, 13.0–24.5 years). Eleven patients were nulliparous. The primary ovarian tumor was pure immature teratoma in 10 patients and mixed ovarian germ cell tumor in 2 patients. Complete laparoscopic tumor resection was achieved in 11 patients. Patients in the laparoscopic group had shorter median operative time (76.5 vs 180.0 minutes, p = .001), lower estimated blood loss (20.0 vs 400.0 mL, p < .001), and decreased postoperative hospital stay (2.0 vs 7.0 days, p < .001) compared with laparotomic surgery. There was no conversion to laparotomy and no perioperative complications. Histologic examination confirmed mature teratoma in all cases. During a median follow-up of 21.9 months (interquartile range, 7.6–44.9 months), 11 patients were alive without disease and 1 was alive with disease. One pregnancy was achieved postoperatively.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic fertility-sparing surgery may represent a feasible option in well-selected patients with ovarian growing teratoma syndrome. Surgery should be performed in gynecologic oncology centers by experienced staff trained in endoscopic procedures. More research and long-time follow-up are needed to determine the oncologic outcomes and safety of laparoscopic surgery in this population.

The endometrioma represents the key differential diagnosis of haemorrhagic ovarian cysts. Affecting 10% of women of reproductive age, endometriosis is defined by growth of ectopic endometrial tissue outside the uterus, which bleeds synchronously with the endometrium. Clinically, endometriosis is suggested by cyclic perimenstrual pain and by other manifestations such as dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, infertility and pain during defecation. Although dysmenorrhoea and chronic pelvic pain represent the classic clinical presentation, a sudden onset with acute pelvic pain may also occur. Because of the great clinical variability of the disease, delayed diagnosis up to 7–10 years after initial symptoms is common.

### Large adrenal incidentaloma in conjunction with perforated diverticulitis [^113KiXS3]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

What we did and why

Answer: C

Informed consent was obtained for a laparotomy, bowel resection, possible stoma, possible resection of the adrenal mass, and possible need for intensive care unit (ICU) management of hemodynamic instability. An arterial line was placed for invasive blood pressure monitoring and induction of general anesthesia was uneventful. Agents to rapidly control hypertensive crisis and arrhythmias were immediately available, with close attention to intraoperative fluid balance. Intraoperative findings included a large pelvic interloop abscess, 30 cm of sigmoid colon requiring resection, and two loops of small bowel densely adhered to the abscess cavity requiring resection due to transmural ischemia (remaining bowel shown in figure 2). The patient was hemodynamically stable throughout the initial bowel resections with minimal manipulation of the adrenal mass.

Figure 2
Remaining small bowel that was densely adhered to the abscess cavity.

The sigmoid and small bowel were initially left in discontinuity while the adrenal mass was assessed with HPB/endocrine surgery. As indicated by preoperative imaging, there was no invasion of other structures and the mass was not hypervascular except for a large draining vein (figure 3). A left adrenalectomy was completed in toto, and the patient remained hemodynamically stable. Two handsewn small bowel anastomoses were then created, and an end colostomy fashioned given the significant purulent contamination, the increased risk of postoperative hypotension, upstream anastomoses, and potential need for adjuvant therapy if the diagnosis was ACC. The anastomoses were performed at the end of the procedure in case the patient did develop hemodynamic instability, allowing for the bowel to be reassessed or anastomosed at a later operation if necessary. Drains were left in the pelvis and lesser sac.

### MR imaging of ovarian masses: classification and differential diagnosis [^115C2xmi]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Morphological characteristics of adnexal masses range from cystic (both unilocular and multilocular), complex (cystic and solid) and predominantly solid. It is true that there is a certain overlap between benign and malignant tumours; in particular, it has to be considered that borderline lesions are very difficult to differentiate because they have both benign and malignant features.

In 2007, Sohaib et al. showed that from the analysis of the MR imaging features, "the most predictive characteristics of malignancy are vegetations in a cystic lesion, presence of ascites, a maximal diameter greater than 6 cm, and necrosis in a solid lesion". In 2011, Valentini et al. suggested criteria for characterization of benign and suspicious adnexal lesions, indicating as features suggestive of malignancy the demonstration of "solid, solid/cystic enhancing masses (greater than 4 cm in maximum diameter) with papillary projections and irregular thick wall and septa (greater than 3 mm) into a cystic lesion" as well as a "heterogeneous and early enhancement pattern".

To conclude this work, we'd like to indicate some key imaging features and general advice that could be of help in the differential diagnosis of adnexal masses:
non-neoplastic lesions should always be taken into consideration;
in a patient with endometriosis, the presence of a complex and rapidly growing mass with contrast enhancement should raise the suspicion of endometrioid or clear cell tumour;
a very low signal intensity on T2-weighted images indicates a fibrotic component, suggesting a tumour of the thecoma/fibroma group, a cystadenofibroma or a Brenner tumour;
sequences with fat saturation are helpful when facing a mass with high signal intensity on T1-weighted images, because the signal suppression is suggestive of a teratoma; otherwise, an endometrial cysts or other haemorrhagic lesions should be considered;
a "stained glass appearance" with cystic loculi of variable signal intensity usually refers to a mucinous tumour, because of the different mucin concentration;
metastasis should be considered if a complex enhancing mass is demonstrated in both ovaries (eventually looking for an unknown primary tumour); however, it must be remembered that serous epithelial tumours can be bilateral as well.

### Comparison of self-assessment of solvent exposure with measurement and professional assessment for female petrochemical workers in China [^111BJoBU]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The primary objective of this paper is to examine the validity of self-assessment of solvent exposure by comparing it with professional assessment and actual measurements.

Methods

Self-assessment of exposures to benzene, toluene, styrene, and xylene was obtained from 132 female workers. The exposures were also estimated by an occupational hygienist and by actual measurement. Self-assessment, professional assessment, and measurement were then compared with each other.

Results

Fair to good agreement was found between self-assessment, professional assessment, and measurement for benzene, styrene, and xylene. The agreement between self-assessment and measurement was poor for toluene, whereas the agreement between self-assessment and professional assessment was good. The latter was caused by a biased professional assessment.

Conclusions

Workers' self-assessment and professional assessment provided useful information for benzene, styrene, and xylene exposure, but not for toluene exposure. False agreement can be obtained when professional assessment was used as reference in validity study.

### Erythromycin (ERYTHROMYCIN base filmtab) [^114dmSjP]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Susceptibility Tests

Dilution Techniques

Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's). These MIC's provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MIC's should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method1(broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of erythromycin powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria:

A report of "Susceptible" indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable. A report of "Intermediate" indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of "Resistant" indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected.

Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard erythromycin powder should provide the following MIC values:

Diffusion Techniques

Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure2requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 15-µg erythromycin to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to erythromycin.

Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 15-µg erythromycin disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria:

Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for erythromycin.

As with standardized dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. For the diffusion technique, the 15-µg erythromycin disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory test quality control strains:

DTs.7

There are no RCTs in the literature about the ideal treatment of DTs. Surgery is known to be associated with significant complications (such as haemorrhage, bowel perforation, short bowel syndrome and significant loss of function), morbidity, and mortality. Moreover, the evolution and response of DTs after treatment are unpredictable, as a high percentage of cases reach a stabilization period but are prone to recurrence after surgery. Therefore, surgery cannot be considered the ideal treatment for DTs. Nevertheless, primary surgery could be considered for well-defined tumours of the abdominal wall that can be safely resected. Surgical resection of mesenteric DTs could be considered for those resistant to medical strategies or radiation therapy or if they are rapidly growing or life-threatening. Surgery is also indicated in cases of DT complications, such as bowel occlusion or perforation, ureteric obstruction, entero-cutaneous fistula, or mesenteric ischaemia. When surgery is performed, efforts should be made to preserve function. When desmoid complications occur, if tumour excision would result in major small bowel sacrifice or other morbidity, it would be preferable to leave the tumour in place.

DTs.8

To date, there are no studies suggesting the effectiveness of chemoprevention in the development of DTs in patients with FAP. Additionally, no study has evaluated the role of chemoprevention after colorectal surgery, even in high-risk patients such as female patients or those with a family history of DTs. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an answer to the question. Only future studies that compare the use of chemoprevention after colorectal surgery in high-risk patients with those who do not receive such therapy will be able to evaluate any potential benefits of chemoprevention in patients with FAP after colonic resection.

### ACG clinical guideline: liver disease and pregnancy [^112EY5RL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Liver masses in pregnancy — Asymptomatic hemangioma and focal nodular hyperplasia do not need management or surveillance during pregnancy (strong recommendation, very low level evidence). Hepatic adenomas should be monitored with ultrasound during pregnancy for growth, and patients with large adenomas (> 5 cm) should be referred for resection before pregnancy (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). Spontaneous rupture of hemangiomas is exceedingly rare, even with large lesions, and routine symptomatic follow-up and standard vaginal delivery is safe. Focal nodular hyperplasia is found in 3% of the population with multiple case series in pregnant women reporting routine pregnancies with good clinical outcomes. If a hepatic adenoma is larger than 5 cm or rapid growth is noted, surgical or radiological intervention should be recommended before pregnancy.

Objective

The goals of this article are to provide an overview of controversial aspects of imaging-based screening and to elucidate potential risks that may offset anticipated benefits.

Conclusion

Current controversial topics associated with imaging-based screening include false-positive results, incidental findings, overdiagnosis, radiation risks, and costs. Alongside the benefits of screening, radiologists should be prepared to discuss these additional diagnostic consequences with providers and patients to better guide shared decision making regarding imaging-based screening.

### Diffusion-limited reactions in dynamic heterogeneous media [^112rH7N1]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Most biochemical reactions in living cells rely on diffusive search for target molecules or regions in a heterogeneous overcrowded cytoplasmic medium. Rapid rearrangements of the medium constantly change the effective diffusivity felt locally by a diffusing particle and thus impact the distribution of the first-passage time to a reaction event. Here, we investigate the effect of these dynamic spatiotemporal heterogeneities onto diffusion-limited reactions. We describe a general mathematical framework to translate many results for ordinary homogeneous Brownian motion to heterogeneous diffusion. In particular, we derive the probability density of the first-passage time to a reaction event and show how the dynamic disorder broadens the distribution and increases the likelihood of both short and long trajectories to reactive targets. While the disorder slows down reaction kinetics on average, its dynamic character is beneficial for a faster search and realization of an individual reaction event triggered by a single molecule.

### Resection of an endocardial uterine sarcoma metastasis to the tricuspid valve apparatus with valve repair [^117AkeMk]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Medium credibility.

Case Description

A 69-year-old female patient underwent a total laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for uterine sarcoma. Pathology was reported as a 9.8-cm, low-grade estrogen and progesterone receptor–positive endometrial stromal sarcoma with necrosis, lymphovascular invasion, and negative resection margins. One year later, the patient underwent an upper vaginectomy for a focus of microscopic recurrent sarcoma, which was resected completely. The patient did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy or immunotherapy, with plans for close clinical follow-up.

During follow-up at 8 months, an intracardiac mass was noted on computed tomography of the chest. Cardiac computed tomography demonstrated a large heterogeneous mass in the right ventricular outflow tract. At least 2 large lobes were seen that measured 1.2 × 1.2 cm and 1.7 × 0.9 cm. The density of the mass suggested that it was a tumor rather than a thrombus (Figure 1). A transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed the presence of the mass and revealed mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Bilateral ventricular systolic function was preserved. Additional workup did not reveal any evidence of metastatic disease. The patient did not have any arrhythmias or heart failure symptoms.

### Evaluating the effect of maternal opioid maintenance dose on the NOWS-COS outcome criteria: a pilot study [^113WvgJm]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we have presented the first evidence of maternal MME dose being associated with time to NOWS infant symptom control and risk of developmental delays by 24 months of age. We propose that non-pharmacologic interventions for consolability should be optimized for infants exposed to higher maternal MME doses. Maternal MME did not predict need for pharmacologic treatment of NOWS. In addition, we propose that infants with higher prenatal MME exposure be increasingly observed for developmental delays prior to 24 months of age to allow for prompt early intervention services.

### The recovery assessment scale-domains and stages (RAS-DS): sensitivity to change over time and convergent validity with level of unmet need [^117CRT8s]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

There is a need for robust outcome measures for use in psychiatric services. Particularly lacking are self-rated recovery measures with evidence of sensitivity to change. This study was established to examine the convergent validity and sensitivity to change over time (responsiveness) of the Recovery Assessment Scale - Domains and Stages (RAS-DS), in comparison to level of unmet need as measured by the Camberwell Assessment of Need - Short Appraisal Scale (CANSAS). Convergent validity was examined through cross-sectional correlations between 540 CANSAS and RAS-DS scores collected on the same day for the same individuals. Sensitivity to change was examined using correlations between change scores in CANSAS and RAS-DS where both were collected on the same day and the two time points were separated by 90 days or more (n = 498). Results demonstrated moderate, significant cross-sectional correlations between CANSAS scores and RAS-DS total and domain scores and between change scores of both instruments. Results suggest that the RAS-DS is sensitive enough to detect change over time. Only moderate correlation between the RAS-DS and CANSAS suggests that, in the context of recovery-oriented service provision, it is important to measure self-reported recovery in addition to level of unmet needs.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement on management of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^113GXp7H]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (pitNETs) — treatment approach: Endoscopic transsphenoidal resection remains the first-line therapy for all pitNETs requiring treatment except for prolactinomas; patients with large pitNETs causing mass effects, acromegaly, or Cushing disease require surgery, whereas nonfunctioning macroadenomas confined to the sella and most microadenomas may be managed conservatively with serial imaging. Medical therapy is first-line for prolactinoma and is an alternative therapy when surgery is not curative or not an option; surgery for prolactinoma is reserved for intolerance or resistance to medical therapy and may be considered in women with macroadenomas desiring pregnancy. For prolactinoma, bromocriptine and cabergoline are both safe for use in pregnancy. Radiation therapy, most commonly administered as single-fraction radiosurgery to the pituitary tumor, may be used for recurrent or aggressive nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas and as second- or third-line treatment in acromegaly or Cushing disease after surgery; it can also be used concomitantly with medical therapy.

### American Society of Plastic Surgeons evidence-based clinical practice guideline revision: reduction mammaplasty [^111WEkAC]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). High credibility.

American Society of Plastic Surgeons — Recommendation 1 (reduction mammaplasty for symptomatic breast hypertrophy): The work group recommends that postmenarche female patients presenting with breast hypertrophy should be offered reduction mammaplasty surgery as first-line therapy over nonoperative therapy based solely on the presence of multiple symptoms rather than resection weight. Aggregate evidence quality is described as High and the strength of recommendation as Strong. Reported benefits include improving QOL, faster relief of symptoms, greater patient satisfaction, faster return to activity, and improved function, while risks include potential surgical complications, anesthesia-related cost and complications, time off work, potentially reduced ability to breastfeed, and postoperative pain. Benefit-harm assessment indicates a preponderance of benefit, value judgments state evidence is not specific to volume or resection weight and shows all symptomatic patients benefit from surgery, the role of patient preferences notes that even though surgery is offered a patient may choose not to have surgery but data support surgery as definitive for correction of this disorder, and exclusions are patients who are not good candidates for surgery.

Susceptibility Tests

Interpretive criteria for urinary isolates have not been established for Proquin XR. Interpretive criteria established based on systemic drug levels may not be appropriate for uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

Dilution Techniques: Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method1(broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of ciprofloxacin powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria:

For testing Enterobacteriaceae:

A report of "Susceptible" indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentration usually achievable. A report of "Intermediate" indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and if the microorganism is not fully-susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of "Resistant" indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentration usually achievable; other therapy should be selected.

Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard ciprofloxacin powder should provide the following MIC values:

Diffusion Techniques: Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure2requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 5-mcg ciprofloxacin to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to ciprofloxacin.

Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 5-mcg ciprofloxacin disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria:

For testing Enterobacteriaceae:

Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for ciprofloxacin.

As with standardized dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. For the diffusion technique, the 5-mcg ciprofloxacin disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory quality control strains:

### Clinical aspects of selected… [^112JNCHU]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Several tumor markers exist that may be helpful in the evaluation of patients with adnexal masses. CA 125 is an antigenic determinant found in benign and malignant conditions. CA 125 level should not be used as a screening tool or when a mass is not identified, 17 and should not be routinely used during the diagnostic workup of an adnexal mass in a premenopausal patient. IMAGING Despite advances in technology, gray-scale transvaginal ultrasonography remains the standard for the evaluation of adnexal masses. 18, 20, 24 Ultrasonography should assess size, mass characteristics, complexity, and the presence or absence of abdominal or pelvic fluid. Ultrasonography characteristics of simple cysts include: anechoic mass; smooth, thin walls; no mural nodules or septations; and association with acoustic enhancement.

29 Findings that suggest malignancy include CA 125 level greater than 35 U per mL or 200 U per mL; evidence of abdominal or distant metastasis; family history of first-degree relative with ovarian or breast cancer; nodular or fixed pelvic mass; and concerning ultrasonography findings, including a solid component, thick septations, bilaterality, Doppler flow to the solid component of the mass, and presence of ascites. Nonpregnant, premenopausal women with an adnexal mass most likely have a follicular cyst. Simple cysts 10 cm or smaller can be managed conservatively with serial ultrasonography. Postmenopausal women with a simple cyst 10 cm or smaller should have a CA 125 level drawn.

If the level is greater than 35 U per mL, they should be referred. If it is less than 35 U per mL, the patient can be monitored with close follow-up and serial ultrasonography every four to six weeks, regardless of the patient's age. 20.

### Diagnosis and management of the adnexal mass… [^117KcTgc]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Differential Diagnosis The broad differential diagnosis of an adnexal mass includes lesions of infectious origin, such as a hydrosalpinx or tubo-ovarian abscess caused by pelvic inflammatory disease; physiologic or functional cysts; endometriomas; both benign and malignant neoplasms, and masses originating in organs or tissues proximal to the adnexa. Important considerations in arriving at the most probable diagnosis are the age of the patient, the history, the findings on physical examination and the results of radiologic and laboratory studies. Particular attention should be directed to the bimanual and rectovaginal examinations. The bimanual examination is helpful in estimating the size, location, consistency and mobility of a mass. The rectovaginal examination allows assessment of the posterior uterine surface, the uterosacral ligaments, the parametria, the pouch of Douglas and the rectum.

In premenopausal women, the presence of a complex adnexal mass, cul-de-sac nodularity and shortened or tender uterosacral ligaments suggests endometriosis. These same findings in the postmenopausal patient may signify malignancy. Masses anterior to the uterus may be dermoid cysts. 4 A post-menopausal ovary twice the size of the contralateral one is considered a suspicious finding. Ultrasound can also indicate whether a mass is cystic or solid, whether its contour is smooth or contains excrescences, and whether it contains any internal septa or papillae. Each of the latter characteristics is suggestive of malignancy. The presence of ascites also may indicate a malignant process. Serum tumor markers are helpful in some cases. The possibility of a germ cell tumor must be considered when a solid adnexal mass is found in a premenarchal or adolescent patient.

Tumor markers that are useful in this setting include alpha-fetoprotein as a marker for endodermal sinus tumors, lactic dehydrogenase for dysgerminomas, and β-hCG for nongestational choriocarcinomas. Mixed germ cell tumors and embryonal carcinomas may produce all three of these markers. One suggestion for following these patients includes ultrasound evaluation at three, six, nine and 12 months and annually thereafter. 2 A cyst greater than 3 cm in diameter can be evaluated laparoscopically. Symptomatic patients with an ultrasonographically suspicious mass and an elevated serum CA-125 level should be referred for surgical evaluation.
