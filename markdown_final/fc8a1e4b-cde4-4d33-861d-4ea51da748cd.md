## Question

What is the appropriate ciprofloxacin dosage for an ear infection with a perforated tympanic membrane?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate use and dosing of ciprofloxacin ear drops for an ear infection when the tympanic membrane is perforated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which clinical scenarios count as "perforated TM" and how that changes therapy. Then, I should verify which ciprofloxacin otic products are FDA‑labeled for these scenarios and what the exact dose is. Next, I will review administration technique, safety and ototoxicity considerations, and whether topical therapy alone suffices or if systemic antibiotics are needed. Finally, I will consider effects on tympanic membrane healing and provide a clear, reference‑anchored recommendation with caveats for special populations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts. A "perforated TM" can be acute otitis media with spontaneous perforation and otorrhea, acute otitis media in a child with tympanostomy tubes, chronic suppurative otitis media with persistent perforation, or acute otitis externa with a coincident nonintact membrane. The presence of a nonintact TM shifts us toward non‑ototoxic topical agents when using ear drops and prompts careful technique to deliver medication into the middle ear space as appropriate, so I need to ensure the chosen drop is safe across the membrane and that the indication matches the scenario [^114C4PPy] [^113LJRNc].

> I will now examine the formulations. Initially, I was going to say "ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone (Ciprodex) is FDA‑approved specifically for perforated TMs", but wait, I should verify the exact labeled indications. Hold on, I should verify the label language: Ciprodex is approved for acute otitis media in pediatric patients with tympanostomy tubes and for acute otitis externa; that label does not explicitly state spontaneous TM perforation, although clinically we treat nonintact TMs with non‑ototoxic fluoroquinolone drops for safety and efficacy. Single‑agent ciprofloxacin otic (Cetraxal) is labeled for acute otitis externa, not for AOM with tubes, so for AOM with tubes the labeled ciprofloxacin option is the ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone combination [^114C4PPy] [^114AJp6m] [^114K65fw].

> Next, I should review the precise dosing. For ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% otic suspension (Ciprodex), the FDA‑labeled dose for acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes in pediatric patients aged 6 months and older is 4 drops into the affected ear twice daily for 7 days; each 4‑drop dose equals 0.14 mL and delivers 0.42 mg ciprofloxacin with 0.14 mg dexamethasone. The same 4 drops twice daily for 7 days regimen applies to acute otitis externa in patients 6 months and older. To reduce dizziness, the bottle should be warmed in the hand before use, and the unused portion should be discarded after therapy completion [^114AJp6m] [^116mKAFi].

> Wait, let me verify administration technique because penetration into the middle ear can matter with a perforation. The bottle should be shaken well; the patient should lie with the affected ear up; after instilling 4 drops, gentle tragal pumping about five times helps the suspension traverse the tube or perforation; the position should be maintained for about a minute; and if both ears are treated, repeat on the other side. This technique is described in labeling and is important for efficacy when the TM is nonintact [^114AJp6m].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about when topical therapy alone is enough. In tympanostomy tube otorrhea, current pediatric tube guidelines recommend topical antibiotic ear drops alone without routine oral antibiotics for uncomplicated cases, making Ciprodex 4 drops twice daily for 7 days a guideline‑concordant choice. In contrast, for AOM with spontaneous TM perforation in a child without tubes, I should confirm systemic therapy needs. AOM guidelines emphasize that the presence of otorrhea signifies definite AOM for which systemic antibiotics are generally indicated; moreover, data from high‑risk pediatric populations support systemic therapy to prevent complications and facilitate resolution. In CSOM with chronic discharge through a perforation, topical quinolone therapy is superior to systemic antibiotics for short‑term clearance of otorrhea. So, I need to align the plan to the specific diagnosis, recognizing that Ciprodex dosing is best anchored to AOM with tubes or AOE, whereas systemic therapy plus or minus topical drops may be appropriate for spontaneous perforation AOM, and topical quinolones are favored for CSOM discharge [^113deHyA] [^113LJRNc] [^112UW88w] [^111wqyZs] [^1166cArA].

> I need to check safety and ototoxicity considerations. Guidelines advise selecting a non‑ototoxic topical agent if the TM is nonintact, which supports fluoroquinolone drops rather than aminoglycosides. Pharmacokinetic and intratympanic sampling data show minimal systemic absorption of ciprofloxacin and low risk of inner ear exposure with clinical intratympanic use, and ofloxacin otic pharmacokinetics likewise demonstrate very low serum levels with high local concentrations. Although a large pediatric claims analysis did not find an increased short‑term sensorineural hearing loss signal with neomycin in nonintact TMs, the class ototoxic potential of aminoglycosides and guideline recommendations still steer us to fluoroquinolones when a perforation or tube is present [^114C4PPy] [^114s7J9z] [^113WuyXo] [^1121xwHH].

> But wait, what about effects on tympanic membrane healing. Animal studies suggest that ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone can delay TM wound healing compared with ofloxacin or saline, with all perforations ultimately healing and a transient modulation of closure also seen in myringotomy models; a larger animal series even noted delayed healing persisting longest with the ciprofloxacin plus dexamethasone combination. However, clinical data in pediatric tympanoplasty cohorts did not show worse closure rates with postoperative ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone compared with no drops, so I should balance animal findings against human clinical outcomes and the clear anti‑infective benefit during active otorrhea [^117AGa52] [^115zqL6Z] [^1149ap38] [^112esvXF].

> Let me consider related options to ensure I am not missing a better‑labeled alternative. Ofloxacin otic 0.3% is FDA‑labeled for AOE in patients 6 months and older, AOM with tympanostomy tubes in children 1 year and older, and CSOM with perforated TM in patients 12 years and older, which is why some clinicians prefer ofloxacin when labeling alignment is important. That said, the question is about ciprofloxacin; in the AOM with tubes and AOE spaces, ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is on‑label and well supported for 4 drops twice daily for 7 days. I should double‑check allergy history to quinolones and avoid use if there is hypersensitivity, and I should counsel to keep the ear dry during treatment regardless of the agent chosen [^1157U72e] [^114AJp6m] [^116mKAFi].

> I should confirm special populations and monitoring. Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is approved down to 6 months of age for AOM with tubes and AOE, with no routine laboratory monitoring needed due to minimal systemic exposure; pregnancy data are limited, so a risk‑benefit discussion is prudent if applicable. Reassessment is warranted if symptoms are not improving within 48–72 hours or if severe systemic features are present, in which case systemic antibiotics and an otolaryngology exam may be needed, especially for suspected spontaneous perforation AOM or CSOM flare [^116mKAFi] [^113LJRNc].

> Putting this together, my summary recommendation is as follows. For an ear infection with a nonintact tympanic membrane, when the diagnosis is acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes or acute otitis externa, ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% otic suspension at 4 drops into the affected ear twice daily for 7 days is an FDA‑labeled, guideline‑concordant regimen; each dose is 0.14 mL and contains 0.42 mg ciprofloxacin and 0.14 mg dexamethasone, and proper administration includes shaking, tragal pumping, and keeping the ear up for about a minute. If the scenario is AOM with spontaneous TM perforation, I need to ensure appropriate systemic therapy is initiated and consider adding a non‑ototoxic topical fluoroquinolone; if it is chronic suppurative otitis media, topical quinolone therapy is favored for clearing otorrhea. I should re‑evaluate promptly if there is no improvement within 48–72 hours or if there are red flags, and I will avoid aminoglycoside‑containing drops across a perforation in line with safety guidance [^114AJp6m] [^116mKAFi] [^113deHyA] [^113LJRNc] [^111wqyZs].

For ear infections with a perforated tympanic membrane, the recommended ciprofloxacin otic dosage is **four drops twice daily for seven days** [^114AJp6m]. This regimen is **safe and effective** [^1139wMdZ] in acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes [^111qJzSU] and in acute otitis externa [^116mKAFi], with no significant ototoxicity reported [^114s7J9z]. If symptoms persist after seven days, reassess and consider alternative therapy [^113A8jH6].

---

## Recommended dosage regimen

- **Dosage**: Four drops (0.14 mL) into the affected ear twice daily for seven days [^114AJp6m] [^116mKAFi].
- **Administration**: Warm the bottle in hand for 1–2 minutes before use to avoid dizziness; instill drops with the affected ear upward, pump the tragus five times, and maintain position for 60 seconds [^114AJp6m].
- **Duration**: Seven days; reassess if symptoms persist [^114AJp6m] [^113A8jH6].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosage

Clinical evidence includes **efficacy** data [^112iqTm4] demonstrating the superiority of ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone over ofloxacin for clinical cure and microbiologic success in pediatric AOM with tympanostomy tubes [^111qJzSU], and **safety** data indicating no significant ototoxicity with topical ciprofloxacin [^1139wMdZ], even with TM perforation [^114s7J9z].

---

## Safety considerations

The risk of **ototoxicity** is low [^114tpDwi] with topical ciprofloxacin [^1139wMdZ], even with TM perforation [^114s7J9z], and **adverse effects** may include mild local irritation or discomfort.

---

## Alternative treatments

Among topical fluoroquinolones, **ofloxacin** is an alternative with similar efficacy and safety [^1157U72e] [^1139wMdZ]. Consider **systemic antibiotics** only for severe or refractory infections [^114C4PPy] [^111wqyZs].

---

## Clinical guidelines

According to the **AAO-HNSF guidelines** [^114C4PPy], non-ototoxic topical preparations are recommended for known or suspected TM perforation [^1121xwHH].

---

The recommended ciprofloxacin otic dosage for ear infections with a perforated tympanic membrane is **four drops twice daily for seven days** [^116mKAFi], supported by strong efficacy and safety evidence.

### Intratympanic ciprofloxacin and the human labyrinthine sampling model [^114s7J9z]. The Laryngoscope (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to investigate the potential absorption of intratympanic ciprofloxacin through the human round window membrane.

- **Study design**: A prospective study.

- **Methods**: Ciprofloxacin was instilled into the middle ear of 10 patients undergoing acoustic tumor removal. The lateral semicircular canal and vestibule were subsequently opened, and using a microsyringe, labyrinthine fluid was aspirated. A sample each of serum and cerebrospinal fluid was also drawn.

- **Results**: Into each middle ear, 0.5 mL ciprofloxacin (0.3%) was instilled. The time interval between the ciprofloxacin application to the round window membrane and sampling of labyrinthine fluid and plasma ranged from 9 to 120 minutes. There was no measurable ciprofloxacin in the labyrinthine fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, or serum of 10 patients.

- **Conclusion**: The lack of measurable absorption of intratympanic ciprofloxacin into the inner ear indicates that the chance of ototoxicity when ciprofloxacin is used clinically, even in the presence of a tympanic membrane perforation, is low.

### Ciprodex [^114AJp6m]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Ciprodex is indicated for otic use (ears) only and is not suitable for ophthalmic use or injection.

- **Dosage and administration**: Prior to administration, shake the bottle well. Instill four drops into the affected ear twice daily for a duration of seven days.

- **Important administration instructions**: To effectively administer Ciprodex, ensure the patient lies with the affected ear facing upward. Instill the prescribed drops, then gently pump the tragus five times by pressing inward. This action helps facilitate penetration of the drops into the middle ear. Maintain this position for 60 seconds. If treatment is needed for both ears, repeat this procedure for the opposite ear. Any unused portion should be discarded after completing the therapy.

- **Dosage for acute otitis media in pediatric patients (age 6 months and older) with tympanostomy tubes**: The recommended dosage through tympanostomy tubes is four drops, equivalent to 0.14 mL of Ciprodex (comprising 0.42 mg of ciprofloxacin and 0.14 mg of dexamethasone), instilled into the affected ear twice daily for seven days. To minimize dizziness from the instillation of a cold suspension, the bottle should be warmed by holding it in the hand for one or two minutes.

- **Dosage for acute otitis externa (age 6 months and older)**: Four drops (equating to 0.14 mL of Ciprodex, which contains 0.42 mg ciprofloxacin and 0.14 mg dexamethasone) should be instilled into the affected ear twice daily for seven days.

### Ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% sterile otic suspension for the topical treatment of ear infections: A review of the literature [^1139wMdZ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to review the literature related to ciprofloxacin 0.3% and dexamethasone 0.1% sterile otic suspension. A systematic literature search utilizing Medline was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles related to safety and efficacy. A total of 47 publications were identified and reviewed herein. The literature supports the use of antibiotic/anti-inflammatory combination ear drops in the treatment of both acute otitis externa and acute otitis media in pediatric patients with tympanostomy tubes. Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone has been demonstrated as safe and effective with regard to clinical cures and microbiological eradication of pathogens in either disease with low treatment failure rates. Additionally, the literature also provides clear evidence for the contribution of dexamethasone when added to ciprofloxacin for the topical treatment of ear infections.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: A randomized clinical trial [^11753HNM]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

This study, "Ototopical Ciprofloxacin and Fluocinolone in AOE (Ciprofloxacin Plus Fluocinolone vs. Ciprofloxacin)", was published by Laurence Chu and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA Network Open. It examines the treatment of acute otitis externa. The trial investigates whether the combination of ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone acetonide is superior to ciprofloxacin alone in this condition.

The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT). It included 393 patients, comprising 198 females and 195 males. Participants were adults and pediatric patients over six months old with acute otitis externa. Notable exclusion criteria were any previous episode of acute otitis externa within four weeks or more than one episode within six months, tympanic membrane perforation, otitis media, and malignant otitis externa.

Interventions were as follows: 197 patients received ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide (ciprofloxacin 0.3% plus fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% otic solution twice daily for seven days), while 196 patients received ciprofloxacin alone (ciprofloxacin 0.3% otic solution twice daily for seven days).

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone in otitis media with tympanostomy tubes in pediatric patients: A randomized clinical trial [^112iqTm4]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2017). High credibility.

Acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes (AOMT) in children commonly presents with otorrhea and negatively affects their daily activities.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution relative to ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, otic solution alone and fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution alone in treating AOMT in children. Two twin multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trials with identical designs were conducted from June 24, 2011, through June 23, 2014, at ear, nose, and throat pediatric practices, general practices, hospitals, and clinical research centers. The study population comprised 662 children (331 in each trial) with AOMT in at least one ear who presented with moderate or severe purulent otorrhea for three weeks or less. Data analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone, ciprofloxacin alone, or fluocinolone alone twice daily for seven days and were evaluated on days 1 (baseline), 3 to 5 (undergoing therapy), 8 to 10 (end of therapy), and 18 to 22 (test of cure).

The primary efficacy measure was time to cessation of otorrhea. The principal secondary endpoint was sustained microbiological cure, defined as eradication or presumed eradication at end-of-therapy and test-of-cure visits.

A total of 662 children participating in the two studies were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone.

### Systemic antibiotics versus topical treatments for chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations [^111wqyZs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) causes ear discharge and impairs hearing. The objective of this study was to compare systemic antibiotics and topical antiseptics or antibiotics (excluding steroids) for treating chronically discharging ears with an underlying eardrum perforation (CSOM).

- **Search strategy**: The sources included the Cochrane ENT Disorders Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1951 to March 2005), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2005), LILACS (January 1982 to March 2005), AMED (1985 to March 2005), CINAHL (January 1982 to March 2005), OLDMEDLINE (January 1958 to December 1965), PREMEDLINE, Metadatabase of registers of ongoing trials (mRCT), and article references.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials were considered, evaluating any systemic versus topical treatment (excluding steroids) in participants with CSOM.

- **Data collection and analysis**: One author assessed eligibility and quality, extracted data, and entered data into RevMan. Two authors provided a second assessment of titles and abstracts, and offered input where there was ambiguity. Contact was made with investigators for clarifications.

- **Main results**: The study analyzed nine trials consisting of 833 randomised participants and 842 analyzed participants or ears. Definitions and severity of CSOM varied; some trials included mastoid cavity infections, other diagnoses, or complications. Methodological quality varied and was generally poorly reported, with short follow-ups and inconsistent handling of bilateral disease. Topical quinolone antibiotics were found to be superior to systemic antibiotics in clearing discharge at 1–2 weeks.

### Topical fluoroquinolones for eye and ear [^114tpDwi]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Topical fluoroquinolones are now available for use in the eye and ear. Their broad spectrum of activity includes common eye and ear pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For the treatment of acute otitis externa, these agents are as effective as previously available otic preparations. For the treatment of otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation, topical fluoroquinolones are effective and safe. These preparations are approved for use in children, and the lack of ototoxicity permits prolonged administration when necessary. Topical fluoroquinolones are not appropriate for the treatment of uncomplicated conjunctivitis where narrower spectrum agents suffice; instead, they represent a simplified regimen for the treatment of bacterial keratitis (corneal ulcers). When administered topically, fluoroquinolones are well tolerated and offer convenient dosing schedules. Currently, bacterial resistance appears limited.

### Topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension is superior to ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of children with acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes [^111qJzSU]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

To determine the efficacy and safety of topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension compared with ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes (AOMT) in pediatric patients, a multicenter, prospective, randomized, observer-masked, parallel-group study was conducted at 39 sites. The study involved 599 children aged ≥ 6 months to 12 years with an AOMT episode of ≤ 3 weeks' duration. The mean age of patients was 2.5 years (standard deviation: 2.37 years).

Patients received either ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% otic suspension, 4 drops twice daily for 7 days, or ofloxacin 0.3% otic solution, 5 drops twice daily for 10 days. Clinical signs and symptoms of AOMT were evaluated at clinic visits on days 1 (baseline), 3 (on therapy), 11 (end of therapy), and 18 (test of cure). A patient diary was used to measure the time to cessation of otorrhea. Principal pretherapy pathogens identified included Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.7%), Haemophilus influenzae (12.4%), S. epidermidis (10.2%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (4.1%).

Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone demonstrated superiority over ofloxacin for clinical cure (90% vs 78%) and microbiologic success (92% vs 81.8%) at the test-of-cure visit. It resulted in fewer treatment failures (4.4% vs 14.1%) and a shorter median time to cessation of otorrhea (4 days vs 6 days). Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment also showed superior improvement in clinical response by visit, absence of otorrhea by visit, and reduction of otorrhea duration.

### Sensorineural hearing loss associated with neomycin eardrops and nonintact tympanic membranes [^1121xwHH]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Use of neomycin eardrops in nonintact tympanic membranes (NITMs) due to tympanic membrane (TM) perforation or tympanostomy tubes (TTs) is controversial because of the potential for ototoxicity. We sought to compare the risk of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in patients with NITMs who received neomycin with those who received fluoroquinolone eardrops.

- **Study design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: Administrative claims data analysis, including diagnoses and procedure detail for physician office and hospital visits and pharmacy dispensing events in children eligible for Medicaid fee-for-service benefits in 29 states between 1999 and 2006.

- **Subjects and methods**: Eligible patients (age < 18 years) had to have received a study eardrop within 12 months after their first diagnosis of NITM. The follow-up period started from the first eardrop dispensing.

- **Main outcome measures**: We compared the 12-month risk of SNHL using Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for SNHL risk factors.

We found 982 SNHL cases in 134,598 children treated with neomycin or fluoroquinolone eardrops. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for 1, 2, and 3 or more prescriptions of neomycin was 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.76–1.07), 1.45 (1.05–2.01), and 1.30 (0.71–2.36), respectively, when adjusted for SNHL risk factors, the interval between initial diagnosis of NITM and eardrop initiation, and the total number of eardrop prescriptions. The results remained unchanged for several sensitivity analyses.

Short-term use of neomycin eardrops in patients with NITMs is not associated with an increased risk of sensorineural hearing loss.

### Ofloxacin [^113A8jH6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

It is very important to use the ear drops for as long as the doctor has instructed, even if the symptoms improve. If ofloxacin otic solution ear drops are not used for the full duration prescribed, the infection may recur more readily.

- **What if a dose is missed**: In patients with an ear canal infection ("Swimmer's Ear"), it is important to take the drops every day. If a dose scheduled earlier in the day (e.g. 8 AM) is missed, the dose should be taken as soon as possible, then resume the regular daily dosing schedule. For patients with a middle ear infection, a missed dose should also be taken as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for the next dose; in that case, skip the missed dose and return to the regular schedule. Do not take a double dose unless explicitly directed by a doctor. If the infection does not improve after one week, consult your doctor. Additionally, if there are two or more episodes of drainage within six months, further evaluation by a doctor is recommended.

- **What activities should be avoided while using ofloxacin otic solution**: It is crucial that the infected ear(s) remain clean and dry. Avoid getting the infected ear(s) wet during bathing, and refrain from swimming unless advised otherwise by a doctor.

### Types and causes of otorrhea [^112foxMy]. Auris, nasus, larynx (2003). High credibility.

Otorrhea, a condition characterized by ear discharge, can result from various causes including chronic otitis media, acute otitis externa, tympanic membrane perforation, skull fracture, suppurative otitis media, cholesteatoma, foreign bodies in the ear canal, malignant otitis externa, and mastoiditis.

### Clinical practice guideline: Acute otitis externa [^112G2Tdw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for managing diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as generalized inflammation of the external ear canal, potentially involving the pinna or tympanic membrane. The primary purpose is to promote the appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials and to highlight the necessity for adequate pain relief.

In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) selected a development group representing the fields of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, family medicine, infectious disease, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and medical informatics. The guideline was created using an explicit, a priori, evidence-based protocol.

The group made a strong recommendation that the management of AOE should include an assessment of pain, and clinicians should recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. Furthermore, clinicians should:

- **Distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the ear canal**.
- **Assess patients with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management**: nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy.
- **Utilize topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE**: systemic antimicrobial therapy should only be used if there is extension outside of the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that indicate a need for systemic therapy.

### Phase 3 trials of thermosensitive ciprofloxacin gel for middle ear effusion in children with tubes [^114juEsn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The cumulative proportion of otorrhea-only treatment failures, as documented by the blinded assessor during the external ear examination, was lower in patients who received OTO-201 than those who received TT alone starting at day 4 and at all visits through day 29. At day 15, the OTO-201 otorrhea treatment failure (per the blinded assessor) was 7.0%, compared with 19.4% for TT alone (age-adjusted OR, 0.303; P < 0.001).

- **Cumulative treatment failures**: The primary end point (day 15 treatment failure) was supported by subpopulation analyses, where lower treatment failures in the OTO-201 group were seen in the analysis by baseline culture status (positive or negative) and baseline effusion type. Sanguineous effusion had too few events to make any meaningful conclusions.

### Oxymetazoline, mupirocin, clotrimazole-safe, effective, off-label agents for tympanostomy tube care [^111LWvFY]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Objectives: Only a few medications have United States Food and Drug Administration indications for the prevention and/or treatment of infections in patients with tympanic perforations or tympanostomy tubes. We examined three off-label agents that have become important in tympanostomy tube care, hoping to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of each in experimental assays and human application.

Methods: Computerized literature review.

Results:

- **Oxymetazoline nasal spray**: Applied at the time of surgery, it is equivalent to fluoroquinolone ear drops in the prevention of early postsurgical otorrhea and tympanostomy tube occlusion at the first postoperative visit.
- **Topical mupirocin 2% ointment**: Effective alone or in combination with culture-directed systemic therapy for the treatment of tympanostomy tube otorrhea caused by community-acquired, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
- **Topical clotrimazole 1% cream**: Highly active against the common yeast and fungi that cause otomycosis. A single application after microscopic debridement will cure fungal tympanostomy tube otorrhea in most cases.

None of these three agents is ototoxic in animal histological or physiological studies, and each has proven safe in long-term clinical use.

Conclusions: Oxymetazoline nasal spray, mupirocin ointment, and clotrimazole cream are safe and effective as off-label medications for tympanostomy tube care in children.

### Phase 3 trials of thermosensitive ciprofloxacin gel for middle ear effusion in children with tubes [^113ntFTF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The integrated analysis of two phase 3 trials demonstrated that a single intraoperative administration of a liquid suspension of ciprofloxacin microparticles in a thermosensitive polymer (OTO-201) — which transitions to a gel — showed a lower cumulative proportion of treatment failures through day 15 compared to TT alone when administered intratympanically for bilateral MEE at the time of TTP.

### Safety and efficacy of intratympanic ciprofloxacin otic suspension in children with middle ear effusion undergoing tympanostomy tube placement: Two randomized clinical trials [^112XAB3a]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Otorrhea after tympanostomy tube placement (TTP) in children is common. Although the US Food and Drug Administration has not approved antibiotic ear drops for this use, they are routinely used intraoperatively and prescribed for multidose, multiday postoperative administration by caregivers.

The objective of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of a single-dose intratympanic, intraoperative, thermosensitive otic suspension of ciprofloxacin (OTO-201) in children requiring TTP.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Two identically designed, prospective, double-blind, sham-controlled, multicenter phase 3 randomized clinical trials included 532 patients aged 6 months to 17 years with middle ear effusions. Patients with confirmed bilateral effusions on the day of TTP were randomized to TTP alone or to TTP with OTO-201 injection. Children underwent a 28-day observation period. Data were collected from November 14, 2013, to June 3, 2014. Final follow-up was completed on June 16, 2014, and intent-to-treat data were analyzed from June 10 to August 27, 2014.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Efficacy was assessed as treatment failure, including the presence of otorrhea, use of otic or systemic antibiotics, loss to follow-up, or missed visits. Safety was assessed for serious adverse events and treatment-emergent adverse events using audiometry, otoscopy, and tympanometry.

- **Results**: Among the 532 patients included in the trials, 175 were randomized to TTP only and 357 to OTO-201 treatment (304 boys [57.1%]; 228 girls [42.9%]; mean [SD] age, 2.4 [2.1]). At day 15, the cumulative proportion of treatment…

### Topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone superior to oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes [^115xCujW]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension with oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid suspension in children with acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes.

- **Methods**: This study was a randomized, observer-masked, parallel-group, multicenter trial involving 80 children aged 6 months to 12 years. The trial compared the efficacy of topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension with that of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid suspension in treating acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes. Adverse events related to ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension included ear pain (5.1%).

### Risk for tympanic membrane perforation after quinolone ear drops for acute otitis externa [^112bJmRr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

This study examined whether the use of quinolone ear drops increased the risk of perforation with intact tympanic membranes and acute otitis externa (AOE).

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort study using Medicaid clinical encounter and pharmacy billing records from 1999 through 2010. Children and adults had to have 24 months of continuous enrollment in Medicaid prior to the first antibiotic ear drop dispensing (index date), and they had to maintain their enrollment for at least 18 months thereafter. Included ear drops were ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin plus hydrocortisone, ciprofloxacin plus dexamethasone, and neomycin plus hydrocortisone. Tympanic membrane perforation (TMP) was identified as 2 inpatient or outpatient encounters associated with TMP diagnosis at least 30 days apart. A Cox regression model adjusting for patient demographics, calendar year, and the number of ear drop prescriptions was used to compare TMP risk between quinolone and neomycin-exposed patients.

- **Results**: A total of 94,333 patients entered the study cohort. Use of quinolone ear drops was associated with increased risk for TMP compared with neomycin plus hydrocortisone, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.26 (95% confidence interval, 1.34–3.83). Adjusted hazard ratios were 2.53 (95% CI, 1.27–5.05) for ofloxacin, 2.24 (95% CI, 1.03–4.85) for ciprofloxacin plus hydrocortisone, and 2.30 (95% CI, 1.09–4.87) for ciprofloxacin plus dexamethasone. Sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analysis.

- **Conclusions**: Use of quinolone ear drops to treat AOE is associated with a previous increase in TMP risk.

### The development and evaluation of a smartphone-aided diagnosis application to measure tympanic membrane perforations [^114aBCy8]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic otitis media is a long-term infection of the middle ear, characterized by persistent discharge from the middle ear through a perforated tympanic membrane. It is one of the most common causes of preventable hearing loss, especially in developing countries. Precise estimation of the size of tympanic membrane perforation is essential for successful clinical management. This study involved the development of a smartphone-based application designed to calculate the ratio of tympanic membrane perforation area to the overall area of the tympanic membrane.

A total of 12 standardized patients, along with 60 medical students, participated in assessing the area of tympanic membrane perforation, specifically focusing on the percentage of perforation size.

- **Methods**: Sixty student doctors, including year 5 and year 6 medical students, as well as interns and post-graduate trainees, were recruited during their rotation at the Otolaryngology department of Taipei Medical University Shuang-Ho Hospital. Simultaneously, twelve standardized patients with chronic otitis media were selected through a single otology practice. An oto-endoscopic examination was performed for all patients using a commercially available digital oto-endoscope, and clinical images of the tympanic membrane perforation were obtained. To demonstrate the variability in perforation size estimation by different student doctors, the smartphone-based application was employed to calculate the percentage of perforation for 12 tympanic membranes objectively, with the results compared to those visually estimated by the 60 student doctors subjectively.

### The influence of ciprofloxacin-dexamethasone ear drops on perforation closure rates after endoscopic tympanoplasty [^112esvXF]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Low credibility.

This study evaluates the effect of ciprofloxacin-dexamethasone (CD) ear drops on the success of tympanoplasty, specifically in the context of pediatric endoscopic procedures. Topical ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone have been shown to disrupt the healing of tympanic membrane perforations in animal models. However, there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effect of CD ear drops on the success rate of tympanoplasty. We compare perforation closure rates in pediatric endoscopic tympanoplasty with and without the use of postoperative CD.

- **Study design**: This research utilizes a retrospective comparative cohort study.

- **Setting**: The study was conducted at a tertiary referral center.

- **Patients**: The study involved 162 totally endoscopic tympanoplasties using porcine-derived collagen grafts in children, with a mean age of 12.0 years (range 2.3–17.9 years).

- **Intervention**: Patients received either a prescription of CD or no ear drops in the immediate postoperative period.

- **Main outcome measure**: The primary measure was the perforation closure rate two months after the totally endoscopic tympanoplasty.

Results showed that postoperative CD was given to 65 (40%) ears; no drops were given to the remainder. Overall, successful closure of tympanic membrane perforation was achieved in 140 (86%) of ears. The closure rate did not significantly differ between ears given CD postoperatively and those not given CD (54/65 [83%] vs. 86/97 [89%], Fisher's p = 0.35). Multiple logistical regression revealed no confounding effect of other variables on the outcome, including age, revision surgery, graft position, or type of postoperative packing material.

In conclusion, the results indicate no harm or benefit from prescribing drops containing ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone for the success of perforation closure after tympanoplasty. Allocation to treatment in this retrospective study was non-randomized.

### Phase 3 trials of thermosensitive ciprofloxacin gel for middle ear effusion in children with tubes [^113ZUr4z]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The cumulative proportion of treatment failures through day 15 was analyzed for the per-protocol population as a sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint. Additional sensitivity analyses included the number and percentage of patients in the intent-to-treat population with treatment failures through day 15, summarized by subgroup according to sex, race, ethnicity, age stratum, baseline culture status, baseline effusion type, and microbiology culture positivity.

Secondary efficacy endpoints included cumulative proportions of treatment failures (full analysis and per-protocol), including by defined cause of treatment failure (full analysis) at days 4, 8, and 29; the cumulative proportion of otorrhea-only treatment failures (i.e. otorrhea as identified by the blinded assessor) at day 15; and microbiologic response at days 15 and 29 with presumption (for patients with positive baseline cultures and without post-baseline cultures who were not treatment failures) or without presumption (for patients with positive baseline cultures and negative post-baseline cultures).

### Earache [^114fDnEw]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Earache, a common emergency department presentation, may be caused by a variety of conditions, some distant from the ear. This article discusses the diagnosis and treatment of:

- **Acute otitis media**: Inflammation or infection of the middle ear.
- **Otitis media with effusion**: Fluid accumulation in the middle ear without signs of infection.
- **Otitis externa**: Infection of the ear canal.
- **Otitis media with ruptured tympanic membrane or tympanostomy tubes**: Occurs when there is a tear in the eardrum or in the presence of ear tubes.
- **Malignant otitis externa**: A severe infection that extends to the bones of the ear canal and the base of the skull.
- **Mastoiditis and petrositis**: Infections of the mastoid bone of the skull and the petrous part of the temporal bone, respectively.
- **Traumatic ruptured tympanic membrane**: Eardrum damage due to injury.
- **Cerumen impactions**: Accumulation of earwax blocking the ear canal.
- **Foreign bodies in the ears**: Objects lodged in the ear canal.

These conditions highlight the importance of accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment in emergency settings.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Goc25]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Low credibility.

Use of exogenous bFGF in tympanic membrane (TM) regeneration has been studied extensively. In the last decade, bFGF has been evaluated as an effective and convenient therapy, supported by numerous experimental and clinical studies. The application of bFGF as an eardrop directly via the transcanal route has been shown to be simple and convenient. Although the majority of studies report encouraging outcomes, these are primarily observed in acute or traumatic TM perforation models. For chronic TM perforations, bFGF has been used in combination with a graft material such as Gelfoam or a collagen patch, leaving the direct effectiveness of bFGF in chronic perforation unclear. Additionally, the most effective dosage, duration, frequency of application, and the presence of patching materials remain to be fully investigated.

Mondain et al. observed that high doses of bFGF (e.g. 400 ng) caused myringitis; in contrast, Lou indicated this dosage was not associated with severe complications such as cholesteatoma and infection. Although otorrhoea was reported with excessive application of a single dosage, it only prolonged the closure time and did not affect the closure rate. The safety of bFGF has been extensively investigated in the literature.

Lou et al. reported that patching materials were not necessary for the topical application of bFGF in acute TM perforation. However, other studies have shown that bFGF, in combination with bioscaffolds, can significantly promote TM healing. Indeed, graft materials and bFGF enhance TM repair in different ways: bioscaffolds provide structural support.

### How does closure of tympanic membrane perforations affect hearing and middle ear mechanics? An evaluation in a patient cohort and temporal bone models [^116uvAxM]. Otology & Neurotology (2012). Low credibility.

This study aimed to determine how tympanic membrane (TM) perforations and their closure, using a paper-patch technique, affect middle-ear mechanics and, thus, conductive hearing for different sizes of the TM perforation.

Temporal bone (TB) study and prospective clinical trial were conducted in a tertiary referral center. The study included nine patients with chronic otitis media for more than three months. The TM perforations were closed with a paper patch in all nine patients. In five out of nine patients, myringoplasty was performed. Matching TM perforations were created in a TB model (n = 8) and closed using the paper patch.

- **Main outcome measures**: Air-bone gap was measured in all nine patients of the patient cohort with TM perforations before and after closure and in five patients after myringoplasty. Stapes velocity and sound pressure difference between the ear canal and middle-ear cavity were measured in TBs with intact TM, with TM perforations, and with the perforations closed by the paper patch. All measurements in the patient cohort and TBs were performed for different sizes of TM perforations to determine if the effects varied as a function of size.

- **Results**: The degree of the air-bone gap differed as a function of the size of the TM perforations and its recovery after closure. Myringoplasty was independent of the size of the TM perforation in the frequency range of 0.25 to 4 kHz. In the TB measurements, although the pressure difference across the TM was almost fully recovered by closing the perforation with a paper patch, recovery of the stapes motion was limited across certain frequencies.

### Effects of ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone and ofloxacin on tympanic membrane perforation healing [^117AGa52]. Otology & Neurotology (2007). Low credibility.

The hypothesis suggests that exposure to ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone, but not ofloxacin, prolongs tympanic membrane (TM) healing. Exposure to hydrocortisone has been shown to delay TM wound healing. However, no published studies have compared the effects of ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone and ofloxacin on TM healing.

The methods involved creating noninfected TM perforations in 30 rats. These rats were divided into three groups, and ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone, ofloxacin, or isotonic sodium chloride solution drops were instilled for 8 days. Tympanic membrane healing was analyzed at specified intervals using photographic documentation verified by a blinded observer.

The results showed that the isotonic sodium chloride solution control and ofloxacin-exposed TMs healed at similar rates. There was a statistically significant delay in TM healing in the ciprofloxacin-/dexamethasone-exposed TMs by postoperative Day 10. However, all TM perforations were healed by postoperative Day 20. Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone delays healing of experimental TM perforations, but the brief exposure in this study did not cause persistent perforations.

### Chronic otorrhoea, otalgia and hearing loss not responding to antibiotics and tympanoplasty surgery [^115v3jfS]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic otorrhoea resulting from a tympanic membrane perforation is a common condition. We present the case of a patient who had previously received seemingly adequate treatment for his condition. Despite this, he presented to our outpatient clinic with worsening otalgia and otorrhoea, progressive hearing loss, and a new tympanic membrane perforation. After a thorough otological evaluation, the patient's medical history and the histological specimen from a previous operation were reviewed. The findings met the diagnostic criteria of eosinophilic otitis media. Following treatment with topical triamcinolone through the perforated tympanic membrane, the patient's otalgia subsided, hearing levels improved, and the size of the tympanic membrane perforation decreased.

### Tympanic membrane changes in central tympanic membrane perforations [^116QmoBb]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the histopathological changes in central tympanic membrane perforations caused by chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma.

- **Materials and methods**: Twenty-nine temporal bones from 25 patients (13 male and 12 female) with central tympanic membrane perforations, including 18 chronic otitis media with perforation and 11 chronic otitis media with perforation caused by ventilation tubes, and 30 age-matched normal temporal bones were included in this study. A scale was used to evaluate the extension of the migration of stratified squamous epithelium on the inner surface of the tympanic membrane. The thickness of tympanic membranes was measured halfway between the annular ligament and the perforation and compared with that of the normal bones. The presence of tympanosclerosis and papillary projections of squamous epithelium was also noted.

- **Results**: The extension of the migration of stratified squamous epithelium on the inner surface of the tympanic membrane was observed in 11 of the 29 perforations (38%). The thickness of tympanic membranes was significantly different between the perforation groups and the control group. Of the 29 tympanic membranes, 13 (44%) had tympanosclerosis and 8 (28%) revealed papillary projections of squamous epithelium.

- **Conclusions**: Our study shows that a central tympanic perforation should not merely be considered a simple defect. Most of the tympanic membranes showed one or more signs of sequelae or persistent abnormalities such as tympanosclerosis, papillary projections, thickening, and additional changes.

### Phase 3 trials of thermosensitive ciprofloxacin gel for middle ear effusion in children with tubes [^1134fxPT]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was assessed by the cumulative proportion of treatment failures (days 4–15). Treatment failure was defined as one of the following, whichever occurred first:

1. **Otorrhea treatment failure**: The presence of tympanostomy tube (TT) otorrhea in one or both ears, as noted by a blinded assessor during the visual external ear examination on or after 3 days postsurgery (day 4).
2. **Otic treatment failure**: The patient received otic antibiotic drops any time postsurgery through day 15 prior to otorrhea confirmation by the blinded assessor.
3. **Systemic antibiotic treatment failure**: The patient received a systemic antibiotic any time postsurgery through day 15 prior to otorrhea confirmation by the blinded assessor.
4. **Loss to follow-up**.
5. **Missed visit treatment failure**: The patient not lost to follow-up who had a missing treatment failure status at a visit through day 15.

An effusion sample taken at the time of surgery was collected for microbiologic culture, sensitivity, and exploratory microbiologic testing. In addition to the otoscopic examination performed by the unblinded investigator, the assessment of TT otorrhea (a visual external ear examination) for the efficacy endpoint occurred on days 4, 8, 15, and 29 by the blinded assessor.

If the blinded assessor confirmed otorrhea in either ear on or after 3 days postsurgery (day 4), a specimen for culture was obtained, and the patient was eligible to receive ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone, 4 drops twice a day.

### Ofloxacin [^113WuyXo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Clinical pharmacology:

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Drug concentrations in serum (in subjects with tympanostomy tubes and perforated tympanic membranes), in otorrhea, and in mucosa of the middle ear (in subjects with perforated tympanic membranes) were determined following otic administration of ofloxacin solution. In two single-dose studies, mean ofloxacin serum concentrations were low in adult patients with tympanostomy tubes, with and without otorrhea, after otic administration of a 0.3% solution (4.1 ng/mL (n = 3) and 5.4 ng/mL (n = 5), respectively). In adults with perforated tympanic membranes, the maximum serum drug level of ofloxacin detected was 10 ng/mL after administration of a 0.3% solution. Ofloxacin was detectable in the middle ear mucosa of some adult subjects with perforated tympanic membranes (11 of 16 subjects). The variability of ofloxacin concentration in middle ear mucosa was high, ranging from 1.2 mcg/g to 602 mcg/g after otic administration of a 0.3% solution. Ofloxacin was present in high concentrations in otorrhea (389 mcg/g to 2,850 mcg/g, n = 13) 30 minutes after otic administration of a 0.3% solution in subjects with chronic suppurative otitis media and perforated tympanic membranes. However, the measurement of ofloxacin in the otorrhea does not necessarily reflect the exposure of the middle ear to ofloxacin.

- **Microbiology**: Ofloxacin has in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms. It exerts its antibacterial activity by inhibiting DNA gyrase, a bacterial topoisomerase. DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination.

### The impact of platelet-derived growth factor on closure of chronic tympanic membrane perforations: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^1136NpAn]. Otology & Neurotology (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with tympanic membrane (TM) perforations often have infections, and repetitive topical treatment may be required. These infections can be prevented by the permanent closure of the TM perforation. Different surgical treatment options have been described, but noninvasive techniques may be preferred as they carry less risk than surgery. One noninvasive approach is to induce wound healing by the application of growth factors. The effect and clinical use of applying topical platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) for decreasing the size and closure of chronic TM perforations is evaluated in this study.

- **Study design**: Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study.

- **Setting**: Tertiary referral center.

- **Patients**: Twenty patients with chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma for more than 3 months.

- **Intervention**: Topical treatment with PDGF or placebo applied weekly to the TM for 6 weeks.

- **Main outcome measures**: Success rate, defined as a reduction of perforation size of 50% or more to determine relative changes in perforation size; effect of initial size and location of the TM perforation on success rate; and air and bone conduction thresholds to determine the air-bone gap measured before treatment.

Results indicate that randomization made matching pretreatment perforation size of the two study groups impossible, and the initial rate of perforation/TM was significantly smaller in the PDGF group. No difference between the two groups was found for perforations/TM less than 10%. However, the success rate did not differ significantly between the two groups (power = 0.8), and the effect of PDGF was…

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwip) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^112UW88w]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). High credibility.

Our trial supports the notion that asymptomatic bulging of the tympanic membrane is an important predictor of AOM and perforation; this has not been emphasized in the AAP and AAFP guidelines. Furthermore, the implications of withholding antibiotic therapy in children with bulging eardrums have not previously been evaluated in high-quality studies. Guidelines for the management of AOM in Indigenous children define AOM as middle ear effusion with either bulging of the tympanic membrane, recent discharge, ear pain, or redness. There is no option to withhold antibiotics in an Aboriginal child with AOM. For children in whom AOM is associated with perforation, longer courses of antibiotics are recommended. Our RCT supports that recommendation.

A recent meta-analysis of individual patient data from studies in low-risk populations identified subgroups most likely to benefit from antibiotic therapy. In children younger than two years of age with bilateral acute otitis media, 55% of controls and 30% on antibiotics still had pain, fever, or both at 3–7 days, with a rate difference between these groups of -25% (95% CI -36% to -14%), resulting in a number-needed-to-treat (NNT) of four children. In children with otorrhea, the rate difference and NNT, respectively, were -36% (-53% to -19%) and three, whereas in children without otorrhea, the equivalent values were -14% (-23% to -5%) and eight. From our results in Aboriginal children, the NNT would be about ten for the normalization of ears, about six for the prevention of perforation, and about four for either beneficial outcome.

### Phase 3 trials of thermosensitive ciprofloxacin gel for middle ear effusion in children with tubes [^113Y1Aup]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

In both trials, there were no serious or life-threatening adverse events related to the study drug, and no treatment-emergent adverse events resulted in patient discontinuation from either trial. Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events for both groups combined were pyrexia, procedural (postoperative) pain, nasopharyngitis, cough, and upper respiratory tract infection.

Overall, there were no drug-related effects on otoscopic examinations, audiometric analyses, or tympanometry. Ninety-two percent of patients had both tubes patent at each time point, with no notable difference between treatment groups. Air conduction for the majority of ears improved from baseline in both groups. By day 15, 80% of ears tested in the OTO-201 group had normal hearing, compared with 73% of ears in the TT-alone group. The most frequent type of shift in PTA category at any visit was from mild to normal for the OTO-201 group and mild or slight to normal in the TT-alone group. PTA shifts of moderate severity from screening to days 15 and 29 were observed in individual ears and were therefore infrequent; most ears that had higher PTA values were found to have effusions.

### Effects of common ear drops on tympanic membrane healing in rats [^1149ap38]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

This study aimed to compare the effect of ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone ear drops on tympanic membrane healing in vivo, as ciprofloxacin + dexamethasone ear drops have been associated with higher rates of tympanic membrane perforations than ofloxacin. Although initially attributed to the steroid, ciprofloxacin (without steroids) has been shown to be more toxic to tympanic membrane fibroblasts than ofloxacin in vitro.

- **Study design**: Controlled animal study.
- **Setting**: Academic research laboratory.
- **Methods**: Perforations were created in 54 rats using a carbon dioxide laser. These rats were randomized into six groups (9 per group), with one ear receiving ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, dexamethasone, ofloxacin + dexamethasone, ciprofloxacin + dexamethasone, or neomycin, while the contralateral ear received saline twice daily for 10 days. Healing was assessed over 40 days.

- **Results**: Ofloxacin did not delay healing compared to saline. However, all other treatments delayed healing relative to ofloxacin by day 10 (P < .0001). Dexamethasone and ofloxacin + dexamethasone delayed healing up to day 14 (P < .0001). Neomycin and ciprofloxacin + dexamethasone further delayed healing up to day 28 (P = 0.009) and day 35 (P = 0.043), respectively. All eardrums healed by day 10 with ofloxacin, by day 20 with ciprofloxacin, by day 28 with dexamethasone, and by day 35 with ofloxacin + dexamethasone. At day 40, 2 out of 9 ciprofloxacin + dexamethasone-treated eardrums had not healed. All saline-treated eardrums in the ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, dexamethasone, and ofloxacin + dexamethasone groups were healed by day 14; however, this was delayed to day 20 in the ciprofloxacin + dexamethasone group.

### Phase 3 trials of thermosensitive ciprofloxacin gel for middle ear effusion in children with tubes [^115XGP3E]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). High credibility.

The integrated analysis included a total of 532 children with middle ear effusion (MEE) requiring tympanostomy tube placement (TTP) who were randomized and participated in the trials between November 2013 and June 2014. Twenty-eight investigators conducted trial 1 at 25 centers in the United States and four centers in Canada; one investigator was the principal at two centers. Nineteen investigators conducted trial 2 at 18 centers in the United States and one center in Canada.

- **Patients and baseline characteristics**: A total of 266 patients were randomized in each trial, with 179 and 178 patients assigned to the OTO-201 dose groups and 87 and 88 patients to the TT-alone groups in trials 1 and 2, respectively. Baseline demographics were generally balanced across all groups, with the majority of patients being between 6 months and 2 years of age (61.3%).

- **Efficacy**: In this integrated analysis, the cumulative proportions of treatment failures in the intent-to-treat population at days 4, 8, 15, and 29 were lower in the OTO-201 group than in the TT-alone group. By day 15, which was the primary endpoint, 23.0% of patients receiving OTO-201 experienced treatment failure, compared with 45.1% of patients in the TT-alone group. This reflects a 49% reduction in treatment failure risk for patients in the OTO-201 group relative to those receiving TT alone (age-adjusted OR, 0.341; P < 0.001; RR, 0.506).

### Clinical practice guideline: Tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^116QBPW5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for acute otitis media, specifically concerning tympanostomy, the AAO-HNSF 2022 guidelines recommend offering bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion in pediatric patients with recurrent acute otitis media (reAOM) who present with unilateral or bilateral middle ear effusion at the time of assessment for tube candidacy.

### With and without exogenous biological scaffolds for repairing traumatic perforations of tympanic membrane: Randomized clinical trials [^111zHaZc]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2022). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of ofloxacin ear drops, Vaseline gauze (VG), and dry gelfoam alone on large traumatic perforations of the tympanic membrane (TM).

A randomized prospective analysis was performed for the treatment of traumatic perforations larger than 25% of the entire TM. The closure rate, closure time, and hearing gain between the ofloxacin ear drops, VG, and gelfoam alone groups were compared at 3 months.

Final analysis was performed on 70 patients. The closure rates of perforation in the ofloxacin ear drops, VG, and dry gelfoam patch groups were 100.0%, 92.0%, and 87.5%, respectively (P = 0.41). The mean closure times were 8.67 ± 3.1, 10.65 ± 4.2, and 14.33 ± 7.5 days for the ofloxacin ear drops, VG, and gelfoam patch alone groups, respectively. The closure times among the 3 groups were significantly different (P = 0.003). In addition, there was a significant difference between the ofloxacin ear drops and gelfoam patch alone groups with regard to closure time (P = 0.003), while there was no significant difference between the ofloxacin ear drops and VG groups (P = 0.080) or VG and gelfoam patch groups (P = 0.056). The mean hearing gain was 11.4 ± 2.3 dB for the ofloxacin ear drops group, 11.7 ± 4.1 dB for the VG group, and 12.2 ± 1.6 dB for the gelfoam patch group (P = 0.69).

The repairing of traumatic perforations did not require an exogenous biological scaffold. Ofloxacin ear drops and VG were ideal materials for repairing traumatic perforation in the otology clinic.

### Does topical steroid use increase the risk for subsequent tympanoplasty [^114RuzoS]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study investigate the long-term impact of adding topical steroids to antibiotics on tympanic membrane (TM) healing, specifically measuring the rates of subsequent tympanoplasty. Although data support the idea that combining topical steroids with antibiotics is a safe and often superior option for suppurative otitis media compared to topical antibiotics alone, the effect of topical steroids on TM healing and the risk of residual perforation remains unclear.

- **Methods**: Electronic health records were queried using the TriNetX Research Network. Cohorts of adult patients were constructed with "infected" TM perforation (ICD-10 code H66) and "noninfected" TM perforation (ICD-10 code H72). Both groups were further divided based on treatment with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone (RxNorm codes). The outcome was measured by whether or not the patient underwent tympanoplasty without mastoidectomy or ossicular reconstruction within two years following diagnosis and treatment.

- **Results**: In "infected" patients, the ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone cohort showed a slightly increased risk of undergoing tympanoplasty (1.12%) compared to the ofloxacin cohort (0.76%). In "noninfected" patients, the ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone cohort demonstrated a significantly increased risk of undergoing tympanoplasty (6.87%) compared to the ofloxacin cohort (5.67%).

- **Conclusion**: In the context of acute suppurative otitis media, there is a small but statistically significant increased risk of residual TM perforation associated with ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment.

### Preoperative topical ofloxacin solution for tympanoplasty: A randomized, controlled study [^115GQ1jj]. Otology & Neurotology (2002). Low credibility.

To establish the efficacy of immediate preoperative ototopical ofloxacin eardrops in eradicating middle ear pathogens and improving operative outcomes, a single-blind, randomized control study was conducted in a tertiary referral center, ambulatory clinic, and hospital setting. The study involved consecutive patients with chronic suppurative otitis media undergoing Type I tympanoplasty (myringoplasty).

The patients were randomly assigned to three groups:

- **Group A**: Underwent 10-minute daily treatments with eardrops for two weeks before surgery.
- **Group B**: Underwent 3-minute daily treatments for two weeks before surgery.
- **Group C**: Underwent no treatment.

Main outcome measures included preoperative and perioperative bacteriology and the success of the surgery, defined by an intact tympanic membrane in the eighth week postsurgery.

The study enrolled 101 patients. During preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative observations, discharge and quantity of discharge were compared with no significant differences found among the groups (Kruskal-Wallis test). Perioperative culture results showed significant findings: 18/21 (86%) became culture-negative in Group A, 23/27 (85%) in Group B, while only 3/21 (14%) in the control group became culture-negative (Group C versus Groups A or B, chi-square tests, p < 0.001). The success rates of surgery, as indicated by an intact tympanic membrane, showed no significant difference among the groups: 28/33 (85%) in Group A, 27/33 (82%) in Group B, and 31/35 (89%) in Group C. However, preoperative positive bacteriology rates in surgical failures were noted to be 10/1.

### Phase 3 trials of thermosensitive ciprofloxacin gel for middle ear effusion in children with tubes [^1119Fnsf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The integrated analysis of two independent, identically designed phase 3 clinical trials in pediatric patients with bilateral middle ear effusion (MEE) who underwent tympanostomy tube placement (TTP) supported the observations for each independent trial, specifically showing a statistically significant treatment effect favoring OTO-201 over tympanostomy tubes (TT) alone. A lower cumulative proportion of treatment failures at day 4 and at all visits through day 29 was noted in the patients who received OTO-201 versus those who received TT alone. Specifically, patients receiving TT alone were approximately twice as likely at day 15 (primary end point) to become a study treatment failure relative to those receiving TT plus OTO-201.

One of the components of treatment failure was the otorrhea-only treatment failures, which were documented by the blinded assessor (secondary end point). The cumulative proportion of treatment failure due to otorrhea was lower with OTO-201 treatment at day 4 and continued through day 29, with approximately a two-thirds percentage reduction in otorrhea treatment failure risk for patients who received OTO-201 (7%) relative to TT alone (19%) at day 15 (absolute risk reduction of 12%). This reduction in the rate of otorrhea is consistent with what has been reported for otic drops in pediatric patients undergoing TT surgery. Furthermore, the observed otorrhea rate in the TT-alone group is similar to the range of 13% to 26% reported from a large meta-analysis and a literature review of the early postoperative period. Future research into the comparison of caregiver burden and cost-effectiveness of otic treatments should be explored.

### Commercial quinolone ear drops cause perforations in intact rat tympanic membranes [^1142Hxmg]. Otology & Neurotology (2019). Low credibility.

Commercial quinolone ear drops may promote the development of perforations (TMPs) in intact tympanic membranes (TMs). Quinolone ear drops have been associated with TMPs after myringotomy, with or without tube placement, in a drug-specific manner and potentiation by steroids.

Rats were randomized into six groups (10 per group). One ear in each group received otic instillation of dexamethasone, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin + dexamethasone, ciprofloxacin + dexamethasone, or neomycin + polymyxin + hydrocortisone — all in commercial formulations and at standard clinical concentrations. The contralateral ear received saline, administered twice daily for 10 days. TMs were assessed over 42 days.

No TMPs were observed in ears treated with saline, dexamethasone, or neomycin. At day 10, TMPs were noted in one of 10 ofloxacin-treated ears and three of 10 ciprofloxacin + dexamethasone-treated ears (p = 0.038). By day 14, the ofloxacin TMP had healed. In contrast, the three ciprofloxacin + dexamethasone TMPs persisted, with a new TMP developing in this group. A ciprofloxacin and an ofloxacin + dexamethasone-treated ear also showed TMPs (p = 0.023).

By day 21, the ofloxacin + dexamethasone and two of four ciprofloxacin + dexamethasone TMPs had healed, but two new TMPs emerged in the ciprofloxacin + dexamethasone group (p = 0.0006). At day 28, TMPs were present in one of 10 ciprofloxacin and four of 10 ciprofloxacin + dexamethasone-treated ears (p = 0.0006). By day 35, only one ciprofloxacin + dexamethasone-treated ear had a TMP (p = 0.42). All TMPs were healed by day 42.

The application of commercial quinolone ear drops can cause tympanic membrane perforations.

### Fungal otitis externa as a cause of tympanic membrane perforation: a case series [^111iLiLK]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2014). Low credibility.

We describe a series of 11 patients — 8 men and 3 women, aged 18 to 70 years (mean: 46.0) — who had fungal otitis externa complicated by a tympanic membrane perforation. These patients were referred for evaluation of chronic, mostly treatment-refractory otitis externa, manifesting as otorrhea, otalgia, and/or pruritus. Seven of the 11 patients had no prior history of ear problems. Five patients were referred by a primary care physician and 4 by an otolaryngologist; the remaining 2 were self-referred.

All patients received thorough debridement of the ear and one of two antifungal medication regimens. Eight of the 11 patients experienced a complete resolution of signs and symptoms, including closure of the tympanic membrane perforation. The other 3 patients required either tympanoplasty (n = 2) or a fat-graft myringotomy (n = 1) as the perforation did not close within a reasonable time.

This series demonstrates that the nonspecific signs and symptoms of fungal otitis externa can complicate diagnosis for both primary care physicians and general otolaryngologists. It also shows that most cases of tympanic membrane perforation secondary to fungal otitis externa resolve with ear cleaning and proper medical treatment. Consequently, most patients with this condition will not require surgery.

### Effects of ciprofloxacin-dexamethasone on myringotomy wound healing [^115zqL6Z]. The Laryngoscope (2007). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effects of the ciprofloxacin-dexamethasone (CDX) combination ototopical treatment after myringotomy on tympanic membrane (TM) healing in ears with eustachian tube obstruction (ETO) and unobstructed ears, a prospective, randomized, masked, controlled study was conducted. ETO was created in the left ear of 30 rats to induce a model of otitis media with effusion (OME). After three weeks, bilateral myringotomy was performed (day 0). Animals were randomized into three groups to receive no treatment or bilateral once-daily ototopical treatment with balanced salt solution (BSS, vehicle) or CDX for 13 days. Bilateral otomicroscopy was performed on days 7, 14, and 28. On day 14, five randomly selected animals per group were humanely euthanized, and the TM was harvested for histology. Three additional rats provided normal negative control ears for histologic comparisons.

On day 14, TM perforation healing rates were 100% in all ears of untreated and BSS-treated animals, 89% (8/9) in CDX-treated obstructed ears, and 30% (3/10) in CDX-treated unobstructed ears (P < .05 vs. BSS). By day 28, 100% (5/5) of the CDX-treated unobstructed ears and 80% (4/5) of the CDX-treated obstructed ears were healed. Histology showed initial TM thickening post-myringotomy in all ears but no significant qualitative differences between groups on day 28.

Myringotomy healing was transiently modulated by treatment with CDX but proceeded normally after CDX discontinuation. This early modulation might enhance middle ear drainage and increase middle ear concentrations of CDX.

### Phase 3 trials of thermosensitive ciprofloxacin gel for middle ear effusion in children with tubes [^113eyvTu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). High credibility.

Otitis media (OM) has a substantial health care burden. Tympanostomy tube placement (TTP) in children with recurrent acute OM or chronic OM with effusion is the most common pediatric ambulatory surgery in the United States. Otorrhea is an often-seen complication following TTP, affecting up to 25% of intubated ears. Otolaryngologists routinely apply antibiotic ear drops intraoperatively and prescribe them following surgery, although such medication is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for this indication. Furthermore, delivery of ear drops into the middle ear cavity through a tympanostomy tube (TT) can be challenging.

We report the integrated results of two phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy, safety, and microbiologic data of OTO-201 (OTIPRIO; Otonomy Inc, San Diego, California) in pediatric patients with OM with bilateral middle ear effusion (MEE) requiring TTP. In two identically designed phase 3 clinical trials, a suspension of ciprofloxacin microparticles in a buffered solution containing a thermosensitive polymer (poloxamer 407) was administered to pediatric patients with OM with bilateral MEE requiring TTP. OTO-201 exists as a liquid at or below room temperature and quickly transitions to a gel after exposure to body temperature in the middle ear. Preclinical studies have shown that a single injection of OTO-201 resulted in measurable ciprofloxacin concentrations in the middle ear for 1 to 2 weeks.

### The necessity and effect of prophylactic quinolone ear drops after ventilation tube insertion for otitis media with effusion [^112xcrmz]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Low credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is a condition where non-infective fluid builds up in the middle ear. Long-term OME can cause damage to the middle ear and hearing impairment. Ventilation tube insertion (VTI) is an efficient procedure to drain persistent OME. However, the effect of prophylactic ear drops after VTI remains controversial because no infection is present. This study investigated the need for and effect of quinolone ear drops in patients with OME after VTI.

- **Methods**: Between July 2018 and July 2021, 272 patients (436 ears with OME) who underwent VTI were enrolled. Prophylactic quinolone ear drops (ofloxacin) were used in 271 OME ears and not used in 165. The clinical findings and effect of the ear drops were assessed.

- **Results**: The group with postoperative ofloxacin had less postoperative otorrhea (p < 0.001). In univariate analysis, age ≥ 13 years (odds ratio [OR] = 1.499, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.003–2.238, p = 0.046) was significantly associated with recovery to normal middle ear functioning (type A on postoperative tympanometry). No adenoid hypertrophy (OR = 1.692, 95% CI: 1.108–2.585, p = 0.014) and no postoperative otorrhea (OR = 2.816, 95% CI: 1.869–4.237, p < 0.001) were significant independent factors associated with middle ear recovery in both univariate and multivariate analysis. After VTI, 65% of tympanic membranes in the group with postoperative ofloxacin recovered to normal, while in 67% of tympanic membranes in the group without ofloxacin scarring remained.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^115a6H1f]. Pediatrics (2013). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for acute otitis media, specifically in relation to tympanostomy, the AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend considering the offer of tympanostomy tubes for children with recurrent acute otitis media (reAOM). This is defined as having three episodes in six months or four episodes in one year, with at least one episode occurring in the preceding six months.

### Phase 3 trials of thermosensitive ciprofloxacin gel for middle ear effusion in children with tubes [^114uJPD1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

There were no drug-related serious adverse events, and the majority of the adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events for the OTO-201 and TT-alone groups were expected for this type of administration and procedure in a pediatric population. OTO-201 administration showed no evidence of increased tube occlusion and no negative effect on audiometry, tympanometry, or otoscopy when compared with TT alone.

Some limitations to this research exist. Patients undergoing concurrent operations were excluded from these trials. Future trials with OTO-201 that could be relevant in this patient setting might:

1. Have broader inclusion criteria.
2. Research caregiver/patient-centricity measures in line with or beyond initiatives and validated tools.
3. Analyze large claims databases to provide insights into populations at highest risk for postoperative otorrhea, disparities in healthcare quality, and the impact of patient access to healthcare.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: A randomized clinical trial [^112WQcci]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The study "Ototopical Ciprofloxacin and Fluocinolone in AOE (ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs. fluocinolone)" was published by Laurence Chu and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA Network Open. This study is related to the disease acute otitis externa.

The trial aimed to answer the question: Is the combination of ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone acetonide superior to fluocinolone acetonide alone in patients with acute otitis externa?

The study design was multi-center, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT). The population consisted of 297 patients (153 female, 144 male). Inclusion criteria included both adult and pediatric patients aged over 6 months with acute otitis externa. Key exclusion criteria included a previous episode of acute otitis externa within 4 weeks or more than one episode of acute otitis externa within 6 months; tympanic membrane perforation; otitis media; and malignant otitis externa.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide (n = 197)**: Ciprofloxacin 0.3% plus fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% otic solution, administered BID for 7 days.
	- **Fluocinolone acetonide alone (n = 100)**: Fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% otic solution, administered BID for 7 days.

### Phase 3 trials of thermosensitive ciprofloxacin gel for middle ear effusion in children with tubes [^113wRDX6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events, otoscopy for the presence of bilateral effusion, tube occlusion assessment, audiometric testing, tympanometry, physical examination, and vital sign measurement. Adverse events were classified with standard terminology, such as system organ class and preferred term, according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (version 16.1).

Patients, if able, completed audiometric testing (typically ≥ 4 years of age) at screening and on days 15 and 29. The audiologist determined the most appropriate test method, choosing from visual reinforcement audiometry, conditioned play audiometry, or conventional. The degree of hearing loss was calculated through the pure tone average (PTA), which is the sum of the threshold levels in decibels obtained for 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz, divided by the number of thresholds obtained. This calculation was used to categorize hearing levels: normal hearing (0–15 dB), slight hearing loss (16–25 dB), mild hearing loss (26–40 dB), moderate hearing loss (41–55 dB), moderate-severe hearing loss (56–70 dB), severe hearing loss (71–90 dB), and profound hearing loss (> 90 dB). Shifts from screening in PTA for air conduction, bone conduction, and the air-bone gap — depicting shifts in air-bone gap ≤ 10 vs > 10 dB — were calculated for each ear, each frequency, and each treatment group at each post-baseline measurement. Shifts were also noted from baseline to day 15 and to day 29 for the type of tympanogram (A, B [small/normal/large canal volume], or C), with ears as the unit of analysis.

### Clinical practice guideline: Acute otitis externa [^115Fetqo]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline is an update and replacement for an earlier guideline published in 2006 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. This update provides evidence-based recommendations to manage acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The variations in management of AOE and the importance of accurate diagnosis suggest a need for updating the clinical practice guideline. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is the clinical resolution of AOE.

The primary purpose of the original guideline was to promote the appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials for AOE and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed because of new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group. The target patient is aged 2 years or older with diffuse AOE. Differential diagnosis will be discussed, but recommendations for management will be limited to diffuse AOE, which is almost exclusively a bacterial infection. This guideline is intended for primary care and specialist clinicians, including otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, pediatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians, internists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. This guideline is applicable in any setting in which patients with diffuse AOE would be identified, monitored, or managed.

### Phase 3 trials of thermosensitive ciprofloxacin gel for middle ear effusion in children with tubes [^111mimhv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Patients in both trials were randomized to receive intratympanic OTO-201 intraoperatively or a sham treatment (TT alone) through a 2:1 allocation ratio stratified by age (6 months to 2 years or > 2 years), since younger children are considered more susceptible to the disease. Treatment assignment was generated via a permuted-block randomization algorithm. Eligible patients were randomized on the day of surgery (day 1) prior to TTP. All external auditory canals and middle ears were liberally irrigated with saline prior to drug treatment and TTP. Other than the qualified medical professional who prepared the study drug and the surgeon administering treatment or TT alone, all persons involved in the trials (trial staff, caregivers, and patients) were blinded to treatment.

Key inclusion criteria required that patients were aged 6 months to 17 years, had a clinical diagnosis of bilateral MEE requiring TTP, and if of appropriate age, were able to provide assent for trial participation. For younger patients, the caregiver was willing to comply with the protocol and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act documents before the initiation of any trial-related procedures and provided written informed consent. Key exclusion criteria were as follows:

- **Important exclusions**:
	1. Designation for any other concurrent surgery.
	2. History of mastoid surgery, sensorineural hearing loss, chronic or recurrent bacterial infections (not including recurrent otitis media), tympanic membrane perforation, or known immunodeficiency disease.
	3. Abnormality of the tympanic membrane or middle ear.

### Safety and efficacy of intratympanic ciprofloxacin otic suspension post-tubes in a real-world pediatric population [^113fVkEp]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2017). Low credibility.

Otorrhea frequently follows tympanostomy tube (TT) placement. This study evaluated otorrhea following a single 6 mg OTO-201 (OTIPRIO®, ciprofloxacin otic suspension 6%) intraoperative injection into each middle ear in a variety of effusion types in children undergoing TT placement.

- **Secondary objective**: Efficacy based on Medicaid status and safety.

This prospective, 8-week, multicenter, open-label study enrolled 501 patients with a mean age of 2.9 years; 56.9% were male. Effusion types included wet/wet ears (66.9%), wet/dry (16.8%), and dry/dry (16.3%), with 32.9% of patients being Medicaid-insured.

- **Main findings**: In the per-protocol population (n = 410), otorrhea rates through Day 15 were 8.8% (CI: 5.7%-12.8%), 6.6% (CI: 2.2%-14.7%), and 3.3% (CI: 0.4%-11.3%) for wet/wet, wet/dry, and dry/dry ears, respectively. For Medicaid patients, otorrhea rates through Day 15, Week 4, and Week 8 were 8.1% (CI: 4.1%-14.1%), 17.0% (CI: 11.1%-24.5%), and 17.8% (CI: 11.7%-25.3%) compared with 7.3% (CI: 4.5%-11.0%), 14.5% (CI: 10.6%-19.3%), and 21.8% (CI: 17.1%-27.2%) for non-Medicaid insured patients, respectively. Safety outcomes were similar to previous Phase 3 trials.

- **Principal conclusions**: OTO-201 demonstrated otorrhea rates consistent with Phase 3 trials in a broader, real-world, ENT practice-based pediatric population. Outcomes were similar in Medicaid- and non-Medicaid insured patients, and OTO-201 was well-tolerated.

### Topical antibiotics without steroids for chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations [^1166cArA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) causes ear discharge and impairs hearing. This study aimed to assess topical antibiotics (excluding steroids) for treating chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations in CSOM patients.

The search strategy included comprehensive searches through various databases: the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1951 to March 2005), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2005), LILACS (January 1982 to March 2005), AMED (1985 to March 2005), CINAHL (January 1982 to March 2005), OLDMEDLINE (January 1958 to December 1965), PREMEDLINE, and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT), as well as references from relevant articles.

The selection criteria focused on randomized controlled trials comparing any topical antibiotic without steroids to no drug treatment, aural toilet, topical antiseptics, or other topical antibiotics excluding steroids in participants with CSOM.

Data collection and analysis were conducted by having one author assess eligibility and quality, extract data, and input this into RevMan. In instances of ambiguity, two authors collaborated on data entry. Investigators were contacted for any necessary clarifications.

The main results were derived from fourteen trials analyzing 1,724 participants or ears. There was variation in the definitions and severity of CSOM; some trials included otitis externa, mastoid cavity infections, and other diagnoses. The methodological quality varied, generally being poorly reported, with short follow-up periods and inconsistent handling of bilateral disease. It was found that topical quinolone antibiotics were more effective than no drug treatment at clearing discharge at one week with a relative risk (RR) of 0.4.
