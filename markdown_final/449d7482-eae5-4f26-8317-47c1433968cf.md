## Question

What is the physiological basis and function of neuronal mirror neurons

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the physiological basis and functional roles of mirror neurons, including their anatomy, mechanisms, and clinical implications, with careful verification of controversies and limitations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and discovery context. Then, I should verify the anatomical substrates in monkeys and humans. Next, I will examine the physiological mechanisms, including visuomotor transformation and inhibition. After that, I need to delineate functional roles, distinguishing action identification from intention inference. Then, I should review clinical implications and therapeutic angles. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, hierarchical model and flag unresolved issues and methodological caveats.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition and discovery context. Mirror neurons were discovered in macaque ventral premotor cortex (area F5) and fire both when the animal executes a goal-directed action and when it observes a similar action performed by another, providing a direct neural substrate for matching observed actions to one's own motor repertoire, which supports embodied action understanding without intermediate cognitive mediation [^113Cpsg4] [^116apwg7] [^111aYc7Q].

> I need to check the anatomical substrates in humans. Convergent neuroimaging and neurophysiology indicate a frontoparietal mirror system encompassing the inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis), inferior parietal lobule, and premotor cortex, with additional limbic mirror properties in anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex relevant to affective resonance, forming at least two partially distinct networks for motor and affective mirroring [^113Cpsg4] [^112TzZDs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without verifying the visuomotor pathway. Visual information about biological motion is processed in superior temporal sulcus and conveyed to inferior parietal cortex, which in turn projects to premotor and inferior frontal regions where mirror properties emerge, enabling transformation of sensory input into motor representations that match the observed act, even when the final part of the action is hidden and must be inferred [^113Cpsg4] [^111Ni75S] [^112rryo2].

> Wait, let me verify the role of inhibition during observation. Although mirror neurons activate during observation, overt movement is typically suppressed by inhibitory control; suppression mirror neurons decrease firing during observation, and pyramidal tract neurons with mirror properties imply downstream motor pathways must be gated, supporting the need for continuous inhibition to prevent covert imitation and highlighting a potential therapeutic lever in action observation treatments [^1166649P] [^111g2ZnD].

> I will now examine the functional role of action identification. Mirror neuron regions contribute to recognizing what action is being performed by mapping observed kinematics to one's own motor programs, providing a first-person grasp of motor goals; however, I should confirm that this is distinct from inferring why the action is being performed, which requires additional processing beyond the mirror system [^113nSkNE] [^112CC6te].

> Let me consider intention inference carefully, because this is where overstatements often occur. Multiple causal studies using TMS and fMRI show that disrupting left inferior frontal gyrus impairs action identification and, secondarily, intention identification, but the effect on intention disappears once the contribution of action identification is accounted for, indicating no independent role of mirror regions in intention inference; instead, intention identification recruits mentalizing regions such as dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, angular gyrus, and precuneus, consistent with a hierarchical model wherein action identification feeds forward to mentalizing systems [^111eHCJo] [^11745kXM] [^111vdS52] [^113d9Yq9].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought mirror neurons might directly encode intentions when actions are embedded in context, but I should double-check that claim. Early reports suggested context-dependent modulation in inferior frontal cortex during intention-laden actions, but subsequent work indicates these effects were confounded by object affordances and task demands; when stimuli and abstraction are matched, mirror regions show no independent response for intention over action, reinforcing the conclusion that mirror regions support action identification rather than autonomous intention coding [^112qgr5r] [^116SUsNX].

> Next, I should review clinical implications and ensure I separate strong from speculative claims. In autism spectrum disorder, several studies report reduced mirror neuron activity during imitation and observation of actions or emotional expressions, linking MNS dysfunction to social communication deficits, though not all studies replicate this, and emerging causal work suggests discoordination between ventral premotor cortex and medial prefrontal cortex may better explain maladaptive social processing than a purely mirror-neuron deficit, warranting caution in interpreting heterogeneity [^116focH1] [^113FEuxC] [^115ZP6BK].

> I need to check schizophrenia next. Evidence is mixed: some TMS and EEG studies show reduced motor facilitation or altered mu suppression during action observation, correlating with theory-of-mind deficits, whereas other multimodal studies find intact mirror system function in stable outpatients, suggesting heterogeneity across illness phases and methods; taken together, mirror system dysfunction may contribute to social cognitive deficits in a subset, but it is not a uniform mechanism across the spectrum [^113mwusN] [^112Q7EJj] [^115kN5Xn] [^117UK4Rh].

> Let me verify therapeutic angles. Action observation therapy leverages mirror activation to promote motor recovery and skill learning, with small studies showing improved motor outcomes in stroke and cerebral palsy, though larger randomized trials are needed; mirror therapy for phantom limb and stroke uses visual illusions that engage attention and self-awareness networks, with mixed evidence for direct MNS engagement, underscoring the need to refine protocols and identify who benefits most [^111g2ZnD] [^115CnZMC] [^115fgUbh].

> I should confirm the role of mirror mechanisms in empathy and emotion processing. Emotional resonance engages anterior cingulate and anterior insula, while motor resonance engages rostral opercular areas; these systems can coexist and operate in parallel, and individual differences in sensorimotor resonance, as in mirror-touch synesthesia, correlate with higher empathy, supporting a dual-route model of affective understanding that integrates embodied simulation with interoceptive and cognitive processes [^112TzZDs] [^112GzKeg] [^114vXeNu].

> But wait, what about language and speech perception. Broca's area shows some mirror-like responses during speech observation and imitation, and the motor theory of speech perception posits articulatory simulation during listening; however, intraoperative data question a direct motor output role for Broca's area in hand or phonoarticulatory control, suggesting any mirror contribution may be more about articulatory representation than semantic processing, so I should be careful not to over-attribute language functions to a strict mirror mechanism [^111zoVum] [^111JeFBx].

> Let me synthesize a hierarchical model and ensure it aligns with the evidence. At the perceptual level, STS extracts biological motion; at the representational level, inferior parietal cortex transforms visual descriptions into motor-compatible formats; at the motor level, premotor and inferior frontal regions instantiate mirror representations that enable recognition of what is being done; at the cognitive level, mentalizing regions integrate action identity with context to infer why it is being done, with functional connectivity between mirror and mentalizing systems shaping social cognition [^115CnZMC] [^113d9Yq9] [^114Qsi14].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations and controversies so we don't overstate. Evidence for human mirror neurons is largely indirect, relying on fMRI, EEG mu suppression, and TMS rather than single-unit recordings; studies often conflate action and intention, and task demands can drive apparent "intention" signals; moreover, the MNS is not universally necessary for all social cognition, and compensatory strategies can maintain performance when mirror mechanisms are disrupted, so claims should remain nuanced and methodologically cautious [^113Cpsg4] [^112qgr5r] [^113d9Yq9].

> In conclusion, mirror neurons instantiate a visuomotor matching mechanism that supports rapid, embodied recognition of others' actions by mapping them onto one's own motor programs, but they do not independently decode intentions; intention understanding requires downstream integration with mentalizing systems, and disruptions of mirror–mentalizing coordination likely contribute to clinical phenotypes in autism and schizophrenia, while targeted action observation and related therapies may harness these circuits for rehabilitation when appropriately individualized [^113nSkNE] [^111eHCJo] [^113FEuxC] [^111g2ZnD].

Mirror neurons are **premotor and parietal neurons** that fire both when an animal performs a goal-directed action and when it observes the same action in others [^113Cpsg4], forming a **visuomotor matching system** [^116apwg7] that maps observed actions onto the observer's motor repertoire [^113Cpsg4]. This shared representation enables **action understanding** [^113nSkNE], imitation [^111ZBiQu], and prediction of others' intentions [^notfound], supporting social learning and empathy [^114vXeNu]. Mirror neurons are most robustly documented in macaques [^113Cpsg4], with convergent evidence for a homologous human system in inferior frontal and inferior parietal cortices [^111PZejL]. Their dysfunction has been linked to autism [^116focH1] and schizophrenia [^113mwusN], and they are a key neural substrate for embodied cognition and social cognition [^116apwg7].

---

## Discovery and anatomical localization

- **Initial discovery**: Mirror neurons were first identified in the ventral premotor cortex (area F5) of macaque monkeys [^113Cpsg4], where neurons fired both during execution and observation of goal-directed hand and mouth actions [^111PZejL].

- **Human homologue**: In humans, mirror properties are found in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, including Broca's area) [^113qdVtA], inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and superior temporal sulcus (STS) [^111JeFBx], forming a fronto-parietal network [^111JeFBx].

- **Limbic mirror system**: A separate limbic mirror system involving the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex supports recognition of affective behavior and emotional states [^113Cpsg4] [^112TzZDs].

---

## Physiological mechanisms

- **Visuomotor integration**: Mirror neurons integrate visual input from observed actions with motor representations, enabling direct mapping of others' actions onto the observer's motor system [^116apwg7] [^115FzMGv].

- **Goal coding**: Mirror neurons encode the goal of actions rather than mere muscle movements, firing for the same goal across different kinematic patterns [^113Cpsg4].

- **Predictive coding**: Mirror neurons contribute to predictive coding, allowing anticipation of action outcomes and intentions based on partial visual information [^1123EGDR] [^111Ni75S].

---

## Functional roles

- **Action understanding**: Mirror neurons provide a direct, embodied understanding of others' actions by activating the observer's motor representations [^113nSkNE] [^113Cpsg4].

- **Imitation and observational learning**: Mirror neurons facilitate imitation and skill acquisition through observation, supporting social learning and cultural transmission [^111ZBiQu] [^114RTXAP].

- **Empathy and social cognition**: Mirror neurons contribute to empathy by enabling shared affective experiences and understanding of others' emotional states [^114vXeNu] [^114Vhusb].

- **Language and communication**: Mirror neurons in Broca's area support the motor theory of speech perception, linking speech production and perception [^111zoVum] [^113qdVtA].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)**: Reduced mirror neuron activity has been observed in ASD, correlating with social communication deficits and impaired imitation [^116focH1] [^111PZejL].

- **Schizophrenia**: Altered mirror neuron function has been linked to social cognitive deficits, including impaired emotion recognition and theory of mind [^113mwusN] [^117UK4Rh].

- **Motor rehabilitation**: Mirror neuron-based therapies, such as action observation and mirror therapy, are used to enhance motor recovery after stroke and other motor disorders [^111PZejL] [^111g2ZnD].

---

## Controversies and limitations

Controversies include ongoing debate about the extent of mirror neurons' role in **higher-order social cognition**, such as theory of mind and intention understanding [^112CC6te] [^113d9Yq9]. Limitations arise because much of the human evidence is **indirect**, relying on neuroimaging and non-invasive techniques rather than direct single-cell recordings [^113Cpsg4] [^111aYc7Q]. Individual and cultural variability further suggests mirror neuron responses are shaped by experience and context [^115NFkrA] [^113Cpsg4].

---

Mirror neurons are a **core neural substrate** for embodied cognition, enabling direct understanding of others' actions and supporting social learning, empathy, and communication. Their dysfunction is implicated in psychiatric and neurological disorders, and they are a target for therapeutic interventions.

### Mirror neurons and their clinical relevance [^115FzMGv]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

One of the most exciting events in neurosciences over the past few years has been the discovery of a mechanism that unifies action perception and action execution. The essence of this 'mirror' mechanism is as follows: whenever individuals observe an action being done by someone else, a set of neurons that code for that action is activated in the observers' motor system. Since the observers are aware of the outcome of their motor acts, they also understand what the other individual is doing without the need for intermediate cognitive mediation. In this Review, after discussing the most pertinent data concerning the mirror mechanism, we examine the clinical relevance of this mechanism. We first discuss the relationship between mirror mechanism impairment and some core symptoms of autism. We then outline the theoretical principles of neurorehabilitation strategies based on the mirror mechanism. We conclude by examining the relationship between the mirror mechanism and some features of the environmental dependency syndromes.

### The mirror mechanism: a basic principle of brain function [^116apwg7]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2016). Medium credibility.

The mirror mechanism is a basic brain mechanism that transforms sensory representations of others' behaviour into one's own motor or visceromotor representations concerning that behaviour. According to its location in the brain, it may fulfil a range of cognitive functions, including action and emotion understanding. In each case, it may enable a route to knowledge of others' behaviour, which mainly depends on one's own motor or visceromotor representations.

### The mirror neuron system and the consequences of its dysfunction [^111aYc7Q]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2006). Medium credibility.

The discovery of premotor and parietal cells known as mirror neurons in the macaque brain that fire not only when the animal is in action, but also when it observes others carrying out the same actions provides a plausible neurophysiological mechanism for a variety of important social behaviours, from imitation to empathy. Recent data also show that dysfunction of the mirror neuron system in humans might be a core deficit in autism, a socially isolating condition. Here, we review the neurophysiology of the mirror neuron system and its role in social cognition and discuss the clinical implications of mirror neuron dysfunction.

### The perception of inferred action [^112rryo2]. Neuron (2001). Low credibility.

Our actions, and those of others, are often partly obscured from view. This complicates the sensory inputs that guide motor actions. In this issue of Neuron, Umilità and colleagues demonstrate that "mirror neurons" in ventral premotor cortex respond when monkeys observe hidden, but inferred, actions.

### I know what you are doing. a neurophysiological study [^111Ni75S]. Neuron (2001). Low credibility.

In the ventral premotor cortex of the macaque monkey, there are neurons that discharge both during the execution of hand actions and during the observation of the same actions made by others (mirror neurons). In the present study, we show that a subset of mirror neurons becomes active during action presentation and also when the final part of the action, crucial in triggering the response in full vision, is hidden and can therefore only be inferred. This implies that the motor representation of an action performed by others can be internally generated in the observer's premotor cortex, even when a visual description of the action is lacking. The present findings support the hypothesis that mirror neuron activation could be at the basis of action recognition.

### Mammalian empathy: behavioural manifestations and neural basis [^114vXeNu]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2017). Medium credibility.

Recent research on empathy in humans and other mammals seeks to dissociate emotional and cognitive empathy. These forms, however, remain interconnected in evolution, across species and at the level of neural mechanisms. New data have facilitated the development of empathy models such as the perception-action model (PAM) and mirror-neuron theories. According to the PAM, the emotional states of others are understood through personal, embodied representations that allow empathy and accuracy to increase based on the observer's past experiences. In this Review, we discuss the latest evidence from studies carried out across a wide range of species, including studies on yawn contagion, consolation, aid-giving and contagious physiological affect, and we summarize neuroscientific data on representations related to another's state.

### Reduced motor facilitation during action observation in schizophrenia: a mirror neuron deficit? [^113mwusN]. Schizophrenia Research (2008). Low credibility.

Impairments in social cognitive functioning are well documented in schizophrenia, however the neural basis of these deficits is unclear. A recent explanatory model of social cognition centers upon the activity of mirror neurons, which are cortical brain cells that become active during both the performance and observation of behavior. Here, we test for the first time whether mirror neuron functioning is reduced in schizophrenia. Fifteen individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and fifteen healthy controls completed a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) experiment designed to assess mirror neuron activation. While patients demonstrated no abnormalities in cortical excitability, motor facilitation during action observation, putatively reflecting mirror neuron activity, was reduced in schizophrenia. Dysfunction within the mirror neuron system may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

### The neural basis of mentalizing [^114Vhusb]. Neuron (2006). Low credibility.

Mentalizing refers to our ability to read the mental states of other agents and engages many neural processes. The brain's mirror system allows us to share the emotions of others. Through perspective taking, we can infer what a person currently believes about the world given their point of view. Finally, the human brain has the unique ability to represent the mental states of the self and the other and the relationship between these mental states, making possible the communication of ideas.

### Somatosensation in social perception [^115GD15T]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2010). Medium credibility.

The discovery of mirror neurons in motor areas of the brain has led many to assume that our ability to understand other people's behaviour partially relies on vicarious activations of motor cortices. This Review focuses the limelight of social neuroscience on a different set of brain regions: the somatosensory cortices. These have anatomical connections that enable them to have a role in visual and auditory social perception. Studies that measure brain activity while participants witness the sensations, actions and somatic pain of others consistently show vicarious activation in the somatosensory cortices. Neuroscientists are starting to understand how the brain adds a somatosensory dimension to our perception of other people.

### Anatomo-functional basis of emotional and motor resonance elicited by facial expressions [^116BkKma]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the present study contributes to a longstanding interdisciplinary debate on the simulation mechanisms active during face-to-face social interactions. Capitalizing on the results of intracranial recordings, electrical stimulation and effective connectivity studies, it suggests that the two predominant models in the literature on mirror neuron — namely, the emotional resonance and the motor resonance models — are not mutually exclusive. Rather, they coexist and work in parallel, but they differ in terms of neural bases (ACC-AI versus RO), visual pathways (amygdala-orbitofrontal versus temporo-parietal), content (emotional/interoceptive versus motor representations) and functions (socio-emotional synchronization versus action recognition).

### The mirror neuron system is more active during complementary compared with imitative action [^116Q1J9Q]. Nature Neuroscience (2007). Medium credibility.

We assessed the role of the human mirror neuron system (MNS) in complementary actions using functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants prepared to execute imitative or complementary actions. The BOLD signal in the right inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral inferior parietal lobes was greater during preparation of complementary than during imitative actions, suggesting that the MNS may be essential in dynamically coupling action observation to action execution.

### Normal movement selectivity in autism [^115ZP6BK]. Neuron (2010). Low credibility.

It has been proposed that individuals with autism have difficulties understanding the goals and intentions of others because of a fundamental dysfunction in the mirror neuron system. Here, however, we show that individuals with autism exhibited not only normal fMRI responses in mirror system areas during observation and execution of hand movements but also exhibited typical movement-selective adaptation (repetition suppression) when observing or executing the same movement repeatedly. Movement selectivity is a defining characteristic of neurons involved in movement perception, including mirror neurons, and, as such, these findings argue against a mirror system dysfunction in autism.

### The functional role of the parieto-frontal mirror circuit: interpretations and misinterpretations [^113nSkNE]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2010). Medium credibility.

The parieto-frontal cortical circuit that is active during action observation is the circuit with mirror properties that has been most extensively studied. Yet, there remains controversy on its role in social cognition and its contribution to understanding the actions and intentions of other individuals. Recent studies in monkeys and humans have shed light on what the parieto-frontal cortical circuit encodes and its possible functional relevance for cognition. We conclude that, although there are several mechanisms through which one can understand the behaviour of other individuals, the parieto-frontal mechanism is the only one that allows an individual to understand the action of others 'from the inside' and gives the observer a first-person grasp of the motor goals and intentions of other individuals.

### Mirror neuron deficit in schizophrenia: evidence from repetition suppression [^112Q7EJj]. Schizophrenia Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Schizophrenia is associated with impaired cognition, especially cognition in social contexts. The mirror neuron system (MNS) serves as an important neuronal basis for social cognitive skills; however, previous investigations on the integrity of MNS function in schizophrenia remain approximate.

Methods

We employed a repetition suppression paradigm that allows for measuring neuronal responses to gesture observation and gesture execution. Cross-modal repetition suppression, i.e., adaptation between observe/execute and execute/observe conditions, was defined as the decisive experimental condition characterizing the unique sensori-motor properties of mirror neurons. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were assessed in 15 schizophrenia patients and 15 matched controls.

Results

We isolated an ERP signature of specific adaptation effects to identical hand gestures. Of critical importance, this ERP signature indicated intact intra-modal adaptive pattern, i.e., observe/observe and execute/execute, of comparable magnitude between groups, but deficient cross-modal adaptation, i.e., observe/execute and execute/observe, in schizophrenia patients.

Conclusion

Our data provide robust evidence that pure perception and execution of hand gestures are relatively intact in schizophrenia. In contrast, visuo-motor transformation processes mediated by the MNS seem to be specifically disturbed in schizophrenia. These results unambiguously demonstrate MNS deficits in schizophrenia and extend our understanding of the neuronal bases of social dysfunction in this disorder.

### Mirror neuron system: basic findings and clinical applications [^111PZejL]. Annals of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

In primates, ventral premotor and rostral inferior parietal neurons fire during the execution of hand and mouth actions. Some cells (called mirror neurons) also fire when hand and mouth actions are just observed. Mirror neurons provide a simple neural mechanism for understanding the actions of others. In humans, posterior inferior frontal and rostral inferior parietal areas have mirror properties. These human areas are relevant to imitative learning and social behavior. Indeed, the socially isolating condition of autism is associated with a deficit in mirror neuron areas. Strategies inspired by mirror neuron research recently have been used in the treatment of autism and in motor rehabilitation after stroke.

### The mirror neuron system and the strange case of broca's area [^111JeFBx]. Human Brain Mapping (2015). Low credibility.

Mirror neurons, originally described in the monkey premotor area F5, are embedded in a frontoparietal network for action execution and observation. A similar Mirror Neuron System (MNS) exists in humans, including precentral gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and superior temporal sulcus. Controversial is the inclusion of Broca's area, as homologous to F5, a relevant issue in light of the mirror hypothesis of language evolution, which postulates a key role of Broca's area in action/speech perception/production. We assess "mirror" properties of this area by combining neuroimaging and intraoperative neurophysiological techniques. Our results show that Broca's area is minimally involved in action observation and has no motor output on hand or phonoarticulatory muscles, challenging its inclusion in the MNS. The presence of these functions in premotor BA6 makes this area the likely homologue of F5 suggesting that the MNS may be involved in the representation of articulatory rather than semantic components of speech.

### Mirror neuron brain regions contribute to identifying actions, but not intentions [^112CC6te]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

When observing someone else's actions we need to know not only what they are doing, but why they are doing it. It has been suggested that identifying the intention that underlies another person's action is performed by "mirror" neurons (Fogassi et al; Rizzolatti & Fogassi,), but this conclusion is controversial (Heyes & Catmur,), with other evidence suggesting that identification of others' intentions relies on "mentalizing" brain regions (Brass et al.). Previous attempts to address this issue have been impacted by factors such as stimulus confounds, alongside difficulties in separating out the cognitive and neural processes that support intention identification from those that are involved in action identification. The present study reports the results of one neurostimulation and one neuroimaging experiment which seek to establish the extent to which mirror neuron brain regions are involved in identifying the intentions underlying others' actions.

Mirror neurons were first reported in the macaque monkey, in ventral premotor cortex (di Pellegrino et al.). Neurons with similar firing patterns have since been recorded in other species including in humans (Mukamel et al.), and there are various noninvasive recording techniques which support the claim that similar neurons exist in homologous areas of the human brain (Fadiga et al; Molenberghs, Cunnington, et al.). Mirror neurons fire primarily when the animal is performing an action. However, they also fire when the animal merely observes someone else performing the same action. This response pattern suggests that mirror neurons map an observed action onto the observer's own motor programme for that action, and this has led some researchers to claim that mirror neurons allow the observer to understand others' actions "from the inside" (Rizzolatti & Sinigaglia,), and thus that mirror neurons support the "understanding of actions made by others" (Rizzolatti et al.). However, the term "action understanding" has been used to refer to at least two cognitive processes, which correspond to action identification, differentiating an observed action from other similar actions; and intention identification, determining the intention that underlies the observed action (Catmur; Thompson et al.); and it is not clear which of these two processes is subserved by mirror neurons.

### The role of inhibition in action observation treatment [^1166649P]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

One of the potential problems of the AOT hypothesis is that it assumes that the activity during action observation is similar enough to the activity during action execution. But the fact that some of the same neurons are active during these two processes does not necessarily mean that the network activity is the same. An important network difference in the brain activity during action observation is continuous inhibition of covert movements. In everyday life, observers almost never actively mirror movements of the people they observe which implies that the activity produced by the mirror neuron system in response to action observation has to be actively and continuously inhibited to prevent generation of covert movements. The necessity of such a system became even more apparent in the light of recent findings that pyramidal tract neurons, which directly project to the spinal cord, can also act as mirror neurons (i.e. mirror activity is reaching to the spinal cord). Further evidence of inhibition present during action observation is the existence of 'suppression mirror neurons' which decrease their activity during action observation sometimes to zero while still being very active during action execution. The important question is which cortical or subcortical network is responsible for this inhibition and whether it facilitates AOT or, in contrast, prevents it from being more effective.

In summary, AOT is a promising therapeutic tool which deserves closer investigation on a bigger scale. It can potentially benefit not only patients but be very helpful in revealing functional properties of the action observation network and its relation to the action execution network.

### Mirror neuron brain regions contribute to identifying actions, but not intentions [^112qgr5r]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

In an influential early study investigating the role of mirror neuron brain regions in intention identification, Iacoboni et al. found that the right inferior frontal cortex showed a greater response to actions when performed in certain contexts, which provided information about the actor's intentions, than to actions presented without contextual cues. However, the original contrast was confounded by the fact that the stimuli were not matched for the number of objects they contained. Differential activity of motor cortical areas in the intention condition may therefore have been the result of the objects' motor affordances (Grèzes et al; Mecklinger et al.) rather than reflecting anything to do with intention identification. This type of confound makes it difficult to interpret the results of neuroimaging studies in which the action identification and intention identification conditions are not well matched. Even when conditions are matched for the presence of objects, in some tasks the intention identification task requires object processing while the action identification task does not (Spunt & Adolphs,), again producing a situation where brain responses to intention identification are conflated with those for object processing.

A further problem arises when the processes of interest (i.e. action vs. intention identification) are confounded with lower‐level features of the stimulus, for example kinematic differences (Becchio et al.). In neuroimaging studies it is difficult to distinguish between differences in brain responses to intention versus action identification, and differences that result from the kinematic differences in the stimuli.

Finally, Spunt et al. demonstrated that answers to action identification questions ("what is she doing?") are less abstract than answers to intention identification questions ("why is she doing it?"), and that furthermore such differences in abstraction, even in the absence of action stimuli, are associated with responses in mirror neuron brain regions.

Therefore, any study which aims to distinguish action identification from intention identification needs to ensure that these two task conditions are matched in terms of the presence of objects (and their involvement in the two processes); any low‐level stimulus features such as kinematics; and the level of abstractness of the stimuli and any associated questions.

### The neuroscience of action semantics in neurodegenerative brain diseases [^113yXFUJ]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Within the last decade, the neurobiology of action processing has moved from an obscure topic of specialist interest to one of the most popular themes in modern neuroscience. However, the wealth of literature and the diversity of approaches and theoretical models can make the field complex and, at times, bewildering. This review presents the main currents of research, examining their theoretical underpinnings in an interdisciplinary context.

Recent Findings

The presence of specific deficits in verb and action processing has been documented in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases, including parkinsonian syndromes and motor neuron disease. Interestingly, most of these disorders affect the motor system, suggesting a systematic relationship between motor functions and their cognitive and linguistic representations. Action processing has been explored with a whole spectrum of methodologies, from neuroimaging to transcranial and intracranial stimulation. The findings have been integrated with other influential concepts and theories, including mirror neurons and embodied cognition.

Summary

Converging evidence from patient and imaging studies links the concepts of actions and their processing with the execution of actions through the motor system. The theory of embodied cognition remains influential as well as controversial. However, the points of criticism have changed, reflecting recent paradigm shifts.

### ACL injury prevention, more effective with a different way of motor learning? [^114RTXAP]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Mirror neuron system

Implicit, observational learning, where imitation of what is shown plays an important role, might be a good alternative in trying to reduce the ACL injury incidence. Imitation is the copying of body movements that are observed. A fundamental question with imitation is: "How does the observer's motor system 'know' which muscle activations will lead to the observed movement if the observer does not see the underlying muscle activation in the actor?". It has been suggested that the mirror neurons resolve this correspondence problem by automatically mapping observed movements onto a motor program, thus leading to the widely held view that the mirror neuron system is crucial for imitation and observational learning. Mirror neurons are visuomotor neurons that fire both when an action is performed and when a similar or identical action is passively observed. A template of the movement becomes active through the mirror neurons by which the movement itself becomes clear in terms of motor actions, without high cognitive reflections. Mirror neurons mediate understanding of action because neurons that represent an action are activated in the observer's premotor cortex. This automatically induced, motor representation of the observed action corresponds to that which is spontaneously generated during active action and whose outcome is known to the acting individual. An important functional aspect of mirror neurons is therefore their ability to link visual and motor properties.

It is interesting to note that the amount of mirror neuron activation correlates positively when the athletes are already proficient in performing that skill. Also, stronger mirror neuron activation is found when observing the same gender. An additional prospective study showed that dancers who were initially naive to certain steps showed an increase in mirror activation over time when they received motor training in which they became skillful in performing the same steps.

### The neuronal correlates of mirror therapy: an fMRI study on mirror induced visual illusions in patients with stroke [^115fgUbh]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

To investigate the neuronal basis for the effects of mirror therapy in patients with stroke.

Methods

22 patients with stroke participated in this study. The authors used functional MRI to investigate neuronal activation patterns in two experiments. In the unimanual experiment, patients moved their unaffected hand, either while observing it directly (no-mirror condition) or while observing its mirror reflection (mirror condition). In the bimanual experiment, patients moved both hands, either while observing the affected hand directly (no-mirror condition) or while observing the mirror reflection of the unaffected hand in place of the affected hand (mirror condition). A two-factorial analysis with movement (activity vs rest) and mirror (mirror vs no mirror) as main factors was performed to assess neuronal activity resultant of the mirror illusion.

Results

Data on 18 participants were suitable for analysis. Results showed a significant interaction effect of movement×mirror during the bimanual experiment. Activated regions were the precuneus and the posterior cingulate cortex (p < 0.05 false discovery rate).

Conclusion

In this first study on the neuronal correlates of the mirror illusion in patients with stroke, the authors showed that during bimanual movement, the mirror illusion increases activity in the precuneus and the posterior cingulate cortex, areas associated with awareness of the self and spatial attention. By increasing awareness of the affected limb, the mirror illusion might reduce learnt non-use. The fact that the authors did not observe mirror-related activity in areas of the motor or mirror neuron system questions popular theories that attribute the clinical effects of mirror therapy to these systems.

### Loneliness and the rate of motor decline in old age: the rush memory and aging project, a community-based cohort study [^116tTPA7]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

The basis for the association between loneliness and motor decline is uncertain. Human social behavior is generated in the brain through interconnected brain structures which process different elements of sociocognitive and socioaffective information which are eventually integrated and translated into motor action. Loneliness and motor decline may be associated since both depend on the structural and functional integrity of neural systems underlying the initiation, planning and execution of motor action and might both be affected by common pathophysiological processes. Moreover, recent work suggests that mirror neurons are thought to play important roles not only for generating movement but also for a wide range of activities essential for social interaction including self-awareness and empathy. Further work is needed to elucidate the role of mirror neurons in human behavior, but this raises an intriguing possibility that mirror neurons might provide a structural causal linkage between self-perceived isolation i.e. loneliness and motor actions. Motor function is necessary for social behavior and is thus an integral component of one's social body. Recent work suggests that social pain may function as an aversive signal, like physical pain, signaling the need to take action against factors which can damage or harm one's social body. Thus, loneliness, as an expression of social pain, may be associated with motor decline because it serves as an aversive signal for factors which may impair motor function and the capacity for social behavior.

### A causal role for frontal cortico-cortical coordination in social action monitoring [^113FEuxC]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

One of the major questions in social neuroscience is whether, and if so, how the PMv and MPFC coordinate with one another for processing social actions. While a meta-analysis of human neuroimaging has shown that the two areas are rarely concurrently active during social task performance, leading to the proposal that their roles in social cognition are mutually independent or even divergent, there have been alternative views that the MPFC may receive social information from the PMv to mediate social cognition. The present findings indicate that the ability of the MPFC to monitor the other's action depends on input from the PMv, supporting a coordinative relationship between the two areas. Our findings can also extend the so-called broken mirror hypothesis, which postulates that people with ASD have dysfunctional mirror neurons in the premotor cortex –. We now suggest that, rather than a deficit in single-neuron types in single brain regions, discoordination between the PMv and the MPFC underlies maladaptive social information processing in ASD. Our intervention procedure selectively targeting the PMv-to-MPFC pathway may provide a useful tool for making a reversible, nonhuman primate model of ASD.

### Anatomo-functional basis of emotional and motor resonance elicited by facial expressions [^112TzZDs]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

Two mirror systems in the frontal lobe?

Fifteen years ago, proponents of the so-called 'simulation theory' argued that others' emotional expressions trigger in the observer an automatic inner simulation and, at a behavioural level, the automatic facial mimicry of the expression. The proponents of the simulation theory also provided a limited number of mutually exclusive explanatory models, two of which are still considered by system neuroscientists. The 'motor resonance' model assumes that perceiving other's emotions triggers a multistep serial processing starting with the simulation of the expression in the perceiver's motor system, where facial movements are represented, and continuing with the sorting of this information to brain regions involved in social cognitive functions. The 'emotional resonance' model, in contrast, hypothesizes that perceiving emotional displays directly activates the corresponding emotional regions, such as the ACC and the AI, bypassing premotor/motor regions.

Although they were often thought of as mutually exclusive models, the present data suggest that the two systems coexist, and that emotional displays simultaneously activate two partially independent networks, served by different streams of information and potentially involved in different functions.

The 'emotional resonance' system, anchored to the anterior cingulate-insular network, receives broad and coarse visual information from the OFC, which in turn is the recipient of input from the superior colliculus-pulvinar-amygdala pathway. Once projected to the ACC and AI, the visual input activates specific emotional/interoceptive representations. While the identification of its specific functions is of course beyond the potentialities of our study, our data are compatible with the hypothesis that this system may serve socio-emotional functions, such as the facilitation of emotional contagion, spontaneous mimicry and social synchronization. This interpretation is compatible with the evidence that lesions of the ACC and OFC impair not only the recognition of others' emotions, but also the production of overt socio-emotional displays, deficits in social interactions and changes in social behaviour.

### Anatomo-functional basis of emotional and motor resonance elicited by facial expressions [^111gL5ye]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The observation of emotional facial expressions triggers a cascade of neural activations beyond the occipito-temporal face network, involving multiple frontal areas. Over the years, 'simulation theories' tried to account for these activations arguing that other's expressions resonate in the same regions controlling their production, and that such resonance is likely mediated by a mirror-neuron system for facial expressions, similar to the one classically described for hand actions. This hypothesis is substantiated, at the behavioural level, by the automatic tendency to respond to emotional expressions with unobservable or mild facial changes.

At the system neuroscience level, this perspective has been modelled by two simulationist models, which postulated that the matching between observed and executed emotional expressions occurred either within motor/premotor areas, (motor resonance) or emotional/interoceptive regions, (emotional resonance). Although similar at first glance, the hypothesis that the observation/execution matching takes place in a motor rather than emotional/interoceptive territories has repercussions on its functional contribution to cognitive processes, spanning from action recognition through its covert replication(motor resonance) to social synchronization and emotional contagion(emotional resonance). Moreover, even assuming that both systems are at work, it would remain to be clarified their possible connections or whether the two systems are hierarchically independent.

### The mirror system, theory of mind and Parkinson's disease [^115pFcBQ]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

The mirror system includes a group of neurons in the monkey cortex that discharge both when a movement is executed and when that same movement is observed. An equivalent system in humans has been proposed to mediate action and emotion understanding, being therefore related to theory of mind. Theory of mind (TOM) is the ability to infer our own or, more frequently, other person's mental states. It is severely impaired in disorders of the autistic spectrum, but it is also affected in other neurological diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD). Two recent studies have shown that the basal ganglia may be involved in action observation, as the subthalamic nucleus shows changes in activity during movement observation similar to those observed during movement execution. These findings suggest that the basal ganglia may be involved in mirror circuit activity, which might be affected in PD in a similar way to normal movement execution. Given the relationship between the mirror system and theory of mind, we hypothesize that TOM deficits in PD might be at least partially mediated by mirror system dysfunction.

### The mirror-neuron system and handedness: a "right" world? [^116SquMX]. Human Brain Mapping (2008). Low credibility.

To assess the relationship between the mirror-neuron system (MNS), an observation-execution matching system, and handedness, we acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging from 11 right-handed (RH) and eight left-handed (LH) subjects to identify regions involved in processing action (execution and observation) of the right and left upper limbs. During the execution tasks, LH subjects had a more bilateral pattern of activation than RH. An interaction between handedness and hand observed during the observation conditions was detected in several areas of the MNS and the motor system. The within- and between-groups analyses confirmed different lateralizations of the MNS and motor system activations in RH and LH subjects during the observation tasks of the dominant and nondominant limbs. The comparison of the execution vs. observation task demonstrated that during the execution task with their dominant limbs, RH subjects activated areas of the motor system in the left hemisphere, whereas LH subjects also activated areas of the MNS. During the execution task with the nondominant limbs, both groups activated regions of the MNS and motor system. Albeit this study is based on a small sample, the patterns of MNS activations observed in RH and LH subjects support the theory that suggests that this system is involved in brain functions lateralization. In LH people, this system might contribute to their adaptation to a world essentially built for right-handers through a mechanism of mirroring and imitation.

### Mirror neuron brain regions contribute to identifying actions, but not intentions [^111eHCJo]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Previous studies have struggled to determine the relationship between mirror neuron brain regions and two distinct "action understanding" processes: identifying actions and identifying the intentions underlying those actions. This may be because the identification of intentions from others' actions requires an initial action identification process. Disruptive transcranial magnetic stimulation was administered to left inferior frontal gyrus (lIFG) during a novel cognitive task to determine which of these "action understanding" processes is subserved by mirror neuron brain regions. Participants identified either the actions performed by observed hand actions or the intentions underlying those actions. The extent to which intention identification was disrupted by lIFG (vs. control site) stimulation was dependent on the level of disruption to action identification. We subsequently performed functional magnetic resonance imaging during the same task. During action identification, responses were widespread within mirror neuron areas including lIFG and inferior parietal lobule. However, no independent responses were found in mirror neuron brain regions during intention identification. Instead, responses occurred in brain regions associated with two distinct mentalizing localizer tasks. This supports an account in which mirror neuron brain regions are involved in an initial action identification process, but the subsequent identification of intentions requires additional processing in mentalizing brain regions.

### Mirror neuron brain regions contribute to identifying actions, but not intentions [^112vCuwF]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

Another difficulty that has undermined efforts to dissociate neural substrates for action and intention identification is that intention identification may require action identification as an initial process. That is: in order to identify the intention underlying an action, one must first identify the action that is being performed. Thus brain areas which respond during intention identification may be contributing to the initial action identification process, the subsequent intention identification process, or both. This makes it difficult to interpret the results of neurostimulation experiments which claim to show that disruption of mirror neuron brain regions impacts intention identification (e.g. Michael et al.): any disruption to intention identification may be the result of disrupting the initial action identification process (Catmur). As a result, in order to determine that a brain region contributes to intention identification, neuroimaging studies need to demonstrate that it contributes over and above its contribution to action identification; and neurostimulation studies need to demonstrate that disruption to intention identification is additional to any disruption to action identification.

In this article we present both a neurostimulation and a neuroimaging experiment using a new task which fulfils the recommendations specified above (Thompson, Bird, et al.) in order to determine whether mirror neuron brain regions contribute to action or intention identification. The hand action task includes two conditions: the action identification condition targets the identification of the configuration of the body parts involved in the observed action; and the intention identification condition targets the identification of the intention underlying the observed action. A range of variables are controlled across the action and intention conditions, including the level of abstractness and the stimuli themselves (e.g. by removing object processing demands and kinematic differences). A control task is also included to control for non‐specific processing demands.

In Experiment 1 we sought to determine whether a key mirror neuron brain region, left inferior frontal gyrus (lIFG), is involved in identifying actions and/or the intentions underlying those actions, by disrupting lIFG and a control brain site with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) during action and intention identification. lIFG was chosen as it responds consistently during mirror neuron localiser tasks and also when observers are determining the goal of observed body movements (van Overwalle & Baetens). Brain stimulation studies also support the involvement of this area in identifying intentions underlying observed actions (Michael et al; Tidoni et al.).

### Involvement of the mirror neuron system in blunted affect in schizophrenia [^115UTXQo]. Schizophrenia Research (2014). Low credibility.

Blunted affect is a relatively enduring schizophrenic symptom and its presence brings about poor functioning and outcomes. Functional impairment in the mirror neuron system which is involved in both motor execution and imitation may be a neural basis of blunted affect, but it is not proved yet. Fifteen patients with schizophrenia and 16 healthy controls performed the facial expression task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The task was to reproduce facial expressions in response to the face or word stimuli for happiness, sadness, and meaningless expression. Brain activities during facial expressions in patients compared with controls and their relationship with affective flattening were analyzed. Compared to controls, patients exhibited decreased activity in the widespread dorsal frontal regions and increased activity in the ventral frontal and subcortical regions. Patients also demonstrated significant negative correlation of the severity of affective flattening with activities in the mirror neuron system, such as the premotor cortex, motor cortex, and inferior parietal lobule. Emotional expression in patients with schizophrenia may be related to hypoactivity of the dorsal system and hyperactivity of the ventral system. An imbalance of these two systems may contribute to blunted affect. Directly addressing blunted affect using emotional expression provides a new perspective that functional disturbance of the mirror neuron system may play an important role in manifestation of blunted affect in schizophrenia.

### Interactions between visual and motor areas during the recognition of plausible actions as revealed by magnetoencephalography [^112pLDHo]. Human Brain Mapping (2014). Low credibility.

Several studies have shown activation of the mirror neuron system (MNS), comprising the temporal, posterior parietal, and sensorimotor areas when observing plausible actions, but far less is known on how these cortical areas interact during the recognition of a plausible action. Here, we recorded neural activity with magnetoencephalography while subjects viewed point-light displays of biologically plausible and scrambled versions of actions. We were interested in modulations of oscillatory activity and, specifically, in coupling of oscillatory activity between visual and motor areas. Both plausible and scrambled actions elicited modulations of θ (5–7 Hz), α (7–13 Hz), β (13–35 Hz), and γ (55–100 Hz) power within visual and motor areas. When comparing between the two actions, we observed sequential and spatially distinct increases of γ (∼65 Hz), β (∼25 Hz), and α (∼11 Hz) power between 0.5 and 1.3 s in parieto-occipital, sensorimotor, and left temporal areas. In addition, significant clusters of γ (∼65 Hz) and α/β (∼15 Hz) power decrease were observed in right temporal and parieto-occipital areas between 1.3 and 2.0 s. We found β-power in sensorimotor areas to be positively correlated on a trial-by-trial basis with parieto-occipital γ and left temporal α-power for the plausible but not for the scrambled condition. These results provide new insights in the neuronal oscillatory activity of the areas involved in the recognition of plausible action movements and their interaction. The power correlations between specific areas underscore the importance of interactions between visual and motor areas of the MNS during the recognition of a plausible action.

### Basis functions for object-centered representations [^112ySeZ6]. Neuron (2003). Low credibility.

In an object-centered representation, the position of the subparts of an object are encoded with respect to a set of axes and an origin centered on the object. Several physiological and neuropsychological results support the existence of such representations in humans and monkeys. An explicit representation would involve neurons with invariant response properties in object-centered coordinates. We consider an alternative scheme using basis functions in which the cells have retinotopic receptive fields modulated by the orientation of the object and task-related signals. We show that this alternative is consistent with single-cell data, is computationally efficient, and accounts for object-centered hemineglect, a syndrome observed in humans after fronto-parietal lesions.

### Entrainment of arteriole vasomotor fluctuations by neural activity is a basis of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent "Resting-state" connectivity [^114YLXRW]. Neuron (2017). Low credibility.

Resting-state signals in blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) imaging are used to parcellate brain regions and define "functional connections" between regions. Yet a physiological link between fluctuations in blood oxygenation with those in neuronal signaling pathways is missing. We present evidence from studies on mouse cortex that modulation of vasomotion, i.e., intrinsic ultra-slow (0.1 Hz) fluctuations in arteriole diameter, provides this link. First, ultra-slow fluctuations in neuronal signaling, which occur as an envelope over γ-band activity, entrains vasomotion. Second, optogenetic manipulations confirm that entrainment is unidirectional. Third, co-fluctuations in the diameter of pairs of arterioles within the same hemisphere diminish to chance for separations > 1.4 mm. Yet the diameters of arterioles in distant (> 5 mm), mirrored transhemispheric sites strongly co-fluctuate; these correlations are diminished in acallosal mice. Fourth, fluctuations in arteriole diameter coherently drive fluctuations in blood oxygenation. Thus, entrainment of vasomotion links neuronal pathways to functional connections.

### Essential roles of the unfolded protein response in intestinal physiology [^113aKh4m]. Egastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Brain-gut axis, controlling ER proteostasis at a distance?

In the last years, there has been an explosive increase in studies describing a close bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain in neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression and autism, among others. Importantly, gastrointestinal physiology is influenced by signals generated both locally in the intestine and from the brain. Neurotransmitters, immune signalling, hormones and neuropeptides produced in the intestine can affect brain physiology.

Multiple studies in Caenorhabditis elegans indicate that the function of neuronal XBP1 has important consequences in extending lifespan. Interestingly, these protective effects of neuronal XBP1s were mapped to activating the IRE1/XBP1 pathway in the intestine of the worm as a mirror response through a cell-non-autonomous mechanism involving the release of small clear vesicles. Neuronal XBP1 expression triggered massive changes in gene expression in the periphery including the upregulation of genes involved in proteostasis, lipid metabolismand lipophagy. The functional outputs of XBP1 expression in neurons may depend on the specific neuronal type affected, including the modulation of antipathogen mechanisms in the intestine. Overall, these reports suggest that the worm's nervous system acts as a sensing unit to propagate signals to the intestine to orchestrate global adaptation processes to ER stress. Whether neuronal UPR regulates intestinal proteostasis in mammals remains to be determined. Furthermore, how UPR regulates immune cells in the intestine and the communication to the brain is unknown.

The enteric nervous system (ENS), also termed the 'second brain', is formed by a diversity of neuronal cell types and complex, integrated circuits that permit the autonomous regulation of many processes in the bowel. The submucosal plexus is located between circular muscle and bowel mucosa, and controls fluid secretion and absorption, modulates blood flow and responds to stimuli from epithelium and lumen to support bowel function. XBP1s have important roles in the nervous system beyond proteostasis, regulating synaptic activity, connectivity, morphology, contributing to sustained brain function during ageing(reviewed in Martínez et al)Whether neuronal UPR can modulate intestinal physiology through the ENS remains to be established.

### The role of inhibition in action observation treatment [^111g2ZnD]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

After the discovery of mirror neurons in macaque monkeys and the demonstration by a number of non-invasive studies of a similar mirror neuron system in the human brain, several researchers came up with an idea of action observation as a functional rehabilitation tool. This idea is very simple and based on a defining property of the mirror neurons: mirror neurons are active both during action execution and action observation. In other words this means that neurons involved in movement can be activated by pure observation of actions. Probably due to the simplicity of the idea it has been restated many times in different contexts, most often in context of stroke rehabilitation; but unfortunately it still remains just a very attractive hypothesis which has been confirmed only by pilot studies.

Buccino et al.report another pilot study of action observation treatment (AOT) in children with cerebral palsy. Although the study was conducted on test and control groups containing only small numbers of children (8 and 7 respectively), improvement measured on the Melbourne Assessment Scale was shown for each participant in the test group. This pilot study certainly deserves to be extended into a bigger randomized clinical trial. Going beyond the pilot studies of AOT into a larger clinical trial is important for many reasons. One of them is the understanding of which patient groups can benefit from this therapy. AOT is very attractive not only because it is very easy for patients but also because the apparatus, which is essentially just video clips, can be easily adapted. The problem is that currently we do not know how the treatment should be adapted to make it more effective. Fundamentally, the ability to improve AOT resides on understanding of the cortical mechanisms which lead to improvement in patients' behaviour. Practically, to be able to adjust AOT for individual patients, more research has to be done to reveal correlations between specific improvements achieved by patients as a result of AOT and observed actions. Another very important reason which has not been investigated and can be addressed in longitudinal trial is for how long any improvement persists. Although large clinical trials are an essential step, they by themselves do not guarantee a translation of any treatment into everyday practice. Indeed, it has been enormously difficult so far to transfer any promising advances in neuroscience into everyday clinics.

### Mirror neuron brain regions contribute to identifying actions, but not intentions [^117ULaRk]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

These results are consistent with previous brain stimulation studies demonstrating the role of the lIFG in processing others' actions (e.g. Avenanti et al; Candidi et al; Cattaneo; Decroix et al; Pobric & Hamilton; Reader & Holmes; Urgesi, Candidi, et al; van Kemenade et al.). However, they do not fit with an account of mirror neuron function in which mirror neurons perform intention identification independently of, or in addition to, their role in action identification. Instead they suggest that, in previous studies where mirror neurons have been claimed to perform intention identification (e.g. Michael et al.), they are in fact contributing to action identification, and it is this contribution to the initial action identification process which then impacts intention inference.

These results also do not provide any independent evidence for the involvement of the lIFG in intention identification, as this process was not significantly impaired by lIFG stimulation separately to its impact on action identification (and in fact there was extreme evidence for the null hypothesis for this analysis). However, Experiment 1 only stimulated one mirror neuron brain region: it could be that other mirror neuron brain regions (e.g. in parietal cortex; Fogassi et al.) are contributing to intention identification. Alternatively, identification of intentions may be performed by other brain areas; a potential candidate being mentalizing areas, those involved in representing others' mental states (Saxe & Kanwisher). Therefore, Experiment 2 used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify mirror neuron and mentalizing brain regions through well‐validated localizer tasks. We also measured the responses in these brain regions of interest to the identification of actions, and to the identification of intentions. If mirror neuron brain regions are involved in intention identification we should find additional responses in these regions to the identification of intentions, over and above any responses to the identification of actions. If, however, the identification of intentions is performed in mentalizing regions, we should instead find that pattern of responses in those regions of interest.

### Mirror neuron brain regions contribute to identifying actions, but not intentions [^11745kXM]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

3 CONCLUSION

Experiment 1 illustrated that a key mirror neuron region, lIFG, contributes to action identification, but that it does not provide a separate contribution to intention identification. Furthermore, the extent to which intention identification was disrupted by lIFG stimulation was explained by the disruption to action identification, supporting the suggestion that mirror neuron contributions to intention identification are best explained via their involvement in action identification. Experiment 2 demonstrated that action identification produces responses in regions defined by an independent mirror neuron localizer, whereas intention identification produces responses in regions defined by independent mentalizing localizers.

Overall, this study indicates that while mirror neuron brain regions may contribute to action identification, there is no additional or independent contribution of these brain regions to intention identification, over and above their involvement in action identification. Instead, the findings suggest that this process requires the additional recruitment of mentalizing brain regions. Future research should investigate the functional connectivity between these two sets of brain regions in order to further understand how the configural action information encoded by mirror neuron brain regions is used to complete intention identification.

### A causal role for frontal cortico-cortical coordination in social action monitoring [^115Yw9NY]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Primates, including humans, are social creatures and coordinate their behavior to maintain group cohesion. Successful social exchanges require monitoring others' actions to optimally organize one's own actions. This social action monitoring for response optimization has been thought to be mediated at the frontal level by brain regions centered in the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) –. The PMv is a cortical area in which the so-called mirror neurons were discovered in the macaque. This class of neurons discharge not only when executing specific actions, but also during the observation of similar actions performed by others. This shared coding of actions between the self and others has been associated with diverse roles, including intention reading via embodied simulation, and is hypothesized to be deficient in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) –. Later work has shown, however, that the MPFC also contains neurons with mirror properties –. In a similar vein, it has been argued that the existence of self neurons and other neurons in the MPFC – may characterize its unique role in self-other distinction. Self neurons and other neurons are those that selectively or preferentially encode the self-action and others' action, respectively, and the paucity of other neurons in the MPFC is associated with a spontaneous autistic phenotype in a macaque monkey. However, such separate neuronal coding of self and other is not confined to the MPFC. Although studies on the PMv have usually emphasized the existence of motor neurons and mirror neurons, a subset of PMv neurons, albeit in the minority (~5%), are purely action observation neurons. These findings suggest that the existence of a particular class of neurons per se cannot uniquely define a particular area in the brain. Despite a growing interest in cortical mechanisms of social action monitoring, the similarities and differences between the PMv and MPFC have yet to be determined. This is in part because direct comparisons of neuronal activities have not been performed between the two areas in the same monkeys performing the same task.

### Neural circuits underlying imitation learning of hand actions: an event-related fMRI study [^111ZBiQu]. Neuron (2004). Low credibility.

The neural bases of imitation learning are virtually unknown. In the present study, we addressed this issue using an event-related fMRI paradigm. Musically naive participants were scanned during four events: (1) observation of guitar chords played by a guitarist, (2) a pause following model observation, (3) execution of the observed chords, and (4) rest. The results showed that the basic circuit underlying imitation learning consists of the inferior parietal lobule and the posterior part of the inferior frontal gyrus plus the adjacent premotor cortex (mirror neuron circuit). This circuit, known to be involved in action understanding, starts to be active during the observation of the guitar chords. During pause, the middle frontal gyrus (area 46) plus structures involved in motor preparation (dorsal premotor cortex, superior parietal lobule, rostral mesial areas) also become active. Given the functional properties of area 46, a model of imitation learning is proposed based on interactions between this area and the mirror neuron system.

### Mirror neuron function, psychosis, and empathy in schizophrenia [^112mgM7E]. Psychiatry Research (2012). Low credibility.

Processing of social and emotional information has been shown to be disturbed in schizophrenia. The biological underpinnings of these abnormalities may be explained by an abnormally functioning mirror neuron system. Yet the relationship between mirror neuron system activity in schizophrenia, as measured using an electroencephalography (EEG) paradigm, and socio-emotional functioning has not been assessed. The present research measured empathy and mirror neuron activity using an established EEG paradigm assessing the integrity of the Mu rhythm (8–13Hz) suppression over the sensorimotor cortex during observed and actual hand movement in 16 schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (SSD) participants (n = 8 actively psychotic and n = 8 in residual illness phase) and 16 age- and gender-matched healthy comparison participants. Actively psychotic SSD participants showed significantly greater mu suppression over the sensorimotor cortex of the left hemisphere than residual phase SSD and healthy comparison individuals. The latter two groups showed similar levels of mu suppression. Greater left-sided mu suppression was positively correlated with psychotic symptoms (i.e., greater mu suppression/mirror neuron activity was highest among subjects with the greater severity of psychotic symptoms). SSD subjects tended to have significantly higher levels of Personal Distress (as measured by the Interpersonal Reactivity Index) than healthy participants. The present study suggests that abnormal mirror neuron activity may exist among patients with schizophrenia during the active (psychotic) phase of the illness, and correlates with severity of psychosis.

### The role of the superior temporal sulcus and the mirror neuron system in imitation [^116frRsb]. Human Brain Mapping (2010). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that in humans the mirror neuron system provides a neural substrate for imitation behaviour, but the relative contributions of different brain regions to the imitation of manual actions is still a matter of debate. To investigate the role of the mirror neuron system in imitation we used fMRI to examine patterns of neural activity under four different conditions: passive observation of a pantomimed action (e.g., hammering a nail); (2) imitation of an observed action; (3) execution of an action in response to a word cue; and (4) self-selected execution of an action. A network of cortical areas, including the left supramarginal gyrus, left superior parietal lobule, left dorsal premotor area and bilateral superior temporal sulcus (STS), was significantly active across all four conditions. Crucially, within this network the STS bilaterally was the only region in which activity was significantly greater for action imitation than for the passive observation and execution conditions. We suggest that the role of the STS in imitation is not merely to passively register observed biological motion, but rather to actively represent visuomotor correspondences between one's own actions and the actions of others.

### Understanding emotions in others: mirror neuron dysfunction in children with autism spectrum disorders [^116focH1]. Nature Neuroscience (2006). Medium credibility.

To examine mirror neuron abnormalities in autism, high-functioning children with autism and matched controls underwent fMRI while imitating and observing emotional expressions. Although both groups performed the tasks equally well, children with autism showed no mirror neuron activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis). Notably, activity in this area was inversely related to symptom severity in the social domain, suggesting that a dysfunctional 'mirror neuron system' may underlie the social deficits observed in autism.

### Fight, flight or finished: forced fitness behaviours in… [^111Gwjae]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Does watching and reading Game of Thrones activate our own fight or flight systems? Mirror, mirror in the brain — can seeing shape thinking?

Back in the early 90s, di Pellegrino and colleagues at the University of Parma, Italy, made a chance observation that revolutionised neuroscience. It had been known for a long time that neurons (premotor cortex) in the part of the brain that sends inputs to the final output centre for movement (motor cortex) were active to tune movements. While recording from this part of the brain in macaque monkeys, the Italian researchers discovered that those same neurons in the premotor cortex active during a monkey's own movement were also active during observation of another monkey doing the same action!

Thus, the concept of the 'mirror neuron' system was born, a name that came from the way that a visually observed movement seemed to be reflected in the brain representation of the same movement in the one doing the observing. Since this discovery, extensive and convincing evidence of this 'mirror neuron' system and related neurons has accumulated in many non-human animals. In humans, the evidence is less direct but very compelling that we also have elements of mirror neuron activity in our brains.

Here, the relevance of the mirror neuron system is that they are activated by actions regardless of whether you are doing something, anticipating doing something or watching someone else do something. Mirror neurons basically help enable us to predict the consequences of our own actions. This raises the possibility that this system might contribute to our (in)ability to understand the meaning of the actions of others.

Since understanding what others do is central to all our social interactions — and paramount in Game of Thrones — this has implications for understanding and communication between individuals. Perhaps this system is extremely highly functional in those who are successfully thriving in Game of Thrones (such as Tyrion Lancaster) and very poorly functional in those who were so ineptly dysfunctional (such as Joffrey Baratheon)?

### Mirror neuron brain regions contribute to identifying actions, but not intentions [^113F6c8F]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

If lIFG is involved in action identification, then response times to identify actions should be slower, and/or accuracy to identify actions should be lower, following lIFG stimulation compared to control site stimulation. If lIFG is independently involved in intention identification then we should see an additional effect of lIFG stimulation on intention identification (i.e.g.reater response time slowing/reduction in accuracy than what is seen for action identification). In contrast, if the contribution of lIFG to intention identification is purely as a result of its contribution to action identification, then any effect of lIFG stimulation on intention identification should be explained by the level of disruption to action identification (e.g. disruption to action identification, when used as a covariate, should remove any effect of stimulation site on intention identification; and the effect of lIFG stimulation on action identification should predict its effect on intention identification).

Intentions may be identified somewhat later than actions (e.g. Thompson, Long, et al.found intentions were identified c. 30 ms slower than actions). This is consistent with our suggestion that action identification contributes to intention identification: if action identification contributes to intention identification then it has to be the case that intentions are processed later than actions; and any disruption of action identification should impact on intention identification. Alternatively, it is possible that action and intention identification are independent processes that take place at different times; in which case, intentions might still be processed later than actions but any disruption to action identification should not impact on intention identification. Accordingly we included a range of stimulation times in order to test whether the impact of lIFG stimulation on action and/or intention identification varied as a function of time after stimulus presentation.

### Perceptual basis of bimanual coordination [^114uFCBK]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Periodic bimanual movements are often the focus of studies of the basic organizational principles of human actions. In such movements there is a typical spontaneous tendency towards mirror symmetry. Even involuntary slips from asymmetrical movement patterns into symmetry occur, but not vice versa. Traditionally, this phenomenon has been interpreted as a tendency towards co-activation of homologous muscles, probably originating in motoric neuronal structures. Here we provide evidence contrary to this widespread assumption. We show for two prominent experimental models-bimanual finger oscillation and bimanual four-finger tapping-that the symmetry bias is actually towards spatial, perceptual symmetry, without regard to the muscles involved. We suggest that spontaneous coordination phenomena of this kind are purely perceptual in nature. In the case of a bimanual circling model, our findings reveal that highly complex, even 'impossible' movements can easily be performed with only simple visual feedback. A 'motoric' representation of the performed perceptual oscillation patterns is not necessary. Thus there is no need to translate such a 'motoric' into a 'perceptual' representation or vice versa, using 'internal models' (ref. 29). We suggest that voluntary movements are organized by way of a representation of the perceptual goals, whereas the corresponding motor activity, of sometimes high complexity, is spontaneously and flexibly tuned in.

### The human mirror neuron system in a population with deficient self-awareness: an fMRI study in alexithymia [^113a9U9U]. Human Brain Mapping (2009). Low credibility.

The mirror neuron system (MNS) is considered crucial for human imitation and language learning and provides the basis for the development of empathy and mentalizing. Alexithymia (ALEX), which refers to deficiencies in the self-awareness of emotional states, has been reported to be associated with poor ability in various aspects of social cognition such as mentalizing, cognitive empathy, and perspective-taking. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we measured the hemodynamic signal to examine whether there are functional differences in the MNS activity between participants with ALEX (n = 16) and without ALEX (n = 13), in response to a classic MNS task (i.e., the observation of video clips depicting goal-directed hand movements). Both groups showed increased neural activity in the premotor and the parietal cortices during observation of hand actions. However, activation was greater for the ALEX group than the non-ALEX group. Furthermore, activation in the left premotor area was negatively correlated with perspective-taking ability as assessed with the interpersonal reactivity index. The signal in parietal cortices was negatively correlated with cognitive facets assessed by the stress coping inventory and positively correlated with the neuroticism scale from the NEO five factor personality scale. In addition, in the ALEX group, activation in the right superior parietal region showed a positive correlation with the severity of ALEX as measured by a structured interview. These results suggest that the stronger MNS-related neural response in individuals scoring high on ALEX is associated with their insufficient self-other differentiation.

### Anatomo-functional basis of emotional and motor resonance elicited by facial expressions [^116zB215]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

The 'motor resonance' system, hosted by the RO, is in contrast part of the parieto-frontal circuits and represents the homologue of the classic mirror-neuron system for hand actions. The RO is not directly connected to any temporal region endowed with visual properties, hence it is likely that — as in the case of the mirror-neuron system for hand actions — the visual input reaches the RO from inferior parietal regions, that are in turn recipient of action-related visual information from superior and middle temporal regions. Following the evidence that lesions of the RO impair the explicit recognition of emotional expressions, one may speculate that this system contributes to action recognition strategies by exploiting one's own motor representations as a heuristic strategy to understand others' communicative intents.

The debate on motor and emotional resonance is inextricably linked to the debate on facial mimicry. Whether facial mimicry reflects an automatic motor response, or an emotional one, is still unsettled and this issue is in fact the focus of very recent studies. From a system neuroscience perspective, it has often been assumed that this automatic facial action could be controlled by the ventral part of the voluntary motor system, where facial movements are represented, but new data point at a wider network of cortical and subcortical regions. Even if we did not record EMG on our patients, our stimuli were the very same as Ekman and Friesen'sset of pictures of facial affect used by Dimbergin his seminal studies. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the participants of our study were also producing below threshold facial changes. Capitalizing on the late iERPs recorded in the ACC and the RO, on the result of their stimulation, revealing the occasional production of emotional facial expressions, and their well-known descending projections to the facial nuclei, we hypothesize that these regions are the best candidates for transforming observed expressions into produced expressions. If on the one hand, this consideration allows us to greatly limit the list of areas potentially involved in the genesis of this phenomenon, on the other hand, it does not still clarify whether facial mimicry is the output of motor resonance (via RO) or emotional resonance (via ACC), with all that follows in terms of its contribution to action recognition or social synchronization.

### Distributed cell assemblies for general lexical and category-specific semantic processing as revealed by fMRI cluster analysis [^1167hhJn]. Human Brain Mapping (2009). Low credibility.

Here, we ask whether frontotemporal cortex is functionally dissociated into distributed lexical and category-specific semantic networks. To this end, fMRI activation patterns elicited during the processing of words from different semantic categories were categorized using k-means cluster algorithms. Results showed a distributed pattern of inferiorfrontal, superiortemporal, and fusiform activation shared by different word categories. This shared activation contrasted with patterns of category-specific semantic activation in widely distributed neural systems. Clustering revealed congruent functional specificity of focal area activations in frontal and temporal cortex; thus suggesting a correspondence between functional partitionings of frontocentral mirror neuron systems and those of inferiortemporal lexical and semantic circuits. Action words related to the face, arms, and legs specifically activated the motor system in a somatotopic manner, whereas form-related words activated prefrontal areas. Similar functional specificity was evident in temporal cortex, where a different semantic topography emerged for form- and action-related words. Results were replicated in a separate data set, therefore recommending fMRI cluster analysis as a reliable method for scrutinizing the brain basis of lexical, semantic, and conceptual systems in humans. As focal modules do not explain the distributed character of functionally specific clusters and their distinct topographies are at variance with general distributed processing accounts, the functionally-homogenous distributed clusters specific to semantic types are best explained by specifically-distributed cortical circuits which, similar to Hebbian cell assemblies, represent functional units with specific roles in cognitive processing, especially in lexical and semantic access and memory.

### Is one motor cortex enough for two hands? [^117JXzpk]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

We report on a patient with mirror movements sustained by a mono-hemispheric fast control of bilateral hand muscles and normal hand function. Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the right motor cortex evoked contractions of muscles in both hands while no responses were observed from the left hemisphere. Somatosensory-evoked potentials, functional magnetic resonance, and diffusion tractography showed evidence of sensorimotor dissociation and asymmetry of corticospinal projections, suggestive of reorganization after early unilateral left brain lesion. This is the first evidence that, in certain rare conditions, good hand function is possible with ipsilateral corticospinal reorganization, supporting the role of unexplored mechanisms of motor recovery.

### Why we should take a closer look at gestures [^116TU2LU]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

Perception of gestures basically involves the same brain areas as performance of gestures, ie, IPL, IFG and (pre)motor areas "including the mirror neuron system". In addition, language related areas in the temporal lobe and IFG are engaged whenever communicative gestures are observed. Parallel brain scans of gesturer's and gesture observer's brains indicated that the temporal course of brain activity during gesture processing is tightly coupled. The neural basis of gesture interpretation relies on both motor and language related fronto-temporal brain areas. For example, the semantic content of gestures is processed within the left IFG, temporal pole, middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and M1.

Despite these advances, the neurocorrelates of gesture processes in psychosis are relatively unknown. However, recent studies have begun to examine domains of gesture functioning in innovative neuroimaging paradigms. One good example is in the area of gesture interpretation. Specifically, investigators observed that decoding of abstract meaning is particularly challenging to schizophrenia patients and during the processing of metaphoric gestures schizophrenia patients demonstrate reduced activation of language areas and aberrant functional connectivity between IFG and superior temporal sulcus. While this sheds some light on one domain, the neural correlates of impaired gesture perception and performance in psychoses are yet to be discovered.

There are several compelling reasons why gesture is a promising target for psychosis research. As gesture behavior is well understood in healthy populations across developmental time points, it can serve as an anchor point in efforts for mapping this behavior in populations where we enjoy considerably less understanding. Certainly, findings that indicate that different gestures are linked to different neural networks speak to considerable potential for biomarker development in this regard. Further, as gesture is closely related to social cognition, deficits may serve as a sensitive "outcome" marker of "social functioning", calling for longitudinal studies. "In a related point, while gesture and facial expressions are both distinct domains of nonverbal communication, one very interesting and potentially informative line of inquiry relates to when they are perceived or employed in tandem, or, how neural processes governing this underlying coordination can become dysregulated". Finally, gesturing may be improved by specialized training, or noninvasive brain stimulation "targeting the mirror neuron system". "Because of the close cross-sectional association between gesture perception and performancewe may speculate for generalization effects when targeting one end of the problem".

### Effects of mirror training on motor performance in healthy individuals: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115CnZMC]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Mirror training (MTr) was first demonstrated in 1995 as a psychophysiological therapy for patients with phantom-limb pain after amputation. Altschuler et al reported that MTr is an advanced technique that improves the range, velocity and accuracy of limb and joint in patients with neurological diseases. The basic form of MTr involves superimposition of a mirror-reflected image of the active extremity over the opposite extremity by placing a midsagittal-plane mirror in front of the person. In most situations, the extremity behind the mirror is inactive. Studies involving unilateral movement of one hand showed that MTr with exercise-dependent motor tasks increased the hand strength of the contralateral side. The placement of mirror can enhance the motor behaviour of contralateral muscle, even though it is not involved in the activity. In prior studies, the tasks included ball rotation, index finger abduction, a wrist or finger extension-flexion taskor dedicated training sequences. A benefit of MTr is cross-limb transfer of motor learning, in that unilateral training induces improvements in motor performance of the contralateral limb. MTr also increases corticospinal excitability and activates the sensorimotor cortex. Some studies suggested that skilled musicians and athletes, for example, have greater motor cortex plasticity and can acquire new skills more easily than unskilled individuals. Interconnections between the superior temporal sulcus and the frontoparietal mirror system can integrate motor signal transmission and visuospatial processing at the cortical level. At the neuronal level, MTr may activate mirror neurons in the frontoparietal cortex, which connects visual neurons receiving external visual information (ie, movement conducted by others or imitation) and motor neurons transmitting coded signals to muscle. The visual inputs are encoded in the superior temporal sulcus, where higher order visual descriptions form. These descriptions are then transmitted to the frontoparietal mirror system for action learning. Zult et al reported confident interactions between MTr and the mirror neuron system in the primary motor cortex (M1) ipsilateral and contralateral to the moving hand, supporting action enforcement. These cortices are activated when the subject conducts a simple task and imitates another person. Beyond neurophysiological research, a number of studies have demonstrated that MTr has positive therapeutic effects in patients with neurological disorders. Although MTr can activate motor function-related cortices, a prior study suggested that in the long term, MTr hardly affects the muscle morphology or strength after exercise.

### Grey-matter correlates of empathy in 4-repeat tauopathies [^114GPFxk]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Empathy describes the ability to understand and share other's emotional feelings and is fundamental to our emotional and social lives. The two main neurocognitive components of empathic abilities are cognitive and emotional empathy. Cognitive empathy refers to cognitive ability of understanding of another person's perspective and feelings (i.e. "I understanding what you feel"). Emotional empathy concerns the ability to feel and share the emotional experience of others (i.e. "I feel what you feel"). The neuroanatomical bases of these abilities in humans have been most consistently identified in a circuit comprising the insula, prefrontal cortices, superior temporal gyrus, temporoparietal junction and temporal poles, anterior cingulate cortex, and the inferior parietal lobules –, which are also regions that have been linked to the mirror neuron system. However, whether socio-cognitive skills (including empathy) are functions independent from other nonsocial cognitive functions (e.g. memory or executive functions) with their own specialized brain modules is an open question in the literature.

1 EXPERIMENT 1

1.1 Method

1.1.1 Participants

A power analysis conducted using G* Power 3 (Faul et al.) indicated a minimum sample size of 34 participants to detect a medium effect size for the interaction of site and task, with a power of over.8 at an alpha level of.05. Thirty‐six right‐handed native English speakers (seven males) aged 18–46 years (mean = 24.03, SD = 5.16) were therefore recruited via King's College London recruitment email. Participants had no contraindications for TMS (Rossi et al.). Participants for both experiments had no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders and were compensated a small fee for their time. Experimental procedures for both experiments were approved by the King's College London Research Ethics Committee and were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

1.1.2 Design

Participants received disruptive stimulation of the lIFG and the vertex, in counterbalanced order, while performing an action understanding task and a control task, again in counterbalanced order. Each task comprised two conditions, action identification and intention identification, which were randomly distributed throughout the task.

### Mirror neuron brain regions contribute to identifying actions, but not intentions [^1125LqtJ]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

Evidence for the role of mirror neuron brain regions in action identification supports previous findings that action identification involves mirror neuron brain regions, such as the IFG (de Lange et al; Molenberghs, Cunnington, et al; Ondobaka et al.) and inferior parietal lobule (Libero et al; Ondobaka et al; Spunt & Adolphs; Spunt & Lieberman). The present experiment built on these studies by using an action understanding task in which factors such as the nature of the stimuli and abstractness of the word phrases were controlled across the action and intention identification conditions. The present study therefore supports previous findings that mirror neuron brain regions are involved in identification of the configuration of body parts involved in an observed action, and confirms that these results are not due to confounding factors such as level of abstraction (cf. Spunt et al.).

The current study further demonstrates that even when these factors are controlled for, mentalizing brain regions, and not mirror neuron brain regions, respond during intention identification. This was the case not only for mentalizing regions identified using the Why/How task, which involves action stimuli; but also for regions identified using a non‐action‐based false belief task. Altogether the present study suggests that mirror neuron brain regions do not directly encode the intentions underlying observed hand actions, but instead this process relies on mentalizing brain regions.

Recent evidence suggests that mirror neuron brain regions are functionally connected to brain regions within the mentalizing network, sending configural and kinematic information to be interpreted (Cole et al; Liew et al; Mainieri et al; Van Overwalle & Baetens). In particular, when inferring others' internal states from human actions, an increase in functional connectivity between mirror neuron brain regions and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex has been more frequently reported (Ciaramidaro et al; Cole et al; Spunt & Lieberman,) than increased connectivity between mirror neuron brain regions and the TPJ (Spunt & Lieberman). In the current study, however, activation for the Hand Intention > Hand Action contrast was found within both frontal and temporoparietal ROIs, suggesting that both these brain areas process information from mirror neuron brain regions.

### Viewing lip forms: cortical dynamics [^113qdVtA]. Neuron (2002). Low credibility.

Viewing other persons' actions automatically activates brain areas belonging to the mirror-neuron system (MNS) assumed to link action execution and observation. We followed, by magnetoencephalographic cortical dynamics, subjects who observed still pictures of lip forms, on-line imitated them, or made similar forms in a self-paced manner. In all conditions and in both hemispheres, cortical activation progressed in 20–70 ms steps from the occipital cortex to the superior temporal region (where the strongest activation took place), the inferior parietal lobule, and the inferior frontal lobe (Broca's area), and finally, 50–140 ms later, to the primary motor cortex. The signals of Broca's area and motor cortex were significantly stronger during imitation than other conditions. These results demonstrate that still pictures, only implying motion, activate the human MNS in a well-defined temporal order.

### Psychopathic and autistic traits differentially influence the neural mechanisms of social cognition from communication signals [^111Vf2vm]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Besides marked socio-affective deficits, about 90% of those with ASD are also affected by sensory processing symptoms. The neural markers of ASD point to deficits already at the level of sensory processing, as social impairment severity correlates with auditory VA activation to voice and speech signals in ASD, and the VA as a neural seed is under-connected to the frontal mentalizing and mirror network in VA. An open research question thus seems if psychopathic traits are also marked by neural deficits in the sensory analysis of voice signals, given the overlap in social cognition deficits across both psychiatric phenotypes.

We here took a parametric neuroimaging approach to test several of the outlined open research questions about the neurofunctional mechanisms that underlie social perception abilities and deficits in psychopathy as a dimensional trait measure. We hypothesized that in response to social voice stimuli, psychopathic and autistic traits would differentially correlate with neurofunctional diversity in regions of the social cognitive and affective brain networks (i.e. mirror neuron, empathy, mentalizing, and limbic subsystems). The study was mostly exploratory, but with a specific focus on these networks.

1.2.3 Response times

The same ANOVA conducted on the RT data revealed significant main effects of site, F (1,35) = 4.96, p = .032, ηₚ² = 0.12, BF 10 = 7.08 × 10⁶, task, F (1,35) = 27.68, p < .001, ηₚ² = 0.44, BF 10 = 6.09 × 10¹³, and pulse time, F (1,35) = 9.50, p = .004, ηₚ² = 0.21, BF 10 = 0.103. Participants responded significantly quicker: when TMS was administered to the vertex (mean = 753.6 ms, SD = 195.2) compared to the lIFG (mean = 821.9 ms, SD = 228.9); to the control task (mean = 739.1 ms, SD = 164.8) compared to the action understanding task (mean = 836.4 ms, SD = 228.2), and to trials in which early pulses were administered (mean = 776.9 ms, SD = 194.1) compared to those where late pulses were administered (mean = 798.6 ms, SD = 191.8).

FIGURE 1
(a) Illustrative stimuli for action understanding and control tasks completed in experiment 1. (i) Hand action identification; (ii) hand intention identification; (iii) appliance action identification; (iv) appliance intention identification. (b) TMS trial procedure. Participants were required to indicate whether the word phrase (describing the action, e.g. "to flick"; or the intention, e.g. "to propel") matched (response = yes) or did not match (response = no) the image

The control, appliance, task was structured in the same way as the action understanding task, but stimuli comprised images of household appliances. Each image was assigned two word phrases, one relating to the action performed by the object (action identification), and the other relating to the purpose of the object (intention identification); for example, "to rotate" or "to cool", describing a rotary fan. The word phrases in the action and intention conditions were matched on the same variables: number of words (all consisting of two words), number of characters t (15) = 0.36, p = .723, word frequency t (15) = 0.85, p = .410 and abstractness rating t (15) = 1.71, p = .109.

### Mirror neuron brain regions contribute to identifying actions, but not intentions [^116SUsNX]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

The limited activation produced by the intention identification condition when controlling for action identification processing could be seen as a limitation of the action understanding task. However, this contrast did reveal moderate to very strong evidence for responses in mentalizing brain regions, indicating that the failure to find such responses in mirror neuron brain regions cannot be attributed solely to the task. Instead, our results suggest that additional activation found in previous studies may be due to the influence of confounding variables, such as objects, producing greater activation that is not specific to intention identification. Due to the controlled nature of the action understanding task, the activation found within the intention identification contrast can be specifically associated with intention identification. Future studies should incorporate equally controlled measures within action understanding tasks, in order to replicate the independent activation found for intention identification within the present study.

Another future research direction would be to stimulate mentalizing brain regions during performance of the action and intention identification task, to determine the extent to which the responses in mentalizing brain regions found in Experiment 2 underlie intention identification (although the more medial areas would be difficult to target with rTMS). We chose not to stimulate an additional mentalizing brain area in Experiment 1 due to the length of the experimental session; but this would be a useful study to perform in future.

### Neural mechanisms for the recognition of biological movements [^11272GQJ]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2003). Medium credibility.

The visual recognition of complex movements and actions is crucial for the survival of many species. It is important not only for communication and recognition at a distance, but also for the learning of complex motor actions by imitation. Movement recognition has been studied in psychophysical, neurophysiological and imaging experiments, and several cortical areas involved in it have been identified. We use a neurophysiologically plausible and quantitative model as a tool for organizing and making sense of the experimental data, despite their growing size and complexity. We review the main experimental findings and discuss possible neural mechanisms, and show that a learning-based, feedforward model provides a neurophysiologically plausible and consistent summary of many key experimental results.

### An avian cortical circuit for chunking tutor song syllables into simple vocal-motor units [^111dTvwt]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Our findings provide additional insight into potential mechanisms driving the mirroring of activity between sensory observation and motor action. The onset-related signals observed in NIf during both singing and tutoring give insights into how mirror neuron activity may arise. In our view, the mirror activity in NIf is a signature of a sensory system that encodes a memory of a sensory event (the tutor song) subsequently used to train a motor system. The mirroring activity in the post-learning adult results from the vestigial neural architecture subserving the earlier learning process.

Together, our NIf recordings and modeling suggest potential neural mechanisms for breaking a tutor song into simple vocal-motor units that can be used to build a motor program that aligns with the auditory memory. By aligning activity to syllable onsets, NIf could chunk songs into syllables, each of which is accessible as a discrete unit during later motor learning and production. This view is consistent with the observation that NIf is necessary in some birds for flexible syllable sequencing. In our model, simple neural plasticity rules produce an appropriate training input that reflects the structure of a tutor song. Building a motor program in this way, shaped by input from a sensory system, could create the precise alignment between a sensory memory and motor representations necessary for subsequent motor learning and evaluation. In the broadest view, this work elucidates neural mechanisms by which the brain, through sensory experience of the environment, can build motor programs appropriate to interact with that environment.

### Numerosity tuning in human association cortices and local image contrast representations in early visual cortex [^115jZ7rd]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Humans and many other animals use visual numerosity, the number of items in a set, to guide behavior. Many species have neurons tuned to numerosity, decreasing in response amplitude with distance from a specific preferred numerosity –. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has identified numerosity-tuned neuronal populations in specific areas of human association cortex using both population receptive field modeling approaches, and fMRI adaptation (or repetition suppression). Other fMRI studies using multivoxel pattern analyses, and representational similarity analysesalso support the existence of numerosity-tuned neural populations in the human brain. Response properties of these neurons mirror properties of numerosity perception. Numerosity perception is correlated with numerosity-tuned responses between trials, and repetition suppressionand multivoxel pattern discriminability between individuals.

### Mirror-touch synesthesia is linked with empathy [^112GzKeg]. Nature Neuroscience (2007). Medium credibility.

Watching another person being touched activates a similar neural circuit to actual touch and, for some people with 'mirror-touch' synesthesia, can produce a felt tactile sensation on their own body. In this study, we provide evidence for the existence of this type of synesthesia and show that it correlates with heightened empathic ability. This is consistent with the notion that we empathize with others through a process of simulation.

### Engagement of the speech motor system in challenging speech perception: activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses [^111zoVum]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The interplay between speech production and perception was initially introduced by Liberman et al. as the Motor Theory of Speech Perception (for a review, see McGettigan & Tremblay). This theory asserts that speech perception depends on articulatory representations in the brain — the motor schemes used to produce speech. Speech perception is thought to automatically activate the motor representations corresponding to each sound in the continuous speech signal from the listener's articulatory repertoire (Liberman & Mattingly). In the Motor Theory, speech sounds serve as informative cues, facilitating the immediate perception of gestures. This theory gained popularity following the discovery of mirror neurons in the premotor cortex of macaque monkeys, which discharged when they observed hand and mouth movements performed by an experimenter (Gallese et al; Rizzolatti & Craighero). Notably, the firing rate of these neurons also increased in response to the sounds accompanying the actions (Kohler et al.). These findings suggest that the motor system is activated simultaneously with the perception of action (whether auditory or visual) and spurred extensive research into the role of the motor network in human speech perception.

1.2.1 Data processing

Accuracy and RT data from any trials in which participants responded before the rTMS pulses (0.3% of trials) were removed. For each participant, the mean and SD correct RTs for each cell of the design were calculated and outlying responses that were more than 2.5 SD from their corresponding mean were excluded (1.7% of trials). The proportion of correct responses and the mean RT were then calculated for each cell of the design (Table 1). For all analyses we report Bayes' Factors (BF 10) indicating the likelihood of the observed effect under the alternative, compared to the null, hypothesis. Bayes' factors were calculated using JASP (JASP Team,) default priors. In terms of interpretation, Bayes' factors BF 10 between 1 and 3 indicate anecdotal evidence; 3–10 moderate evidence; 10–30 strong evidence; 30–100 very strong evidence; and > 100 extreme evidence for the alternative hypothesis; whereas BF 10 between 1 and 0.33 indicate anecdotal evidence; 0.33–0.1 moderate evidence; 0.1–0.033 strong evidence; 0.033–0.01 very strong evidence; and < 0.01 extreme evidence for the null hypothesis (Wagenmakers et al.).

### Effects of different viewing perspectives on somatosensory activations during observation of touch [^115JM67Q]. Human Brain Mapping (2009). Low credibility.

Previous studies showed that neurons in the monkey premotor cortex became active when performing a particular action and also when observing the same action performed by others. These findings suggest a mirror system for action observation. Recently, bimodal neurons, sensitive both to visual and tactile stimulation, were reported in the parietal cortex, suggesting a potential mirror neuron system for observing and experiencing tactile stimulation. Subsequently, a mirror neuron system for observed touch has been suggested. The current study was designed to determine whether the activation of a sensory mirror system during touch observation is affected by possible attributions of the observed touch to oneself (subjective view) or to somebody else (objective view). In the study, healthy volunteers observed video clips of a touched or nontouched hand either in an egocentric or in an allocentric perspective during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results showed activation of somatosensory cortices when observing the hand being touched in egocentric as well as in the allocentric perspectives. Moreover, somatosensory responses differed depending on the perspective of the observed touch. We discuss the results in terms of a possible mirror neuron system for observed and experienced touch.

### Pictures of pain: their contribution to the neuroscience of empathy [^112545KK]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

The study of empathy, a translation of the term 'Einfühlung', originated in 19th century Germany in the sphere of aesthetics, and was followed by studies in psychology and then neuroscience. During the past decade the links between empathy and art have started to be investigated, but now from the neuroscientific perspective, and two different approaches have emerged. Recently, the primacy of the mirror neuron system and its association with automaticity and imitative, simulated movement has been envisaged. But earlier, a number of eminent art historians had pointed to the importance of cognitive responses to art; these responses might plausibly be subserved by alternative neural networks. Focusing here mainly on pictures depicting pain and evoking empathy, both approaches are considered by summarizing the evidence that either supports the involvement of the mirror neuron system, or alternatively suggests other neural networks are likely to be implicated. The use of such pictures in experimental studies exploring the underlying neural processes, however, raises a number of concerns, and suggests caution is exercised in drawing conclusions concerning the networks that might be engaged. These various networks are discussed next, taking into account the affective and sensory components of the pain experience, before concluding that both mirror neuron and alternative neural networks are likelyto be enlisted in the empathetic response to images of pain. A somewhat similar duality of spontaneous and cognitive processes may perhaps also be paralleled in the creation of such images. While noting that some have repudiated the neuroscientific approach to the subject, pictures are nevertheless shown here to represent an unusual but invaluable tool in the study of pain and empathy.

3.2 Towards a unified account of DCD

The improved quality of experimental work on DCD over recent years has enhanced our ability to compare results across studies and to consider how findings might be integrated under a common explanatory framework (Fig. 4), one that considers more precisely the mutual interaction of individual, task, and environmental constraints. Whereas mechanisms research has had a traditional focus on individual‐level factors in performance, recent research suggests that we think about the notion of action constraints (and their interaction) more seriously when assessing and treating children with DCD. 68 The upshot of an integrated framework (or hybrid model) is that individual‐level constraints (such as internal modelling or even executive function deficits) can affect performance (or not) in variable ways, especially as a function of task difficulty/type. The causal mechanisms that determine motor performance are not linear but dynamic and interactive. Several important conclusions can be made about the body of evidence, mainly related to the themes of predictive motor control, action representation, perceptual–motor coupling, task complexity, co‐occurring cognitive issues, compensation, and persistence into adulthood.

Research has continued to address the internal modelling deficit hypothesis and the function of the mirror neuron system (MNS). The internal modelling deficit hypothesis holds reasonably well across different types of movement, but the deficit in forward planning (or predictive control) is more evident in tasks of higher complexity or those that require higher endpoint precision. Related to this, issues with action representation (in gesture imitation and motor imagery) reflect problems associated with the egocentric representation of space and possibly function of the MNS (Fig. 4); neuroimaging data show differences in microstructure associated with the MNS but, on the other hand, there is also very recent evidence from functional neuroimaging that shows no differences in MNS activation between DCD and non‐DCD groups. 69 On balance, additional data are needed to make firmer conclusions about the role of the MNS in DCD.

### When action prediction grows old: an fMRI study [^1123EGDR]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Successful interactions imply the ability to online read what other people are doing to predict the unfolding of their actions and plan an appropriate response. This anticipatory coding of others' gestures is crucial in both cooperative and competitive contexts, like during the performance of musical ensembles (Keller et al; Novembre et al; Novembre & Keller,) or sport competitions (Aglioti et al; Makris & Urgesi; Tomeo et al; Urgesi et al.): in these circumstances, flexible and fine‐tuned temporal coordination engages not only visual but also motor processes.

It is widely accepted that motor representations of actions and their sensory consequences are encoded in the sensorimotor system independently of the specific task performed by the agent (e.g. action observation, motor imagery, or action execution; Hommel et al; Jeannerod; Prinz). In primates, these tasks are associated with neural activity in specific premotor and parietal "mirror neurons" (Rizzolatti & Sinigaglia,), which respond not only when performing but also when observing hand‐object interactions, even when the action conclusion is hidden from view (Umiltà et al.). In humans, homologous fronto‐parietal areas support similar "mirror" mechanisms during action observation (Chong et al; Kilner et al; Mukamel et al.). Previous neuroimaging and neurostimulation studies have shown that predicting the unfolding of observed actions (action prediction abilities) depends on the same fronto‐parietal visuo‐motor network (Avenanti et al; Stadler et al; Urgesi et al; see also Kilner). For instance, the neuromodulation study by Avenanti et al. has demonstrated the causal role of the left premotor cortex in predicting the conclusion of human grasping actions. Together with the interconnected posterior parietal regions (Binkofski & Buccino; Blakemore & Sirigu; Tunik et al.), these brain areas constitute a sensorimotor action observation network (AON, Grafton,) responsible for predicting the unfolding of others' actions and their sensory consequences. These predictions are supported by internal models that link a stimulus (e.g. an observed movement) with its most likely conclusion and outcome, thanks to expectations based on prior experience (Friston et al; Kilner et al; Wolpert et al.).

### Mirror neuron brain regions contribute to identifying actions, but not intentions [^116a9GvR]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

2.1.2 Tasks

All participants completed four tasks (Figure 3) in the following order. See Supplementary Material for more details of stimuli and procedure for each task.

Action understanding

The action understanding and control tasks used in Experiment 1 were combined into a block design with four conditions: action and intention identification within the action understanding task (Hand Action and Hand Intention), and action and intention identification within the appliance task (Control Action and Control Intention).

Mirror neuron localizer

The mirror neuron localizer task was based on previous localizers (Arnstein et al; de la Rosa et al; Martineau et al; Press et al.), consisting of observe, execute, control, catch, and baseline blocks.

Mentalizing localizer: Why/How

The hand portion of the Why/How task (Spunt & Adolphs,) was used. Each trial comprised a question followed by an image of a hand action. The question varied as a function of the condition (How or Why) and referred to how the action was being performed (e.g. "is the person pressing a button?") or to the intention underlying the action (e.g. "is the person helping someone?").

Mentalizing localizer: False belief

The Why/How task contains images of actions and as such could be biased toward localizing more action‐related brain responses. Therefore, the final task was a replication of a text‐based mentalizing localizer by Dodell‐Feder et al. The stimuli comprised two sets of 10 stories requiring participants to represent false content: either about the beliefs a person holds (False Belief) or about a photograph/map/painting (False Photo).

### Mirror neuron brain regions contribute to identifying actions, but not intentions [^112VAgqc]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

Finally, to test the extent to which the disruption to intention identification could be explained by the disruption to action identification, the differences in response times between the hand and appliance tasks were calculated for each condition and site, yielding action and intention identification effects for each site. These values were entered into a regression analysis to determine which of these effects predicted the intention identification effect for lIFG; that is, the extent to which lIFG stimulation disrupted response times to identify intentions. The three predictors were: the vertex intention identification effect; the vertex action identification effect; and the lIFG action identification effect. Both the vertex intention identification effect (β = −.073, t = 0.42, p = .680, BF 10 = 0.508) and the vertex action identification effect (β = .277, t = 1.53, p = .136, BF 10 = 1.123) were not significant predictors of the lIFG intention identification effect, whereas, as illustrated in Figure 2b, the extent to which action identification was disrupted by lIFG stimulation was strongly predictive of the extent to which intention identification was affected (β = .666, t = 5.56, p < .001, R² = .570, BF 10 = 11,404.82).

1.3 Discussion

Experiment 1 sought to investigate the role of the lIFG in action understanding by delivering disruptive stimulation during the processing of actions and intentions performed either by human hands, or, in the control task, by appliances.

Participants responded significantly more accurately and quickly for the control task than the action understanding task. Although the control task was designed to be as difficult as the action understanding task, the nature of the stimuli is less ambiguous. Appliances are typically designed for a particular purpose and, therefore, identifying the action and intention associated with them is relatively easy. For hand actions, however, one configuration of the hand could result in the performance of several different actions and in turn relate to several different intentions (Jacob & Jeannerod). This ambiguity of hand actions is what makes "action understanding" processes so complex and is difficult to recreate with other stimuli, making direct comparisons of accuracy across tasks difficult. However it should be noted that the control task still controls for non‐specific elements of the task, such as word and image processing, decision making, and motor responses.

### Affective and cooperative social interactions modulate effective connectivity within and between the mirror and mentalizing systems [^114Qsi14]. Human Brain Mapping (2018). Low credibility.

Decoding the meaning of others' actions, a crucial step for social cognition, involves different neural mechanisms. While the "mirror" and "mentalizing" systems have been associated with, respectively, the processing of biological actions versus more abstract information, their respective contribution to intention understanding is debated. Processing social interactions seems to recruit both neural systems, with a different weight depending on cues emphasizing either shared action goals or shared mental states. We have previously shown that observing cooperative and affective social interactions elicits stronger activity in key nodes of, respectively, the mirror (left posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), superior parietal cortex (SPL), and ventral/dorsal premotor cortex (vPMC/dPMC)) and mentalizing (ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)) systems. To unveil their causal organization, we investigated the effective connectivity underlying the observation of human social interactions expressing increasing cooperativity (involving left pSTS, SPL, and vPMC) versus affectivity (vmPFC) via dynamic causal modeling in 36 healthy human subjects. We found strong evidence for a model including the pSTS and vPMC as input nodes for the observed interactions. The extrinsic connectivity of this model undergoes oppositely valenced modulations, with cooperativity promoting positive modulations of connectivity between pSTS and both SPL (forward) and vPMC (mainly backward), and affectivity promoting reciprocal positive modulations of connectivity between pSTS and vmPFC (mainly backward). Alongside fMRI data, such divergent effective connectivity suggests that different dimensions underlying the processing of social interactions recruit distinct, although strongly interconnected, neural pathways associated with, respectively, the bottom-up visuomotor processing of motor intentions, and the top-down attribution of affective/mental states.

### Familiarity modulates mirror neuron and mentalizing regions during intention understanding [^115NFkrA]. Human Brain Mapping (2011). Low credibility.

Recent research suggests that the inference of others' intentions from their observed actions is supported by two neural systems that perform complementary roles. The human putative mirror neuron system (pMNS) is thought to support automatic motor simulations of observed actions, with increased activity for previously experienced actions, whereas the mentalizing system provides reflective, non-intuitive reasoning of others' perspectives, particularly in the absence of prior experience. In the current fMRI study, we show how motor familiarity with an action and perceptual familiarity with the race of an actor uniquely modulate these two systems. Chinese participants were asked to infer the intentions of actors performing symbolic gestures, an important form of non-verbal communication that has been shown to activate both mentalizing and mirror neuron regions. Stimuli were manipulated along two dimensions: (1) actor's race (Caucasian vs. Chinese actors) and (2) participants' level of experience with the gestures (familiar or unfamiliar). We found that observing all gestures compared to observing still images was associated with increased activity in key regions of both the pMNS and mentalizing systems. In addition, observations of one's same race generated greater activity in the posterior pMNS-related regions and the insula than observations of a different race. Surprisingly, however, familiar gestures more strongly activated regions associated with mentalizing, while unfamiliar gestures more strongly activated the posterior region of the pMNS, a finding that is contrary to prior literature and demonstrates the powerful modulatory effects of both motor and perceptual familiarity on pMNS and mentalizing regions when asked to infer the intentions of intransitive gestures.

### The "mirror-neuron system" in MS: a 3 tesla fMRI study [^116Qw1UY]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The mirror neuron system (MNS) is an observation-execution matching system activated, in humans, during action observation, motor learning, and imitation of action. We used functional MRI (fMRI) to investigate the properties of the MNS in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

Methods

Using a 3 tesla scanner, we acquired fMRI in 16 right-handed patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 14 controls. Two motor tasks were studied. The first consisted of repetitive flexion-extension of the last four fingers of the right hand (simple task) alternated to epochs of rest; the second (MNS task) consisted of observation of a movie showing the hand of another subject while performing the same task.

Results

During the simple task, compared to controls, patients with MS had more significant activations of the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex and supplementary motor area. During the MNS task, both groups showed the activation of several visual areas, the infraparietal sulcus, and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), bilaterally. The IFG and the visual areas were significantly more active in patients than controls. The between-group interaction analysis showed that in patients with MS, part of the regions of the MNS were more active also during the simple task.

Conclusions

This study suggests increased activation of the mirror neuron system in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) with a normal level of function and widespread CNS damage. The potentialities of this system in facilitating clinical recovery in patients with MS and other neurologic conditions should be investigated.

2.1.3 Procedure

All participants initially took part in a screening session, in which eligibility was assessed and the tasks were practiced within a mock scanner (see Supplementary Material). During the scanning session, task stimuli were projected onto a rear projection screen in the bore of the scanner and were viewed using a mirror attached to the head coil. See Supplementary Material for scanning parameters.

2.1.4 fMRI analysis

fMRI data were analyzed using SPM12 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, UCL, London, UK;). See Supplementary Material for details of pre‐processing and first and second level analyses.

2.2 Results

See Supplementary Material for the behavioural data.

2.2.1 data

Action understanding task

Action identification

Statistical images were created for the Hand Action > Control Action contrast in order to investigate the brain regions active during action identification, while controlling for non‐specific processes such as low‐level visual processing, decision making, and motor responses due to button presses. Activation (corrected at p < .05 FWE) was found bilaterally in the precuneus and IFG (pars opercularis), in the left middle occipital gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, middle frontal gyrus, superior frontal sulcus, and in the right inferior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, cuneus and IFG (pars orbitalis) (Figure 4a). The coordinates of peak activation are shown in Table S1.

Intention identification

In order to investigate the brain regions that were recruited during intention identification in addition to, and independent of, those recruited during action identification, statistical images were created for the contrast Hand Intention > Hand Action. Activation (corrected at p < .05 FWE) was found for one cluster within the left superior frontal gyrus (Table S1).

### The inferior temporal cortex is a potential cortical precursor of orthographic processing in untrained monkeys [^111jQ9ar]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

These results are consistent with a variant of the "neuronal recycling" theory, which posits that the features that support visual object recognition may have been coopted for written word recognition. Specifically, this variant of the theory is that humans have inherited a pre-existing brain system (here, the ventral visual stream) from recent evolutionary ancestors, and they either inherited or evolved learning mechanisms that enable individuals to adapt the outputs of that system during their lifespan for word recognition and other core aspects of orthographic processing. Consistent with this, our results suggest that prereading children likely have a neural population representation that can readily be reused to learn invariant word recognition. Relatedly, it has been previously proposed that the initial properties of this system may explain the child's early competence and errors in letter recognition, e.g. explaining why children tend to make left-right inversion errors by the finding that IT neurons tend to respond similarly to horizontal mirror images of objects. Consistent with this, we here found that the representation of IT-based decoders exhibited a similar signature of left-right mirror symmetry. According to this proposal, this neural representation would become progressively shaped to support written word recognition in a specific script over the course of reading acquisition, and may also explain why all human writing systems throughout the world rely on a universal repertoire of basic shapes. As shown in the present work, those visual features are already well encoded in the ventral visual pathway of illiterate primates, and may bias cultural evolution by determining which scripts are more easily recognizable and learnable.

A similar "neuronal recycling hypothesis" has been proposed for the number system: all primates may have inherited a pre-existing brain system (in the intraparietal sulcus) in which approximate number and other quantitative information is well encoded. It has been suggested that these existing representations of numerosity may be adapted to support exact, symbolic arithmetic, and may bias the cultural evolution of numerical symbols. Likewise, such representations have been found to spontaneously emerge in neural network models optimized for other visual functions. Critically, the term "recycling", in the narrow sense in which it was introduced, refers to such adaptations of neural mechanisms evolved for evolutionary older functions to support newer cultural functions, where the original function is not entirely lost and the underlying neural functionality constrains what the brain can most easily learn. It remains to be seen whether all instances of developmental plasticity meet this definition, or whether learning may also simply replace unused functions without recycling them.

### Gaps between aims and achievements in therapeutic modification of neuronal damage ("Neuroprotection") [^113c8mts]. Neurotherapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

The term "neuroprotection" is often misused, overused, or misunderstood. A reasonable definition of neuroprotection refers to the preservation of "neuronal structure and/or function". Although our knowledge about the cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration has expanded, experimental systems and animal models that mimic the process or allow translation into clinical success remain limited. This editorial discusses reasons for this gap and strategies to close it. Experimental models can only mirror certain aspects of disease mechanisms in humans. Therefore, findings in these models need to be linked with patient data to improve real-life relevance. Successful neuroprotection depends on finding the right "window of opportunity" which varies from very short (stroke) to very long (Alzheimer's disease), necessitating the need to focus on strategies for very early disease recognition. This need challenges the strategies to be chosen, trial approaches and methodologies, and the allocation of resources. Additionally, outcome measures are often not well suited to assess neuroprotection. To this end, surrogate measures, including biomarkers, are useful endpoints to demonstrate evidence of target directed therapeutic utility. Finally, studies have shown that neuroprotection is not likely to succeed when targeting only one pathway. These obstacles have reduced the level of enthusiasm for neuroprotection in certain disease areas (e.g., stroke). Academia, industry, regulatory authorities, funding agencies and patient organizations have to cooperate to a greater extent in order to overcome these impediments and to encourage nonclassical concepts. These concepts will be interdisciplinary in order to achieve meaningful disease modification.

### The neural development of empathy is sensitive to caregiving and early trauma [^116Wk324]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Exposure to stimuli depicting others in distress, including both physical pain and mental distress, activates the SMA/MCC node, with MEG studies implicating alpha modulations in sensorimotor cortex. Our findings add ecological-validity to this literature by showing that this neural pattern is triggered by age-appropriate daily distress of peers, and our use of MEG demonstrates alpha modulations over sensorimotor regions, similar to findings for pain empathy and motor mirroring, suggesting that complex resonance with others' mental states builds on the same circuit. As activations nested in the SMA and MCC are proposed to sustain both aspects of empathy, cognition and affect, our findings suggest that although these nodes are a core part of the embodied simulation system that enables individuals to represent others' motions and emotions in their own brain and initiate an automatic, bottom-up resonance, they also have a top-down regulatory role in conveying more abstract representations that sustain empathy. Consistently, Fan et al.'sreview of neuroimaging studies on empathy shows that the SMA-MCC node is repeatedly activated across a wide variety of empathy studies, regardless of paradigm, stimulus, or emotion, including pain, fear, happiness, disgust, and anxiety.

The capacity for empathy is critical for the human ability to participate in social life, feel compassion, sustain a sense of self, and form affiliative bonds, and like any other core social ability develops in mammals in the context of the mother–infant bond. Parent–child synchrony provides the first experience of nonverbal resonance where the mother adapts her gaze, affective expression, vocal quality, and movements to the infant's earliest signals to create a shared dialog. Synchrony supports the development of abilities that sustain social engagement, including symbol formation, moral understanding, emotion regulation, and frustration tolerance and provides a template for biological synchrony; during synchronous moments parent and child coordinate their heart rhythms, neural response, and oxytocin release, hence, synchrony is a mechanism by which the parent's mature physiological systems externally-regulate the child environment-dependent systems and tune them to social life. Here, we show that synchrony longitudinally shapes the neural basis of empathy in preadolescence and specifically targets brain areas that underpin the interface of cognitive and affective empathy. Because conditions that impair maternal–infant bonding, such as postpartum depression, premature birth, and contextual adversity impinge upon the experience of synchrony, our findings highlight the need to construct early interventions that aim to bolster synchrony in the first years of life.

### Aversive learning shapes neuronal orientation tuning in human visual cortex [^1161GkdS]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The responses of sensory cortical neurons are shaped by experience. As a result perceptual biases evolve, selectively facilitating the detection and identification of sensory events that are relevant for adaptive behaviour. Here we examine the involvement of human visual cortex in the formation of learned perceptual biases. We use classical aversive conditioning to associate one out of a series of oriented gratings with a noxious sound stimulus. After as few as two grating-sound pairings, visual cortical responses to the sound-paired grating show selective amplification. Furthermore, as learning progresses, responses to the orientations with greatest similarity to the sound-paired grating are increasingly suppressed, suggesting inhibitory interactions between orientation-selective neuronal populations. Changes in cortical connectivity between occipital and fronto-temporal regions mirror the changes in visuo-cortical response amplitudes. These findings suggest that short-term behaviourally driven retuning of human visual cortical neurons involves distal top-down projections as well as local inhibitory interactions.

FIGURE 2

Error bars represent standard error. Dots indicate individual participant response times. (b) Relationship between the effect of lIFG stimulation on action (x ‐axis) and intention (y ‐axis) identification

As a further check, therefore, we tested whether any effect of lIFG stimulation on intention identification for hand actions remained once the effect of lIFG stimulation on action identification was accounted for. Specifically, we tested whether the site by task interaction found in the main ANOVA was present for the intention identification condition alone; and whether any effect remained once the effect of lIFG stimulation on action identification was included as a covariate. A two‐way ANOVA with factors of stimulation site (lIFG, vertex) and task (action understanding, control) was performed on the response times from the intention identification condition and revealed main effects of site, F (1,35) = 4.16, p = .049, ηₚ² = 0.11, BF 10 = 5.28, and task, F (1,35) = 20.28, p < .001, ηₚ² = 0.37, BF 10 = 118.83, and a trend toward an interaction between site and task, F (1,35) = 3.11, p = .086, ηₚ² = 0.08, BF 10 = 1.32, consistent with the main analysis. The difference in response times between the hand and appliance tasks for the action identification condition was then calculated for each site and a subsequent difference score between lIFG and vertex for this measure was calculated, creating a variable which represented the effect of lIFG compared to vertex stimulation on action identification for hand compared to appliance tasks. When this covariate was added into the ANOVA above, the site by task interaction was no longer significant, F (1,34) = 0.01, p = .909, ηₚ² = 0.00, BF 10 = 0.385, indicating that the effect of lIFG stimulation on response times to identify intentions from hand actions is explained by the effect of lIFG stimulation on action identification (although the strength of the evidence for the null hypothesis is anecdotal).

### A causal role for frontal cortico-cortical coordination in social action monitoring [^111A3yG8]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The time-frequency domain analysis of the LFP signals further supports our conclusion that the PMv and MPFC have different biological preferences. We confirmed that the magnitude of mu suppression in the MPFC, but not in the PMv, changed systematically depending on the biological nature of the partner (Fig. 4d). Mu suppression has been thought to be a neural signature of mirror neuron activity in human studies. Our findings now suggest that activity in the MPFC, a midline cortical structure, also contributes to mu suppression in humans. In support of this view, it has been documented that mu suppression can be recorded at Cz, in addition to C3 and C4, in the international 10–20 method of electrode placement. Moreover, the magnitude of mu suppression decreases when observing nonbiological movements compared to biological actions, as found in MPFC LFPs in the present study. These findings suggest that electroencephalogram-based mu suppression contains MPFC-derived response components to a significant degree. The functional significance and clinical relevance of mu suppression in each area are unclear. While the mu frequency band seems to carry information regarding social actions in each of the PMv and MPFC, interactions between the two areas, as indexed by coherent activity, take place in much lower frequency bands (< 3 Hz). It has been proposed that slow oscillations serve to synchronize neural activities in large-scale networks. These results indicate that social action information is processed in specific frequency channels within (mu frequency band) and between (delta-frequency band) the PMv and MPFC.

### A causal role for frontal cortico-cortical coordination in social action monitoring [^114jiSS6]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Identification of recording sites

PMv: The rostral bank of the arcuate sulcus was initially explored using intracortical microstimulation (ICMS; cathodal pulses of 0.2-ms duration at 333 Hz) to identify the posterior end of the frontal eye field (FEF). Briefly, any penetration was considered to be in the FEF if saccades were evoked by ICMS with low thresholds (typically 11 pulses at a current intensity of < 50 μA). During this mapping, the location of the spur of the arcuate sulcus was also noted on the basis of the complete lack of neuronal activity. The premotor cortex was located just caudal to the FEF, and the PMv was identified based on its location relative to the arcuate spur and on distal movements evoked by ICMS. During this functional mapping, we 'clinically' examined functional properties of well-isolated neurons. Briefly, the monkeys were presented with a food item and allowed to grasp it when at reaching distance. To test mirror properties, an experimenter also performed a series of hand actions in front of the monkeys, such as putting a food item on a surface and grasping it.

MPFC: The MPFC mainly included the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and its rostrally adjacent prefrontal area 9. We first identified the border between the SMA and pre-SMA according to physiological criteria. Briefly, the face region of the SMA was carefully mapped on the basis of motor effects evoked by ICMS (typically 11–22 pulses at a current intensity of up to 40 μA) and neuronal responses to somatosensory stimuli. The pre-SMA was identified just rostral to the face region in the SMA, and was characterized by (1) a higher threshold for evoking forelimb movements (≥ 40 pulses and ≥ 40 μA), (2) complex motor effects involving multiple joints following ICMS, and (3) the prevalence of neurons responsive to visual rather than somatosensory stimuli. The rostral-most portion of the recording site was 12 mm anterior to the border between the SMA and pre-SMA.

Difference in actor coding and biological preference between two areas

We isolated 565 PMv and 480 MPFC single neurons by multisite recordings with no sampling bias (Fig. 2a). Among these, 277 PMv and 215 MPFC neurons exhibited significantly changed activity in the 600-ms period starting 400 ms before the target button press (peri-action period; see Methods). Because direct comparisons of neural activities have never been reported between the PMv and MPFC in the same monkeys performing the same tasks, we first examined actor coding in the RA condition. Most interesting in this respect was the existence of three types of neuronal populations referred to as self, mirror, and partner types (see Methods for the statistical definition of each neuronal type). These populations were found in both areas but with different frequencies (Fig. 2b).

### Mirror-induced visual illusion of hand movements: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study [^111cBvAN]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify neural networks associated with the use of a mirror to superimpose movement of 1 hand on top of a nonmoving contralateral hand (often referred to as mirror therapy or mirror-induced visual illusion).

Design

A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of mirror-induced visual illusion of hand movements using a blocked design in a 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Neural activation was compared in a no-mirror experiment and a mirror experiment. Both experiments consisted of blocks of finger tapping of the right hand versus rest. In the mirror experiment, movement of the left hand was simulated by mirror reflection of right hand movement.

Setting

University medical center.

Participants

Eighteen healthy subjects.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Differences in fMRI activation between the 2 experiments.

Results

In the mirror experiment, we found supplementary activation compared with the no-mirror experiment in 2 visual areas: the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the right superior occipital gyrus.

Conclusions

In this study, we found 2 areas uniquely associated with the mirror-induced visual illusion of hand movements: the right STG and the right superior occipital gyrus. The STG is a higher-order visual region involved in the analysis of biological stimuli and is activated by observation of biological motion. The right superior occipital gyrus is located in the secondary visual cortex within the dorsal visual stream. In the literature, the STG has been linked with the mirror neuron system. However, we did not find activation within the frontoparietal mirror neuron system to support further a link with the mirror neuron system. Future studies are needed to explore the mechanism of mirror induced visual illusions in patient populations in more detail.

1.1.3 Stimuli

Sixteen images were used within each task (action understanding: hand images, and control: appliance images). For each task, each image was presented with both an action word phrase and an intention word phrase, and thus each condition comprised 16 word phrase‐image stimuli. Each image was presented twice in each condition (once with a matching and once with a mismatching word phrase), resulting in a total of 32 trials per condition; 64 trials per task. Trials from each condition were randomly distributed throughout the task.

Hand stimuli consisted of still images depicting pantomimed hand actions, adapted from video clips created by Molenberghs, Hayward et al. (see Figure 1). Each image was assigned two corresponding word phrases: one relating to the configuration of hand parts depicted in the image (action identification), and the other relating to the motivation underlying the depicted action (intention identification). The action and intention identification conditions were therefore fully matched in terms of the image properties. Each word phrase consisted of two to three words starting with the word "to", for example, "to turn" (action) or "to open" (intention). The word phrases in the action and intention conditions were matched on a range of variables including: number of words (t [15] = 1.46, p = .164); number of characters (t [15] = 0.24, p = .812); word frequency, as determined by per million words in the SUBTLEX database (van Heuven et al.), t (15) = 0.80, p = .435, and abstractness ratings (Brysbaert et al.), t (15) = 0.76, p = .457.

### Reduced mirror neuron activity in schizophrenia and its association with theory of mind deficits: evidence from a transcranial magnetic stimulation study [^117UK4Rh]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The "mirror-neuron system" has been proposed to be a neurophysiological substrate for social cognition (SC) ability. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigms to compare putative mirror neuron activity (MNA) in 3 groups: antipsychotic-naive, medicated schizophrenia patients, and healthy comparison subjects. We also explored the association between MNA and SC ability in patients.

Methods

Fifty-four consenting right-handed schizophrenia patients (33 antipsychotic naive) and 45 matched healthy comparison subjects completed a TMS experiment to assess putative premotor MNA. We used 4 TMS paradigms of eliciting motor-evoked potentials (MEP) in the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. These were applied while the subjects observed a goal-directed action involving the FDI (actual action and its video) and a static image. The difference in the amplitude of the MEP while they observed the static image and the action provided a measure of MNA. Subjects also underwent SC assessments (theory of mind [ToM], emotion processing, and social perception).

Results

Two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant group × occasion interaction effect in 3 TMS paradigms, indicating deficient motor facilitation during action observation relative to rest state in antipsychotic-naive schizophrenia patients as compared with the other two groups. Among patients, there were significant direct correlations between measures of MNA and ToM performance.

Conclusions

Antipsychotic-naive schizophrenia patients have poorer MNA than medicated patients and healthy controls. Measures of putative MNA had significant and consistent associations with ToM abilities. These findings suggest a possibility of deficient mirror neuron system underlying SC deficits in schizophrenia.

### Mirror neuron brain regions contribute to identifying actions, but not intentions [^1171osdc]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

Mirror neuron localizer task

Mirror neuron brain regions were determined by conducting a conjunction analysis between Observe > Baseline and Execute > Baseline. As shown in Figure 4b, this revealed bilateral activation in the cerebellum, cuneus, inferior parietal lobule, supplementary motor area, precentral gyrus and laterally, in the right fusiform gyrus, posterior middle temporal gyrus, middle cingulate gyrus, and in the left middle occipital gyrus, lingual gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, insula, postcentral gyrus and IFG (pars opercularis).

To perform the univariate region of interest (ROI) analyses, peak coordinates from each cluster identified within the conjunction analysis were used as the centre of each ROI and spheres (radius = 10 mm) were created around these coordinates, resulting in 21 ROIs (Table S2).

Why/How localizer task

Statistical maps of the Why > How contrast revealed bilateral activation in the middle occipital gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, angular gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, lateral orbito‐frontal cortex and laterally in the right temporal pole, anterior superior temporal sulcus, IFG (pars triangularis) and in the left hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (Figure 4c).

To create the first mentalizing brain region localizer, the peak coordinates from each cluster were used as the centre of each ROI as above, resulting in 16 ROIs (Table S3).

False belief localizer task

The False Belief > False Photo contrast revealed bilateral activation in the TPJ, precuneus, superior frontal gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex, and laterally in the right anterior superior temporal sulcus/temporal pole, middle frontal gyrus, IFG (pars triangularis) and in the left superior temporal sulcus, caudate and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (Figure 4d).

To create the second mentalizing brain region localizer, the peak coordinates from each cluster were used as the centre of each ROI as above, resulting in 12 ROIs (Table S4).

### Mirror neuron brain regions contribute to identifying actions, but not intentions [^111vdS52]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

Why/How ROIs

To determine whether mentalizing brain regions showed additional activation for intention identification over and above that of action identification, one‐sample t ‐tests were conducted on the beta values for the Hand Intention > Hand Action contrast extracted from the ROIs identified in the Why > How contrast. Following Bonferroni correction, two ROIs reached significance: the left angular gyrus, t (36) = 3.41, p = .007, BF 10 = 40.79, and left lateral orbito‐frontal cortex, t (36) = 3.16, p = .015, BF 10 = 22.42.

False belief ROIs

To determine whether brain regions associated with false belief processing showed additional activation for intention identification over and above that of action identification, one‐sample t‐tests were conducted on the beta values for the Hand Intention > Hand Action contrast extracted from the ROIs identified in the False Belief > False Photo contrast. Following Bonferroni correction, two ROIs reached significance: the precuneus, t (36) = 2.70, p = .046, BF 10 = 7.99, and left superior frontal gyrus, t (36) = 3.64, p = .002, BF 10 = 72.22.

2.3 Discussion

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether mirror neuron brain regions are involved in action and intention identification. ROI analysis of the brain regions active during the observation and execution of hand actions in the mirror neuron localizer task, revealed that action identification activated several mirror neuron brain regions, including the inferior parietal lobule, supramarginal gyrus, precentral gyrus and lIFG (pars opercularis), with evidence ranging from strong to extreme for these analyses. However, ROI analysis of the additional activation produced during intention identification revealed anecdotal to moderate evidence against the involvement of mirror neuron brain regions in this process. Instead, this activation was found in brain regions associated with two independent mentalizing brain region localizer tasks, specifically the angular gyrus, precuneus, superior frontal gyrus, and the lateral orbito‐frontal cortex, with moderate to very strong evidence for the involvement of these brain regions in intention identification.

### No evidence for mirror system dysfunction in schizophrenia from a multimodal TMS / EEG study [^115kN5Xn]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Dysfunctional mirror neuron systems have been proposed to contribute to the social cognitive deficits observed in schizophrenia. A few studies have explored mirror systems in schizophrenia using various techniques such as TMS (levels of motor resonance) or EEG (levels of mu suppression), with mixed results. This study aimed to use a novel multimodal approach (i.e. concurrent TMS and EEG) to further investigate mirror systems and social cognition in schizophrenia. Nineteen individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 19 healthy controls participated. Single-pulse TMS was applied to M1 during the observation of hand movements designed to elicit mirror system activity. Single EEG electrodes (C3, CZ, C4) recorded brain activity. Participants also completed facial affect recognition and theory of mind tasks. The schizophrenia group showed significant deficits in facial affect recognition and higher level theory of mind compared to healthy controls. A significant positive relationship was revealed between mu suppression and motor resonance for the overall sample, indicating concurrent validity of these measures. Levels of mu suppression and motor resonance were not significantly different between groups. These findings indicate that in stable outpatients with schizophrenia, mirror system functioning is intact, and therefore their social cognitive difficulties may be caused by alternative pathophysiology.

### Altered brain activation during action imitation and observation in schizophrenia: a translational approach to investigating social dysfunction in schizophrenia [^1149RQyF]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Social impairments are a key feature of schizophrenia, but their underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Imitation, a process through which we understand the minds of others, involves the so-called mirror neuron system, a network comprising the inferior parietal lobe, inferior frontal gyrus, and posterior superior temporal sulcus. The authors examined mirror neuron system function in schizophrenia.

Method

Sixteen medicated schizophrenia patients and 16 healthy comparison subjects performed an action imitation/observation task during functional MRI. Participants saw a video of a moving hand or spatial cue and were instructed to either execute finger movements associated with the stimulus or simply observe. Activation in the mirror neuron system was measured during imitative versus nonimitative actions and observation of a moving hand versus a moving spatial cue. These contrasts were compared across groups.

Results

Activation in the mirror neuron system was less specific for imitation in schizophrenia. Relative to healthy subjects, patients had reduced activity in the posterior superior temporal sulcus during imitation and greater activity in the posterior superior temporal sulcus and inferior parietal lobe during nonimitative action. Patients also showed reduced activity in these regions during action observation. Mirror neuron system activation was related to symptom severity and social functioning in patients and to schizotypal syndrome in comparison subjects.

Conclusions

Given the role of the inferior parietal lobe and posterior superior temporal sulcus in imitation and social cognition, impaired imitative ability in schizophrenia may stem from faulty perception of biological motion and transformations from perception to action. These findings extend our understanding of social dysfunction in schizophrenia.

### Mirror neuron brain regions contribute to identifying actions, but not intentions [^114CfRof]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

There was also a significant interaction between site and task, F (1,35) = 6.08, p = .019, ηₚ² = 0.15, BF 10 = 4.02 (Figure 2a). Simple effects analysis revealed that participants responded significantly slower for the action understanding task when TMS pulses were administered to the lIFG (mean = 885.1 ms, SD = 271.3) compared to when they were administered to the vertex (mean = 787.7 ms, SD = 222.8), t (35) = 3.06, p = .004, d = 1.04, BF 10 = 8.96. However, there was no significant difference in RT for the control task when TMS pulses were administered to the lIFG (mean = 758.8 ms, SD = 201.6) compared to when they were administered to the vertex (mean = 719.5 ms, SD = 185.5), t (35) = 1.16, p = .255, BF 10 = 0.332. Furthermore, this site by task interaction did not differ by condition (F (1,35) = 0.264, p = .610, ηₚ² = 0.01, BF 10 = 0.002), indicating that the effect of lIFG stimulation did not differ for action versus intention identification. That is, there was no additional effect of lIFG stimulation on intention identification, beyond its effect on action identification. The Bayes' factor associated with the above three‐way interaction indicates extreme evidence for the null hypothesis. This allows us to effectively rule out two possibilities. First, if the lIFG was not involved in intention understanding at all, we would have found a three‐way interaction whereby lIFG stimulation affected action identification and not intention identification. Alternatively, if the lIFG was involved more strongly in intention identification than in action identification we would have found a three‐way interaction in the other direction. However, the absence of a three‐way interaction indicates that the involvement of the lIFG in intention identification does not differ from its involvement in action identification.

### Can we share a pain we never felt? Neural correlates of empathy in patients with congenital insensitivity to pain [^112MZyJw]. Neuron (2009). Low credibility.

Theories of empathy differ regarding the relative contributions of automatic resonance and perspective taking in understanding others' emotions. Patients with the rare syndrome of congenital insensitivity to pain cannot rely on "mirror matching" (i.e., resonance) mechanisms to understand the pain of others. Nevertheless, they showed normal fMRI responses to observed pain in anterior mid-cingulate cortex and anterior insula, two key regions of the so-called "shared circuits" for self and other pain. In these patients (but not in healthy controls), empathy trait predicted ventromedial prefrontal responses to somatosensory representations of others' pain and posterior cingulate responses to emotional representations of others' pain. These findings underline the major role of midline structures in emotional perspective taking and understanding someone else's feeling despite the lack of any previous personal experience of it — an empathic challenge frequently raised during human social interactions.

### Neural and computational mechanisms of action processing: interaction between visual and motor representations [^114g2JEs]. Neuron (2015). Low credibility.

Action recognition has received enormous interest in the field of neuroscience over the last two decades. In spite of this interest, the knowledge in terms of fundamental neural mechanisms that provide constraints for underlying computations remains rather limited. This fact stands in contrast with a wide variety of speculative theories about how action recognition might work. This review focuses on new fundamental electrophysiological results in monkeys, which provide constraints for the detailed underlying computations. In addition, we review models for action recognition and processing that have concrete mathematical implementations, as opposed to conceptual models. We think that only such implemented models can be meaningfully linked quantitatively to physiological data and have a potential to narrow down the many possible computational explanations for action recognition. In addition, only concrete implementations allow judging whether postulated computational concepts have a feasible implementation in terms of realistic neural circuits.

### The mirror neuron system | Radiology | JAMA neurology… [^113Cpsg4]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Mirror neurons were first described in the F5 sector of the macaque ventral premotor cortex. 1, 2These neurons, like most neurons in F5, discharge in association with movements that have a specific goal. They do not fire when a monkey executes simple movements, that is, during active displacement of a body part devoid of a specific goal. It is generally assumed that the main functional role of parietofrontal mirror neurons is to understand motor acts performed by others in an automatic way, ie, by matching them to the monkey's own motor repertoire. 5Evidence in favor of this hypothesis came from experiments that showed that F5 mirror neurons also fire when monkeys. Their behavior is illustrated in Figure 1. These findings indicate that action-constrained parietal mirror neurons do not only encode the observed motor act, but also the aim of the observed action.

It has been hypothesized that this organization provides a neural substrate for understanding the goal of the entire observed action before it is concluded. Evidence of the existence of a mirror system in humans comes from neuroimaging studies and noninvasive neurophysiological investigations. 9 Neuroimaging demonstrated the existence of 2 main networks with mirror properties: one residing in the parietal lobe and the premotor cortex plus the caudal part of the inferior frontal gyrus, and the other formed by the insula and the anterior mesial frontal cortex. The parietofrontal mirror system is involved in recognition of voluntary behavior, while the limbic mirror system is devoted to the recognition of affective behavior. In the present review, we will describe only the first system.

There is evidence that only motor acts that are present in the motor repertoire of the observer are effective in activating the mirror system. This was shown in an fMRI experiment in which oral actions made by humans, monkeys, and dogs were presented to normal human volunteers. The data demonstrated that the left hemisphere IPL and inferior frontal gyrus responded to actions made by a human and a nonhuman performer, as long as the action was part of the motor repertoire of the human observer. The mirror system failed to be activated when the action belonged to another species. 19.

### High-frequency deep brain stimulation for parkinson disease… [^111i8GpJ]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Early research by DeLong was focused on the basal ganglia, a grouping of interconnected nuclei deep in the cerebral hemispheres. Although the functions of the basal ganglia were obscure, severe disturbances of voluntary and involuntary movements observed in patients with diseases affecting the basal ganglia clearly suggested a prominent role of the basal ganglia in movement. Accordingly, DeLong's early studies of single cell recording in primates were focused on the role of the basal ganglia in movement. 1 Attention was directed to the major output nucleus of the basal ganglia, the internal segment of the globus pallidus, because it was thought that neuronal activity, studied during different movement tasks, would most clearly reflect the overall contributions of the basal ganglia to movement.

The output from the GPi was known to be inhibitory and thought to both facilitate and inhibit movement by appropriate increases and decreases of discharge in ensembles of individual neurons. Movement-related neurons were found throughout the basal ganglia in a specific network that DeLong and colleagues designated as the "motor circuit, " which they found functioned in parallel with other basal ganglia circuits implicated in cognitive, emotional, and reward functions.
2. Together with colleagues, DeLong examined the activity of neurons in the striatum and subthalamic nucleus, basal ganglia nuclei that both received cortical input and provided inhibitory and excitatory influences, respectively, on the output nucleus. It was well known that lesions of the subthalamic nucleus in both humans and experimental animals resulted in pronounced involuntary movements of the contralateral limbs, whereas depletion of dopamine in the striatum was known to cause parkinsonism.

dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and mimicked the motor features as well as the biochemistry and pathology of Parkinson disease. 3 In initial studies in the MPTP-treated primate model, neuronal activity was found to be clearly increased and abnormally patterned in both the GPi and subthalamic nucleus. By contrast, a lesion in the subthalamic nucleus in primates that caused chorea was found to result in a decrease of basal ganglia output. These contrasting findings in the animal models of chorea and Parkinson disease indicated that a lesion of the subthalamic nucleus in the MPTP model of Parkinson disease would provide a direct test of the hypothesis that parkinsonism was due to an increased excitatory drive on GPi from the subthalamic nucleus.

### Atypical cross talk between mentalizing and mirror… [^113d9Yq9]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Even though both ToM and the MNS are involved in understanding others, a meta-analysis of more than 200 functional magnetic resonance imaging task-based activation studies17 confirmed that, functionally and anatomically, they are 2 distinct systems. While the MNS is an action-understanding system, activated only in the presence of biological motion, ToM is recruited during a more abstract processing of others' intentionality, in the absence of any biological motion.

Anatomically, the meta-analysis identified ToM with a frontal-posterior network of brain regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral temporal-parietal junction, and posterior cingulate cortex /precuneus, while the human MNS engaged the anterior intraparietal sulcus, premotor cortex, and posterior superior temporal sulcus.
17. at rest, in the absence of an overt cognitive task. 30 Importantly, those patterns correspond to brain networks recruited during specific cognitive or mental processes31–34 and are, therefore, thought to reflect intrinsically organized functional networks35 formed by a long history of frequent coactivation associated with functional specialization.

36, 37 Moreover, resting-state FC patterns are largely consistent with anatomical connectivity38, 39 and appear robust and highly reliable across individuals. 39–43. The present study investigated whether adolescents with ASD show altered FC in the MNS and ToM, 2 brain networks putatively impaired in ASD and involved in social processing, by using resting-state fcMRI to assess interregional BOLD correlations in these networks. Our aims were 2-fold: to examine the extent of functional specialization, as deduced from the FC, of the ToM and MNS networks in adolescents with ASD and to relate FC of these networks involved in understanding others to variation on clinical measures of social impairment. The observed links between ToM-MNS cross-network connectivity and sociocommunicative symptom severity may support this interpretation.

At the very least, these findings suggest that connectivity of and between the ToM and MNS networks plays a role in autistic symptomatology.

### Glial cells under physiologic and pathologic conditions… [^111gKAbB]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Microglia are macrophagelike cells that serve a phagocytic function. Macroglia are composed of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, which are the CNS equivalent of myelinating Schwann cells that are found in the peripheral nervous system. In close association with neurons, astrocytes enwrap synaptic terminals and make extensive contacts with endothelial cells from the capillaries. Moreover, astrocytes are interconnected with one another by gap junctions. In the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, they give rise to new neurons throughout life in many vertebrates, including humans.

1. The pathways taken by newborn neurons are specific and depend on cellular contacts and diffusible guidance cues, most of which are provided by glial cells and their precursors. Development and lamination of the mammalian neocortex is controlled by a set of specialized neuroepithelial radial glial cells that provide the migration scaffold used by roughly 90% of cortical neurons.

In addition to integration of neurotransmitter input, astrocytes release their own transmitters that act on neighboring neurons and modulate their function, suggesting a bidirectional signaling pathway between astrocytes and neurons. If glial cells can release neurotransmitters in a regulated manner, this process must be a fundamental component of their dialogue with neurons during synaptic activity. What is the role of glial cells in memory and learning. Studies in brain slices showed that activation of astrocytes increased miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Astrocytes may therefore be necessary in the activity-dependent modulation of inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus. 6 A role of astrocytes in synaptic function is also supported by results of studies in mice lacking the intermediate-filament glial fibrillary acidic protein, a protein found predominantly in astrocytes of the CNS.

The mutant mice indeed displayed enhanced long-term potentiation compared with control mice. Therefore, these mice demonstrate that a primary defect in astrocytes influences neuronal physiology. 7 In a related study8 using another GFAP-deficient mouse strain, excitatory synaptic transmission from parallel or climbing fibers to Purkinje cells was unaltered in the cerebellum, and these synapses displayed normal short-term synaptic plasticity to paired stimuli. In contrast, long-term depression at parallel-fiber Purkinje cell synapses was clearly deficient, suggesting a role for astrocytes in induction and maintenance of long-term depression in the cerebellum. 8.
