## Question

Chronic pelvic pain management in women

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about chronic pelvic pain management in women. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining chronic pelvic pain and its epidemiology. Then, I should verify the biopsychosocial model and why a multidisciplinary approach is foundational. Next, I will review first-line nonpharmacologic therapies, followed by pharmacologic options and their evidence. After that, I need to examine surgical indications and what to avoid. I will then consider special populations and contexts, and finally synthesize a practical, staged algorithm with monitoring and follow-up, while double-checking areas where evidence conflicts or is limited.

> Let me first confirm the definition and burden so I don't anchor on a misleading premise. Chronic pelvic pain is generally defined as noncyclic pain perceived in pelvic structures lasting at least 6 months, with prevalence estimates around 15–26% in women, substantial healthcare utilization, and frequent absence of a single identifiable cause, which underscores the need for a biopsychosocial approach rather than a purely organ-centric one [^654e5cc1] [^e0363b5e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology. I should verify the multifactorial model. Contemporary guidance emphasizes overlapping pain conditions, central sensitization, musculoskeletal contributors, and psychosocial drivers; indeed, musculoskeletal pain and dysfunction are present in 50–90% of patients, and trauma-informed, biopsychosocial care is repeatedly recommended across high-quality guidelines and reviews, reinforcing that management must be interdisciplinary and patient-centered [^654e5cc1] [^2152af28] [^8a35ab6b].

> Next, I should review first-line nonpharmacologic therapies and confirm their standing. Pelvic floor physical therapy is consistently recommended as first-line for myofascial and pelvic floor dysfunction, with benefits on pain, function, and mood; behavioral strategies including CBT, ACT, and mindfulness are endorsed to improve coping and quality of life; and patient education with shared decision-making is essential to set expectations and functional goals, especially when no single pathology is identified [^2152af28] [^54941f80] [^d478c81e] [^731ce9cf].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for psychotherapy and pelvic floor therapy so I don't overstate it. While many recommendations are based on extrapolation from chronic pain literature and moderate-quality evidence, multiple guidelines converge on these modalities as core elements, and emerging work highlights the value of trauma-informed, biopsychosocial care; importantly, when psychological distress is significant, guideline-directed psychological treatment is advised, which aligns with patient-centered models [^2152af28] [^731ce9cf] [^871521ec].

> I will now examine pharmacologic options, starting with simple analgesics, and I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize. NSAIDs and acetaminophen are reasonable first-line analgesics for pain flares, though evidence specific to CPP is limited; opioids are not recommended for long-term management due to lack of efficacy and harms, with SOGC explicitly advising against long-term opioid therapy and ACOG recommending weaning when already prescribed, reserving any exception for specialist oversight after other options fail [^3e3f0e00] [^2152af28] [^e09d62e1].

> Let me consider antidepressants next, and I should double-check the evidence base. SNRIs such as duloxetine and venlafaxine are recommended for chronic pain with neuropathic features, and TCAs like amitriptyline or nortriptyline are options, particularly for neuropathic pelvic pain, painful bladder syndrome, or IBS; however, evidence is largely extrapolated from other chronic pain conditions, so shared decision-making about benefits and side effects is key [^2152af28] [^8262927f] [^009ee41e] [^bb2f87f0].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought gabapentin had strong support here, but I should correct that. A large, multicenter RCT (GaPP2) found gabapentin was not effective for women with chronic pelvic pain without obvious pathology, so routine use should be discouraged; earlier smaller studies suggested benefit, but the higher-quality evidence now overrides those findings, and guidelines accordingly do not recommend gabapentin as first-line for undifferentiated CPP, though it may still be considered for clearly neuropathic phenotypes in select cases [^2e91756a] [^2152af28].

> Next, I should review hormonal therapies and confirm their role. Progestogens and GnRH agonists or antagonists are reasonable when pain is cyclical or endometriosis is suspected, with moderate-quality evidence supporting progestogens for short-term pain reduction, albeit with adverse effects like weight gain; GnRH analogs can be effective but require careful counseling on menopausal effects and bone health, and add-back therapy is often used when treatment extends beyond 6 months [^3105ca66] [^1f8dcb57].

> I need to check surgical indications and what to avoid. Routine adhesiolysis is not recommended for CPP without another indication, and LUNA lacks consistent benefit; hysterectomy may be considered only when pain is clearly uterine in origin and refractory, and even then, only about half experience meaningful improvement, so patient selection and preoperative counseling are critical; for endometriosis, laparoscopic excision with adjunctive medical therapy is favored over empiric surgery without a plan [^2152af28] [^890874d0] [^2a45ddfd].

> But wait, what if the pain is driven by a specific peripheral generator or overlapping condition. I should confirm targeted strategies: for pudendal neuralgia or other peripheral nerve pain syndromes, early referral to experts in multidisciplinary settings and use of standard neuropathic pain approaches are advised; for bladder pain syndrome, guideline-concordant urologic/gynecologic management and behavioral therapies are appropriate; for anorectal pain syndromes, percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation or sacral neuromodulation may be considered in refractory cases [^4f22e11f] [^6d212174] [^08361442].

> Let me think about special populations and contexts so I don't miss important modifiers. Adolescents and those with trauma histories benefit from trauma-informed, developmentally sensitive care; patients with limited access require pragmatic, stepped models integrating primary care with telehealth and local resources; and those with high opioid risk or current use need coordinated taper plans with mental health support and addiction expertise when indicated [^ec31b710] [^3ff8710a].

> I should now synthesize a practical, staged algorithm and verify alignment with guidelines. Start with education, biopsychosocial assessment, and pelvic floor physical therapy; add simple analgesics as needed; if inadequate, consider SNRIs or TCAs for neuropathic features; reserve hormonal therapy for cyclical pain or endometriosis; avoid routine opioids and avoid gabapentin for undifferentiated CPP; escalate to pain specialist or multidisciplinary clinic if no improvement after 3–6 months; and consider surgery only for well-selected, refractory cases with clear anatomic drivers and shared decision-making [^2152af28] [^8a35ab6b] [^fe4f321d].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring and follow-up elements so the plan is actionable. Functional goals, validated pain and quality-of-life measures, and periodic reassessment of efficacy are essential; ineffective treatments should be discontinued, and the diagnosis reconsidered if multiple reasonable trials fail; this iterative approach reduces therapeutic drift and maintains alignment with patient priorities [^2152af28] [^a89c6b33].

> Finally, I need to ensure the key takeaways are explicit and evidence-anchored. Chronic pelvic pain in women is common, multifactorial, and often without a single cause; a biopsychosocial, multidisciplinary approach with pelvic floor therapy, behavioral strategies, and judicious pharmacotherapy yields the best outcomes; routine surgery and long-term opioids should be avoided; and patient education with shared decision-making is central to care, with evidence strongest for nonpharmacologic modalities and selective use of medications tailored to phenotype and comorbidities [^654e5cc1] [^2152af28] [^8a35ab6b].

---

Chronic pelvic pain in women is best managed with a **multidisciplinary, biopsychosocial approach** [^654e5cc1] that addresses physical, psychological, and social contributors [^af1fa1f1]. First-line care includes **pelvic floor physical therapy** [^54941f80], **CBT** [^d478c81e], and **patient education** [^01f0ffd5]; pharmacologic options such as NSAIDs, SNRIs/TCAs [^8262927f], and hormonal therapies (progestins, GnRH analogs) [^3105ca66] are added as needed. Surgery is reserved for refractory cases with identifiable pathology [^890874d0], and opioids are not recommended for long-term use [^3e3f0e00]. Regular reassessment and individualized care are essential to improve pain, function, and quality of life [^a89c6b33].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnosis

A thorough evaluation is essential to identify underlying causes and guide management:

- **History and physical examination**: Detailed pain history, menstrual history, and psychosocial assessment; pelvic and musculoskeletal examination to identify myofascial pain, trigger points, and pelvic floor dysfunction [^2152af28].

- **Laboratory and imaging tests**: Limited utility; use selectively based on clinical suspicion (e.g. endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, PID) [^17d3a719].

- **Multidisciplinary assessment**: Involve gynecology, urology, gastroenterology, pain medicine, psychology, and physiotherapy as indicated [^8a35ab6b].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological therapies are foundational and often effective:

| **Intervention** | **Evidence and recommendations** |
|-|-|
| Pelvic floor physical therapy | First-line for myofascial pain and pelvic floor dysfunction; improves pain, function, and sexual health [^54941f80] [^3f2ec2cf] |
| Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) | Reduces pain, catastrophizing, and improves coping; recommended by ACOG and AAFP [^2152af28] [^d478c81e] |
| Patient education | Essential to explain pain mechanisms, set expectations, and promote self-management [^01f0ffd5] [^22373f1a] |
| Acupuncture | Considered for musculoskeletal CPP; modest evidence [^2152af28] [^8dbdd713] |
| Mindfulness and acceptance-based therapies | Useful for coping and quality of life improvement [^731ce9cf] [^871521ec] |

---

## Pharmacological management

Pharmacologic therapy is individualized based on symptoms, comorbidities, and response:

- **Analgesics**: NSAIDs and acetaminophen for mild pain; limited evidence in CPP [^notfound].

- **Antidepressants**: SNRIs (e.g. duloxetine) and TCAs (e.g. amitriptyline) for neuropathic pain and central sensitization [^8262927f] [^009ee41e].

- **Anticonvulsants**: Gabapentin or pregabalin for neuropathic pain; evidence mixed, with a large RCT showing no benefit for undifferentiated CPP [^2e91756a] [^2152af28].

- **Hormonal therapies**: Progestins, GnRH agonists/antagonists for endometriosis-related pain; consider add-back therapy for GnRH analogs [^3105ca66] [^1f8dcb57].

- **Opioids**: Not recommended for long-term management due to lack of efficacy and risks; reserve for short-term use in exceptional cases [^3e3f0e00] [^2152af28].

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgery is reserved for refractory cases with identifiable pathology:

- **Laparoscopy**: Diagnostic and therapeutic for endometriosis, adhesions, or other pathology [^notfound].

- **Hysterectomy**: Consider only when pain is clearly uterine and refractory to conservative therapy; benefit is variable [^f947e376].

- **Neuroablative procedures**: Presacral neurectomy or uterosacral nerve ablation may be considered in select cases; evidence limited [^890874d0].

---

## Emerging and experimental therapies

Emerging therapies show promise but require further research:

- **Neuromodulation**: Sacral neuromodulation for refractory bladder or pelvic pain syndromes [^08361442].

- **Botulinum toxin**: Intramuscular injections for pelvic floor dysfunction and myofascial pain [^notfound].

- **Cannabinoids**: Under investigation for chronic pain; limited evidence in CPP [^notfound].

---

## Patient-centered care and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to assess response, adjust therapy, and address new issues. Shared decision-making ensures **individualized care** aligned with patient preferences [^2152af28]. Addressing psychological comorbidities — such as anxiety, depression, and trauma — improves outcomes [^d6fb2d76].

---

## Barriers and challenges

Significant barriers persist, including **delayed diagnosis**, fragmented care, and limited access to multidisciplinary services [^fa9e15a0]. Educational gaps among clinicians and stigma further impede care [^bf4e3c17].

---

## Conclusion

Effective management of chronic pelvic pain in women requires a **multidisciplinary, biopsychosocial approach** [^654e5cc1] that prioritizes non-pharmacological therapies, judicious pharmacologic use, and selective surgical interventions. Individualized, patient-centered care with regular follow-up is essential to optimize outcomes [^a89c6b33].

### An update on the management of chronic pelvic pain in women [^af1fa1f1]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain represents a major public health problem for women and impacts significantly on their quality of life. Yet it is under-researched and a challenge to manage. Women who suffer from chronic pelvic pain frequently describe their healthcare journey as long, via a variety of specialists and frustrating, with their pain often dismissed. Aetiological factors and associations are best conceptualised using the 'three P's' model of predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors. This integrates the numerous biological, psychological and social contributors to the complex, multifactorial nature of chronic pelvic pain. Overall management involves analgesia, hormonal therapies, physiotherapy, psychological approaches and lifestyle advice, which like other chronic pain conditions relies on a multidisciplinary team approach delivered by professionals experienced and trained in managing chronic pelvic pain.

### Evaluation of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) on the management of female chronic pelvic pain (CPP) using the AGREE II instrument [^e0363b5e]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a debilitating condition, affecting 15% of women worldwide. It is associated with significant socio-economic burden and long-term morbidity. CPP is defined as pain lasting > 6 months or recurrent episodes of abdominal/pelvic pain, hypersensitivity or discomfort often accompanied by elimination changes and sexual dysfunction. CPP remains a challenging disorder to treat because of the complexities of pain sensation and unclear aetiology. Standard medical and surgical treatments seldom prove effective at improving quality of life and pain intensity among affected women. Furthermore, the variation in outcome reporting of trials evaluating interventions has prevented the synthesis of data to identify effective treatments and draw clinically relevant conclusions in the context of guideline formation.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) are systematically developed statements using best available research evidence. They aim to improve the delivery and quality of patient care and health outcomes. Adoption of CPG attempts to eliminate variation, standardize medical care and implement effective treatments. Guidelines are developed using standardized methods and processes including: engaging stakeholder groups, identifying, quality assessment and synthesis of research evidence as well using consensus methods to derive robust guideline recommendations. The methodological quality of guidelines has been inconsistent.

Guidelines based on poor evidence or those that fail to reflect the needs of women may contribute to the delivery of suboptimal, ineffective or even harmful interventions thereby compromising the quality of care. To date, there has been no evaluation of the methodological quality of national or international guidelines on female CPP. In this systematic review, we aimed to evaluate the methodological quality of CPP guidelines, produce a comprehensive inventory of recommendations and explore the relationships between recommendations and evidence.

### FIGO-IPPS consensus statement: addressing the global unmet needs of women with chronic pelvic pain [^3e56e504]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP), a debilitating condition affecting an estimated 25% of women worldwide, represents a significant yet understudied global health crisis. Existing research is limited and likely fails to capture the true impact of CPP on global health. What is known is that CPP results in a profound health, societal, and economic burden on women. Our inability to fully understand this burden is a critical gap in women's healthcare. To address this urgent need, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and the International Pelvic Pain Society (IPPS) have partnered to develop this consensus statement where we examine the key challenges to accessing CPP care and propose a framework for overcoming these barriers. We emphasize that effective global strategies for addressing the negative health consequences of living with CPP must prioritize the lived experiences of patients, empower healthcare professionals with the necessary tools and training, and drive meaningful policy change. This call to action is grounded in a comprehensive vision of women's health and rights to address the full spectrum of conditions women experience throughout their lives. Given its high prevalence, CPP must be a central focus of this expanded vision.

Purpose Of Review

The diagnosis and treatment of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) have moved away from targeting a specific organ to multifactorial and multidisciplinary individualized approach to treatment strategies. The purpose of this article is to review the current advancements in diagnosis and treatment of CPP.

Recent Findings

Recognition that response to current treatment approach to CPP syndrome is variable; organizations such as the European Association of Urology, American Urologic Association, International Continence Society, International Association for the Study of Pain, and others have integrated the most current evidence and management strategies from multiple specialties (urology, gynecology, pain medicine, gastroenterology, colorectal surgery, neurology, physiotherapy, and psychology). The 1 World Congress on Pelvic Pain met in 2013 to further collaborate on diagnosis and management of CPP. A multimodal clinical phenotype system has also been implemented to help understand cause and guide therapy.

Summary

New classification systems allow for overlap of mechanisms between conditions and a multidisciplinary treatment approach.

### Approach to diagnosis and management of chronic pelvic pain in women: incorporating chronic overlapping pain conditions in assessment and management [^2c81a80c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is multifactorial in etiology and heterogeneous in presentation. Identification of all pain contributors is essential for successful management. Chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs) are a specified group of chronic pain conditions that commonly co-occur in patients. We briefly review individual COPCs and highlight risk factors and mechanisms that appear to be applicable across COPCs. We review evaluation and communication strategies that may help establish a productive therapeutic relationship between clinicians and patients. Management should include treatment of peripheral pain generators as well as co-occurring psychological conditions and central sensitization when present.

### Surgical interventions for the management of chronic pelvic pain in women [^890874d0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common gynaecological condition accounting for 20% of all gynaecological referrals. There are wide ranges of causes with overlapping symptomatology, therefore the management of the condition is a formidable challenge for clinicians. The aetiology of CPP is heterogeneous and in many cases, no clear diagnosis can be reached. It is in this scenario that the label of chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) can be applied. We defined women with CPPS as having a minimum duration of pain of at least 6 months, including with a diagnosis of pelvic congestion syndrome, but excluding pain caused by a condition such as endometriosis. Many surgical interventions have been tried in isolation or in conjunction with non-surgical interventions in the management with variable results. Surgical interventions are invasive and carry operative risks. Surgical interventions must be evaluated for their effectiveness prior to their prevalent use in the management of women with CPPS.

Objectives

To review the effectiveness and safety of surgical interventions in the management of women with CPPS.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGF) Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO, on 23 April 2021 for any randomised controlled trials (RCT) for surgical interventions in women with CPPS. We also searched the citation lists of relevant publications, two trial registries, relevant journals, abstracts, conference proceedings and several key grey literature sources.

Selection Criteria

RCTs with women who had CPPS. The review authors were prepared to consider studies of any surgical intervention used for the management of CPPS. Outcome measures were pain rating scales, adverse events, psychological outcomes, quality of life (QoL) measures and requirement for analgesia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently evaluated studies for inclusion and extracted data using the forms designed according to Cochrane guidelines. For each included trial, we collected information regarding the method of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, data reporting and analyses. We reported pooled results as mean difference (MDs) or odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) by the Mantel-Haenszel method. If similar outcomes were reported on different scales, we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD). We applied GRADE criteria to judge the overall certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

Four studies met our inclusion criteria involving 216 women with CPP and no identifiable cause. Adhesiolysis compared to no surgery or diagnostic laparoscopy We are uncertain of the effect of adhesiolysis on pelvic pain scores postoperatively at three months (MD -7.3, 95% CI -29.9 to 15.3; 1 study, 43 participants; low-certainty evidence), six months (MD -14.3, 95% CI -35.9 to 7.3; 1 study, 43 participants; low-certainty evidence) and 12 months postsurgery (MD 0.00, 95% CI -4.60; 1 study, 43 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adhesiolysis may improve both the emotional wellbeing (MD 24.90, 95% CI 7.92 to 41.88; 1 study, 43 participants; low-certainty evidence) and social support (MD 23.90, 95% CI -1.77 to 49.57; 1 study, 43 participants; low-certainty evidence) components of the Endometriosis Health Profile-30, and both the emotional component (MD 32.30, 95% CI 13.16 to 51.44; 1 study, 43 participants; low-certainty evidence) and the physical component of the 12-item Short Form (MD 22.90, 95% CI 10.97 to 34.83; 1 study, 43 participants; low-certainty evidence) when compared to diagnostic laparoscopy. We are uncertain of the safety of adhesiolysis compared to comparator groups due to low-certainty evidence and lack of structured adverse event reporting. No studies reported on psychological outcomes or requirements for analgesia. Laparoscopic uterosacral ligament ablation or resection compared to diagnostic laparoscopy/other treatment We are uncertain of the effect of laparoscopic uterosacral ligament/nerve ablation (LUNA) or resection compared to other treatments postoperatively at three months (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.40 to 3.93; 1 study, 51 participants; low-certainty evidence) and six months (MD -2.10, 95% CI -4.38 to 0.18; 1 study, 74 participants; very low-certainty evidence). At 12 months post-surgery, we are uncertain of the effect of LUNA on the rate of successful treatment compared to diagnostic laparoscopy. One study of 56 participants found no difference in the effect of LUNA on non-cyclical pain (P = 0.854) or dyspareunia (P = 0.41); however, there was a difference favouring LUNA on dysmenorrhea (P = 0.045) and dyschezia (P = 0.05). We are also uncertain of the effect of LUNA compared to vaginal uterosacral ligament resection on pelvic pain at 12 months (MD 2.00, 95% CI 0.47 to 3.53; 1 study, 74 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the safety of LUNA or resection compared to comparator groups due to the lack of structured adverse event reporting. Women undergoing LUNA may require more analgesia postoperatively than those undergoing other treatments (P < 0.001; 1 study, 74 participants). No studies reported psychological outcomes or QoL.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain about the benefit of adhesiolysis or LUNA in management of pain in women with CPPS based on the current literature. There may be a QoL benefit to adhesiolysis in improving both emotional wellbeing and social support, as measured by the validated QoL tools. It was not possible to synthesis evidence on adverse events as these were only reported narratively in some studies, in which none were observed. With the inadequate objective assessment of adverse events, especially long-term adverse events, associated with adhesiolysis or LUNA for CPPS, there is currently little to support these interventions for CPPS.

### Non-surgical interventions for the management of chronic pelvic pain [^1f8dcb57]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pelvic pain is a common and debilitating condition; its aetiology is multifactorial, involving social, psychological and biological factors. The management of chronic pelvic pain is challenging, as despite interventions involving surgery, many women remain in pain without a firm gynaecological diagnosis.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of non-surgical interventions for women with chronic pelvic pain.

Search Methods

We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register. We also searched (from inception to 5 February 2014) AMED, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS. We handsearched sources such as citation lists, trial registers and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on non-surgical management of chronic pelvic pain were eligible for inclusion. We included studies of women with a diagnosis of pelvic congestion syndrome or adhesions but excluded those with pain known to be caused by endometriosis, primary dysmenorrhoea (period pain), active chronic pelvic inflammatory disease or irritable bowel syndrome. We considered studies of any non-surgical intervention, including lifestyle, physical, medical and psychological treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection, quality assessment and data extraction were performed independently by two review authors. Meta-analysis was performed using the Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcome measure was pain relief, and secondary outcome measures were psychological outcomes, quality of life, requirement for analgesia and adverse effects. The quality of the evidence was assessed by using GRADE methods.

Main Results

Twenty-one RCTs were identified that involved non-surgical management of chronic pelvic pain: 13 trials were included in the review, and eight were excluded. The studies included a total of 750 women-406 women in the intervention groups and 344 in the control groups. Included studies had high attrition rates, and investigators often did not blind adequately or did not clearly describe randomisation procedures. Medical treatment versus placebo Progestogen (medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)) was more effective than placebo at the end of treatment in terms of the number of women achieving a greater than 50% reduction in visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score immediately after treatment (Peto OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.70 to 5.31, two studies, n = 204, I(2) = 22%, moderate-quality evidence). Evidence of benefit was maintained up to nine months after treatment (Peto OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.71, two studies, n = 204, I(2) = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). Women treated with progestogen reported more adverse effects (e.g. weight gain, bloatedness) than those given placebo (high-quality evidence). The estimated effect of lofexidine on pain outcomes when compared with placebo was compatible with benefit and harm (Peto OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.61, one study, 39 women, low-quality evidence). Women in the lofexidine group reported more adverse effects (including drowsiness and dry mouth) than women given placebo (moderate-quality evidence). Head-to-head comparisons of medical treatments Head-to-head comparisons showed that women taking goserelin had greater improvement in pelvic pain score (MD 3, 95% CI 2.08 to 3.92, one study, n = 47, moderate-quality evidence) at one year than those taking progestogen. Women taking gabapentin had a lower VAS pain score than those taking amytriptyline (MD -1.50, 95% CI -2.06 to -0.94, n = 40, low-quality evidence). Study authors reported that no statistically significant difference was observed in the rate of adverse effects among women taking gabapentin compared with women given amytriptyline. The study comparing goserelin versus progestogen did not report on adverse effects. Psychological treatment Women who underwent reassurance ultrasound scans and received counselling were more likely to report improved pain than those treated with a standard 'wait and see' policy (Peto OR 6.77, 95% CI 2.83 to 16.19, n = 90, low-quality evidence). Significantly more women who had writing therapy as a disclosure reported improvement in pain than those in the non-disclosure group (Peto OR 4.47, 95% CI 1.41 to 14.13, n = 48, very low-quality evidence). No difference between groups in pain outcomes was noted when other psychological therapies were compared with standard care or placebo (quality of evidence ranged from very low to low). Studies did not report on adverse effects. Complementary therapy Distension of painful pelvic structures was more effective for pain when compared with counselling (MD 35.8, 95% CI 23.08 to 48.52 on a zero to 100 scale, one study, n = 48, moderate-quality evidence). No difference in pain levels was observed when magnetic therapy was compared with use of a control magnet (very low-quality evidence). Studies did not report on adverse effects. The results of studies examining psychological and complementary therapies could not be combined to yield meaningful results.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence of moderate quality supports progestogen as an option for chronic pelvic pain, with efficacy reported during treatment. In practice, this option may be most acceptable among women unconcerned about progestogenic adverse effects (e.g. weight gain, bloatedness-the most common adverse effects). Although some evidence suggests possible benefit of goserelin when compared with progestogen, gabapentin as compared with amytriptyline, ultrasound versus 'wait and see' and writing therapy versus non-disclosure, the quality of evidence is generally low, and evidence is drawn from single studies. Given the prevalence and healthcare costs associated with chronic pelvic pain in women, RCTs of other medical, lifestyle and psychological interventions are urgently required.

### The 2013 EAU guidelines on chronic pelvic pain: is management of chronic pelvic pain a habit, a philosophy, or a science? 10 years of development [^98d63248]. European Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Progress in the science of pain has led pain specialists to move away from an organ-centred understanding of pain located in the pelvis to an understanding based on the mechanism of pain and integrating, as far as possible, psychological, social, and sexual dimensions of the problem. This change is reflected in all areas, from taxonomy through treatment. However, deciding what is adequate investigation to rule out treatable disease before moving to this way of engaging with the patient experiencing pain is a complex process, informed by pain expertise as much as by organ-based medical knowledge.

Objective

To summarise the evolving changes in the management of patients with chronic pelvic pain by referring to the 2012 version of the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on chronic pelvic pain.

Evidence Acquisition

The working panel highlights some of the most important aspects of the management of patients with chronic pelvic pain emerging in recent years in the context of the EAU guidelines on chronic pelvic pain. The guidelines were completely updated in 2012 based on a systematic review of the literature from online databases from 1995 to 2011. According to this review, levels of evidence and grades of recommendation were added to the text. A full version of the guidelines is available at the EAU office or Web site (www.uroweb.org).

Evidence Synthesis

The previously mentioned issues are explored in this paper, which refers throughout to dilemmas for the physician and treatment team as well as to the need to inform and engage the patient in a collaborative empirical approach to pain relief and rehabilitation. These issues are exemplified in two case histories.

Conclusions

Chronic pelvic pain persisting after appropriate treatment requires a different approach focussing on pain. This approach integrates the medical, psychosocial, and sexual elements of care to engage the patient in a collaborative journey towards self-management.

### Chronic pelvic pain in women: evaluation and treatment [^17d3a719]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain affects up to 26% of individuals with female anatomy and is defined as at least 6 months of pain that is perceived to originate in the pelvis. Chronic pelvic pain is highly correlated with psychosocial comorbidities, including depression, anxiety, and history of abuse. Although common causes include irritable bowel syndrome, bladder pain syndrome (interstitial cystitis), pelvic floor dysfunction, and endometriosis, chronic pelvic pain is most often the result of multiple coexisting pain conditions and central nervous system hypersensitivity. Evaluation requires a biopsychosocial approach, beginning with a complete history and physical examination to ensure an accurate and timely diagnosis. Diagnostic laboratory and imaging tests are of limited utility and should be tailored to investigate presenting symptoms and examination findings. When a single etiology is identified, treatment should follow disease-specific guidelines; otherwise, the management of undifferentiated chronic pelvic pain should follow an interdisciplinary approach to improve function and quality of life. Multimodal treatment includes pain education, self-care, behavioral therapy, physical therapy, and pharmacotherapy, with limited indications for surgical interventions. Regular follow-up to review progress is necessary. Clinicians should have a low threshold for referral to interdisciplinary pain management or other subspecialties when improvement is not seen.

### Chronic pelvic pain: defining the scope of the problem [^0cc5d6dc]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To define the scope of the problems associated with chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and optimize management.

Method

Clinical trial results and healthcare utilization data from the literature were reviewed.

Results

Recent evidence suggests that a large percentage of women experience CPP. While no etiology tends to be found in the majority of these women, the annual cost for diagnosing and treating CPP seems considerable. The management of patients with negative laparoscopies constitutes a clinical challenge. While surgical and medical therapy have a role in CPP, there appears to be no 100% effective cure.

Conclusions

There is no consensus on management of patients with no visible pathology and chronic pelvic pain. Physicians should select a treatment for CPP that will be the least complicated and least risky and will deliver speedy symptomatic relief.

1 THE MULTIFACED PROBLEM OF CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN BEGINS WITH THE DEFINITION

Despite widespread recognition of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) as a significant clinical problem, inconsistencies in its definition across leading organizations — including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), WHO, and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (RCOG) — create substantial challenges for clinical practice, research, and education. ACOG defines CPP based on anatomical origin (pelvic organs/structures) and duration (greater than 6 months), highlighting associated negative consequences and related symptoms. Conversely, IASP prioritizes the patient's pain experience, defining CPP with a shorter duration (3 months) and emphasizing specific pain syndromes.WHO's ICD‐11 classification distinguishes between chronic primary pain (the condition itself) and chronic secondary pain (a symptom of an underlying condition). The RCOG definition further complicates matters by characterizing CPP primarily as a symptom.

These disparate approaches — with ACOG's broad definition contrasting with IASP and WHO's subtype categorizations, and the RCOG's focus on CPP as a symptom — hinder comparisons of research findings, the development of standardized treatment protocols, and accurate assessments of CPP's prevalence and burden. This inconsistent overlap across definitions also complicates the training of healthcare professionals. Moreover, the frequent co‐occurrence of CPP with other conditions complicates diagnosis and often delays appropriate treatment. This heterogeneity is also reflected in the breadth and variation in the definitions for CPP. This diagnostic ambiguity creates significant challenges for researchers seeking to establish relevant outcome measures, determine accurate prevalence rates, and develop effective treatment strategies. Ultimately, the multifactorial nature of CPP, exacerbated by these definitional inconsistencies, negatively impacts the well‐being of affected individuals and impedes progress in understanding and managing this complex condition.

8 A CALL TO ACTION ON CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN

CPP inflicts significant suffering and economic burden upon millions of women worldwide, yet it remains a neglected area of health research and policy. This disparity between impact and resource allocation is unacceptable. This consensus statement calls for urgent action to prioritize CPP by promoting the following key actions:
Establishing a consensus definition of chronic pelvic pain: the first step must be to obtain a consensus on the definition of CPP, agreed upon by multiple societies and advocacy groups. A clear definition paves the way for the development of a classification system, akin to PALM‐COEINfor abnormal uterine bleeding, which will enable clinicians to accurately diagnose CPP and enhance trainee and health professional education. An established definition will also assist researchers to precisely identify study populations, promote standardized data collection, and aid with the interpretation of results across studies, including systematic reviews and meta‐analyses. A clear definition empowers patients by giving them a name for their condition, validating their experience, and facilitating communication with healthcare professionals. Finally, a consensus definition provides policymakers with a focus for understanding the scope of the problem and allocating resources appropriately.
Empower women and reduce stigma: women with CPP play a vital role in changing the landscape of care for this condition. Their lived experiences are invaluable in identifying gaps in care, developing more effective and compassionate treatment approaches, and driving improvements in access to care. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and International Pelvic Pain Society (IPPS) call on affiliated societies to partner with women with CPP and patient advocacy groups to develop and implement strategies that not only remove stigma and create a supportive environment where women feel empowered to seek help, but also actively engage them in promoting education and advancing research on this condition. Their participation in studies, sharing of experiences, and input on research priorities are vital for enhancing our understanding of CPP mechanisms, developing innovative diagnostic tools, discovering more effective treatments, and developing policies that improve care. This type of collaboration with patients can be fostered through research, awareness campaigns, educational initiatives, and open dialogue.
Expand access to quality transdisciplinary care: increasing access to transdisciplinary care for women with CPP requires a multifaceted approach. First, improving physician education is essential, ensuring that healthcare professionals across various specialties (e.g. gynecology, primary care, physical therapy, mental health) are well‐versed in the complexities of CPP and the benefits of collaborative care. Simultaneously, developing practical tools and resources, such as standardized assessment protocols, referral pathways, and patient education materials, can facilitate coordinated care delivery. Disseminating evidence‐based clinical guidelines will ensure consistent, high‐quality care across different healthcare settings. Integrating CPP care into primary care settings will enable early diagnosis, timely referral to specialized services, and improved care coordination. Importantly, these resources must be adaptable to countries with varied cultures and socioeconomic means. It is imperative that healthcare professionals and models of care shift away from treating CPP as an acute condition to a chronic care model that prioritizes long‐term management, physical and emotional rehabilitation, and mental well‐being. Policies should encourage the establishment of transdisciplinary pain clinics or networks, where specialists can work together, to provide comprehensive and integrated care. Finally, an evidence‐based biopsychosocial and trauma‐informed approach must be incorporated into all aspects of evaluation and management. This approach recognizes that women with CPP come from diverse backgrounds and varying socioeconomic statuses, and may have experienced traumatic events such as war, poverty, or abuse, all of which can significantly influence their pain experience and response to treatment. By acknowledging these factors and shifting the focus from "curing" an acute problem to managing a long‐term health condition, healthcare providers can promote well‐being and create a safe and supportive environment, foster trust, and facilitate more effective, patient‐centered care.
Enhance education and awareness: CPP is often misunderstood, with many women suffering in silence. To address this, public awareness campaigns are needed to educate women, their families, and communities about CPP symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options. These campaigns must challenge the harmful notion that pelvic pain is an acceptable or normal part of being a woman. By reducing stigma and encouraging help‐seeking behavior, we can empower women to take control of their health and seek timely care. Simultaneously, healthcare providers need comprehensive education and training to effectively diagnose and manage CPP. This includes promoting a transdisciplinary approach, utilizing the biopsychosocial model, and ensuring cultural sensitivity in all patient interactions. Providing women with culturally relevant educational resources will further empower them to actively participate in their care and navigate the healthcare system with confidence.
Prioritizing research and funding: there are multifactorial causes for CPP and all of them are under‐studied. FIGO and IPPS emphasize the urgent need to recognize the underestimated impact of CPP. This underestimation leads to inadequate funding, limited recognition within healthcare systems, and ultimately, suboptimal care for millions of women. To address this, a rigorous assessment of CPP's full economic burden, including the often‐overlooked costs of unpaid work and lost productivity, is crucial. This comprehensive understanding will inform resource allocation and prioritize effective interventions. Furthermore, research efforts must explore the knowledge gaps, stigma, and barriers to care that perpetuate the cycle of neglect. Increased investment in transdisciplinary CPP research is essential. This research should prioritize innovative diagnostic tools, non‐surgical interventions that are more easily accessible, tailoring treatments to individual needs, and therapies that improve all aspects of physical, mental, and emotional health. Including CPP in global health agendas and research funding priorities is not only a matter of justice for women but is also essential for the well‐being and economic prosperity of societies worldwide.
Developing dedicated CPP sections within healthcare societies: all relevant healthcare societies, including those representing gynecology, urology, gastroenterology, primary care, pain management, physical therapy, and behavioral and mental health, are strongly encouraged to develop dedicated sections, committees, or working groups specifically focused on CPP.
FIGO and IPPS are committed to universal gynecologic health coverage and work as hard on creating preventive care strategies as they do on access to the best medical, surgical, and emergency gynecologic care.

American Urological Association (AUA) chronic pelvic pain in men — evidence grading framework links statement types to certainty and benefit–risk balance. Strong Recommendation (Net benefit or harm substantial) under Evidence Strength A states "Net benefit (or net harm) is substantial" and applies broadly with "future research is unlikely to change confidence"; under B the same magnitude is retained but "better evidence could change confidence"; under C, "Net benefit (or net harm) appears substantial" with application to most patients but "better evidence is likely to change confidence (rarely used to support a Strong Recommendation)". Moderate Recommendation (Net benefit or harm moderate) follows the same pattern with "Net benefit (or net harm) is moderate" for A and B and "Net benefit (or net harm) appears moderate" for C, each applying to most patients with future research respectively "unlikely", "could", or "likely" to change confidence. Conditional Recommendation (Net benefit or harm comparable to other options) under A reflects "Benefits = Risks/Burdens", where the "Best action depends on individual patient circumstances" and "Future research is unlikely to change confidence"; under B, "Best action appears to depend on individual patient circumstances" and "Better evidence could change confidence"; under C the "Balance between Benefits & Risks/Burdens unclear", with "Alternative strategies may be equally reasonable" and "Better evidence likely to change confidence".

### Chronic pelvic pain: ACOG practice bulletin summary, number 218 [^9839713d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain is a common, burdensome, and costly condition that disproportionately affects women. Diagnosis and initial management of chronic pelvic pain in women are within the scope of practice of specialists in obstetrics and gynecology. The challenging complexity of chronic pelvic pain care can be addressed by increased visit time using appropriate coding modifiers, as well as identification of multidisciplinary team members within the practice or by facilitated referral. This Practice Bulletin addresses the diagnosis and management of chronic pelvic pain that is not completely explained by identifiable pathology of the gynecologic, urologic, or gastrointestinal organ systems. When evidence on chronic pelvic pain treatment is limited, recommendations are extrapolated from treatment of other chronic pain conditions to help guide management. The evaluation and management of potential gynecologic etiologies of pelvic pain (ie, endometriosis, adenomyosis, leiomyomas, adnexal pathology, vulvar disorders) are discussed in other publications of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (1–4).

### Cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pelvic pain: what is It and does It work? [^4ee67f86]. The Journal of Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS), which encompasses interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome in women and men and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men, is a common, often disabling urological disorder that is neither well understood nor satisfactorily treated with medical treatments. The past 25 years have seen the development and validation of a number of behavioral pain treatments, of which cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is arguably the most effective. CBT combines strategies of behavior therapy, which teaches patients more effective ways of behaving, and cognitive therapy, which focuses on correcting faulty thinking patterns. As a skills-based treatment, CBT emphasizes "unlearning" maladaptive behaviors and thoughts, and replacing them with more adaptive ones that support symptom self-management.

Materials and Methods

This review describes the rationale, technical procedures, and empirical basis of CBT.

Results

While evidence supports CBT for treatment-refractory chronic pain disorders, there is limited understanding of why or how CBT might work, for whom it is most beneficial, or the specific UCPPS symptoms (eg, pain, urinary symptoms) it effectively targets. This is the focus of EPPIC (Easing Pelvic Pain Interventions Clinical Research Program), a landmark NIH trial examining the efficacy of low-intensity, home-based CBT for UCPPS relative to a nonspecific comparator featuring self-care recommendations of AUA guidelines.

Conclusions

Systematic efforts to increase both the efficiency of CBT and the way it is delivered (eg, home-based treatments) are critical to scaling up CBT, optimizing its therapeutic potential, and reducing the public health burden of UCPPS.

Guideline characteristics

Guidelines were published between 2002 and 2020. They specifically reported on the management including treatment of CPP. The number or type of stakeholders involved in the development of guidelines was not reported by two guidelines (ISPOG and RCOG). In four guidelines (ACOG, ASRM, EAU and SOGC), stakeholders included various health professionals (gynaecologists, urologists, neurologist, gastroenterologist, pain medicine, psychologist and sexologist) and methodological experts in clinical guideline development. The number of stakeholders in these guidelines ranged from 12 to 52. No guideline reported the involvement of women with CPP during the development process or reported their experiences of the recommended interventions. All guidelines developed recommendations applicable to high-income settings. One guideline (ASRM) described consensus development methods including the modified Delphi method. No guidelines provided a detailed search strategy used to identify supporting evidence for recommendations. Four guidelines (ACOG EAU, RCOG and SOGC) described methods to quality assess research evidence (Table 1).

### Evaluation of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) on the management of female chronic pelvic pain (CPP) using the AGREE II instrument [^ebb63786]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was designed and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. It was performed by a working group of CHORUS, an International Collaboration for Harmonizing Outcomes in Research and Standards in Urogynaecology and Women's Health. This study is part of a wider project for establishing core outcome sets (COS) in CPP. We followed a methodological approach implemented successfully by previous studies by CHORUS working groups appraising the quality of clinical guidelines in various areas of gynaecology.

Search strategy

A comprehensive literature search was undertaken using the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Searches were performed from database inception to August 2020 using the following MESH terms: "chronic pelvic pain", pelvic pain", "idiopathic chronic pelvic pain", "guidance", "guideline" and "recommendation". Reference lists of included guidelines were hand-searched. We subsequently searched websites of specialist societies and professional organizations including gastroenterology, gynaecology, pain medicine and urology to identify additional guidelines. (A list of these can be found in Appendix 3.)

Selection of guidelines

We included guidelines reporting on the diagnosis and management of CPP in women. Two researchers (VG, VS) reviewed the full text of retrieved guidelines independently to assess eligibility. Guidelines in languages other than English, specific to a particular condition (i.e. endometriosis, bladder pain syndrome), local/regional guidelines or if an updated guideline was available by the same organization were excluded. We excluded editorials, reviews, position statements, consensus statements, expert opinions, practice standards, practice alerts/bulletins and primary studies as these documents do not meet the criteria of assessment or purpose of the AGREE II tool. Discrepancies regarding suitability for inclusion were resolved by discussion with a senior author (SKD) and a consensus reached. A PRISMA flow chart is included to demonstrate the search and guideline inclusion process (Appendix 2).

Management approach — reassessment and discontinuation of ineffective therapies: Clinicians should periodically reassess efficacy of treatment and discontinue ineffective treatments, and the clinical diagnosis should be reconsidered if no improvement occurs after multiple treatment approaches (Clinical Principle). No single treatment has demonstrated consistent, reliable efficacy for all chronic pelvic pain patients, and patients should be instructed to return to their physician if treatment is or becomes ineffective; validated questionnaires may be used to assess symptoms, bother, and QOL after treatment. If a clinically meaningful trial of a therapy has been conducted without efficacy, then the therapy should be discontinued and other therapeutic alternatives should be considered, and the clinical diagnosis is often informed by response to therapy and should be reconsidered based on improvement (or lack thereof) after treatment approaches.

Diagnostic and therapeutic guideline recommendations are helpful in standardizing and improving the quality of care. However, they are limited and may not be relevant or apply in every clinical field of practice. CPP is a manifestation resulting from various underlying conditions that may evolve and develop into regional pain disorders. The complex aetiology of CPP and scarcity of available evidence may cause clinicians to resort to their own experience or seek expert opinions. A holistic approach is needed as underlying causes, treatment options and concerns of women with CPP can vary. Additionally, groups/societies publish guidelines for their members rather than a broader audience. The focus and scope of guidelines may be influenced by the clinical/scientific theme, interests or priorities of publishing societies/professional groups. For example, professional bodies for gynaecologists may focus on endometriosis only in women presenting with CPP. This may have contributed to the variability of recommendations for the management of female CPP observed in this study. The inclusion of a multidisciplinary stakeholder committee will help produce concise and collaborative recommendations that prevent duplicate investigations and the recommendation of ineffective treatments. This study indicated that guidelines performed poorly in the Stakeholder Involvement domain reflecting unilateralism in their approach to CPP including a lack of engagement and participation with their target audience, i.e. women with CPP.

In this review, all guidelines recommended surgical intervention; however, there was no consensus among guidelines. The lack of consistent recommendations presents difficulty when supporting or refuting the effectiveness of surgical procedures, such as adhesiolysis, to manage female CPP. The benefit of bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy during hysterectomy was also unclear with contradictory advice given in two guidelines. There is a place for hysterectomy in the management of CPP particularly due to endometriosis; however, patient selection is paramount. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that bilateral removal of normal ovaries during hysterectomy does not result in improved outcomes but in fact is associated with increased morbidity. Guidelines should not only focus on identifying effective interventions by utilizing the best available evidence but also provide guidance on which patient factors may contribute to the success and failure of such interventions.

5 BARRIERS TO HEALTH‐RELATED CARE

The global health community needs to prioritize a move away from the current fragmented and often inadequate approach to CPP care. Transdisciplinary care using the biopsychosocial model, while recognized as the standard of care, remains inaccessible to most women. Admittedly, applying a biopsychosocial model to care for CPP patients can be complex and many of them experience delayed or inaccurate care due to limited access to specialists who have the proper knowledge to spearhead management strategies. For instance, women with endometriosis, a common subset of the CPP population, have reported delays of 4–11 years from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis. Disparities in access to quality care have been reported across LMICs and HICs, particularly for underserved populations. The resulting lack of recognition and access leaves women powerless and stigmatized, leading to the overuse of surgical interventions with irreversible consequences, such as menopause and infertility.

### Evaluation of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) on the management of female chronic pelvic pain (CPP) using the AGREE II instrument [^e7cb15e0]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Our findings are consistent with other studies that noted the Applicability, Editorial Independence and Stakeholder Involvement domains as areas of improvement for future guideline development.

Our findings suggest that guidelines performed poorly in the Stakeholder Involvement domain. Guidelines failed to engage and involve women with CPP in the development process. Most guidelines were unsuccessful at including individuals from relevant professional groups therefore narrowing their scope to managing CPP. For example, only a single guideline included health professionals from various disciplines such as gastroenterology, neurology, pain medicine, urology and psychology. The inclusion of a multidisciplinary guideline development group will help produce concise and collaborative recommendations. Furthermore, in complex conditions such as CPP which may be due to a single or multiple concurrent causes or indeed idiopathic, input from multiple specialities is required. It is vital that clinical pathways are efficient and coordinated. A diagnostic pathway can often be a frustrating and negative experience for women with CPP hindered by delay. Guideline developers such as the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) have initiatives such as the Patient Public Involvement Programme (PPIP) to support opportunities for patients and the public to be involved in developing guidance. Additionally, guideline developers can contact patient organizations to assist with the recruitment and inclusion of patients on their panels.

The Applicability domain refers to the implementation of guideline recommendations. Various factors can influence the successful implementation of guidelines such as the awareness of recommendations, associated costs and resource implications. Development of guidelines without effective and structured implementation strategies may not lead to the expected changes in clinical practice. Identification of barriers and facilitators in advance and incorporating these into the guideline development process can lead to tailored implementation strategies. These can improve adherence and avoid unnecessary investigations and inadequate interventions.

Maintaining editorial independence is vital to ensure the reliability and validity of recommendations. Influence or interference from funding bodies or conflicts of interest from members of the guideline development group can introduce bias and undermine the credibility of the guideline development process. Conflicts of interest can be mitigated by guideline developers obtaining and presenting full and transparent disclosures.

As opposed to the satisfying solutions found in the management of acute pain, chronic pelvic pain can be a vexing problem for the patient and physician. Seldom is a single source or cause found, and nearly always the condition is influenced by the broader social and psychological context of the patient. In this article, we discuss the evaluation of chronic pelvic pain, often considering pain as the disease itself, and identify peripheral generators, which gynecologists can address to help reduce their contributions to symptoms.

Recommendations for clinical practice

In total, we extracted 228 recommendations across six guidelines. We grouped recommendations into the following categories: diagnosis (96 recommendations), medical treatment (72 recommendations), surgical treatment (29 recommendations), behavioural/physical interventions (18 recommendations), alternative treatments (7 recommendations) and education/research (5 recommendations).

Overall, 39 recommendations (17.11%) were comparable across guidelines including a comprehensive pain history, multifactorial nature of CPP including attributing muscular causes of CPP, an assessment of quality of life and multi-disciplinary approach. There was significant variation in recommendations regarding hormonal treatment, role of surgical interventions (adhesiolysis, hysterectomy, presacral neurectomy and uterosacral nerve ablation) as well the effectiveness of psychological and physical therapies.

Risks of interventions and procedures were reported in five guidelines (ACOG, ASRM, EAU, SOGC and RCOG). The rationale of clinical decision making was discussed in all guidelines

Chronic pelvic pain — ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 218 summary of recommendations: The routine use of laparoscopic adhesiolysis is not recommended for the management of chronic pelvic pain (Level A). For Level B, referral for pelvic floor physical therapy, sex therapy, or cognitive behavioral therapy, alone or in combination, is recommended to manage the myofascial and psychosocial causes and consequences of chronic pelvic pain and associated dyspareunia; based upon their effectiveness for other neuropathic pain syndromes, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are recommended for patients with neuropathic chronic pelvic pain; based upon their effectiveness for other neuropathic pain syndromes, gabapentin and pregabalin are recommended for the treatment of neuropathic chronic pelvic pain; opioids are not recommended for the treatment of chronic pelvic pain and patients already on opioids should be slowly weaned; and trigger point injections of saline, anesthetic, steroids, or opioids, in isolation or in combination with other treatment modalities, are recommended to improve pain and functional ability in patients with myofascial chronic pelvic pain. For Level C, a detailed medical history and physical examination, with particular attention to the abdominal and pelvic neuromusculoskeletal examination, are recommended for the evaluation of chronic pelvic pain; evaluation for common nonreproductive conditions that contribute to chronic pelvic pain should include screening for interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulitis, and comorbid mood disorders (depression, anxiety), with additional testing or referral as needed to rule out other causes of urinary, gastrointestinal, or constitutional symptoms in patients with risk factors; referral to pain medicine specialists may be part of the multidisciplinary care of women with chronic pelvic pain, and the timing of consultation or referral to multidisciplinary care should be individualized; and based on evidence of benefit for the treatment of nongynecologic chronic pain, acupuncture and yoga can be considered for the management of chronic pelvic pain of musculoskeletal etiology.

### Consensus statement for the management of chronic pelvic pain and endometriosis: proceedings of an expert-panel consensus process [^2a45ddfd]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop recommendations for the medical and surgical care of women who present with chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and are likely to have endometriosis as the underlying cause.

Design

An expert panel comprised of practicing gynecologists from throughout the United States and experts in consensus guideline development was convened. After completion of a structured literature search and creation of draft algorithms by an executive committee, the expert panel of > 50 practicing gynecologists met for a 2-day consensus conference during which the clinical recommendations and algorithms were reviewed, refined, and then ratified by unanimous or near-unanimous votes.

Patient(S)

Women presenting with CPP who are likely to have endometriosis as the underlying cause.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

None.

Conclusion(S)

Chronic pelvic pain frequently occurs secondary to nongynecologic conditions that must be considered in the evaluation of affected women. For women in whom endometriosis is the suspected cause of the pain, laparoscopic confirmation of the diagnosis is unnecessary, and a trial of medical therapy, including second-line therapies such as danazol, GnRH agonists, and progestins, is justified provided that there are no other indications for surgery such as the presence of a suspicious adnexal mass. When surgery is necessary, laparoscopic approaches seem to offer comparable clinical outcomes to those performed via laparotomy, but with reduced morbidity. The balance of evidence supports the use of adjuvant postoperative medical therapy after conservative surgery for CPP. There is some evidence that adjuvant presacral neurectomy adds benefit for midline pain, but currently, there is inadequate evidence to support the use of uterosacral nerve ablation or uterine suspension. Hysterectomy alone has undocumented value in the surgical management of women with endometriosis-associated CPP.

### Chronic pelvic pain in women: a review [^654e5cc1]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a challenging condition that affects an estimated 26% of the world's female population. Chronic pelvic pain accounts for 40% of laparoscopies and 12% of hysterectomies in the US annually even though the origin of CPP is not gynecologic in 80% of patients. Both patients and clinicians are often frustrated by a perceived lack of treatments. This review summarizes the evaluation and management of CPP using recommendations from consensus guidelines to facilitate clinical evaluation, treatment, improved care, and more positive patient-clinician interactions.

Observations

Chronic pelvic pain conditions often overlap with nonpelvic pain disorders (eg, fibromyalgia, migraines) and nonpain comorbidities (eg, sleep, mood, cognitive impairment) to contribute to pain severity and disability. Musculoskeletal pain and dysfunction are found in 50% to 90% of patients with CPP. Traumatic experiences and distress have important roles in pain modulation. Complete assessment of the biopsychosocial factors that contribute to CPP requires obtaining a thorough history, educating the patient about pain mechanisms, and extending visit times. Training in trauma-informed care and pelvic musculoskeletal examination are essential to reduce patient anxiety associated with the examination and to avoid missing the origin of myofascial pain. Recommended treatments are usually multimodal and require an interdisciplinary team of clinicians. A single-organ pathological examination should be avoided. Patient involvement, shared decision-making, functional goal setting, and a discussion of expectations for long-term care are important parts of the evaluation process.

Conclusions and Relevance

Chronic pelvic pain is like other chronic pain syndromes in that biopsychosocial factors interact to contribute and influence pain. To manage this type of pain, clinicians must consider centrally mediated pain factors as well as pelvic and nonpelvic visceral and somatic structures that can generate or contribute to pain.

### Focus for the future: tackling the 'pelvic pain' problem in gynecologic practice-an interactive session [^f0e3af21]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The clinical management of women with chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and endometriosis involves important issues that exist at the interface between these two conditions.

Methods

To address these issues, an interactive session was convened to discuss an empiric algorithmic protocol for the clinical management of CPP and endometriosis presented during the Takeda-sponsored session as part of the XVI FIGO World Congress of Gynecology and Obstetrics and to monitor the audience response to this approach.

Results

Approximately one-third of the audience responded that they would definitely try this method, approximately 18% were already using it, and approximately 21% would be fairly likely to try it. Thirty percent of the audience was not convinced that the empiric approach is the best management strategy.

Conclusion

The advantages of this management strategy should be carefully considered, and discussed with colleagues who do think it is the reasonable treatment approach in selected cases.

### A meta-synthesis of qualitative literature on female chronic pelvic pain for the development of a core outcome set: a systematic review [^871521ec]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Additionally, we will use women's own narratives, collected by this study, to help describe and label themes/domains using appropriate language. This will ensure that subsequent Delphi surveys are accessible and can easily be understood by key stakeholders participating in the survey such as patients. Insights from this study have facilitated a deeper understanding of which themes/domains matter most to women and why. Determining the scope of the themes/domains is vital to ensure accurate and relevant outcomes are forwarded in the COS development process as well as selection of suitable outcome measures, for example, the inclusion and impact of psychosocial factors to maximize treatment outcomes.

Our findings identified areas of concerns such as interactions with health professionals and medical services and the lack of holistic treatment including the recognition and influence of psychosocial factors. However, the experience of women with CPP is not unique but shared across a number of chronic pain conditions. Previous meta-syntheses exploring chronic pain condition syndromes have also alluded to delays in diagnosis, failure to recognize the individual and wider impact of pain symptoms among health professionals as well as a lack of interventions supporting women and their families. Such feedback allows identification of areas of improvement whilst ensuring patients' views and opinions contributes to service development. The deeper understanding of patient priorities resulting from qualitative research may not have been possible using quantitative research methodology.

In this review, women with CPP described their negative experiences of healthcare services and highlighted the lack of individualized care, a holistic approach and continuity of care. These insights can be utilized to frame the overarching theme of future guidelines and inform a model of care women want and health providers want to provide. Future clinical priorities should focus on developing a multi-disciplinary and patient-centred approach. At present, psychological and behavioural therapies are neglected despite the overwhelming evidence supporting their use in reducing pain intensity. The recognition and correction of pain behaviours and concomitant mood disorders are necessary to optimize potential benefits derived from conventional medical/surgical treatments. Targeted psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy have proven effective at reducing pain catastrophization. Additionally, the persistent and pervasive nature of chronic pain requires patients to make adjustments to learn to live with their disease by implementing effective coping strategies. Inclusion of behavioural interventions that promote protective psychological factors and coping mechanisms should be considered in multifaceted treatment programmes. Active pain coping (APC) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) are beneficial in cultivating traits such as resilience and self-efficacy.

### The role of interventional pain management strategies for neuropathic pelvic pain in endometriosis [^9f9d905d]. Pain Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Endometriosis is a chronic common condition affecting 10% of reproductive-aged women globally. It is caused by the growth of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterine cavity and leads to chronic pelvic pain, affecting various aspects of a woman's physical, mental, emotional, and social well-being. This highlights the importance of an understanding of the potential involvement of the nervous system and involved nerves as well as an effective multidisciplinary pain management.

Objectives

Our aim was to assess the current understanding of pain mechanisms in endometriosis and the effectiveness of different interventional pain management strategies.

Study Design

Literature review.

Methods

A search was conducted using multiple databases, including Google Scholar, MEDLINE (Ovid), PubMed, and Embase. We used keywords such as "endometriosis", "pain", pelvic pain, "management", and "anaesthesia" along with Boolean operators and MeSH terms. The search was limited to English language articles published in the last 15 years.

Results

Nerve involvement is a well-established mechanism for pain generation in patients with endometriosis, through direct invasion, irritation, neuroangiogenesis, peripheral and central sensitization, and scar tissue formation. Endometriosis may also affect nerve fibers in the pelvic region, causing chronic pelvic pain, including sciatic neuropathy and compression of other pelvic nerves. Endometriosis can cause sciatica, often misdiagnosed due to atypical symptoms. Interventional pain management techniques such as superior hypogastric plexus block, impar ganglion block, S3 pulsed radiofrequency, myofascial pain trigger point release, peripheral nerve hydrodissection, and neuromodulation have been used to manage persistent and intractable pain with positive patient outcomes and improved quality of life.

Limitations

The complex and diverse clinical presentations of endometriosis make it challenging to compare the effectiveness of different pain management techniques.

Conclusion

Endometriosis is a complex condition causing various forms of pain including nerve involvement, scar tissue formation, and bowel/bladder symptoms. Interventional pain management techniques are effective for managing endometriosis-related pain.

Key Words

Endometriosis, chronic pain, therapeutic interventions, interventional techniques, pain injections, visceral pain, peripheral pain.

### Pain management for postpartum pain: a narrative review [^524c51d7]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This review provides a comprehensive summary of the epidemiological characteristics, underlying mechanisms, clinical types, and management strategies of persistent postpartum pain. Current evidence indicates that postpartum pain is not merely a short-term complication of childbirth but may progress to chronic or persistent pain, exerting long-lasting effects on women's quality of life and psychological well-being. However, despite the increasing number of studies in recent years, both the clinical recognition and intervention rates remain relatively low.

At the mechanistic level, multiple factors — including local tissue injury, neural sensitization, hormonal fluctuations, psychosocial influences, and chronic inflammatory responses — are believed to interact and contribute to the onset and persistence of postpartum pain. This complexity highlights the need for future studies to integrate basic and clinical research data and further elucidate the interplay among these mechanisms.

In terms of management, pharmacological therapy remains the cornerstone. Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are widely recommended as first-line options due to their safety and efficacy, while opioids are reserved for short-term use in moderate-to-severe pain to minimize risks of dependence and adverse effects. Regional nerve blocks and epidural analgesia are also widely employed in cesarean delivery and labor analgesia, providing effective acute pain control and reducing systemic medication use. At the same time, non-pharmacological interventions have gained increasing attention as important adjuncts. Physical therapies — such as thermotherapy, cryotherapy, electrical stimulation, ultrasound, and pelvic floor muscle training — help relieve inflammation and muscle tension while promoting tissue repair and functional recovery. Rehabilitation approaches, including progressive exercise and postural correction, support improvement in muscle dysfunction and enhance physical stability. Psychosocial support, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, postpartum education, and family involvement, has also been shown to reduce pain perception and mitigate the risk of chronicity.

Growing evidence suggests that combining pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions represents a leading approach for individualized pain relief and functional recovery. For instance, routine use of NSAIDs supplemented with early pelvic floor rehabilitation or physical therapy can shorten the duration of pain and improve maternal quality of life. Nevertheless, most existing studies are limited by small sample sizes, short follow-up periods, and the lack of standardized outcome measures, which restrict the generalizability and validation of long-term efficacy. Therefore, future research should prioritize large-scale, multicenter randomized controlled trials to verify the effectiveness and safety of non-pharmacological therapies and combined pharmacological–non-pharmacological approaches. Additionally, efforts should focus on identifying optimal drug dosages, refining regional anesthesia techniques, and optimizing rehabilitation modalities, thereby advancing the development of systematic and precise multimodal management strategies.

### Evaluation of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) on the management of female chronic pelvic pain (CPP) using the AGREE II instrument [^27d84a63]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Behavioural/physical interventions

Eighteen recommendations described behavioural interventions. No recommendations were comparable across guidelines. The highest grade (i.e. level of evidence I and grade A) of recommendations supported psychological interventions combined with medical/surgical, biofeedback treatment in pelvic pain and dyssynergic defecation and biofeedback as an adjunct to muscle exercises in overactive pelvic floor muscles (Table S5).

Psychological treatments were recommended by three guidelines (ACOG, EAU and ISPOG). The EAU and ISPOG guidelines recommended integrating psychological interventions with standard medical/surgical treatments for CPP. The EAU guideline specifically referred to the role of psychological treatment in various conditions including PBS, urethral pain syndrome and chronic vulvar pain.

The ACOG guideline recommended cognitive behavioural therapy, pelvic floor physiotherapy or sexual therapy alone or in combination to manage myofascial dysfunction and dyspareunia secondary to CPP. Only one guideline (EAU) recommended training pelvic floor muscles to improve quality of life and sexual function. The EAU guideline advocated using behavioural strategies for patients and their partners with sexual dysfunction secondary to CPP.

Physiotherapy was recommended by a single guideline (EAU) for BPS and pelvic floor overactivity. Pelvic floor muscle treatment was considered a first-line treatment in CPP by the EAU guideline.

Only one guideline (SOGC) reported the use of exercise in the treatment of CPP due to myofascial dysfunction. No further details regarding the type of exercise (aerobic or resistance) were provided (Table S5).

Complementary and alternative treatments

Seven recommendations focused on alternative treatments. No recommendations were comparable across guidelines. The highest grade (i.e. level of evidence I and grade A) of recommendations supported treatment of myofascial trigger points by dry needling or pressure (Table S5). There were conflicting statements regarding dry needling of trigger points (EAU and ISPOG).

One guideline reported limited data supporting the use of alternative therapies to treat CPP including acupuncture, trigger point treatment, reflexology, biofeedback, distension therapy, homoeopathy and Thiele massage (ISPOG). A single guideline (EAU) supported the use of alternative therapies such as TENS to treat CPP. There were no consistent recommendations regarding acupuncture and use was limited to specific clinical scenarios. The EAU guideline did not recommend acupuncture in the treatment of BPS. However, the ACOG guideline supported use of acupuncture in CPP secondary to muscoskeletal aetiology (Table S5).

### Chronic pelvic pain in women [^f947e376]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain in women is defined as persistent, noncyclic pain perceived to be in structures related to the pelvis and lasting more than six months. Often no specific etiology can be identified, and it can be conceptualized as a chronic regional pain syndrome or functional somatic pain syndrome. It is typically associated with other functional somatic pain syndromes (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, nonspecific chronic fatigue syndrome) and mental health disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, depression). Diagnosis is based on findings from the history and physical examination. Pelvic ultrasonography is indicated to rule out anatomic abnormalities. Referral for diagnostic evaluation of endometriosis by laparoscopy is usually indicated in severe cases. Curative treatment is elusive, and evidence-based therapies are limited. Patient engagement in a biopsychosocial approach is recommended, with treatment of any identifiable disease process such as endometriosis, interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, and comorbid depression. Potentially beneficial medications include depot medroxyprogesterone, gabapentin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists with add-back hormone therapy. Pelvic floor physical therapy may be helpful. Behavioral therapy is an integral part of treatment. In select cases, neuromodulation of sacral nerves may be appropriate. Hysterectomy may be considered as a last resort if pain seems to be of uterine origin, although significant improvement occurs in only about one-half of cases. Chronic pelvic pain should be managed with a collaborative, patient-centered approach.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^d1de3602]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain in men — evidence review methods detail data abstraction and risk-of-bias grading. For included studies, a single investigator abstracted study characteristics and results, with a second investigator reviewing for accuracy and discrepancies resolved through discussion and consensus. Two investigators independently assessed risk of bias using predefined criteria, with disagreements resolved by consensus, and studies were rated as "low risk of bias", "medium risk of bias", or "high risk of bias", with "low risk of bias" generally considered valid. "Low risk of bias" randomized trials include clear descriptions of the population, setting, interventions, and comparison groups, valid allocation methods, baseline similarity, low dropout with clear reporting, blinding of patients, care providers and outcome assessors, and appropriate analysis. "Low risk of bias" diagnostic accuracy studies use unbiased patient selection, avoid case-control design, clearly describe the test, apply the same reference standard to all patients, have low rates of missing or uninterpretable data, and ensure blinded interpretation of the reference standard. "Medium risk of bias" studies are susceptible to some bias and do not meet all "low risk of bias" criteria but have no flaw likely to cause major bias. "High risk of bias" studies have significant flaws that may invalidate results, and due to paucity of data in some areas were not excluded a priori but were considered less reliable than "low" or "medium risk of bias" studies. Criteria for assessing risk of bias were adapted from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and from the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) instrument.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^64b71141]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Analgesics — pain management in chronic pelvic pain in men allows that clinicians may prescribe pharmacologic pain management agents (e.g., urinary analgesics, acetaminophen, non-opioid medications) after counseling on risks and benefits. There are no controlled studies of common pharmacologic pain agents for use in CP/CPPS, and currently there is no method to predict which drug is most likely to alleviate pain in a given male chronic pelvic pain patient. The starting dose should always be the smallest available and titration should occur at frequent intervals based on pain scores and side effects, and the goal is not necessarily to eliminate pain but to improve QOL and daily functioning. Regarding acetaminophen, it is considered safe at recommended daily adult doses up to 4 g/day, and doses above the recommended doses may lead to hepatotoxicity.

### Evaluation of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) on the management of female chronic pelvic pain (CPP) using the AGREE II instrument [^729f33bb]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction and hypothesis

Variations in guidelines may result in differences in treatments and potentially poorer health-related outcomes. We aimed to systematically review and evaluate the quality of national and international guidelines and create an inventory of CPG recommendations on CPP.

Methods

We searched EMBASE and MEDLINE databases from inception till August 2020 as well as websites of professional organizations and societies. We selected national and international CPGs reporting on the diagnosis and management of female CPP. We included six CPGs. Five researchers independently assessed the quality of included guidelines using the AGREE II tool and extracted recommendations.

Results

Two hundred thirty-two recommendations were recorded and grouped into six categories: diagnosis, medical treatment, surgical management, behavioural interventions, complementary/alternative therapies and education/research. Thirty-nine (17.11%) recommendations were comparable including: a comprehensive pain history, a multi-disciplinary approach, attributing muscular dysfunction as a cause of CPP and an assessment of quality of life. Two guidelines acknowledged sexual dysfunction associated with CPP and recommended treatment with pelvic floor exercises and behavioural interventions. All guidelines recommended surgical management; however, there was no consensus regarding adhesiolysis, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy during hysterectomy, neurectomy and laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation. Half of recommendations (106, 46.49%) were unreferenced or made in absence of good-quality evidence or supported by expert opinion. Based on the AGREE II assessment, two guidelines were graded as high quality and recommended without modifications (EAU and RCOG). Guidelines performed poorly in the "Applicability", "Editorial Independence" and "Stakeholder Involvement" domains.

Conclusion

Majority of guidelines were of moderate quality with significant variation in recommendations and quality of guideline development.

### Gabapentin for chronic pelvic pain in women (GaPP2): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^2e91756a]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Added value of this study

This study is the first large, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial to report on treatment of chronic pelvic pain with gabapentin. Although it conflicts with the results of the Egyptian trial, the robustness of the study design, including masking to treatment allocation of both participants and investigators, ensured internal validity, enabling the results to be interpreted with confidence. Groups were balanced with respect to dysmenorrhoea, psychological distress, and concomitant use of hormonal contraceptives — all potentially prognostic for reported pain. The design of our trial reflects the real-word choices that women and their gynaecologists make about the management of chronic pelvic pain. We can confidently conclude that gabapentin is not effective for chronic pelvic pain in women.

Implications of all the available evidence

Women with chronic pelvic pain and no obvious pelvic pathology should be advised that gabapentin might not alleviate their pain and could give them unpleasant side-effects. In our opinion, no further research is required to establish the role of gabapentin in the management of chronic pelvic pain in women with no obvious pelvic pathology. Questions that remain unaddressed relate to the use of other pharmacological interventions (monotherapy vs combination therapy), physiotherapy, and cognitive behavioural therapy for treating chronic pelvic pain in women. It is possible that subgroups of women could benefit from gabapentin, but these will need to be carefully characterised and explored.

The urologic chronic pain conditions such as chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome and interstitial cystitis are syndromes whose evaluation and management are controversial. Part of the difficulty in diagnosis and therapy is the heterogeneity of etiologies and symptoms. We propose a six-domain phenotype, which can classify these patients clinically and can direct the selection of therapy in the most evidence based multimodal manner. The domains are urinary, psychosocial, organ specific, infection, neurologic and tenderness of skeletal muscles. This system is flexible and responsive to new biomarkers and therapies as their utility and efficacy are proven.

Women with chronic pelvic pain are frequently referred to gynaecologists as over 50% also have genitourinary or irritable bowel symptoms or both. When no specific pathology is found and the pathophysiology is unclear, the aetiology is probably an interplay of neuropathic, inflammatory and functional factors. The principles of medical and surgical treatment are discussed and should be based on evidence-based medicine.

4 CHALLENGES IN ESTABLISHING‐FOCUSED HEALTH POLICIES

Despite the significant global health, economic, and social impact, CPP suffers from a critical lack of recognition within health policy agendas and research funding priorities. This underinvestment hinders progress, perpetuating a cycle of under‐recognition, underfunding, and limited access, resulting in unnecessary suffering and substantial economic burdens. The consequences are far‐reaching, resulting in unnecessary suffering for millions of women, substantial monetary burdens on individuals, families, and healthcare systems, and a significant impediment to women's overall well‐being and societal participation. This neglect not only reflects a general dismissal of women's health concerns but also highlights societies and policymakers' lack of awareness of the far‐reaching impacts of overlooking CPP.

To ensure that women with CPP receive the necessary care, the cycle of neglect must be broken by explicitly incorporating CPP into both local and global health agendas. This necessitates a commitment to increase and sustain investment in research and improve resource allocation. Data collection and integration into national strategies are essential to this endeavor. Analysis of the prevalence, burden, and economic impact of CPP will inform policy decisions and resource allocation. Therefore, CPP‐specific metrics must be developed for tracking progress in research funding and policy implementation.

### From roots to canopy: understanding chronic pelvic pain through a tree-inspired model [^1d9e9154]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP), defined as persistent, chronic pain in the pelvic region that has lasted beyond 6 months, and is associated with negative cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and sexual consequences, affects millions of women globally and yet continues to be shrouded in silence. It is conservatively estimated that one quarter of women have CPP, with an underrepresentation in low-middle income countries. There are many reasons why it is underdiagnosed and undertreated, ranging from gendered cultural differences that limit women seeking care to a lack of training of health practitioners. A biopsychosocial model of care encompassing an interdisciplinary approach results in the best outcomes. The biopsychosocial model recognizes the interconnection between biophysiological, psychological (such as thoughts, emotions, behaviors, beliefs, etc.), and social contributors in the personal experience of pain. All these factors need to be recognized and addressed for the successful management of chronic pain. However, this interdisciplinary approach is not accessible to everyone, resulting in fragmented or absent care, which only accentuates women's suffering and perpetuates these disparities. This leaves women feeling dismissed, confused, and without hope. Conversely, health care providers often do not know where and whom to turn to for support, and provision of care that is beyond their training and capacity. The complexity and nuances of CPP often deters practitioners from embarking on management and treatment options. However, recognizing that over 80% of women with CPP have a pelvic floor myofascial component makes it imperative that every provider seeing women for urogynecological conditions be able to screen, understand, and possibly manage CPP.

### Evaluation of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) on the management of female chronic pelvic pain (CPP) using the AGREE II instrument [^cce8bb08]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Interpretation

This systematic review reflects variations in guideline recommendations and the poor quality of guideline development. Similar results were found in studies critically appraising the quality of guidelines including BPS, endometriosis, obstetric perineal lacerations and the use of transvaginal mesh implants in prolapse. Challenges of guideline development are not unique to a specific area of medicine but represent a generic issue arising from a lack of standardization. Our findings contribute to the existing body of evidence supporting the need to harmonize national and international guidelines. A coordinated and collaborative approach is required among guideline developers. Guidelines should be developed using transparent and robust methods such as those outlined by the AGREE II tool. This will facilitate the comparability and harmonization of guidelines and their recommendations as differences in guideline development methods can result in varying recommendations. Standardized guideline development will minimize any unwarranted and unjustified variations in clinical practice.

Various terminology has been used by authors and organizations to describe clinical practice recommendations. These have included clinical practice guidelines, consensus statements, position statements, practice alerts and hybrid terms such as consensus guidelines. Such terms can be indicative of the level of evidence and strength of recommendations. However, authors have used these terms interchangeably with a lack of consistency and available evidence. This poses a particular problem and possibly a challenge in harmonization of clinical guidance, as encountered in this study, of identifying "true" clinical practice guidelines that are developed using rigorous methodology. The use of inconsistent terminology may mislead clinicians about the level of confidence to place in recommendations and the process by which they were developed. Further consensus initiatives are needed for transparency and clarity regarding the definitions of these terminologies.

Guidelines support and provide an evidence base to the clinical decisions made in daily practice. However, we observed that almost half of all recommendations were made despite the absence of good quality evidence. The shortage of primary research supporting the management of women with CPP may prohibit the development of useful guidelines. Furthermore, the quality of existing RCTs evaluating CPP interventions is variable with significant variability in outcome selection and reporting. A working group within CHORUS is currently in the progress of establishing core outcome sets (COS) in CPP. Implementation of a COS will promote greater reporting consistency and reduce outcome reporting bias by stipulating a minimum set of criteria to report. It will also facilitate the comparability and synthesis in meta-analysis to produce high-quality results leading to informed healthcare decisions.

### Evaluation of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) on the management of female chronic pelvic pain (CPP) using the AGREE II instrument [^9d7da8f8]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Variations in guidelines may result in differences in treatments and potentially poorer health-related outcomes. We aimed to systematically review and evaluate the quality of national and international guidelines and create an inventory of CPG recommendations on CPP.

Methods

We searched EMBASE and MEDLINE databases from inception till August 2020 as well as websites of professional organizations and societies. We selected national and international CPGs reporting on the diagnosis and management of female CPP. We included six CPGs. Five researchers independently assessed the quality of included guidelines using the AGREE II tool and extracted recommendations.

Results

Two hundred thirty-two recommendations were recorded and grouped into six categories: diagnosis, medical treatment, surgical management, behavioural interventions, complementary/alternative therapies and education/research. Thirty-nine (17.11%) recommendations were comparable including: a comprehensive pain history, a multi-disciplinary approach, attributing muscular dysfunction as a cause of CPP and an assessment of quality of life. Two guidelines acknowledged sexual dysfunction associated with CPP and recommended treatment with pelvic floor exercises and behavioural interventions. All guidelines recommended surgical management; however, there was no consensus regarding adhesiolysis, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy during hysterectomy, neurectomy and laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation. Half of recommendations (106, 46.49%) were unreferenced or made in absence of good-quality evidence or supported by expert opinion. Based on the AGREE II assessment, two guidelines were graded as high quality and recommended without modifications (EAU and RCOG). Guidelines performed poorly in the "Applicability", "Editorial Independence" and "Stakeholder Involvement" domains.

Conclusion

Majority of guidelines were of moderate quality with significant variation in recommendations and quality of guideline development.

### Vulvodynia: a practical guide in treatment strategies [^ec4f497e]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Vulvodynia is a debilitating condition characterized by chronic vulvar pain, with a detrimental impact on the patient's overall quality of life. Its etiology is multifactorial, but still in the process of being clearly outlined. Vulvodynia is not a single entity. It is a heterogeneous condition characterized by multiple triggers, making it challenging to define a reference standard for its treatment. In this manuscript we selected all articles including the following key criteria: "vulvodynia". The primary outcomes observed included the resolution of chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia and sexual satisfaction, psychological well-being, and overall quality of life. Most pharmacologic treatments require further evidence to be recommended. On the other hand, non-pharmacologic approaches such as psychotherapy, physical therapy, and surgery have received stronger support. This review summarizes pros and cons of adopting available treatments. Multimodal approaches should be introduced to improve patient outcomes. Further investigations are warranted to improve patients' quality of life.

6 GAPS IN HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION

Many providers lack a comprehensive understanding of the complex nature of pelvic pain, including its diverse etiologies, overlapping symptoms, and the importance of a biopsychosocial approach to care. This educational gap often leads to misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis, and inappropriate or ineffective treatment. Women's pain is frequently dismissed or minimized, often by frustrated providers, resulting in patient frustration and a sense of being unheard, further compounding their suffering. Inadequate education may also result in inequitable care, fragmented approaches, and, ultimately, poor patient outcomes. Fortunately, deficiencies in training can be addressed by improving training resources and investing in robust, standardized education for healthcare professionals across multiple disciplines, including primary care physicians, gynecologists, urologists, gastroenterologists, physical therapists, and mental health professionals.

### Trajectories of mHealth-tracked mental health and their predictors in female chronic pelvic pain disorders [^adcc5dba]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite its prevalence and burden, female CPPDs are often inadequately managed, with less than half of patients experiencing pain relief from any medical treatment. Patient self-management, which aims to equip the individual with tools to actively manage pain and its effects on physical and emotional function, is a common chronic pain care model intervention, and it has been associated with significant improvement in symptoms. Some examples of patient self-management include relaxation techniques, symptom tracking to identify triggers, mindfulness, and behavioral factors (eg, sleep hygiene). Further, Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines state that non-opioid and non-pharmacologic therapies should be prioritized for chronic pain management. Non-pharmacological self-management strategies, especially those that target mental health outcomes of CPPD patients, are needed for effective personalized treatment of CPPD. Psychosocial interventions can be effective at improving mental health outcomes for those with chronic pain. However, psychosocial support that requires mental health professionals, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or biofeedback, may not be accessible to everyone. Here, we investigate how physical activity (PA) patterns of individuals with CPPDs may affect mental health outcomes and serve as an additional method to improve mental well-being in female CPPDs.

Recommendations for education and research

Five recommendations were relevant to education and research. No recommendations were comparable in this domain. One guideline advised incorporating CPP into the curricula of health professionals (SOGC). Two guidelines outlined future research priorities including the role of gene therapy, effectiveness of surgical management and investigating myofascial and sexual dysfunction in CPP (EAU and SOGC).

Evidence supporting recommendations

Three guidelines (EAU, RCOG and SOGC) reported the grading of evidence used to support recommendations. Each guideline used a different grading scale including the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence (EAU), the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) grading system (RCOG) and the Canadian Task Force on Periodic Health Exam grading (SOGC). Of note, the ACOG guideline evaluated evidence using the US Preventative Services Task Force grading system; however, the level of evidence supporting each recommendation was not reported.

The total number of references cited in guidelines ranged from 22 to 644. The number of Cochrane reviews cited by each guideline ranged from 1 to 20. One guideline did not use any Cochrane reviews to support recommendations. The total number of RCTs used per guideline ranged from 6 to 32. Almost half of the recommendations (106, 46.49%) were unreferenced, made in the absence of good quality evidence or supported by expert opinion.

### EAU guidelines on chronic pelvic pain [^765ef6ca]. European Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

On behalf of the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines for diagnosis, therapy and follow-up of chronic pelvic pain patients were established.

Method

Guidelines were compiled by a working group and based on current literature following a systematic review using MEDLINE. References were weighted by the panel of experts.

Results

The full text of the guidelines is available through the EAU Central Office and the EAU website (www.uroweb.org). This article is a short version of this text and summarises the main conclusions from the guidelines on management of chronic pelvic pain.

Conclusion

A guidelines text is presented including chapters on prostate pain and bladder pain syndromes, urethral pain, scrotal pain, pelvic pain in gynaecological practice, role of the pelvic floor and pudendal nerve, general treatment of chronic pelvic pain and neuromodulation. These guidelines have been drawn up to provide support in the management of the large and difficult group of patients suffering from chronic pelvic pain.

### Diagnosis and management of chronic pelvic pain [^d5732fa7]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain is difficult to diagnose and to treat [81] because of the multiple and often overlapping causes [82]. A systematic approach aids in the thorough evaluation and appropriate therapy. At the initial visit(s), a thorough history should be taken and complete physical examination performed. Screening for co-existing conditions, such as depression, narcotic dependency, and physical, sexual, or emotional abuse is crucial so these issues may be addressed immediately while additional causes for pelvic pain are evaluated. The relative likelihood of gastrointestinal, urologic, musculoskeletal, or gynecologic etiology must be considered to guide a more thorough initial evaluation. With gynecologic chronic pelvic pain, differentiation between hormonally responsive and nonresponsive conditions is helpful for diagnosis and treatment. Therapy can then be instituted or an appropriate referral made.
