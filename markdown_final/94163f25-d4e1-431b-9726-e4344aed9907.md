## Question

How do partial agonists differ from full agonists in their mechanism of action?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how partial agonists differ from full agonists in their mechanism of action. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise pharmacologic definitions and the concept of intrinsic efficacy. Then, I should verify the core mechanistic distinction at the receptor level, including conformational selection and ensemble models. Next, I will examine receptor-class–specific mechanisms for GPCRs, ion channels, and nuclear receptors. After that, I should review clinical examples that illustrate these principles, including opioids, β2-agonists, dopamine D2 partial agonists, and varenicline. Finally, I will synthesize the unifying themes and clinical implications, making sure to double-check any points that might be overgeneralized or context-dependent.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions so I don't misframe the comparison. Full agonists produce the maximal response characteristic of the receptor system at saturating concentrations, whereas partial agonists produce a submaximal response even at full receptor occupancy; this difference is captured by intrinsic efficacy, a measure of the ligand's capacity to elicit a response beyond simple binding affinity, and it is not limited to a ceiling of 1, which is a common misconception I should correct now [^112oK7ju].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism before anchoring in receptor theory. The prevailing framework is conformational selection: receptors exist in an equilibrium of inactive, intermediate, and active states, and ligands bias this ensemble by stabilizing different states to varying extents; full agonists enrich the active state population more than partial agonists, which stabilize mixed ensembles with fewer fully active receptors, thereby yielding lower maximal response despite high occupancy [^114gCVbU].

> I will now examine GPCRs, where structural and biophysical data are most detailed. Wait, let me verify the β-adrenergic receptor evidence: full agonists like isoproterenol stabilize a fully active receptor–G-protein complex, whereas partial agonists like dobutamine or salbutamol stabilize less active or intermediate conformations; NMR and single-molecule FRET show that partial agonists populate active-like states less efficiently, and β1-AR–Gs cryo-EM reveals that partial agonists form less stable nucleotide-free intermediates, slowing GDP release and G-protein activation, which mechanistically explains lower efficacy [^114TKuKR] [^111mz9uL] [^1132Exju].

> But wait, what if the ligand engages additional receptor microdomains that modulate efficacy. Recent work shows that bitopic ligands targeting the orthosteric site and the conserved sodium pocket in class A GPCRs can tune partial agonism and bias signaling; for example, δ-opioid receptor partial agonists designed around sodium-site interactions show reduced seizure liability while maintaining analgesia, illustrating how structural control of conformational ensembles can shape clinical pharmacology [^114eDnAo] [^113KWqEt].

> Next, I should review ligand-gated ion channels, where gating kinetics and pre-open states matter. Let me consider the nicotinic superfamily: partial agonists are limited not by a different open–shut equilibrium but by an earlier "flipping" or "priming" step that occurs while the channel is closed; once flipped, the channel opens and closes similarly regardless of agonist efficacy, which reconciles why partial agonists can show near-normal open durations but lower open probability overall [^11564KVd] [^114nMquR].

> I need to check AMPA-type glutamate receptors as well. Structural and functional trapping studies show that partial agonists stabilize multiple non-conducting conformations of the ligand-binding domain and tetrameric assemblies, indicating that partial agonism reflects both spatial heterogeneity and temporal sampling of unproductive states; this inverse relation between agonist efficacy and conformational promiscuity provides a mechanistic bridge between classical MWC and KNF models without excluding either [^117PMZvT] [^111Ugp6r] [^115bG19s].

> Let me verify NMDA receptor data to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. Kinetic analyses indicate that partial agonists raise energy barriers across the activation pathway, reducing the likelihood of successful gating transitions; this global energetic penalty contrasts with the more localized effects seen in pentameric channels and underscores receptor-class distinctions in partial agonism [^1172nKSV].

> Now, I should review nuclear receptors, where transcriptional outputs hinge on coregulator recruitment. Partial agonists often fail to fully stabilize helix 12 or the AF-2 surface, leading to attenuated coactivator binding and a mixed coactivator–corepressor equilibrium; for example, telmisartan and other partial PPARγ agonists show suboptimal hydrogen bonding networks around helix 12, while FXR partial agonists introduce a kink in helix α11 that destabilizes the α11–α12 loop, blunting coactivator recruitment and producing graded transcriptional responses [^112AFYng] [^111As9Xs] [^112zs479].

> Hold on, I should verify that these mechanistic distinctions translate into clinically meaningful differences. Buprenorphine at the μ-opioid receptor is a partial agonist with high affinity and a ceiling on respiratory depression and euphoria; this ceiling effect, alongside antagonism at κ- and δ-receptors, contributes to a favorable safety profile in pain and addiction care, though I must remember that "partial agonist" does not automatically mean "partial analgesia", and expert consensus cautions against equating in vitro partial agonism with reduced clinical efficacy in pain pathways [^115qtVgG] [^1135o7DT] [^115DL3hg].

> Let me consider β2-adrenoceptor agonists next. In acute severe asthma, full agonists like formoterol provide greater bronchodilation than partial agonists like salmeterol, but partial agonism can be therapeutically useful when desensitization or adverse effect risk is a concern; intrinsic efficacy differences map to distinct clinical roles and safety trade-offs, reinforcing that the choice should be mechanism- and context-driven rather than efficacy-maximizing by default [^1141tKEL] [^114pWWh7].

> I should double-check dopamine D2 partial agonists. Aripiprazole and cariprazine stabilize D2 conformations that yield partial intrinsic activity, functioning as "dopamine system stabilizers" that can act as antagonists in hyperdopaminergic states and agonists in hypodopaminergic states, thereby mitigating extrapyramidal and metabolic adverse effects seen with full antagonists while preserving antipsychotic efficacy [^111CSXVn] [^113f6meJ].

> Next, I should review varenicline as a partial agonist example. Varenicline partially activates α4β2 nicotinic receptors, reducing withdrawal while competitively blocking nicotine's binding, which diminishes reward; this mechanistic blend of partial activation and antagonism underpins its superior cessation efficacy versus nicotine replacement in large randomized trials [^114t3vER].

> Let me synthesize the unifying themes, but I need to ensure I don't overstate uniformity. Across receptor classes, partial agonists differ from full agonists by stabilizing receptor ensembles that include fewer fully active conformations, whether through less efficient TM6 motions in GPCRs, incomplete priming in ion channels, or suboptimal helix 12 positioning in nuclear receptors; clinically, this manifests as lower maximal response, potential ceiling effects on adverse outcomes, and sometimes antagonist-like behavior when competing with full agonists, all of which can be leveraged to tailor therapy to disease biology and safety goals [^114gCVbU] [^114nMquR] [^112zs479].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially implied that partial agonists always show a ceiling effect; that's not universally true and I should correct it. While buprenorphine exhibits a ceiling on respiratory depression and euphoria, not all partial agonists have clinically evident ceilings, and the manifestation of partial agonism is system- and context-dependent, shaped by receptor reserve, tissue-specific signaling, and the presence of endogenous tone or competing ligands [^115qtVgG] [^113RqKBg] [^113mpuPy].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical implications are explicit and practical. Understanding whether a drug is a full or partial agonist informs expectations for maximal efficacy, adverse effect profiles, and drug–drug interactions; for example, naloxone may have limited efficacy reversing partial agonists, and guidelines advise special dosing considerations in mixed agonist–antagonist contexts, while in pain care, rotation from full to partial agonists like buprenorphine can improve safety without sacrificing analgesia in appropriately selected patients [^115SMkit] [^1145BrzQ] [^114MXvtY].

Full agonists produce maximal receptor activation by stabilizing the fully active conformation and driving the receptor's conformational equilibrium toward the active state [^114gCVbU], whereas partial agonists produce submaximal responses by stabilizing intermediate conformations and only partially shifting the equilibrium, resulting in lower **intrinsic efficacy** [^117PMZvT]. This difference arises from distinct **ligand–receptor interactions**: full agonists form optimal contacts that fully engage the receptor's activation machinery, while partial agonists form suboptimal contacts that incompletely activate downstream signaling [^114TKuKR]. Clinically, partial agonists can act as antagonists in the presence of full agonists, and their ceiling effects can improve safety profiles, as seen with **buprenorphine** at the μ-opioid receptor [^115qtVgG] [^112sM1fm].

---

## Molecular mechanisms of full agonism

Full agonists achieve maximal receptor activation through several coordinated molecular events:

- **Conformational stabilization**: Full agonists bind to receptors and stabilize the fully active conformation, shifting the equilibrium toward the active state and enabling maximal downstream signaling [^114gCVbU].

- **Optimal ligand–receptor interactions**: Full agonists form strong, specific interactions with key receptor residues, engaging the receptor's activation machinery and promoting robust signaling [^114TKuKR].

- **Efficient downstream signaling**: Full agonists effectively activate downstream effectors (e.g. G-proteins, ion channels, kinases), producing maximal physiological responses [^111mz9uL].

---

## Molecular mechanisms of partial agonism

Partial agonists produce submaximal responses through distinct molecular mechanisms:

- **Intermediate conformational states**: Partial agonists stabilize intermediate receptor conformations that are distinct from both fully active and inactive states, resulting in partial receptor activation [^117PMZvT].

- **Suboptimal ligand–receptor interactions**: Partial agonists form weaker or less specific interactions with receptor residues, incompletely engaging the receptor's activation machinery and limiting downstream signaling [^114TKuKR].

- **Limited downstream signaling**: Partial agonists activate downstream effectors less efficiently, producing submaximal physiological responses even at high receptor occupancy [^111mz9uL].

---

## Structural differences between full and partial agonists

Structural studies have elucidated key differences between full and partial agonists:

| **Receptor type** | **Full agonist interactions** | **Partial agonist interactions** |
|-|-|-|
| β-adrenergic receptors | Full agonists (e.g. isoproterenol) form strong hydrogen bonds with conserved serine residues in transmembrane helix 5, stabilizing the fully active conformation [^114TKuKR] | Partial agonists (e.g. salbutamol) form weaker or fewer hydrogen bonds, stabilizing intermediate conformations and limiting activation [^114TKuKR] |
| AMPA receptors | Full agonists stabilize a fully closed ligand-binding domain, promoting maximal channel opening [^115bG19s] | Partial agonists stabilize multiple non-conducting conformations, limiting channel opening and producing submaximal responses [^117PMZvT] |
| Nuclear receptors | Full agonists stabilize conformations that strongly favor coactivator recruitment, leading to maximal transcriptional activation [^112zs479] | Partial agonists stabilize conformations that allow both coactivator and corepressor binding, resulting in partial transcriptional activation [^111As9Xs] |

## Functional consequences of partial agonism

Partial agonism has important functional and clinical implications:

- **Ceiling effect**: Partial agonists exhibit a ceiling effect, where increasing doses beyond a certain point do not produce additional physiological responses. This can limit efficacy but also improve safety by reducing the risk of overdose [^115qtVgG].

- **Antagonistic properties**: In the presence of full agonists, partial agonists can act as antagonists by competing for receptor binding sites and attenuating the effects of full agonists [^113f6meJ].

- **Clinical applications**: Partial agonists are clinically useful in contexts where moderate receptor activation is desired, such as buprenorphine for opioid use disorder [^112enY57], aripiprazole for psychiatric disorders [^111CSXVn], and varenicline for smoking cessation [^112sM1fm].

---

## Clinical examples of partial agonists

Several clinically important drugs exhibit partial agonist properties:

- **Buprenorphine**: Partial agonist at the μ-opioid receptor, providing analgesia and reducing withdrawal symptoms with a lower risk of respiratory depression compared to full agonists [^115qtVgG] [^112enY57].

- **Aripiprazole**: Partial agonist at dopamine D2 receptors, used in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, balancing dopamine activity to reduce side effects [^111CSXVn].

- **Varenicline**: Partial agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, reducing nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms while blocking the rewarding effects of nicotine [^112sM1fm].

---

Full and partial agonists differ in their ability to stabilize **receptor conformations** and activate downstream signaling, leading to distinct clinical effects. Full agonists produce **maximal responses** by stabilizing fully active conformations, whereas partial agonists produce submaximal responses by stabilizing intermediate conformations. This distinction underlies the therapeutic utility of partial agonists, including their **ceiling effects** and antagonistic properties in the presence of full agonists.

### Structural basis for partial agonist action at ionotropic glutamate receptors [^113TEBFj]. Nature Neuroscience (2003). Medium credibility.

An unresolved problem in understanding neurotransmitter receptor function concerns the mechanism(s) by which full and partial agonists elicit different amplitude responses at equal receptor occupancy. The widely held view of 'partial agonism' posits that resting and active states of the receptor are in equilibrium, and partial agonists simply do not shift the equilibrium toward the active state as efficaciously as full agonists. Here we report findings from crystallographic and electrophysiological studies of the mechanism of activation of an AMPA-subtype glutamate receptor ion channel. In these experiments, we used 5-substituted willardiines, a series of partial agonists that differ by only a single atom. Our results show that the GluR2 ligand-binding core can adopt a range of ligand-dependent conformational states, which in turn control the open probability of discrete subconductance states of the intact ion channel. Our findings thus provide a structure-based model of partial agonism.

### Efficacy of the β ₂-adrenergic receptor is determined by conformational equilibrium in the transmembrane region [^1141tKEL]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are one of the largest membrane protein families in eukaryotes, and more than 25% of modern drugs target GPCRs. These drugs bind to GPCRs, leading to the induction or inhibition of signal transduction mediated by G-proteins, β-arrestins and various other effectors via GPCRs. Each chemical ligand for a GPCR has a different level of ability to activate or inhibit its target, which is commonly referred to as efficacy, and the ligands are classified according to their efficacies, such as full agonists, partial agonists, neutral antagonists and inverse agonists. These differences in the efficacies significantly affect the therapeutic properties of the GPCR ligands. In the case of drugs that target β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR), a full agonist offers a clinical advantage over a partial agonist in acute severe asthma, although full agonists are capable of causing more adverse effects.

### Mechanism of partial agonist action at the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors [^113ynsBE]. Neuron (2005). Low credibility.

Partial agonists produce submaximal activation of ligand-gated ion channels. To address the question of partial agonist action at the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor, we performed crystallographic and electrophysiological studies with 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACPC), 1-aminocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (ACBC), and 1-aminocyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid (cycloleucine), three compounds with incrementally larger carbocyclic rings. Whereas ACPC and ACBC partially activate the NMDA receptor by 80% and 42%, respectively, their cocrystal structures of the NR1 ligand binding core show the same degree of domain closure as found in the complex with glycine, a full agonist, illustrating that the NR1 subunit provides a new paradigm for partial agonist action that is distinct from that of the evolutionarily related GluR2, AMPA-sensitive receptor. Cycloleucine behaves as an antagonist and stabilizes an open-cleft conformation. The NR1-cycloleucine complex forms a dimer that is similar to the GluR2 dimer, thereby suggesting a conserved mode of subunit-subunit interaction in AMPA and NMDA receptors.

### On the nature of partial agonism in the nicotinic receptor superfamily [^11564KVd]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

Partial agonists are ligands that bind to receptors but produce only a small maximum response even at concentrations where all receptors are occupied. In the case of ligand-activated ion channels, it has been supposed since 1957 that partial agonists evoke a small response because they are inefficient at eliciting the change of conformation between shut and open states of the channel. We have investigated partial agonists for two members of the nicotinic superfamily-the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and the glycine receptor-and find that the open-shut reaction is similar for both full and partial agonists, but the response to partial agonists is limited by an earlier conformation change ('flipping') that takes place while the channel is still shut. This has implications for the interpretation of structural studies, and in the future, for the design of partial agonists for therapeutic use.

### High dose antipsychotic polypharmacy and dopamine partial agonists-time to rethink guidelines? [^111CSXVn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the treatment of schizophrenia limit the use of antipsychotic agents to clinically-established maximum doses. This acknowledges both the absence of additional efficacy of dopamine D2 receptor antagonists above a receptor occupancy threshold, and the increases in side effects that can occur at higher doses. These limits restrict the dosing of combinations of antipsychotics as they do single agents; drugs sharing the major antipsychotic mechanism of D2 receptor antagonism will act additively in blocking these receptors. Several newer antipsychotic drugs, including aripiprazole and cariprazine, act as partial agonists at the D2 receptor site and avoid action at several other receptors, effects at which are responsible for some non-dopaminergic adverse effects. This pharmacology imparts different characteristics to the drugs resulting often in a more favourable side effect profile. Their partial agonism, along with high affinities for the D2 receptor, also means that these drugs given adjunctively may in part replace, rather than enhance, the D2 antagonism of other antipsychotic agents. This can result in an improvement in certain side effects without loss of antipsychotic efficacy. This article makes the case for distinguishing the D2 partial agonists from antagonists in defining maximum doses of combined treatments, which would increase the options available to the prescriber, emphasising that pharmacological mechanisms need to be understood in identifying optimal treatments for psychotic illness.

How do the mechanisms of action of nonsteroidal MRAs differ from those of steroidal MRAs?

I previously mentioned that one of the reasons for updating and publishing the new KDIGO guidelines in the first quarter of 2022 is the emergence of a new class of agents: novel non-steroidal MRAs. This next slide describes how the mechanisms of action of nonsteroidal MRAs differ from those of first-generation steroidal MRAs — to do this I have compared the classic steroidal MRA, which has been a mainstay of clinical practice for many years, spironolactone, with the new, recently approved third-generation MRA, finerenone.

Pharmacologically, finerenone has a bulky nature that allows it to bind to the MR in a way that prevents the MR from becoming or adopting an agonist conformation. In addition, finerenone has full MR antagonist activity compared to the classic steroidal MRAs like spironolactone, and more recently eplerenone, which have partial MR agonist activity that is undesirable.

It is therefore important to understand that the new, non-steroidal MRAs are able to act or to promote blockade in a more unfettered or unchained mechanism which, obviously, is relevant for progression for CKD.

### Mechanism of partial agonism in AMPA-type glutamate receptors [^115bG19s]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The LBD has a bi-lobate fold, built up by an upper D1 and a lower D2 domain, with the ligand bound between the two lobes. In the active configuration, the LBDs dimerize through interactions between D1 domains. Upon binding of glutamate, the two domains close and envelop the neurotransmitter. This motion provokes the separation of the D2 domains, connected to the ion channel, and presumably leads to the opening of the receptor gate. Nevertheless, the geometry and dynamics of the activation mechanism of this receptor remains opaque, not least because in all structures of the full-length AMPA receptor with agonists to date, the ion pore was closed, despite several arrangements of the LBD layer being observed.

One of the most pressing questions concerning ligand activity at enzymes, receptors and drug targetsconcerns the mechanisms by which full and partial agonists produce different amplitude responses at equally full occupancies of available binding sites. Partial agonism can be described by two distinct classical models. The Monod–Wyman–Changeux (MWC) model imagines that the partial agonist is weaker in shifting its target to the active state, producing different divisions of state occupancy over time. In contrast the Koshland–Nemethy–Filmer (KNF) model suggests that the receptors can undergo sequential non-concerted changes of the structure, meaning that different ligands, like partial agonists, induce distinct conformational states, and thus a division over spatial variables, such as the closure of a clamshell domain. However, these two models are extremes of more general models, which include hybrid intermediates, but that might still be too simplified because they do not explicitly include multiple conformations. Methods reporting both conformational space and activation at once offer a promising avenue to investigate how these distinct models relate to activity.

### Buprenorphine [^115qtVgG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Buprenorphine sublingual tablet contains buprenorphine, a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptor.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Subjective Effects

Comparisons of buprenorphine to full opioid agonists such as methadone and hydromorphone suggest that sublingual buprenorphine produces typical opioid agonist effects which are limited by a ceiling effect.

Opioid agonist ceiling-effects were also observed in a double-blind, parallel group, dose-ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution (1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, 16 mg, or 32 mg), placebo and a full agonist control at various doses. The treatments were given in ascending dose order at intervals of at least one week to 16 opioid-experienced subjects who were not physically dependent. Both active drugs produced typical opioid agonist effects. For all measures for which the drugs produced an effect, buprenorphine produced a dose-related response. However, in each case, there was a dose that produced no further effect. In contrast, the highest dose of the full agonist control always produced the greatest effects. Agonist objective rating scores remained elevated for the higher doses of buprenorphine (8 mg to 32 mg) longer than for the lower doses and did not return to baseline until 48 hours after drug administration. The onset of effects appeared more rapidly with buprenorphine than with the full agonist control, with most doses nearing peak effect after 100 minutes for buprenorphine compared to 150 minutes for the full agonist control.

### Clinical implications of the intrinsic efficacy of β-adrenoceptor drugs in asthma: full, partial and inverse agonism [^114sFfRv]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

beta2-Adrenoceptor (AR) agonists are the most effective bronchodilators known, and play important roles in every step of asthma therapy. Intrinsic efficacy is an important pharmacological property that differentiates the clinical effects and safety profile of beta2-AR agonists. We review the role of beta2-AR agonist intrinsic efficacy in asthma treatment focusing on recent literature.

Recent Findings

In acute asthma, a full agonist (high intrinsic efficacy) offers a clinical advantage over a partial agonist (low intrinsic efficacy) but with the potential of inducing dose-dependent adverse effects. The chronic use of beta2-AR agonists may be associated with several adverse outcomes including loss of asthma control and even increased mortality. Recently, the role of beta-AR inverse agonists (beta-blockers) which have a negative intrinsic efficacy was studied. Whereas contraindicated in acute asthma, preliminary data suggest that the chronic use of these agents may be associated with attenuation of airway hyper-responsiveness in patients with mild asthma. Studies in a murine model of asthma suggest that such effects may be related to decreased airway inflammation and mucous metaplasia.

Summary

Rational choice among beta2-AR agonists in acute and chronic asthma should be influenced by differences in intrinsic efficacy among these agents. In acute severe asthma, a full agonist offers a clinical advantage over a partial agonist. Whereas the use of inverse agonists in the treatment of asthma is still experimental and needs further exploration in future trials, preliminary studies suggest that their chronic use is well tolerated and is associated with decreased airway hyper-responsiveness.

### Principles for modulation of the nuclear receptor superfamily [^111jgswB]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2004). Medium credibility.

Nuclear receptors are major targets for drug discovery and have key roles in development and homeostasis, as well as in many diseases such as obesity, diabetes and cancer. This review provides a general overview of the mechanism of action of nuclear receptors and explores the various factors that are instrumental in modulating their pharmacology. In most cases, the response of a given receptor to a particular ligand in a specific tissue will be dictated by the set of proteins with which the receptor is able to interact. One of the most promising aspects of nuclear receptor pharmacology is that it is now possible to develop ligands with a large spectrum of full, partial or inverse agonist or antagonist activities, but also compounds, called selective nuclear receptor modulators, that activate only a subset of the functions induced by the cognate ligand or that act in a cell-type-selective manner.

### Structure-guided design of partial agonists at an opioid receptor [^114eDnAo]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In line with this emerging need, our investigation focused on the transition from full to partial agonism. Intriguingly, as we engaged the sodium binding site, we observed such a transition between C5-Quino and C6-Quino. This difference in efficacy was even more pronounced in arrestin activity than in G-protein signaling. To better understand this difference in efficacy, we combined structural and pharmacological approaches to confirm that interactions with the sodium site play important roles in ligand efficacy modulation.

How receptor efficacy is modulated has been previously unclear. A recent study uncovered the mechanism responsible for xanomeline's efficacy-driven selectivity among closely related muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). Xanomeline binds similarly to the inactive states of all five mAChR subtypes but differently to their active states, due to steric clashes of its tail with the second extracellular loop. Changes in efficacy are driven by the contraction of the binding pockets upon activation, a mechanism that could apply to other G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) where binding pockets change size during activation. These findings indicate that small structural changes, such as addition of a few atoms to a drug molecule, can alter efficacy. These changes can be explained through classical thermodynamic principles of binding at the orthosteric site, without considering factors like binding kinetics, receptor internalization, or receptor oligomerization.

In summary, C6-Quino displayed potent analgesic effects without typical δOR adverse effects. Although our data strongly suggest that the distinct pharmacological profiles of SNC80 and C6-Quino arise primarily from their differing efficacies, we cannot exclude the possibility that structural differences between these two ligands also contribute to the observed in vivo effects. C6-Quino's unique properties, including the absence of seizures, locomotor impairment, and reduced respiratory depression, highlight its potential as a candidate for chronic pain treatment. These findings also suggest that targeting the sodium site offers a new approach towards modulating signaling activity, thereby opening up new opportunities for the development of analgesics with enhanced safety profiles and efficacy in treating chronic pain, particularly in neuropathic and inflammatory conditions where current treatment options are limited. Further research and clinical trials will help validate the potential of δOR partial agonists as safer therapeutic agents for chronic pain. Moreover, the approach presented here serves as a versatile strategy for enhancing the signaling characteristics of other Class A GPCRs, making it a valuable tool for optimizing their performance.

Agonist objective rating scores remained elevated for the higher doses of buprenorphine (8mg to 32 mg) longer than for the lower doses and did not return to baseline until 48 hours after drug administration. The onset of effects appeared more rapidly with buprenorphine than with the full agonist control, with most doses nearing peak effect after 100 minutes for buprenorphine compared to 150 minutes for the full agonist control.

### The structural basis for agonist and partial agonist action on a β (1)-adrenergic receptor [^114TKuKR]. Nature (2011). Excellent credibility.

β-adrenergic receptors (βARs) are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that activate intracellular G proteins upon binding catecholamine agonist ligands such as adrenaline and noradrenaline. Synthetic ligands have been developed that either activate or inhibit βARs for the treatment of asthma, hypertension or cardiac dysfunction. These ligands are classified as either full agonists, partial agonists or antagonists, depending on whether the cellular response is similar to that of the native ligand, reduced or inhibited, respectively. However, the structural basis for these different ligand efficacies is unknown. Here we present four crystal structures of the thermostabilized turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) β(1)-adrenergic receptor (β(1)AR-m23) bound to the full agonists carmoterol and isoprenaline and the partial agonists salbutamol and dobutamine. In each case, agonist binding induces a 1Å contraction of the catecholamine-binding pocket relative to the antagonist bound receptor. Full agonists can form hydrogen bonds with two conserved serine residues in transmembrane helix 5 (Ser(5.42) and Ser(5.46)), but partial agonists only interact with Ser(5.42) (superscripts refer to Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering). The structures provide an understanding of the pharmacological differences between different ligand classes, illuminating how GPCRs function and providing a solid foundation for the structure-based design of novel ligands with predictable efficacies.

### Derepression may masquerade as activation in ligand-gated ion channels [^116qTmrw]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

A repressive role for the α-subunits offers a way to reconcile these counterintuitive findings, and provides insight into phenomenological 'flipped' and 'primed' states. Rather than activating the channel, agonists could instead derepress it. In this framework, the α-subunits repress spontaneous/basal activity, and agonists remove this repressive influence leading to an 'apparent activation', which is in fact the restoration of intrinsic basal activity. To derepress the channel, agonists drive the transition of the channel from a repressed/closed state where openings are unlikely (e.g. 'unflipped' or 'unprimed'), to a derepressed/closed state where openings are more likely (e.g. 'flipped' or 'primed'). An important distinction between derepression and activation, is that in the derepression paradigm, agonists do not drive the transition from an inactive/closed state to an active/open state, but instead drive a transition between two distinct closed states that are both inactive. From this perspective, full vs. partial agonists differ in their ability to derepress the channel, but once derepressed, the channel opens and closes in the same way irrespective of the efficacy of the bound agonist. These predictions that (1) agonists drive a transition between two inactive/closed states, and (2) channel opening is independent of agonist efficacy, are both realised in the 'flip' and 'prime' models.

### Functionally selective signaling and broad metabolic benefits by novel insulin receptor partial agonists [^1164cJyr]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In the current studies, a novel class of insulin dimers is described that function as insulin receptor partial agonists (IRPA). The studies expand on an early observationthat selected covalent dimers of insulin may have liver-preferential action and newly demonstrate that this can be tuned structurally to manifest desirable partial agonism across species. The partial agonism of IRPA derives from differences from insulin in IRPA binding to the insulin receptor, differences in receptor mediated ligand endocytosis, and selectivity or bias in downstream signal transduction. In vivo studies demonstrated clear differentiations from insulin in rodents and larger animal species of pig and dog, which derive mechanistically from the partial agonism and functional selectivity of signaling. Notably, these in vivo differences include a slower clearance than regular insulin, attributable largely to diminished IR mediated clearance, to a hepato-adipose tissue predominance in insulin action with relative sparing of skeletal muscle insulin action, and for a lesser propensity to cause hypoglycemia, a frequent complication of conventional insulin therapy. Taken together, these in vivo characteristics of IRPA form a profile that bears strong resemblance to that of the profile of postabsorptive physiology governed by endogenously secreted insulin in healthy humans.

### Efficacy of the β ₂-adrenergic receptor is determined by conformational equilibrium in the transmembrane region [^111JkNUi]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Many drugs that target G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) induce or inhibit their signal transduction with different strengths, which affect their therapeutic properties. However, the mechanism underlying the differences in the signalling levels is still not clear, although several structures of GPCRs complexed with ligands determined by X-ray crystallography are available. Here we utilized NMR to monitor the signals from the methionine residue at position 82 in neutral antagonist- and partial agonist-bound states of β₂-adrenergic receptor (β₂AR), which are correlated with the conformational changes of the transmembrane regions upon activation. We show that this residue exists in a conformational equilibrium between the inverse agonist-bound states and the full agonist-bound state, and the population of the latter reflects the signal transduction level in each ligand-bound state. These findings provide insights into the multi-level signalling of β 2 AR and other GPCRs, including the basal activity, and the mechanism of signal transduction mediated by GPCRs.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^114ksJFW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film contains buprenorphine and naloxone. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptor. Naloxone is a potent antagonist at mu-opioid receptors and produces opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in individuals physically dependent on full opioid agonists when administered parenterally.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Subjective Effects

Comparisons of buprenorphine to full opioid agonists such as methadone and hydromorphone suggest that sublingual buprenorphine produces typical opioid agonist effects which are limited by a ceiling effect.

In opioid-experienced subjects who were not physically dependent, acute sublingual doses of buprenorphine/naloxone tablets produced opioid agonist effects which reached a maximum between doses of 8 mg/2 mg and 16 mg/4 mg buprenorphine/naloxone.

Opioid agonist ceiling-effects were also observed in a double-blind, parallel group, dose-ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg), placebo and a full agonist control at various doses. The treatments were given in ascending dose order at intervals of at least one week to 16 opioid-experienced subjects who were not physically dependent. Both active drugs produced typical opioid agonist effects. For all measures for which the drugs produced an effect, buprenorphine produced a dose-related response. However, in each case, there was a dose that produced no further effect. In contrast, the highest dose of the full agonist control always produced the greatest effects. Agonist objective rating scores remained elevated for the higher doses of buprenorphine (8 mg to 32 mg) longer than for the lower doses and did not return to baseline until 48 hours after drug administration. The onset of effects appeared more rapidly with buprenorphine than with the full agonist control, with most doses nearing peak effect after 100 minutes for buprenorphine compared to 150 minutes for the full agonist control.

1. Interpreting Buprenorphine as a Partial Agonist at the µ -Opioid Receptor

Discussion

The in vitro classification of buprenorphine as a "partial agonist" at the µ -opioid receptor may lead to the misconception that it is less effective as an analgesic than a reference opioid that is considered a full µ -opioid receptor agonist; however, the definition of partial agonist is context dependent and relative to a reference agent (Figure 2). For example, some in vitro studies have also classified morphine as a partial µ -opioid receptor agonist. In addition, antinociceptive dose-response curves for buprenorphine and morphine have been shown to vary by pain intensity, which highlights that the partial µ -opioid receptor agonism can vary depending on experimental design.

Figure 2
Receptor/ligand definitions and applications to buprenorphine at the μ-opioid receptor. *Definition of a partial agonist: a compound with an intermediate intrinsic activity that at full receptor saturation produces less than the maximal effect obtainable with full agonists in some specified set of in vitro or clinical circumstances. Buprenorphine is a potent Schedule III opioid with high binding affinity at the μ-opioid receptor that behaves as a partial agonist on the basis of in vitro studies. Although buprenorphine has less total intrinsic activity (capacity to activate a receptor to induce multiple signaling pathways) than full μ-opioid receptor agonists, it still effectively stimulates the analgesic signaling pathway from the μ-opioid receptor. 3D = three-dimensional; OR = opioid receptor.

### Structure-guided design of partial agonists at an opioid receptor [^115V3hDD]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Emerging evidence suggests that reduced intrinsic efficacy for G protein activation could lead to improved side effect profiles for opioids (as demonstrated by μOR-focused studies) –, antipsychotics, and non-hallucinogenic psychedelic analogs. While it remains unclear whether partial agonism at δORs confers comparable benefits across different pain modalities, these findings highlight the potential of δOR partial agonists as safer therapeutic agents. Partial agonists produce a submaximal response compared to full agonists and have been associated with fewer side effects including opioid physical dependence. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanism mediating partial agonism and its structural basis remain unclear, severely hindering the rational design of such ligands.

Recently, structural advances focusing on the conserved sodium site in a highly diverse array of class A GPCRs have proposed this site as an "efficacy-switch" controlling ligand efficacy –. Sodium acts as a negative allosteric modulatorand is critical for the control of signaling in a number of GPCRs at physiological concentrations. Specifically, the sodium pocket is shown to undergo dramatic conformational changes upon receptor activation, with recent studies proving residues in the sodium pocket control the basal activity of the receptor and differentially modulate GPCR activation towards signaling at either G-protein or β-arrestin pathways –. Consistent with these findings, the high-resolution inactive state structure of δOR revealed a sodium ion in a pocket at the bottom of the orthosteric site. Several mutations in the δOR sodium pocket converted the action of the δOR antagonist, naltrindole (NTI), into partial or full agonism in the β-arrestin2 pathway, further validating the sodium site as an attractive target to control ligand efficacy and modulate signaling activity through the δOR. Furthermore, recent cryo-EM studies of δOR agonist complexes have provided some structural insights into ligand-induced receptor activation, suggesting a possible role of sodium pocket interactions in modulating signaling bias.

### Buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride (Zubsolv) [^1142hZEg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

ZUBSOLV contains buprenorphine and naloxone. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptor. Naloxone is a potent antagonist at mu-opioid receptors and produces opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms, if administered parenterally, in individuals physically dependent on full opioid agonists.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

ZUBSOLV has been shown to have different bioavailability compared to Suboxone tablet. One ZUBSOLV 5.7 mg/1.4 mg tablet provides equivalent buprenorphine exposure and 12% lower naloxone exposure to one Suboxone 8 mg/2 mg tablet. The pharmacodynamic information of other currently marketed buprenorphine/naloxone-containing sublingual products is not directly comparable on a mg basis to ZUBSOLV [see Dosage and Administration (2.9].

Subjective Effects

Comparisons of buprenorphine to full opioid agonists such as methadone and hydromorphone suggest that sublingual buprenorphine produces typical opioid agonist effects which are limited by a ceiling effect.

In opioid-experienced subjects who were not physically dependent, acute sublingual doses of Suboxone tablets produced opioid agonist effects which reached a maximum between doses of 8 mg/2 mg and 16 mg/4 mg buprenorphine/naloxone.

### Hormonal contraception and HIV-1 acquisition: biological mechanisms [^1175DjAM]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Whether a progestin is an agonist, a partial agonist, or an antagonist, known as its "biocharacter", is a measure of the extent of the maximum response possible relative to a reference agonist. This can also be determined from dose–response curves, as illustrated in Fig. 2(a) for agonist and partial agonist. All progestins are agonists for the PR. Progestins can also be steroid receptor antagonists, that is, they can bind to steroid receptors other than the PR but induce a nonoptimal receptor conformation and hence result in no change in a response on their own, but they can block the effect of an agonist. Antagonist potency and efficacy are determined by dose–response analysis using a constant concentration of the agonist in the presence of varying concentrations of antagonist, as was used to show potent antagonist activity for progesterone acting via the MR. Thus high-affinity binding does not necessarily confer a high agonist or partial agonist response. An antagonist such as RU486 binds both the GR and PR with a relatively high affinity, but it is an antagonist for both receptors. Several progestins can act as partial or full agonists for receptors other than the PR. For example, both MPA and NET can act as agonists for the AR, with progesterone acting as a partial agonist, whereas MPA can act as a partial agonist or full agonist for the GR, depending on cell and gene context. In contrast, progesterone is a partial agonist for the GR with low potency, whereas NET has no GR agonist activity in cell line models. Because steroids can either increase or decrease responses such as gene expression, dose–response curves can either be stimulatory (as for transactivation), depicted in Fig. 2(a), or inhibitory (as for transrepression). MPA has been shown to be a relatively potent full agonist for transrepression and a partial agonist for transactivation via the GR, whereas progesterone is a relatively weak, partial agonist for both via the GR. Biocharacters can also be cell specific and sometimes even gene specific, such as for many synthetic selective steroid modulators, similar to tamoxifen via the ER. Importantly, the EC 50 can vary depending on the progestin receptor concentration inside the cell. Fig. 2(b) shows how potency could increase from 10 nM (curve c), to 1 nM (curve b), to 0.1 nM (curve a) just by increasing the receptor concentration in the same cell [Fig. 2(b), low receptor concentration for curve c and high receptor concentration for curve a]. The effects of changing receptor concentrations have been best demonstrated for the GR, and they have also been shown to switch the biocharacter of MPA from a partial agonist to a full agonist via the GR. EC 50 also varies with the concentrations and interactions of proteins and other molecules that mediate the response downstream of steroid binding, as well as the affinity of the progestin for its receptor. Hence, progestin potency cannot be predicted and is steroid, cell, and even gene specific.

Agonism: EFFICACY

When a drug interacts with the orthosteric site of a receptor, this interaction can result in several outcomes. If the drug stimulates a change in receptor function, we say that it has efficacy. The ability of a drug to activate a receptor is currently thought to derive from changes in the receptor conformation such that the changed receptor, either directly or indirectly, alters cell function. A direct effect could be the opening of an ion channel in the receptor resulting in changed membrane permeability (e.g. for a ligand-gated ion channel receptor). Alternatively, the activated receptor may cause the response indirectly by interacting with either a transducer (e.g. G proteins) or an effector (e.g. kinase) molecule to mediate the biological signal. A drug that does this would be called an orthosteric agonist. In Figure 3a, the activated conformation of the receptor is illustrated by the change in color from blue to purple. If the drug interacts with the orthosteric site but does not change the physical structure of the receptor, the function of the receptor does not change. This drug is called an orthosteric antagonist. By definition, it has an efficacy (e value) of zero. Different drugs may have different abilities to activate a receptor and it is here that the quantitative nature of efficacy is defined. A drug with full ability to activate a receptor, resulting in the maximum effect of the receptor is given a positive efficacy value [which may range from 0 to a large number; efficacy is not necessarily limited to a maximum of 1]. Such a drug that gives a full response in a system is known as a full agonist. There are also drugs that cause a response less than that of the full agonist; they are called partial agonists. This concept is illustrated in Figure 4a. Figure 5 depicts classic concentration (A) and dose (B) response curves from which potency and efficacy can be assessed. The threshold, as marked in this figure, is the lowest concentration of the drug at which a biological event is observed.

### Mechanism of partial agonism in AMPA-type glutamate receptors [^117PMZvT]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Neurotransmitters trigger synaptic currents by activating ligand-gated ion channel receptors. Whereas most neurotransmitters are efficacious agonists, molecules that activate receptors more weakly — partial agonists — also exist. Whether these partial agonists have weak activity because they stabilize less active forms, sustain active states for a lesser fraction of the time or both, remains an open question. Here we describe the crystal structure of an α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptor (AMPAR) ligand binding domain (LBD) tetramer in complex with the partial agonist 5-fluorowillardiine (FW). We validate this structure, and others of different geometry, using engineered intersubunit bridges. We establish an inverse relation between the efficacy of an agonist and its promiscuity to drive the LBD layer into different conformations. These results suggest that partial agonists of the AMPAR are weak activators of the receptor because they stabilize multiple non-conducting conformations, indicating that agonism is a function of both the space and time domains.

### Mechanism of partial agonism in AMPA-type glutamate receptors [^111Ugp6r]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

In summary, by validating LBD trapping mutants, we found that the less efficacious the agonist is, the more distinct conformations the AMPA receptor can visit. In other words, partial agonists are bad at activating the channel because they allow the LBD to sample conformations that are unproductive. This observation suggests that partial agonism not only occurs by the limited ability of a given ligand to close the LBD, but also because of the (possibly consequent) reduced ability to constrain LBD movement within the tetramer.

### Pharmacological similarities and differences between beta2-agonists [^114pWWh7]. Respiratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Formoterol and salmeterol are both long-acting bronchodilators that are effective in the treatment of asthma. However, some differences exist in their pharmacology that are reflected in their clinical profiles. Formoterol has a rapid onset of action, whereas salmeterol causes bronchodilation in a somewhat slower manner. However, both ofthese drugs are long-acting. After single doses clear effects are maintained for 12 h after inhalation, and with high doses effects are observed even at 24 h. Differences between the maximal effects of both drugs are also a consequence of their pharmacological properties. Thus, formoterol has higher intrinsic activity than salmeterol, which means that it is a full agonist, whereas salmeterol is a partial agonist on the beta2-receptor. Physicochemical properties of the drugs may explain the differences in onset and duration of action. Adequate water solubility and moderate lipophilicity of formoterol ensures rapid diffusion to the beta2-receptor on the smooth muscle and rapid bronchodilating activity. Salmeterol, on the other hand, may diffuse more slowly to the beta2-receptor because of its high lipophilicity explaining the slower onset of action. Unlike salbutamol, which is hydrophilic and has a rapid onset and short duration of action, both formoterol and salmeterol possess adequate lipophilic properties to remain in the airway tissues as a depot in close vicinity to the beta2-receptor, explaining their long duration of effect. The long duration of salmeterol has also been suggested to depend on an anchored binding within the beta2-receptor. The pharmacological evidence for a rapid onset of action of formoterol, but long duration of effect, is supported by several clinical studies. The fast onset of bronchodilation and high intrinsic activity of formoterol therefore suggest that it can be used for relief treatment in patients with asthma if they are concomitantly treated with inhaled glucocorticoids.

### Structure-guided design of partial agonists at an opioid receptor [^113KWqEt]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Chronic pain and opioid overdose deaths highlight the need for non-addictive analgesics with novel mechanisms. The δ opioid receptor (δOR) is a promising target, as it lacks the respiratory depression associated with µ opioid receptor (µOR) agonists. However, early δOR full agonists caused seizures, limiting their clinical use. Partial δOR agonists may offer more controlled receptor activation than full agonists, but their development has been hindered by uncertainty regarding the molecular mechanism of partial agonism. Here we show that C6-Quino, a bitopic ligand developed through structure-based design, acts as a selective δOR partial agonist. Functional studies reveal that C6-Quino shows differential activity at G-protein and arrestin pathways and interacts with the sodium binding pocket, confirmed through cryo-EM analysis. C6-Quino demonstrates oral activity, analgesic activity in chronic pain models without causing δOR-related seizures and µOR-related adverse effects which have limited opioid usage in recent times. This discovery outlines a new strategy for developing δOR-targeted analgesics and provides a framework for optimizing signaling profiles of other Class A GPCRs.

### Kinetic basis of partial agonism at NMDA receptors [^1172nKSV]. Nature Neuroscience (2009). Medium credibility.

Activation of ligand-gated channels is initiated by the binding of small molecules at extracellular sites and culminates with the opening of a membrane-embedded pore. To investigate how perturbations at ligand-binding domains influence the gating reaction, we examined current traces recorded from individual NMDA receptors in the presence of several subunit-specific partial agonists. We found that low-efficacy agonists acting at either the glycine-binding or the glutamate-binding NMDA receptor subunits had very similar effects on the receptor's activation reaction, possibly reflecting a high degree of coupling between the two subunit types during gating. In addition, we found that partial agonists increased the height of all energy barriers encountered by NMDA receptors during activation. This result stands in sharp contrast to the localized effects that have been observed for pentameric ligand-gated channels and may represent a previously unknown mechanism by which partial agonists reduce receptor activity.

### Treatments for schizophrenia: a critical review of pharmacology and mechanisms of action of antipsychotic drugs [^117JA6UK]. Molecular Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

The treatment of schizophrenia has evolved over the past half century primarily in the context of antipsychotic drug development. Although there has been significant progress resulting in the availability and use of numerous medications, these reflect three basic classes of medications (conventional (typical), atypical and dopamine partial agonist antipsychotics) all of which, despite working by varying mechanisms of actions, act principally on dopamine systems. Many of the second-generation (atypical and dopamine partial agonist) antipsychotics are believed to offer advantages over first-generation agents in the treatment for schizophrenia. However, the pharmacological properties that confer the different therapeutic effects of the new generation of antipsychotic drugs have remained elusive, and certain side effects can still impact patient health and quality of life. Moreover, the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs is limited prompting the clinical use of adjunctive pharmacy to augment the effects of treatment. In addition, the search for novel and nondopaminergic antipsychotic drugs has not been successful to date, though numerous development strategies continue to be pursued, guided by various pathophysiologic hypotheses. This article provides a brief review and critique of the current therapeutic armamentarium for treating schizophrenia and drug development strategies and theories of mechanisms of action of antipsychotics, and focuses on novel targets for therapeutic agents for future drug development.

### Mechanism of partial agonism in AMPA-type glutamate receptors [^111jivCm]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Structural studies on isolated AMPAR LBDs in complex with agonists (that is, glutamate and willardiines) indicated a correlation between the cleft closure and the agonist efficacy. However, although mutations at the 'mouth' of the cleft reduce glutamate efficacy, this correlation is not entirely reflected in full-length structures. Also, MD simulations, NMR experimentsand single-molecule FRET analysisshowed that partial agonists lead to a variety of clamshell conformations. Thus, the correlation observed between clamshell closure and efficacy is not consistent, speaking against clamshell closure as the sole determinant of the degree of channel activation. In the context of the tetramer, further degrees of freedom, afforded by different agonists, could explain the differences in efficacy.

In two recent studies, we identified two distinct conformations of the tetrameric LBD layer, associated with partial activation of the AMPA receptor. The 'closed angle' conformation (CA) is trapped by a crosslink between subunits A and C at position A665C (ref.) and represents an activation intermediate obtained in subsaturating glutamate. A similar compact form was subsequently obtained for LBDs fully bound to glutamate. Here, we present the crystal structure of the soluble GluA2 LBD bound to the partial agonist 5-fluorowillardiine (FW) in a different tetrameric arrangement, which we could confirm with functional trapping in full-length receptors. In this arrangement, subunits B and D are found in close apposition, distinct from previously published structures. Extending our study across four distinct trapping geometries, and seven bridges in all, we found an inverse relationship between the efficacy of the agonist and the number of conformations that the AMPA receptor could adopt. These data show that the efficacy of AMPA receptor agonists is a function of both time and conformational space.

### Functionally selective signaling and broad metabolic benefits by novel insulin receptor partial agonists [^115gTWSz]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Insulin analogs have been developed to treat diabetes with focus primarily on improving the time action profile without affecting ligand-receptor interaction or functional selectivity. As a result, inherent liabilities (e.g. hypoglycemia) of injectable insulin continue to limit the true therapeutic potential of related agents. Insulin dimers were synthesized to investigate whether partial agonism of the insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase is achievable, and to explore the potential for tissue-selective systemic insulin pharmacology. The insulin dimers induced distinct IR conformational changes compared to native monomeric insulin and substrate phosphorylation assays demonstrated partial agonism. Structurally distinct dimers with differences in conjugation sites and linkers were prepared to deliver desirable IR partial agonist (IRPA). Systemic infusions of a B29-B29 dimer in vivo revealed sharp differences compared to native insulin. Suppression of hepatic glucose production and lipolysis were like that attained with regular insulin, albeit with a distinctly shallower dose-response. In contrast, there was highly attenuated stimulation of glucose uptake into muscle. Mechanistic studies indicated that IRPAs exploit tissue differences in receptor density and have additional distinctions pertaining to drug clearance and distribution. The hepato-adipose selective action of IRPAs is a potentially safer approach for treatment of diabetes.

### Molecular tuning of farnesoid X receptor partial agonism [^111As9Xs]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The bile acid-sensing transcription factor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulates multiple metabolic processes. Modulation of FXR is desired to overcome several metabolic pathologies but pharmacological administration of full FXR agonists has been plagued by mechanism-based side effects. We have developed a modulator that partially activates FXR in vitro and in mice. Here we report the elucidation of the molecular mechanism that drives partial FXR activation by crystallography- and NMR-based structural biology. Natural and synthetic FXR agonists stabilize formation of an extended helix α11 and the α11-α12 loop upon binding. This strengthens a network of hydrogen bonds, repositions helix α12 and enables co-activator recruitment. Partial agonism in contrast is conferred by a kink in helix α11 that destabilizes the α11-α12 loop, a critical determinant for helix α12 orientation. Thereby, the synthetic partial agonist induces conformational states, capable of recruiting both co-repressors and co-activators leading to an equilibrium of co-activator and co-repressor binding.

### Can buprenorphine Be combined with potent opioids? Synergy, additive effects, or antagonism [^116KTxHo]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2025). Medium credibility.

This review explores the pharmacological interactions between buprenorphine and potent full mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists. Drawing on preclinical studies, it evaluates whether buprenorphine acts synergistically, additively, or antagonistically when co-administered with other opioids. Human equivalent doses (HEDs) derived from animal models are used to inform clinical practice. Until clinical trials provide definitive guidance, clinicians can combine analgesic-range buprenorphine with short-acting full-agonist opioids for breakthrough pain, anticipating additive analgesia at lower buprenorphine exposures and exercising caution at high buprenorphine doses.

### Structures of β-adrenergic receptor in complex with Gs and ligands of different efficacies [^114gCVbU]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate transmembrane signaling from ligands with different efficacies to downstream heterotrimeric G-proteins –. Ligands can vary in efficacy, namely in their intrinsic ability to activate downstream signaling pathways. Full agonists elicit the maximal signaling response, and partial agonists induce various degrees of sub-maximal responses. Antagonists produce no or little responses by themselves, but block the binding of other ligands to GPCRs. Inverse agonists decrease the basal physiological activity of GPCRs. A conformation selection model has been proposed to explain the actions of ligands with different efficacies on GPCRs. GPCRs are highly dynamic proteins and can sample multiple conformations including inactive states, intermediate states, and active states. These different conformations are in equilibrium with each other. Ligands stabilize unique and ligand-specific GPCR conformations. Binding of full agonists stabilizes the active state conformation, and shifts the GPCR conformational equilibrium towards the active states. Partial agonists select a different conformation and are less able to drive the equilibrium to the active state than full agonists. Therefore, the population or amount of GPCRs in the active state is correlated with ligand efficacy.

After ligand binding, GPCRs activate G-proteins to initiate downstream physiological responses. Here we have investigated the activation of G-proteins by GPCRs bound with ligands with different efficacies. Previous X-ray crystal structural studies of GPCRs (without G-proteins) bound with ligands with different efficacies surprisingly showed similar conformations for individual GPCRs that most are in the inactive states. The ligand-binding pockets in the receptors adopt ligand-specific configurations. On the other hand, nuclear magnetic resonance and fluorescence life-time spectroscopy studies of GPCRs (without G-proteins) indicate that ligand efficacy correlates with local conformational changes, and these changes occur in a fast timescale –. Furthermore, X-ray crystal and cryo-EM structures of the complexes of full agonist-bound GPCRs and G-proteins show that GPCRs in these complexes are in the fully active states. While the interactions between GPCRs (without G-proteins) and full agonists, partial agonists and antagonists have been investigated, we still do not fully understand the structural and biochemical bases for the activation of G-proteins by GPCRs after bound with partial agonists.

### Mechanism of partial agonism in AMPA-type glutamate receptors [^114eRCCA]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The first crystal structures of the GluA2 LBDs were solved nearly 20 years ago. Despite functional, biochemical, FRET, molecular dynamics studies and the latest full-length structures of the glutamate receptor bound to agonists, antagonists and modulators, LBD movements during activation are not fully understood, perhaps because of their inherent complexity. Nonetheless, there has been comparatively little testing of which conformations can be obtained by functional receptors undergoing normal activation in cell membranes. By combining crystallographic studies with engineered binding sites for Zn 2+ or cysteine crosslinks, we could verify trapping of the full-length receptor in different functional states, assign these states to LBD tetramer geometries, and compare the properties of trapped receptors to the overall ensemble activated in a particular condition. Importantly, by confirming that mutations we made did not alter the channel opening equilibrium much in the absence of zinc, we ensured that we worked with receptors that were good mimics of wild-type receptors, (Supplementary Table 2). Unfortunately, receptor constructs heavily engineered for crystallization do not always obey this criterion. Trapping bridges can lock potassium channels and NMDA receptors into active, open channel states. Perhaps surprisingly, given these observations, all the bridges that we have studied to date in the AMPA receptor, either inhibit activity when they coordinate zinc, or are neutral, as shown here for some partial agonists.

### A structural mechanism for directing corepressor-selective inverse agonism of PPAR γ [^117BJmvN]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a target for antidiabetic drugs, including the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of molecules. TZDs are full agonists of PPARγ that promote transcription of PPARγ target genes. Unfortunately, therapeutic use of TZDs has adverse side effects, including brittle bones from the differentiation of bone into fat. Although originally it was thought that full activation of PPARγ was required for antidiabetic efficacy, recent studies have shown that antidiabetic PPARγ ligands alter posttranslational modifications impacting target gene expression. These ligands have been shown to span a wide range of efficacies — including full and partial agonists, antagonists, and inverse agonists that have robust or mild activating, neutral, or repressive transcriptional properties, respectively –. Importantly, repressive PPARγ modulators promote bone formation, and pharmacological repression or antagonism of PPARγ is implicated in the treatment of obesity, and cancer –.

In order to understand how to harness the positive effects of targeting PPARγ, we need to better understand the structural mechanisms that elicit PPARγ activation (agonism) and repression (inverse agonism) relative to basal cellular activity. The distinct pharmacological phenotypes of PPARγ ligands are dictated by ligand-dependent recruitment of transcriptional coregulator proteins (coactivators and corepressors) to the PPARγ ligand-binding domain (LBD). The LBD contains the orthosteric ligand-binding pocket, which is the binding site for endogenous and most synthetic ligands, as well as the activation function-2 (AF-2) coregulator binding surface. The AF-2 surface is composed of three LBD structural elements: helix 3, helix 5, and the critical helix 12 that moves between two or more conformations in the absence of ligand –.

### Structures of β-adrenergic receptor in complex with Gs and ligands of different efficacies [^1132Exju]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) receive signals from ligands with different efficacies, and transduce to heterotrimeric G-proteins to generate different degrees of physiological responses. Previous studies revealed how ligands with different efficacies activate GPCRs. Here, we investigate how a GPCR activates G-proteins upon binding ligands with different efficacies. We report the cryo-EM structures of β₁-adrenergic receptor (β₁-AR) in complex with Gs (Gαs Gβ₁ Gγ₂) and a partial agonist or a very weak partial agonist, and compare them to the β₁-AR-Gs structure in complex with a full agonist. Analyses reveal similar overall complex architecture, with local conformational differences. Cellular functional studies with mutations of β 1 -AR residues show effects on the cellular signaling from β 1 -AR to the cAMP response initiated by the three different ligands, with residue-specific functional differences. Biochemical investigations uncover that the intermediate state complex comprising β 1 -AR and nucleotide-free Gs is more stable when binding a full agonist than a partial agonist. Molecular dynamics simulations support the local conformational flexibilities and different stabilities among the three complexes. These data provide insights into the ligand efficacy in the activation of GPCRs and G-proteins.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and aspirin [^117WC5RS]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action

Hydrocodone is full opioid agonist with relative selectivity for the mu-opioid (μ) receptor, although it can interact with other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydrocodone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with hydrocodone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression.

The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug.

Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is a more potent inhibitor of both prostaglandin synthesis and platelet aggregation than other salicylic acid derivatives. The differences in activity between aspirin and salicylic acid are thought to be due to the acetyl group on the aspirin molecule. This acetyl group is responsible for the inactivation of cyclo-oxygenase via acetylation.

Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) works by inhibiting the body's production of prostaglandins, including prostaglandins involved in inflammation. Prostaglandins cause pain sensations by stimulating muscle contractions and dilating blood vessels throughout the body. In the CNS, aspirin works on the hypothalamus heat-regulating center to reduce fever, however, other mechanisms may be involved.

### Antagonist-agonist combinations as therapies for heroin addiction: back to the future? [^113qg7f8]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Psychopharmacology is a powerful approach to the treatment of many psychiatric disorders. In this article I discuss the conceptual and practical issues in relation to the use of mu opioid receptor agonist, antagonist and partial agonist drugs in the treatment of opioid addiction, as this is one therapeutic area where all three types of agents are currently available. The choice of pharmacological agent is largely determined by patient profile, existence of ongoing drug misuse, and the kinetics of the drugs available. These principles, however, can be applied to other disorders as and when other pharmacological approaches become refined in these areas.

### Targeting disrupted networks in schizophrenia: can muscarinic drugs make a fundamental difference? [^1147GjSr]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

It is clear that xanomeline has high affinity for all muscarinic receptors (M1–M5), and the affinity is similar for all. Thus, xanomeline will clearly act at central M2, M3 and M5 receptors as well as M1 and M4; it is just not clear whether the interaction is as an antagonist or as a weak (or strong) partial agonist. Some in vitro functional systems (transfected cells) have very high receptor reserve and facilitate the demonstration of partial agonist activity. Indeed, in vitro, xanomeline appears as a partial to full agonist at all muscarinic receptors (M1–M5;).

Partial agonist activity at M1 and M4 receptors has been observed in CNS tissue, in rodent frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. Effects on striatal dopamine release originally interpreted as M1 agonist actions may, in the light of current knowledge, be more plausibly explained by M5 agonist actions. The level of partial agonist activity that might exist at the other muscarinic receptors appears not to have been systematically investigated and remains unclear. However, in addition to M1/M4 (and possibly M5) receptor partial agonist actions, xanomeline shows partial agonist at 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A serotonin receptors, and this is seen both in vitro and in brain (cortex and hippocampus) tissue. As the potency of these serotonergic effects is equivalent to the muscarinic receptor potency, these actions are likely to form a part of the clinical picture of xanomeline.

Xanomeline does show some very weak affinity for D2 dopamine receptors, but it is probably sufficiently weak not to be relevant at therapeutic doses.

The profile of partial agonist activity at M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors, and at 5-HT1A receptors, corresponds quite closely to the pharmacological profile of clozapine. Clozapine shares high affinity for all muscarinic receptors, with partial agonist activity, at least in vitro, in each case, combined with partial agonist activity at 5-HT1A receptors. There are some differences: apart from clozapine's significant D2 dopamine receptor activity, clozapine is an antagonist rather than a partial agonist at 5-HT2A receptors, and also has inverse agonist activity at 5-HT7 receptors (where xanomeline has affinity, but unknown efficacy);). Clozapine also has a number of other actions as well, for example, at histamine H1 receptors.

### Derepression may masquerade as activation in ligand-gated ion channels [^114nMquR]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

An enduring goal is to understand how agonists activate their receptors. For ligand-gated, or 'agonist-activated', ion channels, such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), agonist binding culminates in activation/opening of an intrinsic ion-conducting pore. Early models postulated that agonists are effective at opening the channel because they have a higher affinity for the open state than the closed state, and thus their binding shifts the equilibrium towards the open state. In a landmark study, del Castillo and Katz proposed that agonism could be explained by a two-step process, where the agonist first binds to an inactive receptor, that then isomerises to an active/open conformation. Within this framework, the ability of a given agonist to catalyse the isomerization step, and open the channel, was encoded in the chemical structure of the agonist, as well as its interactions with the receptor-binding site. Full vs. partial agonists differed in their ability to catalyse the isomerization step, with full agonists being more effective than partial agonists.

The advent of the patch clamp technique and the development of single-channel analysis methods have made detailed investigations of the activation mechanism possible –. Early single-channel experiments were consistent with del Castillo and Katz's two-step mechanism, however, to account for the two agonist sites on the AChR, the original scheme had to be extended to include two agonist-binding steps instead of one. The emerging single-channel data also revealed additional complexity, including a class of brief closings, originally called ' nachschlag shuttings', which interrupted bursts of agonist-activated openings. In some cases, the duration of these closings appeared to be agonist-independent, necessitating the introduction of an additional closed state in a more intricate scheme. These observations, combined with studies of the related glycine receptorand continued technical improvements, ultimately led to more elaborate mechanisms that incorporated intermediate closed states, termed 'flipped' or 'primed', which preceded channel opening. These findings placed the origins of agonism before channel opening in the overall activation process, and demonstrated that the ultimate opening and closing rates of the AChR were independent of the agonist used to elicit them; a somewhat counterintuitive finding for a channel 'activated' by agonist.

### Functionally selective signaling and broad metabolic benefits by novel insulin receptor partial agonists [^113mpuPy]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

It has been well-documented in the GPCR field that the degree of partial agonism for a given partial agonist ligand is additionally modulated by the cellular density of its receptor, i.e. a full agonist has the same maximum effect (at saturating concentrations) in cells having different receptor expression while a partial agonist induced smaller maximum effect in low expressing cells relative to cells having high receptor expression. This unique property of a GPCR partial agonism forms the basis for an effective approach when differential tissue action is desirable for pharmacological targeting. Accordingly, we postulated that the attenuated action of an IRPA observed in skeletal muscle could be due to lower IR expression in muscle. Higher liver than muscle IR expression has been documentedincluding in our own studies. To formally evaluate the dependency of IRPA partial agonism level on IR expression, two CHO cell lines were generated that expressed different levels of hIR (by 60% based on IR in the membrane fraction) and though both lines reached a same maximal pAkt activation upon RHI stimulation, IRPA-1 treatment yielded higher maximal activity in the higher IR-expressing CHO cells (51% and 31% for IR high and IR low cells, respectively; Fig. 3i). These results provide one plausible factor underlying a stronger liver relative to muscle action for IRPA. Thus, analogous to GPCR partial agonists, IRPAs possess an intrinsic property to exploits physiological differences in IR expression of different tissues and thereby shape an in vivo pharmacology profile that manifests tissue selectivity.

### Structure-guided design of partial agonists at an opioid receptor [^115GoWdo]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study focusing on δOR, we employed a structure-based approach to design partial agonists by simultaneously targeting the orthosteric site and the sodium-binding pocket. This bitopic approach allows us to modulate signaling efficacy at G-proteins as well as β-arrestins to develop safer pharmacological options for the treatment of chronic pain.

Chronic pain poses a significant and complex health challenge, necessitating the development of safe and effective analgesics that avoid the adverse effects and addictive potential of conventional opioids. While µOR agonists have demonstrated effectiveness for acute pain, they are accompanied by severe side effects and abuse liabilities. In contrast, δOR agonists have shown promise in rodent models of chronic pain and generally lack the undesired effects of µOR agonists, including respiratory depression, addiction or constipation. Therefore, they hold significant promise as targets for pain-relieving therapies in the treatment of neuropathic and inflammatory pain, conditions that currently lack effective treatment options. However, the major limitation to δOR agonist development in the past has been that selective ligands such as SNC80 and SNC162 have produced convulsions, rendering them unsuitable for clinical use.

Recently, two competing theories have been proposed to explain why certain drugs have beneficial pharmacological profiles: biased signaling and low efficacy signaling –. Biased signaling, where a ligand can activate specific signaling pathways or cellular responses through a receptor while not fully activating all possible pathways, has been proposed as a method to achieve safe therapeutics by fine-tuning the pharmacological effects. However, achieving biased signaling poses a challenge as it requires a deep understanding of the receptor's molecular mechanisms and the ligand's interaction with it. Low-efficacy signaling, on the other hand, refers to the partial agonist's reduced ability to activate a receptor compared to a full agonist. Developing partial agonists with the right balance of efficacy necessitates finding a pharmacological "sweet spot", where the ligand provides therapeutic benefits while avoiding overstimulation or inadequate activation of the receptor.

### Benefit-risk analysis of buprenorphine for pain management [^116hVAsX]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Mechanism of Action of Buprenorphine at Opioid and NOP Receptors. At µ-opioid receptors, buprenorphine is a partial agonist with very high binding affinity, which results in potent analgesia, contributes to a ceiling effect on respiratory depression and euphoria, and reduces other adverse events commonly observed with opioid use owing to unique phosphorylation and signaling activity. Buprenorphine has antagonistic activity with high binding affinity at κ- and δ-opioid receptors, which may limit constipation, respiratory depression, dysphoria, and substance abuse. The agonistic activity and low binding affinity at the NOP receptor contribute to spinal analgesia and may limit the substance abuse potential and tolerance commonly observed with full µ-opioid receptor agonists.

Conventional opioids bind to µ-opioid receptors, which activate signaling pathways that depress neural functions and are associated with adverse events. However, the partial agonistic effects of buprenorphine limit µ-opioid receptor activity, which elicits analgesia pathways but may restrict pathways associated with adverse events, contributing to a more favorable safety profile and patient satisfaction.

Buprenorphine is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for acute pain, chronic pain, opioid use disorder, or opioid dependence, depending on the formulation (Table 1). Buprenorphine formulations exist as either a combination therapy with naloxone (eg, Suboxone and similar products) or as stand-alone products. The stand-alone buprenorphine products and their indications are listed in Table 1. Buprenorphine also exists as a suppository, but this formulation is not FDA-approved for use in the US.

Table 1
Buprenorphine Products

The purpose of this review is to present the literature assessing the efficacy of buprenorphine products for the treatment of pain and compare the risks and benefits of buprenorphine to conventional opioids. The information presented here can be used to aid health care professionals in medication selection for patients who are experiencing pain and for whom opioid treatment is deemed appropriate.

### Single-molecule analysis of ligand efficacy in β AR-G-protein activation [^111mz9uL]. Nature (2017). Excellent credibility.

G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated signal transduction is central to human physiology and disease intervention, yet the molecular mechanisms responsible for ligand-dependent signalling responses remain poorly understood. In class A GPCRs, receptor activation and G-protein coupling entail outward movements of transmembrane helix 6 (TM6). Here, using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging, we examine TM6 movements in the β 2 adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR) upon exposure to orthosteric ligands with different efficacies, in the absence and presence of the G s heterotrimer. We show that partial and full agonists differentially affect TM6 motions to regulate the rate at which GDP-bound β 2 AR-G s complexes are formed and the efficiency of nucleotide exchange leading to G s activation. These data also reveal transient nucleotide-bound β 2 AR-G s species that are distinct from known structures, and provide single-molecule perspectives on the allosteric link between ligand- and nucleotide-binding pockets that shed new light on the G-protein activation mechanism.

### Understanding buprenorphine for use in chronic pain: expert opinion [^116Sy1fZ]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

An expert panel with preclinical and clinical experience in the use of buprenorphine for chronic pain convened to identify and clarify misinterpretations surrounding buprenorphine and provide clinical recommendations. The overall consensus of this panel was that, in some patients, buprenorphine is an effective and well-tolerated tool in the management of chronic pain; thus, recommendations are provided regarding the definition of a partial agonist, the appropriate use of Schedule III vs Schedule II opioids, and conversion strategies for transitioning from a full µ -opioid receptor agonist to buprenorphine.

The panel identified a prominent misconception regarding the efficacy of buprenorphine on the basis of its in vitro classification as a partial µ -opioid receptor agonist. The panel agreed that for buprenorphine the term partial agonist should not be translated as "partial efficacy". However, further study of the multimechanistic effects of buprenorphine on opioid receptors and how these effects relate to the unique clinical properties of the molecule is warranted.

Buprenorphine may have safety advantages compared with full µ -opioid receptor agonists. Thus, it is recommended that buprenorphine be considered before Schedule II and perhaps Schedule IV opioids in patients with chronic pain and a favorable risk/benefit ratio for the drug on the basis of abuse potential, tolerability, and other factors. The risk/benefit ratio should also be assessed when considering converting a patient from a full µ -opioid receptor agonist to buprenorphine.

In most patients receiving transdermal or buccal buprenorphine who are undergoing a surgical procedure or who have sustained traumatic injuries, buprenorphine should be continued in the perioperative/trauma period. In these scenarios, a short-acting full µ -opioid receptor agonist with high binding affinity, such as fentanyl, hydromorphone, or sufentanil, or IV buprenorphine can be used in the short term in addition to the previously established buprenorphine regimen. Additional research is recommended on the use of buprenorphine in acute pain management in the postoperative period, in patients with a dual diagnosis of pain and depression, and in combination with full µ -opioid receptor agonists to potentially mitigate tolerance and hyperalgesia.

### A structural mechanism for directing corepressor-selective inverse agonism of PPAR γ [^112zs479]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The structural mechanisms affording PPARγ activation are well understood. Agonists stabilize an active state of the AF-2 surface by forming hydrogen bonds with residues near helix 12. Full agonists form a critical hydrogen bond with the side chain of Y473 on helix 12 to strengthen coactivator/weaken corepressor binding affinities, inducing transcriptional activation. Partial agonists generally do not hydrogen bond to Y473, but mildly stabilize helix 12 via interactions with other regions of the ligand-binding pocket, resulting in less pronounced changes in coregulator affinity and transcriptional activation –. Partial agonism can also be elicited by ligands that hydrogen bond to Y473 but make unfavorable contacts to nearby residues such as Q286 on helix 3 or other nearby regions. Antagonists, which make unfavorable interactions with F282 on helix 3, do not stabilize helix 12 and display negligible changes in activation. These findings have established the structural mechanisms for eliciting robust (agonist), weak (partial agonist), or no (antagonist) transcriptional activation of PPARγ. An inverse agonist could display a profile opposite of an agonist, increasing the binding affinity of corepressors and decreasing the binding affinity of coactivators, or weaken the affinity for coactivators or coregulators, resulting in transcriptional repression. However, relatively few studies have explored the structural mechanisms by which ligands repress PPARγ transcription, and it remains poorly understood how to design inverse agonists.

### Functionally selective signaling and broad metabolic benefits by novel insulin receptor partial agonists [^114s91nE]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

IRPAs exhibit improved therapeutic index in glucose lowering in rodent

Broadly, the therapeutic index (TI) for a medication is regarded as that increment of dose above a fully efficacious dose that can be safely tolerated before dose-related adverse effects ensue, and for insulin the TI is generally framed with respect to induction of insulin-induced hypoglycemia and it is notoriously narrow. When IRPA-3 was administered to C57BL/6 mice to lower glucose, the initial increases of dose increased efficacy (Fig. 5a; 60 vs. 120 nmol/kg), however, as the dose was further increased, little or no further increase of glucose lowering was detected (Fig. 5a; 300–900 nmol/kg). Interestingly, during this upward dose titration study, the plateauing of maximal glucose lowering hovered above the hypoglycemic threshold, denoting a widening of TI. Strikingly, this plateau of glycemia held as the circulating IRPA-3 level increased more than 20-fold (120 vs. 900 nmol/kg doses) (Fig. 5b). A similar amplitude of dose escalation of RHI is not possible without driving animals to severe hypoglycemia and even death. The leveling off in glucose reduction regardless of dose escalation as blood glucose approaches normoglycemia denotes an improved TI for IRPA relative to conventional insulins and appears to be a phenomenon unique to partial agonist dimers since insulin dimers with full agonist activities do not have this characteristic (Fig. S 7a–f). This apparent reduction in action at higher doses of IRPAs is not due to an emergent loss of intrinsic efficacy but rather suggests a plateau of its action and perhaps some manner of dependence upon the hyperglycemic condition for its action. Regarding this last point, doses of IRPA-1 which were essentially inactive to reduce normal levels of fasting glucose in non-diabetic mice, demonstrated potent glycemic efficacy in diabetic animals (Fig. S 7a–c).

### Illumination of a progressive allosteric mechanism mediating the glycine receptor activation [^112mB7yb]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Pentameric ligand-gated ion channel mediate signal transduction at chemical synapses by transiting between resting and open states upon neurotransmitter binding. Here, we investigate the gating mechanism of the glycine receptor fluorescently labeled at the extracellular-transmembrane interface by voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF). Fluorescence reports a glycine-elicited conformational change that precedes pore opening. Low concentrations of glycine, partial agonists or specific mixtures of glycine and strychnine trigger the full fluorescence signal while weakly activating the channel. Molecular dynamic simulations of a partial agonist bound-closed Cryo-EM structure show a highly dynamic nature: a marked structural flexibility at both the extracellular-transmembrane interface and the orthosteric site, generating docking properties that recapitulate VCF data. This work illuminates a progressive propagating transition towards channel opening, highlighting structural plasticity within the mechanism of action of allosteric effectors.

### Structures of β-adrenergic receptor in complex with Gs and ligands of different efficacies [^117TPLtF]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In this work, we use structural, computational, cellular and biochemical approaches to understand the mechanisms of activation of G-proteins by β 1 -adrenergic receptor (β 1 -AR) after bound with ligands of different efficacies. We determine the cryo-EM structures of β 1 -AR and heterotrimeric Gs (Gα s Gβ 1 Gγ 2) in complex with a partial agonist (dobutamine), or a very weak partial agonist (cyanopindolol; also called an antagonist). We then compare these cryo-EM structures with our previously determined cryo-EM structure of β 1 -AR and Gs in complex with a full agonist (isoproterenol). This provides the opportunity to compare and contrast the interactions between the same GPCR and the G-protein in the presence of a full agonist, a partial agonist, and a very weak partial agonist. The comparison surprisingly reveals that the overall structures of the three different complexes are similar, with local conformational differences mainly in the ligand-binding pockets. Furthermore, we examine the activation of Gs by β 1 -AR in cells after stimulation by these three ligands. We generate mutations in the residues on β 1 -AR that interact with the ligands or Gs. These mutations impair the cellular signaling from β 1 -AR to the downstream cAMP response initiated by the three different ligands, with residue-specific differences. Moreover, we investigate the stability of the intermediate state complex of the nucleotide-exchange process (i.e. the ligand–β 1 -AR–nucleotide-free Gs complex). We find that, when bound with a full agonist, the β 1 -AR–Gs (nucleotide-free) intermediate state is more stable than the intermediate states bound with a partial agonist. All-atom simulations using a robust Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) method, support these structural and biochemical findings. Together, these data provide insights into the activation of G-proteins by GPCRs after bound with ligands of different efficacies.

### Molecular tuning of farnesoid X receptor partial agonism [^111pgoeL]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

NRs share a common architecture of an N-terminal ligand-independent activation domain followed by a DNA-binding domain (DBD), a flexible hinge region and a ligand-binding domain composed of twelve α-helices (α1-α12). Especially the C-terminal α12, the so-called activation function 2 (AF-2) of the LBD, has been identified as crucial for NR activation since stabilisation of α12 and concomitant binding to the core of the LBD provides a surface for co-activator binding.

Previous studies have already evaluated general molecular mechanisms of NR activation. Observations in early co-crystal structures of NR-LBDs revealing differences in the position of α12 for liganded and unliganded (apo) states, have established the common model of a mouse-trap mechanism for NR activation where α12 was thought to be positioned away from the core LBD in apo-state. Agonist binding would then alter its position to be bound to the core LBD. Later studies (reviewed in) have used various techniques to revise this model and have suggested that the terminal LBD region is dynamic in apo-state and that α12 is only formed upon agonist binding. This contradicted the model of two (active and inactive) positions of a permanently stable α12 and already indicates that more than a single active conformation of NR-LBDs may exist.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^112sM1fm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Varenicline mechanism and comparative effectiveness for smoking cessation — Varenicline is a partial agonist at the α4β2 nicotinic cholinergic receptor that mediates brain dopamine release and is believed to be the primary mediator of nicotine addiction. As a partial agonist, varenicline activates the nicotine receptor, producing about 50% of the maximal effects at this receptor and thereby reducing the intensity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms, while binding tightly to the nicotine receptor prevents receptor binding by nicotine from cigarette smoke and reduces the rewarding effects of smoking. Varenicline is proven to be more effective in promoting smoking cessation than single NRT or bupropion in several clinical trials; the largest was the EAGLES randomized controlled trial, which included over 8,000 smokers and compared varenicline, bupropion, nicotine patch, and placebo given for 12 weeks along with brief counseling.

### Gs-versus golf-dependent functional selectivity mediated by the dopamine dreceptor [^117SPZ4p]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

In summary, the current study provides the first example of a D1R agonist, DHX, that acts as a full agonist with Gs- and a partial agonist with Golf-dependent signaling. Consequently, DHX behaves as a low efficacy striatal D1R agonist but as a full D1R agonist in the cortex. This therefore provides a rationale for the use of DHX, or related compounds, in neuropsychiatric disorders with cognitive deficits, which could benefit from selective targeting of cortical D1R. Specifically, pharmacological enhancement D1R activity is being considered as a highly promising therapeutic mechanism for the amelioration of schizophrenia-spectrum cognitive deficits. Indeed, recent findings suggest that DHX can be potentially effective for the treatment of schizophrenia-spectrum working memory impairments. The pharmacological characterization presented here, in combination with structure-activity relationship analysis, may lead to the development of compounds that can differentially affect D1R function in different brain regions.

### Efficacy of the β ₂-adrenergic receptor is determined by conformational equilibrium in the transmembrane region [^1164QRT7]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Two mechanisms have been proposed for the partial efficacies in the partial agonist-bound states: the equilibrium between the active and inactive states, and the distinct conformation of the partial agonist-bound state from those of both the active and inactive states, although there have been no experimental evidence for them. The chemical shifts of the M82 2.53 resonances in the efficacy-dependent and the temperature-dependent manner in the partial agonist-bound states suggest the equilibrium between the active and inactive states.

The M82 D resonance was observed only in the inverse agonist- and neutral antagonist-bound states, and the intensity of the M82 D resonance is higher in the inverse agonist-bound state than in the neutral antagonist state. In addition, the 13 C chemical shifts of M82 U and M82 D suggest that the M82 U conformation flexibly adopts both the trans and gauche conformations, whereas the M82 D conformation mainly adopts the trans conformation (Supplementary Discussion); therefore, the M82 D conformation may be more rigid than the M82 U conformation. It is thus tempting to speculate that the M82 D conformation is more refractory to shifting to the activated state than the M82 U conformation, and the higher population of the M82 D conformation in the inverse agonist-bound state causes the inhibition of the basal activity.

The resonances from M215 5.54 and M279 6.41, which are located on the cytoplasmic side of the TM region, were not observed in the formoterol-bound state, suggesting that these signals were broadened due to the conformational exchange between the multiple conformations in the formoterol-bound state. The multiple conformations on the cytoplasmic side of the TM region in the full agonist-bound state may be effective for interacting with various effectors in the conformational selection manners. A number of β 2 AR ligands have been shown to impart differing degrees of signalling in G-protein and arrestin pathways, a phenomenon called 'functional selectivity' or 'biased signalling'. The biased signalling is important for both understanding the functions of GPCRs and drug development, and it is quite interesting to investigate the conformations of β 2 AR in the biased ligand-bound states. Although biased signalling was not reported for the ligands chosen in this study, the biased signalling may be due to the diversity of the conformational dynamics in the cytoplasmic side of the TM region in each ligand-bound state.

### The place of partial agonism in psychiatry: recent developments [^113f6meJ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2005). Low credibility.

Drugs used to treat psychiatric disorders, although effective, are often restricted by adverse events. The use of partial agonists for treating hypertension was found to limit some of the side-effects in some patients. This led to the investigation of partial agonists as a treatment modality in psychiatric disorders. Partial agonists have a lower intrinsic efficacy than full agonists leading to reduced maximum response. They can act as antagonists by competing for receptor binding with full agonists. The level of activity depends on the level of endogenous receptor activity. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor, is used to treat patients with addiction and decreases the symptoms of withdrawal and risks of overdose and intoxication. The anxiolytic buspirone shows partial agonism at 5-HT(1A) receptors, and this seems to provide anxioselective effects, without inducing extrapyramidal side-effects, convulsions, tolerance or withdrawal reactions. In schizophrenia, partial dopamine agonism results in antagonistic effects at sites activated by high concentrations of dopamine and agonistic effects at sites activated by low concentrations of dopamine. This stabilizes the dopamine system to effect antipsychotic action without inducing adverse motor or hormonal events. Aripiprazole is the first 'dopamine system stabilizer', and the data are promising, with efficacy at least equivalent to that with current atypical antipsychotics but fewer of the troublesome side-effects. Partial agonists seem to provide a way to fine-tune the treatment of psychiatric disorders by maximizing the treatment effect while minimizing undesirable adverse events.

### Effects of isoflurane on gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors activated by full and partial agonists [^112Y1qc8]. Anesthesiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Volatile anesthetics prolong inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in central neurons an allosteric action on the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor, an effect that may underlie the hypnotic actions of these agents. Inhaled anesthetics such as isoflurane act to enhance responses to submaximal concentrations of GABA, but it is not clear whether their effect is mediated by an increase in the binding of the agonist or by changes in receptor gating behavior. To address this question, the authors studied the effects of isoflurane on a mutant GABA(A) receptor with a gating defect that decreases receptor sensitivity by lowering agonist efficacy. They then compared the effects of clinically relevant concentrations of isoflurane on the actions of GABA and piperidine-4-sulfonic acid (P4S), a partial agonist at the GABA(A) receptor.

Methods

The authors created a mutant of the GABA receptor alpha subunit (L277A) by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant subunit was coexpressed with beta(2) and gamma(2S) subunits in HEK293 cells, and responses to GABA and P4S were recorded using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. EC values were determined for the full agonist GABA and the partial agonist P4S. The authors also determined the relative efficacy (epsilon) of P4S. These measurements were then repeated in the presence of isoflurane.

Results

The concentration-response curve for GABA was shifted to the right (EC₅₀ = 278 microm) in the alpha(1)(L277A)beta(2)gamma(2S) mutant receptor, compared with the corresponding wild-type alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) GABA(A) receptor (EC₅₀ = 16 microm). P4S is a partial agonist at both receptors, with a dramatically decreased relative efficacy at the mutant receptor (epsilon = 0.24). When the mutant receptor was studied in the presence of isoflurane, the concentration-response curves for both GABA and P4S were shifted to the left (EC₅₀ for GABA = 78 microm); the efficacy of P4S also increased significantly (epsilon = 0.40).

Conclusion

By studying a mutant GABA receptor with impaired gating, the authors were able to demonstrate clearly that isoflurane can increase the efficacy of a partial agonist, as well as increase agonist potency. These data suggest that the volatile anesthetic isoflurane exerts at least some of its effects on the GABA(A) receptor via alterations in gating rather than simply changing binding or unbinding of the agonist.

### Functionally selective signaling and broad metabolic benefits by novel insulin receptor partial agonists [^113EoDuz]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Selected insulin dimers function as IR partial agonists and induce biased signaling

A series of IRPA molecules were generated to explore structure-function relationships within IRPA and with differing degrees of partial agonism, nine of these compounds were used in the current studies and their respective structures, potency, and degree of partial agonism are presented in Table 1. Compounds with similar functionality were used interchangeably in preclinical studies, an approach that serves to confirm class-specific properties rather than a compound-specific idiosyncratic effect. In general, IRPA molecules with higher potency and higher partial agonism were used in rodent studies due to the species' relative insulin resistance. IRPA-1 is a novel insulin covalent dimer analog conjugated with a B29-B'29 linkage (see structure in Fig. S 1a), shown to bind to the human insulin receptor isoform b (hIRb; table insert in Fig. 1a). IRPA-1 functions as a hIRb partial agonist when tested in CHO-hIRb cells and measuring IR-mediated phosphorylation of Akt (pAkt; Fig. 1a). Unless otherwise indicated, partial agonism is expressed as percentage of the maximum pAkt activity induced by RHI, this is due to the robustness of this assay and higher numerical values obtained as compared to IR phosphorylation (pIR). In this report, higher partial agonism denotes agonism that more closely approaches full agonism (i.e. a higher ratio for pAkt IRPA to pAkt RHI), and the converse applies to lower partial agonism. That IRPA-1 behaves as a characteristic receptor partial agonist is illustrated by the attenuated maximum pAkt level when titrated alone (green line, Fig. 1a) and by its ability, at a high concentration of IRPA-1, to attenuate the action of RHI when combined (blue line, Fig. 1a; green and blue lines converge at high IRPA concentration). At low RHI exposure, IRPA-1 demonstrated additive activity but a partial antagonizing action with RHI at a high concentration, as determined when RHI was titrated upward in the presence of a fixed level of IRPA-1 (Fig. 1b). In contrast, a weak IR agonist (such as proinsulin) has a different profile from that of IRPA, revealing itself as a weak but full agonist and with a lack of antagonist activities under these conditions (Fig. S 1b). In addition to partial agonist activity towards hIR, IRPA-1 demonstrated this property with IR of other species, including pig and dog (Fig. S 1c, d). This cross-species similarity in partial agonism is also true in primary cells, e.g. differentiated human myotubes (Fig. 1c) and freshly isolated mouse hepatocytes (Fig. 1d). The partial agonism function was clearly structure based as a change of conjugation site (discussed below) or subtle modifications of the linker yielded changes in the level of partial agonism. For example, IRPA-2 compared to IRPA-1, the former without urea capping groups at the A1 and B1 positions (see Table 1 and Fig S 1a for structural details), induced higher partial agonism (Fig. 1c, d and Fig. S 1c, d). Another aspect of the IRPA compounds relative to RHI was a reduced maximum ligand-induced IR internalization. IRPA-1 has minimal activity to stimulate IR-internalization while IRPA-2 showed ~20% maximal activity in this assay (Fig. 1e).

### Benefit-risk analysis of buprenorphine for pain management [^1135o7DT]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Opioids can be divided into conventional opioids (full µ-opioid receptor agonists such as fentanyl, hydrocodone, morphine, oxycodone)and mixed-action or atypical opioids (such as buprenorphine, butorphanol, tramadol, tapentadol). When compared with other opioids currently on the market, the atypical opioid buprenorphine has a unique pharmacologic profile.

Buprenorphine is a partial agonist with very high binding affinity at µ-opioid receptors, an agonist with low binding affinity at the nociceptin opioid receptor (NOP, formerly known as opioid receptor like-1), and an antagonist with high binding affinity at κ- and δ-opioid receptors (Figure 1). The term "partial agonist" was applied owing to a partial effect on stimulating the receptor with in vitro assays. This does not necessarily translate to partial analgesic efficacy in vivo or in clinical practice, as the analgesic signaling pathway may be sufficiently activated by a partial agonist. Partial agonism at the µ-opioid receptor by buprenorphine yields potent analgesia and a ceiling effect on respiratory depression and euphoria and reduces other adverse events commonly observed with conventional opioid use. Buprenorphine does not occupy all µ-opioid receptors, which allows for efficacy of concomitant full µ-opioid receptor agonists. Antagonism at the δ- and κ-opioid receptors may limit constipation, respiratory depression, dysphoria, and substance abuse. Kappa-opioid receptor antagonists are currently being considered as promising therapeutics for psychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders. Agonism at NOP contributes to spinal analgesia and may limit the potential for substance abuse and tolerance commonly observed with full µ-opioid receptor agonists.

### Effect of TAAR1 / 5-HTagonist SEP-363856 on REM sleep in humans [^113mcRRv]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Earlier work has shown that agonism at TAAR1 and 5-HT 1A receptors contributes to the mechanism of action of SEP-363856. Consequently, the effects of SEP-363856 on REM sleep are in line with prior reports of REM suppression following treatment with selective TAAR1 agonists in mice, rats, and nonhuman primates. Although more robust effects on REM suppression were reported with partial (versus a full) TAAR1 agonist in rodents, additional studies with full agonists are needed to better understand these discrepancies. TAAR1 partial agonists also promote wakefulness and reduced NREM sleep. SEP-363856, which is a full agonist at TAAR1, has been shown to increase cumulative wake time in rats without altering cumulative NREM sleep. In contrast, no changes in total sleep time, and an increase in NREM stages 2 and 3 were observed in healthy male subjects in the current study. Given that polyphasic sleep/wake cycles in rodents compared to the consolidated sleep periods in humans, differences in certain sleep EEG measures are to be expected across species. Interestingly, TAAR1 agonists reduced cataplexy in two mouse models of narcolepsy, a sleep disorder characterized by excessive sleepiness and REM sleep abnormalities. Although these represent promising results, future clinical trials are required to determine the utility of TAAR1 agonists in the treatment of narcolepsy. In addition to TAAR1 agonism, activation of 5-HT 1A receptors likely also contributes to SEP-363856's effects on sleep EEG. Several studies have reported REM suppression with 5-HT 1A agonists in healthy human subjects –. The 5-HT 1A receptor agonist eptapirone has been shown to increase wake time and sleep onset latency, with greater effects when administered in the morning compared to nighttime, while its REM suppression effects were only observed with nighttime administration. In the current study, SEP-363856 was administered at nighttime which may have contributed to its REM-suppressing effect while minimizing the potential for 5-HT 1A -mediated wake-promoting effects. In addition, Seifritz and colleaguesobserved enhanced EEG slow-wave sleep (defined as NREM stages 3/4) upon administration of low doses of the 5-HT 1A agonist ipsapirone in humans. However, opposite, or mixed results of 5-HT 1A agonist effects on NREM sleep are reported in other clinical and preclinical studies. The increase in NREM sleep (stage 2 and 3) observed at 50 mg SEP-363856 could partially be modulated by 5-HT 1A receptors and potentially reflects a compensatory shift in sleep stages in response to the robust REM suppression. Slow-wave sleep is involved in the overnight consolidation of declarative memories and has been suggested to facilitate several cognitive processes –. Thus, treatments that enhance slow-wave sleep could have significant therapeutic implications.

### Structural basis for telmisartan-mediated partial activation of PPAR gamma [^112AFYng]. Hypertension Research (2012). Low credibility.

Telmisartan, a selective angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, has recently been shown to act as a partial agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). To understand how telmisartan partially activates PPARγ, we determined the ternary complex structure of PPARγ, telmisartan, and a coactivator peptide from steroid receptor coactivator-1 at a resolution of 2.18Å. Crystallographic analysis revealed that telmisartan exhibits an unexpected binding mode in which the central benzimidazole ring is engaged in a non-canonical — and suboptimal — hydrogen-bonding network around helix 12 (H12). This network differs greatly from that observed when full-agonists bind with PPARγ and prompt high-coactivator recruitment through H12 stabilized by multiple hydrogen bonds. Binding with telmisartan results in a less stable H12 that in turn leads to attenuated coactivator binding, thus explaining the mechanism of partial activation.

### What place is there for tramadol / dexketoprofen? [^112V9CGo]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

No single analgesic provides effective pain relief in all patients and increasing the dose of an analgesic may increase its unwanted effects.1 In addition, pain frequently results from multiple mechanisms that may respond to different pharmacological interventions.2 One suggested approach is to combine analgesics with different modes of action, with the aim of delivering better analgesia using lower doses of each drug.1 Skudexa (A. Menarini Farmaceutica Internazionale SRL), a combination of tramadol hydrochloride (a synthetic opioid analgesic that is a partial agonist at the μ, δ and κ opioid receptors) and dexketoprofen (a NSAID), is licensed for short term treatment of moderate to severe acute pain in adults.1–4 Here, we consider the evidence for this product and how it fits with current guidance on the management of pain.

### Structural mechanism of CBR binding to peripheral and biased inverse agonists [^116K922D]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Ligand bias towards particular effector signaling cascades is an increasingly sought-after property in GPCR drug discovery, as functional selectivity for modulating G protein or arrestin signaling pathways can lead to a better therapeutic window and improved side-effect profile for a drug. Biased GPCR agonists induce conformational changes of intracellular epitopes that diverge in promoting interactions with G proteins versus arrestins. On the other hand, biased inverse agonists promote a conformational ensemble with an inaccessible effector binding site, albeit accomplishing this differentially for G proteins versus arrestins. In receptor theory, the propagation of orthosteric ligand binding into effector activation or inhibition can be quantified by an intrinsic efficacy parameter, with positive values for agonists and negative values for inverse agonists. The intrinsic efficacy of an inverse agonist can be different for different effectors, contributing to a shifted inhibition dose-response curve for G protein signaling relative to arrestin signaling.

### Does in vitro potency predict clinically efficacious concentrations? [^113RqKBg]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Based on the aforementioned, we surmise that the biological variation between therapeutic unbound exposure levels relative to in vitro potency predominantly originates from:
Substantial variability in the observed in vivo potency vs. in vitro drug affinity owing to the impact of in vivo target kinetics. For example, recent work by Gabrielsson et al. 31 quotes data excerpted from six literature studies. Recalculating in vivo EC₅₀ –to– in vitro K_d ([k_off/k_on]) Ratios from these studies results in ranges from 0.22 to 66, thus a factor of 300‐fold difference in turnover rates among the targets in question. While these examples were large molecule (antibody) targets, similar findings have been reported also for small molecules. In particular, agents with targets in the circulation compartment and/or that have slow target dissociation rates k_off are expected to show in vivo potencies highly dependent upon the corresponding target turnover rate ([k_deg/k_on], where k_deg is target degradation rate, see Gabrielsson et al. 31
Differences in the level of in vivo target occupancy required for clinical efficacy across targets, dependent both upon the level of endogenous tone at the target, drug mechanism of action (e.g. GPCR agonist vs. antagonist), and target amplification properties (receptor reserve; see further studies, e.g. Grimwood & Hartig, 2009 3). For example, a high efficacy agonist drug at the dopamine D2 receptor may elicit a near‐maximal receptor response already at receptor occupancies < 10–20%, whereas 70–80% receptor occupancy by antagonists at the same target is typically required for therapeutic efficacy in schizophrenia. It follows that marked differences in plasma concentrations are to be expected, depending on what level of receptor occupancy may be required for beneficial effects in vivo, even for the very same target site. The difference between 20 to 80% receptor occupancy usually corresponds to at least a 10‐fold difference in drug exposure. A possible corollary is that the curve for GPCR agonists would be shifted ~ threefold to the right had in vitro EC₁₀ or EC₂₀ rather than EC₅₀ been used for C u, ss / in vitro potency calculations in this class. Conversely, the curve for GPCR antagonist agents would be shifted ~ threefold leftward had the in vitro EC₇₀ or EC₈₀ rather than EC₅₀ been used in the same manner.
Factors related to the experimental model used to determine in vitro potency (e.g. assay conditions, target binding, or functional type of assay). For example, the 10 th and 90 th percentile factors were 0.31 and 3.3 of the geometric mean value when there were multiple in vitro potency values available for the same drug in our database; that is, roughly a 10‐fold range.

### Understanding buprenorphine for use in chronic pain: expert opinion [^114MXvtY]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In some clinical settings, buprenorphine had similar or greater analgesic efficacy and antihyperalgesic effects as full µ -opioid receptor agonists. Intravenous (IV) buprenorphine was as efficacious as or more efficacious than IV morphine in producing analgesia across various surgical models. The effect size, or correlation between two variables, for change in pain intensity observed in clinical trials of transdermal and buccal buprenorphine vs placebo overlapped with those of several Schedule II opioids across trials of chronic noncancer pain, suggesting similar efficacy. In addition, sublingual buprenorphine was as effective as IV morphine in managing acute renal colic pain. Therefore, the characterization of buprenorphine as a partial µ -opioid receptor agonist does not clinically equate to partial analgesic efficacy.

Although the analgesic effects of buprenorphine are well known to be mediated by the µ -opioid receptor, multimechanistic effects at other opioid receptors may also contribute to efficacy and tolerability (Figure 3A). Buprenorphine is a full agonist at the more recently identified opioid receptor-like 1 (ORL1), which may contribute to analgesia, and it is an antagonist at the δ- and κ-opioid receptors, which lessen constipation, dysphoria, and abuse potential and help reduce mental depression. In fact, buprenorphine has been shown to effectively reduce depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in patients unresponsive to conventional antidepressant medications. However, these and other complex receptor interactions require further study.

Figure 3
Efficacy and tolerability of buprenorphine compared with those of other opioids used for chronic pain. (A) Potential mechanism of action for buprenorphine and (B) conceptual representation of possible effects compared with those of Schedule II opioids such as, but not limited to, fentanyl. OR = opioid receptor; ORL1 = opioid receptor-like 1.

In response to µ -opioid receptor binding, buprenorphine has been shown to have low intrinsic signaling activity that is sufficient to reach the analgesic threshold, while exhibiting a relative ceiling effect for respiratory depression (Figure 3B). At therapeutic doses, the risk of respiratory depression appears to be lower than that of analgesic doses of full µ-opioid receptor agonists; nonetheless, there is still a risk of respiratory depression with buprenorphine, which can vary depending on the route of administration, use of concurrent medications, and presence of underlying comorbidity/disease.

### Structural basis of hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor signaling mechanisms through ligand binding [^112Dw7yS]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

HCA3 (GPR109b) exists only in hominids, including humans. Despite the high sequence similarity between HCA2 and HCA3, their endogenous ligands differ. Pharmacologic and computational analyses indicate that amino acids in the extracellular half of the transmembrane (TM) domain are responsible for the different ligand preferences. How differences in the ligand binding pockets determine ligand preference, however, is still unclear. Structural information on HCA2 and HCA3 will provide important clues for the development of subtype-selective drugs.

In this work, we determined the cryo-EM structures of human HCA2-Gi complexes bound to the HCA2-selective full agonists GSK256073 and MK6892, the partial agonist LUF6283, and the nonselective synthetic full agonist acifran to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying HCA ligand recognition and activation. For a deeper understanding of HCAs, we also analyze the structure of the human HCA3-Gi complex with acifran. These structural and mutational analyses and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation experiments reveal the molecular basis for understanding how HCA recognizes ligands and activates G proteins.

### An alternate binding site for PPAR γ ligands [^112F6TZm]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

PPARγ is a target for insulin-sensitizing drugs such as glitazones, which improve plasma glucose maintenance in patients with diabetes. Synthetic ligands have been designed to mimic endogenous ligand binding to a canonical ligand-binding pocket to hyperactivate PPARγ. Here we reveal that synthetic PPARγ ligands also bind to an alternate site, leading to unique receptor conformational changes that impact coregulator binding, transactivation and target gene expression. Using structure-function studies we show that alternate site binding occurs at pharmacologically relevant ligand concentrations, and is neither blocked by covalently bound synthetic antagonists nor by endogenous ligands indicating non-overlapping binding with the canonical pocket. Alternate site binding likely contributes to PPARγ hyperactivation in vivo, perhaps explaining why PPARγ full and partial or weak agonists display similar adverse effects. These findings expand our understanding of PPARγ activation by ligands and suggest that allosteric modulators could be designed to fine tune PPARγ activity without competing with endogenous ligands.

### Ligand efficacy shifts a nuclear receptor conformational ensemble between transcriptionally active and repressive States [^1134mTYk]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-regulated transcription factors that control gene expression in response to binding endogenous metabolites and synthetic ligands, including about 15% of FDA-approved drugs. NRs contain a modular domain architecture consisting of an N-terminal disordered activation domain, a central DNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD). A fundamental hypothesis in the NR field posits that in the absence of ligand the LBD exchanges between transcriptionally active and repressive states that can be stabilized upon ligand binding. The binding of an agonist stabilizes an LBD conformation that favors the recruitment of coactivator proteins over corepressors, resulting in transcriptional activation of gene expression. Pharmacological antagonists block ligand binding and are generally considered transcriptionally neutral, stabilizing an LBD conformation that does not significantly alter coregulator recruitment compared to the unliganded state. Inverse agonists stabilize an LBD conformation that promotes interaction with corepressor proteins over coactivators, leading to transcriptional repression of gene expression. These ligand-dependent activities, which result in distinct coregulator recruitment and transcriptional outcomes, are known as ligand bias.

Although the field has a relatively good understanding of the structural basis of agonist-induced, coactivator-selective NR functions associated with transcriptional activation, several features remain poorly understood. These include graded transcriptional activity (e.g. partial vs. full agonism), transcriptional repression (inverse agonism), and whether agonists and inverse agonists select natively populated structural conformations (conformational selection) or induce non-native conformations. X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy have provided structural insights into DNA- and coregulator-bound NR transcriptional complexes, including LBDs bound to different pharmacological ligands. However, these structural methods that capture static snapshots of functionally relevant NR complexes fail to explain features relevant to the dynamic functional LBD conformational ensemble, which are detectable by other methods such as NMR spectroscopy. Moreover, studies into the mechanisms of graded NR transcriptional repression have been hampered because most NR ligand series consist of compounds of a single pharmacological type (e.g. agonists). Less common are reports of transcriptionally repressive NR inverse agonists and compounds that span the full pharmacological spectrum, from agonism to inverse agonism, which display distinct coregulator recruitment profiles or ligand bias.

### Opioid agonist treatment for pharmaceutical opioid dependent people [^113CZek7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There are increasing concerns regarding pharmaceutical opioid harms including overdose and dependence, with an associated increase in treatment demand. People dependent on pharmaceutical opioids appear to differ in important ways from people who use heroin, yet most opioid agonist treatment research has been conducted in people who use heroin.

Objectives

To assess the effects of maintenance agonist pharmacotherapy for the treatment of pharmaceutical opioid dependence.

Search Methods

The search included the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group's Specialised Register of Trials; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2015, Issue 5); PubMed (January 1966 to May 2015); EMBASE (Ovid) (January 1974 to May 2015); CINAHL (EBSCOhost) (1982 to May 2015); ISI Web of Science (to May 2014); and PsycINFO (Ovid) (1806 to May 2014).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials examining maintenance opioid agonist treatments that made the following two comparisons:1. full opioid agonists (methadone, morphine, oxycodone, levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM), or codeine) versus different full opioid agonists or partial opioid agonists (buprenorphine) for maintenance treatment and2. full or partial opioid agonist maintenance versus placebo, detoxification only, or psychological treatment (without opioid agonist treatment).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

We identified six randomised controlled trials that met inclusion criteria (607 participants). We found moderate quality evidence from two studies of no difference between methadone and buprenorphine in self reported opioid use (risk ratio (RR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 1.63) or opioid positive urine drug tests (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.18). There was low quality evidence from three studies of no difference in retention between buprenorphine and methadone maintenance treatment (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.22). There was moderate quality evidence from two studies of no difference between methadone and buprenorphine on adverse events (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.91). We found low quality evidence from three studies favouring maintenance buprenorphine treatment over detoxification or psychological treatment in terms of fewer opioid positive urine drug tests (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.91) and self reported opioid use in the past 30 days (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.93). There was no difference on days of unsanctioned opioid use (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.31, 95% CI -0.66 to 0.04). There was moderate quality evidence favouring buprenorphine maintenance over detoxification or psychological treatment on retention in treatment (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.47). There was moderate quality evidence favouring buprenorphine maintenance over detoxification or psychological treatment on adverse events (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.57). The main weaknesses in the quality of the data was the use of open-label study designs.

Authors' Conclusions

There was low to moderate quality evidence supporting the use of maintenance agonist pharmacotherapy for pharmaceutical opioid dependence. Methadone or buprenorphine appeared equally effective. Maintenance treatment with buprenorphine appeared more effective than detoxification or psychological treatments. Due to the overall low to moderate quality of the evidence and small sample sizes, there is the possibility that the further research may change these findings.

### Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma calls for activation in moderation: lessons from genetics and pharmacology [^1169obvQ]. Endocrine Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is a prototypical member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and integrates the control of energy, lipid, and glucose homeostasis. PPARgamma can bind a variety of small lipophilic compounds derived from metabolism and nutrition. These ligands, in turn, determine cofactor recruitment to PPARgamma, regulating the transcription of genes in a variety of metabolic pathways. PPARgamma is the main target of the thiazolidinedione class of insulin-sensitizing drugs, which are currently a mainstay of therapy for type 2 diabetes. However, this therapy has a number of side effects. Here, we review the clinical consequences of PPARgamma polymorphisms in humans, as well as several studies in mice using general or tissue-specific knockout techniques. We also discuss the recent pharmacological literature describing a variety of new PPARgamma partial agonists and antagonists, as well as pan-PPAR agonists. The results of these studies have added to the understanding of PPARgamma function, allowing us to hypothesize a general mechanism of PPARgamma action and speculate on future trends in the use of PPARgamma as a target in the treatment of type II diabetes.

### Opioid agonist treatment for people who are dependent on pharmaceutical opioids [^1126ENxM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There are ongoing concerns regarding pharmaceutical opioid-related harms, including overdose and dependence, with an associated increase in treatment demand. People dependent on pharmaceutical opioids appear to differ in important ways from people who use heroin, yet most opioid agonist treatment research has been conducted in people who use heroin. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of maintenance opioid agonist pharmacotherapy for the treatment of pharmaceutical opioid dependence.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to January 2022: the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, four other databases, and two trial registers. We checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs with adults and adolescents examining maintenance opioid agonist treatments that made the following two comparisons. 1. Full opioid agonists (methadone, morphine, oxycodone, levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM), or codeine) versus different full opioid agonists or partial opioid agonists (buprenorphine) for maintenance treatment. 2. Full or partial opioid agonist maintenance versus non-opioid agonist treatments (detoxification, opioid antagonist, or psychological treatment without opioid agonist treatment).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods.

Main Results

We identified eight RCTs that met inclusion criteria (709 participants). We found four studies that compared methadone and buprenorphine maintenance treatment, and four studies that compared buprenorphine maintenance to either buprenorphine taper (in addition to psychological treatment) or a non-opioid maintenance treatment comparison. We found low-certainty evidence from three studies of a difference between methadone and buprenorphine in favour of methadone on self-reported opioid use at end of treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 0.86; 165 participants), and low-certainty evidence from four studies finding a difference in favour of methadone for retention in treatment (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.43; 379 participants). We found low-certainty evidence from three studies showing no difference between methadone and buprenorphine on substance use measured with urine drug screens at end of treatment (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.17; 206 participants), and moderate-certainty evidence from one study of no difference in days of self-reported opioid use (mean difference 1.41 days, 95% CI 3.37 lower to 0.55 days higher; 129 participants). There was low-certainty evidence from three studies of no difference between methadone and buprenorphine on adverse events (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.93; 206 participants). We found low-certainty evidence from four studies favouring maintenance buprenorphine treatment over non-opioid treatments in terms of fewer opioid positive urine drug tests at end of treatment (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.84; 270 participants), and very low-certainty evidence from four studies finding no difference on self-reported opioid use in the past 30 days at end of treatment (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.01; 276 participants). There was low-certainty evidence from three studies of no difference in the number of days of unsanctioned opioid use (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.19, 95% CI -0.47 to 0.09; 205 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence from four studies favouring buprenorphine maintenance over non-opioid treatments on retention in treatment (RR 3.02, 95% CI 1.73 to 5.27; 333 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence from three studies of no difference in adverse effects between buprenorphine maintenance and non-opioid treatments (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.07 to 3.48; 252 participants). The main weaknesses in the quality of the data was the use of open-label study designs, and difference in follow-up rates between treatment arms.

Authors' Conclusions

There is very low- to moderate-certainty evidence supporting the use of maintenance agonist pharmacotherapy for pharmaceutical opioid dependence. Methadone or buprenorphine did not differ on some outcomes, although on the outcomes of retention and self-reported substance use some results favoured methadone. Maintenance treatment with buprenorphine appears more effective than non-opioid treatments. Due to the overall very low- to moderate-certainty evidence and small sample sizes, there is the possibility that the further research may change these findings.

### Structure of the IFN γ receptor complex guides design of biased agonists [^115EzPSo]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

The cytokine interferon-γ (IFNγ) is a central coordinator of innate and adaptive immunity, but its highly pleiotropic actions have diminished its prospects for use as an immunotherapeutic agent. Here, we took a structure-based approach to decoupling IFNγ pleiotropy. We engineered an affinity-enhanced variant of the ligand-binding chain of the IFNγ receptor IFNγR1, which enabled us to determine the crystal structure of the complete hexameric (2:2:2) IFNγ-IFNγR1-IFNγR2 signalling complex at 3.25 Å resolution. The structure reveals the mechanism underlying deficits in IFNγ responsiveness in mycobacterial disease syndrome resulting from a T168N mutation in IFNγR2, which impairs assembly of the full signalling complex. The topology of the hexameric complex offers a blueprint for engineering IFNγ variants to tune IFNγ receptor signalling output. Unexpectedly, we found that several partial IFNγ agonists exhibited biased gene-expression profiles. These biased agonists retained the ability to induce upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class I antigen expression, but exhibited impaired induction of programmed death-ligand 1 expression in a wide range of human cancer cell lines, offering a route to decoupling immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive functions of IFNγ for therapeutic applications.

### Gating intermediates reveal inhibitory role of the voltage sensor in a cyclic nucleotide-modulated ion channel [^114zZ78r]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Ligand binding is the crucial energy input for conformational changes in CNG channels. We propose that the partial agonist nature of cAMP for SthK allowed us to capture on-pathway gating intermediates rather than just end states. Full agonists, like cGMP for CNGA1 channels, are very effective in stabilizing open states, which may explain why only end open states have been captured using structural methods. Conversely, partial agonists are less effective in stabilizing open states, which can result in relative stabilization of intermediate states. Our work introduces a novel way to determine structures of high energy states by employing partial agonists in combination with mutations that shift agonist efficacy.

In SthK, cAMP is a partial agonist at 0 mV. However, depolarization can increase cAMP efficacy, and gain-of-function mutations in the voltage sensor can lead to an almost unitary single-channel Po, suggesting that the partial agonist status of cAMP can be modulated by voltage. This i) shows directly that the voltage sensing mechanism and cAMP-gating are allosterically linked, and ii) suggests that cAMP may be a full agonist if not for the inhibitory action of the VSD, pointing to an intriguing parallel to eukaryotic CNG channels. One could speculate that during evolutionary integration of eukaryotic CNG channels into more complex signaling pathways (as compared to bacteria), the VSD may have lost most of its inhibitory action making cyclic nucleotides powerful agonists of CNG channels with only vestigial voltage-dependence.

In summary, we showed here structural evidence of allostery in CNG channels, by introducing perturbations in the voltage-sensor domain and capturing conformational changes taking place along the ligand-activation pathway. We took advantage of the dual activation of SthK by voltage and cAMP and the partial agonist nature of cAMP to capture on-pathway gating intermediates, which are normally too unstable to be captured with cryo-EM. Based on our data, we defined a detailed ligand-activation pathway for SthK and proposed an inhibitory role for the voltage-sensor domain (Fig. 5). Our findings shed direct light on key conformational transitions and can be used to understand similar pathways in eukaryotic CNG channels.

### Functionally selective signaling and broad metabolic benefits by novel insulin receptor partial agonists [^117WNpNW]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) mediate critical signaling events to regulate growth and metabolism. While functional selectivity between ligand and receptor interaction is common in nature, and evident in many classes of receptors with pleiotropic actions, biased signaling and partial agonism from a pharmacologic perspective of drug discovery has mostly been investigated in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). The topic has not been widely studied in the arena of RTK drug discovery though there are interesting cases of sub-pathway specific signaling for multiple RTK families. Several examples are: (1) the seven epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) for which natural ligands can stabilize receptor dimers with distinct conformations, different levels of agonism and signaling bias; (2) the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family of four receptors that collectively have 18 ligands, a clear indication of a potential for signal fine-tuning; and (3) insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) as respective "biased" ligands for the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) or the insulin receptor (IR) to regulate a balance between growth and proliferation. The physiological relevance of these native systems that manifest a potential for biased signaling is just beginning to be realized and the modulation by design of RTK ligands to harvest pharmacological benefit has yet to be broadly attempted.

### Ligand efficacy shifts a nuclear receptor conformational ensemble between transcriptionally active and repressive States [^115KBSQm]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Structural biology studies of NRs focused on understanding the molecular basis for ligand-dependent changes in transcription have been primarily focused on generating crystal structures of NR LBDs bound to coregulator peptide and/or ligand. However, while crystal structures provide low-energy static snapshots of the functional endpoints (e.g. fully active states) they do not explain graded activity that is critical for understanding how ligands influence the dynamic NR LBD conformational ensemble. PPARγ is a good model system to study how pharmacological ligands influence the dynamic NR LBD conformational ensemble. Although crystal structures of PPARγ LBD bound to partial or full agonists all show a similar low-energy active LBD conformation and do not explain the molecular basis of graded agonism, NMR studies revealed that graded activation of PPARγ is correlated to shifting the LBD conformational ensemble from a ground state to an active state. Here, we define a more comprehensive LBD conformational ensemble and show that compounds within the same scaffold select natively populated repressive- and active-like conformations present in the apo/ligand-free state.

### Understanding buprenorphine for use in chronic pain: expert opinion [^116pzJWd]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

An expert panel convened to reach a consensus on common misconceptions surrounding buprenorphine, a Schedule III partial µ-opioid receptor agonist indicated for chronic pain. The panel also provided clinical recommendations on the appropriate use of buprenorphine and conversion strategies for switching to buprenorphine from a full µ-opioid receptor agonist for chronic pain management.

Methods

The consensus panel met on March 25, 2019, to discuss relevant literature and provide recommendations on interpreting buprenorphine as a partial µ-opioid receptor agonist, prescribing buprenorphine before some Schedule II, III, or IV options, perioperative/trauma management of patients taking buprenorphine, and converting patients from a full µ-opioid receptor agonist to buprenorphine.

Results

The panel recommended that buprenorphine's classification as a partial µ-opioid receptor agonist not be clinically translated to mean partial analgesic efficacy. The panel also recommended that buprenorphine be considered before some Schedule II, III, or IV opioids in patients with a favorable risk/benefit profile on the basis of metabolic factors, abuse potential, and tolerability and that buprenorphine be continued during the perioperative/trauma period. In addition, switching patients from a full µ-opioid receptor agonist to buprenorphine should be considered with no weaning period at starting doses that are based on the previous opioid dose.

Conclusions

These recommendations provide a framework for clinicians to address most clinical scenarios regarding buprenorphine use. The overall consensus of the panel was that buprenorphine is a unique Schedule III opioid with favorable pharmacologic properties and a safety profile that may be desirable for chronic pain management.

### Crystal structures of human ETreceptor provide mechanistic insight into receptor activation and partial activation [^114wxG5f]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Endothelin receptors (ET A and ET B) are class A GPCRs activated by vasoactive peptide endothelins, and are involved in blood pressure regulation. ET B -selective signalling induces vasorelaxation, and thus selective ET B agonists are expected to be utilized for improved anti-tumour drug delivery and neuroprotection. Here, we report the crystal structures of human ET B receptor in complex with ET B -selective agonist, endothelin-3 and an ET B -selective endothelin analogue IRL1620. The structure of the endothelin-3-bound receptor reveals that the disruption of water-mediated interactions between W6.48 and D2.50 is critical for receptor activation, while these hydrogen-bonding interactions are partially preserved in the IRL1620-bound structure. Consistently, functional analysis reveals the partial agonistic effect of IRL1620. The current findings clarify the detailed molecular mechanism for the coupling between the orthosteric pocket and the G-protein binding, and the partial agonistic effect of IRL1620, thus paving the way for the design of improved agonistic drugs targeting ET B.

Regarding medical management for opioids for pain, more specifically with respect to choice of agent and dosage, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to consider rotating from a full opioid agonist to a partial opioid agonist, such as buprenorphine, for nonterminal pain management, particularly in patients with opioid use disorder or at risk for opioid misuse or overdose.

### Mechanism of partial agonism in AMPA-type glutamate receptors [^112NjVH8]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Partial agonists selectively support diagonal crosslinks

In functional studies the A665C mutant could be selectively trapped at concentrations of glutamate close to the EC₅₀ (∼500 μM), in the presence of the oxidizing agent copper-phenanthroline (CuPhen). This crosslink could be observed in the CA tetramer structure(Fig. 3a). However, in the sLBD_FW structure, cysteine residues introduced at position 666 did not form a crosslink (their C-alphas being too distant at 17 Å). We therefore substituted three positions in the FG-loop (I664, A665 and V666) with cysteine (Fig. 3a). Each mutant was tested for its crosslinking potential with different partial agonists as FW, IW, HW and KA under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 3b). We used a quadruple barrel fast perfusion system that enables the fast application of each partial agonist in the presence of CuPhen, and allowed the partial agonist to dissociate whilst holding the disulfide bond with CuPhen before assessing the active fraction (Supplementary Fig. 4).

Perhaps surprisingly, given the sLBD_FW structure, we obtained trapping for the mutants I664C, A665C and V666C with all partial agonists FW, IW and KA (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Fig. 5A). However, HW failed to trap robustly at the I664C site (Active fraction 88 ± 10% P = 0.0139 versus WT see Fig. 5a). Receptors were better trapped at this site with the other partial agonists (active fraction range 77–82%), or at other sites (58–82% across 11 conditions).

### Current issues with beta2-adrenoceptor agonists: pharmacology and molecular and cellular mechanisms [^114c5Xc4]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Beta2-adrenoceptors are widely, almost ubiquitously, expressed. Activation of these receptors on bronchial smooth muscle by short- and long-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists causes bronchodilation. Here, the beta2-adrenoceptor is linked by the G protein, Gs, to adenylyl cyclase, which increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), thus activating protein kinase A, which affects calcium levels and reduces the efficiency of myosin light-chain kinase, causing relaxation. Activation also entrains numerous acute and longer term downregulation responses affecting the number, location, and net efficiency of signaling of the receptor. Synthetic beta2-agonists are all "partial agonists", incompletely able to optimally stimulate cAMP signal transduction. However, compared with some cells (such as mast cells) involved in exercise- induced asthma induction, airway smooth muscle is privileged in that transduction efficiency is intrinsically high and the tissue is very resistant to complete downregulation. Glucocorticosteroids have broadly beneficial interactions with beta2-adrenoceptors. Researchers have recently discovered that the beta2-adrenoceptor may function as a homodimer and that it can form heterodimers with both the beta1- and beta3-adrenoceptors, and possibly other receptors. This further complicates interpretation of the effect of beta2-adrenoceptor polymorphisms, but it is unknown whether this occurs in humans in vivo. Researchers have known for some time that strong contraction involving receptors coupled to the Gq G protein (e.g., cholinergic and leukotriene receptors via negative biochemical crosstalk), virus infection (via uncoupling), and inflammation (via kinases) can impair relaxation. Most recently, researchers have discovered that the beta2-adrenoceptor can also send potentially adverse signals after "atypical coupling" to Gq rather than Gs. The clinical implications of these uncouplings, crosstalk, and atypical coupling possibilities are not well-understood.

### Buprenorphine: considerations for pain management [^115wFAn8]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2005). Low credibility.

New effective analgesics are needed for the treatment of pain. Buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid agonist which has been in clinical use for over 25 years, has been found to be amenable to new formulation technology based on its physiochemical and pharmacological profile. Buprenorphine is marketed as parenteral, sublingual, and transdermal formulations. Unlike full mu-opioid agonists, at higher doses, buprenorphine's physiological and subjective effects, including euphoria, reach a plateau. This ceiling may limit the abuse potential and may result in a wider safety margin. Buprenorphine has been used for the treatment of acute and chronic pain, as a supplement to anesthesia, and for behavioral and psychiatric disorders including treatment for opioid addiction. Prolonged use of buprenorphine can result in physical dependence. However, withdrawal symptoms appear to be mild to moderate in intensity compared with those of full mu agonists. Overdoses have primarily involved buprenorphine taken in combination with other central nervous system depressants.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^1119dVP7]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Buprenorphine and acute pain management — temporarily increasing buprenorphine dosing and/or dividing the dose may be effective for acute pain management; the analgesic effects last for approximately 6–8 hours while withdrawal and craving suppression lasts for approximately 24 hours, and increasing the daily dose by 20–25% and splitting it into 3–4 doses can often adequately address acute pain; when moving to split dosing the clinician should ensure that the patient has not missed their last non-split dose. Patients with acute pain refractory to other treatments may benefit from as-needed buprenorphine, and adding a short-acting full opioid agonist to the patient's regular dose of buprenorphine can be effective; the guideline committee recommends that this may be considered in supervised settings, such as during hospitalization. In situations when a full opioid agonist is used for pain management, discontinuation of buprenorphine is not required; if buprenorphine is discontinued during severe pain to allow more mu opioid receptor availability, patients should be monitored closely because high doses of a full agonist may be required, and as the partial agonist effect dissipates the full agonist effect may lead to over-sedation and respiratory depression.

### Efficacy at G-protein-coupled receptors [^114UXw9e]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2002). Medium credibility.

At present, the drug-discovery process centres on ligands that either block or produce physiological responses. However, there are therapeutic uses for ligands that do neither of these things, but which still affect receptors in other ways. This review discusses the intimate relationship between the affinity of a ligand for its receptor, and the probability that the binding of the ligand will produce some change in the receptor, resulting in efficacy. This, in turn, argues that ligands that have affinity should be tested more broadly, for a wider range of efficacies, to detect hidden therapeutic activities.

### Structural basis for GPR40 allosteric agonism and incretin stimulation [^116WNoXB]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Activation of free fatty acid receptor 1 (GPR40) by synthetic partial and full agonists occur via distinct allosteric sites. A crystal structure of GPR40-TAK-875 complex revealed the allosteric site for the partial agonist. Here we report the 2.76-Å crystal structure of human GPR40 in complex with a synthetic full agonist, compound 1, bound to the second allosteric site. Unlike TAK-875, which acts as a Gαq-coupled partial agonist, compound 1 is a dual Gαq- and Gαs-coupled full agonist. compound 1 binds in the lipid-rich region of the receptor near intracellular loop 2 (ICL2), in which the stabilization of ICL2 by the ligand is likely the primary mechanism for the enhanced G protein activities. The endogenous free fatty acid (FFA), γ-linolenic acid, can be computationally modeled in this site. Both γ-linolenic acid and compound 1 exhibit positive cooperativity with TAK-875, suggesting that this site could also serve as a FFA binding site.

Figure 1.
Schematic diagram illustrating steroid receptor selectivity of progestins and intracellular mechanism of regulation of transcription by steroid receptors. (a) Binding and transcriptional activity. Solid black lines indicate high-affinity binding similar to or greater than that of the endogenous cognate agonist ligands. These are progesterone (Prog) for the PR, cortisol (Cort) for the GR, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for the AR, and aldosterone (Ald) for the MR. Stippled black line indicates lower affinity (∼10-fold lower), whereas dotted black lines indicate very low relative affinity (at least 100-fold lower) compared with the endogenous agonist ligands. Plus signs (+) indicate agonist or partial agonist activity, where four plus signs (++++) indicate full agonist activity similar to endogenous agonist ligands and fewer plus signs indicate relative partial agonist activity. Minus signs (−) indicate antagonist activity toward the endogenous agonist, where four minus signs (−−−−) indicate full antagonist activity and fewer minus signs indicate relative partial antagonist activity. Data sources include references listed in Tables 1 and 2 and references discussed in the text. Note that there is considerable uncertainly and/or inconsistency in some of the data as discussed in the text, especially for affinities and transcriptional activities of LNG and ETG for GR, AR, and MR. Additionally, steroid receptor activity can be gene and cell specific, and many of the activities in animal preclinical models may not represent activities in human tissues. (b) Mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by MPA acting via the GR. Other progestin agonists and partial agonists can both transactivate and transrepress genes via their cognate receptors using similar mechanisms. Green arrows indicate increase in transcription of target genes (transactivation by direct binding of receptor to DNA) whereas red stop lines indicate inhibition (transrepression by tethering of receptor to other transcription factors), both taking place in the nucleus. Chromatin effects are not indicated. Antagonist activity is not depicted but involves recruitment of corepressors instead of coactivators by DNA-bound receptors, due to the conformation induced by the antagonist bound to the receptor. Additional mechanisms of gene regulation may be involved. Ald, aldosterone; Cort, cortisol; DHT, dihydrotestosterone; Prog, progesterone. With data from Stanczyk et al. and Africander et al.
