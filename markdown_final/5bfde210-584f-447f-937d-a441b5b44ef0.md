## Question

Hypertension treatment in a 35 year old male with history of bicuspid aortic valve who is status post aortic valve replacement with mechanical valve. He is on 10 mg amlodipine already and BP is not quite at goal

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage hypertension in a 35-year-old man with a history of bicuspid aortic valve who has undergone mechanical aortic valve replacement and is currently on amlodipine 10 mg daily, but his blood pressure is not at goal. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the blood pressure target in a young adult with bicuspid aortic valve and a mechanical valve. Then, I should verify the current blood pressure and confirm true uncontrolled hypertension. Next, I will review guideline-based pharmacologic escalation, paying attention to drug–drug interactions with warfarin and the role of renin–angiotensin system blockade. After that, I need to consider special issues such as aortic diameter thresholds, coarctation screening, and the possibility of resistant hypertension. Finally, I will outline monitoring, lifestyle measures, and a practical titration algorithm with safety checks and contingencies.

> Let me first confirm the blood pressure target. In adults under 65 years, ESC/ESH 2018 recommends targeting systolic blood pressure 120–129 mmHg if tolerated, with a universal first objective of achieving less than 140/90 mmHg, and in patients with bicuspid aortic valve–related aortopathy, tighter control to 130/80 mmHg or lower is advised when tolerated, so for a 35-year-old I should aim for 120–129 mmHg if he can tolerate it without dizziness or syncope [^113Xz66w] [^112j6vuh] [^117XXM2R].

> Wait, let me verify the current blood pressure status and ensure we are not missing white-coat or masked hypertension. I should obtain accurate office measurements, consider home blood pressure monitoring or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to confirm true uncontrolled hypertension, and document pulse pressure and heart rate because these influence both risk and drug selection in aortic disease contexts [^116phXpY].

> Next, I should review the baseline therapy and its adequacy. Amlodipine 10 mg daily is a full-dose dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker; if blood pressure remains above goal, monotherapy is generally insufficient in most patients, and guidelines favor moving to combination therapy rather than further increasing a single agent beyond typical maxima, so I should not escalate amlodipine further [^111yornR].

> I will now examine the preferred second agent. Given his age and the absence of compelling contraindications, adding a renin–angiotensin system blocker such as an ACE inhibitor or an ARB is appropriate and guideline-concordant. Importantly, in patients with a history of aortic stenosis managed with valve replacement, RAAS blockade has been associated with improved outcomes, supporting its use for blood pressure control in this setting [^112MwoQ5] [^115K6bqE].

> Hold on, I should verify drug–drug interaction concerns with warfarin. ACE inhibitors can interact with warfarin and may increase INR, so if I choose an ACE inhibitor, I need to check the INR more frequently after initiation and dose changes; ARBs are less likely to affect warfarin metabolism, so an ARB may be a pragmatic first choice here to simplify anticoagulation management, though either class is acceptable with appropriate INR monitoring [^notfound].

> Let me consider concrete options and dosing. Adding valsartan 160–320 mg daily or olmesartan 20–40 mg daily would be reasonable. Fixed-dose combinations of amlodipine with valsartan or olmesartan are FDA-approved and can simplify the regimen while maintaining equivalent total doses, and they have predictable blood pressure lowering with most of the effect seen within 1–2 weeks, which helps with titration planning [^115FxvjK] [^111CKQAs] [^1139xC3c].

> I should double-check expected efficacy to set expectations. In moderate to severe hypertension, combining amlodipine with an ARB increases the likelihood of achieving systolic goals by roughly 15–20% compared with monotherapy, and mean additional systolic reductions of about 10–15 mmHg are typical, which should materially help reach the 120–129 mmHg target in this patient if tolerated [^1139xC3c] [^113kLyyQ].

> But wait, what if blood pressure remains above goal after 4–6 weeks of dual therapy. I need to ensure adherence, verify home measurements, and screen for secondary causes; if truly uncontrolled on two agents including a dihydropyridine CCB and a RAAS blocker, guidelines support adding a thiazide-like diuretic such as chlorthalidone 12.5–25 mg daily, with caution regarding electrolytes and renal function, and in eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², a loop diuretic may be preferred, with careful monitoring of volume status and potassium [^115X9Fw5].

> Hold on, I should verify the resistant hypertension pathway. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled on three agents including a diuretic, spironolactone 25–50 mg daily is the preferred fourth agent; if spironolactone is not tolerated, eplerenone, a beta-blocker if not already indicated, or other fourth-line options can be considered, with attention to potassium and renal function during follow-up [^116M3vAi] [^114auHg5].

> I need to ensure we are not missing bicuspid-specific aortic risks. Even after isolated AVR, patients with bicuspid aortic valve have residual aortic event risk if the aorta was dilated at baseline, so I should confirm current aortic dimensions and growth trajectory; surgery is recommended at 55 mm for the root or ascending aorta, and earlier consideration is reasonable at 50 mm with risk factors or at 45–50 mm if undergoing concomitant valve surgery, with rapid growth defined as 0.5 cm/year or 0.3 cm/year in two consecutive years prompting earlier intervention [^116knib7] [^113JWv2b] [^114zd8Ef] [^111phsM7].

> Let me consider coarctation screening because it coexists with bicuspid aortic valve and can drive refractory hypertension. I should check four-limb blood pressures and pulses, and if there is a significant arm–leg gradient or other suggestive features, obtain echocardiography with Doppler and, if needed, CT angiography or MR angiography to exclude native or repaired coarctation that could undermine blood pressure control [^117XXM2R] [^1138j2jf].

> Next, I should review lifestyle measures that meaningfully augment pharmacotherapy. Weight loss to a BMI less than 25 kg/m², dietary sodium restriction to under 2 g/day, limitation of alcohol to no more than two drinks per day, at least 150 minutes per week of moderate aerobic activity, and smoking cessation all contribute to blood pressure reductions of roughly 5–10 mmHg and should be reinforced at each visit [^116phXpY].

> I should confirm monitoring cadence and safety labs. After adding or changing therapy, reassess blood pressure in 2–4 weeks, check serum potassium and creatinine within 1–2 weeks of adding a RAAS blocker or diuretic, and monitor INR closely when initiating an ACE inhibitor; home blood pressure monitoring should be encouraged to distinguish white-coat effects and guide titration, with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring considered if diagnosis remains uncertain or resistant hypertension is suspected [^116phXpY].

> Let me reconsider potential pitfalls. Very low blood pressure after aortic valve replacement has been associated with worse outcomes in observational cohorts, so I should avoid overaggressive downward titration that results in systolic blood pressure below 120 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure below 60 mmHg, and instead individualize to the lowest tolerated blood pressure above those thresholds while respecting the 120–129 mmHg target range in this young patient [^112dTNRq] [^117Ts6W2].

> Putting this together, my actionable plan is as follows: confirm true uncontrolled hypertension with home or ambulatory monitoring. Add an ARB such as valsartan 160 mg daily or olmesartan 20 mg daily, or an ACE inhibitor if preferred with enhanced INR monitoring. Titrate the RAAS blocker to 320 mg for valsartan or 40 mg for olmesartan after 2–4 weeks if needed. If still above goal, add chlorthalidone 12.5–25 mg daily and recheck electrolytes and renal function. If still uncontrolled, add spironolactone 25–50 mg daily or consider eplerenone or a beta-blocker based on comorbidities. Throughout, reinforce lifestyle measures, surveil the aorta per bicuspid protocols, and screen for coarctation if blood pressure remains refractory [^117XXM2R] [^113Xz66w] [^116M3vAi] [^115X9Fw5] [^116knib7] [^1138j2jf].

For a 35-year-old man with a mechanical aortic valve and persistent hypertension on amlodipine 10 mg, **target BP is < 130/80 mmHg** if tolerated, with a practical goal of 120–129/70–79 mmHg given his age and valve prosthesis [^113Xz66w] [^1142u5ao]. Add an **ARB or ACE inhibitor** (e.g. valsartan 160–320 mg or lisinopril 20–40 mg) and titrate to effect; if still uncontrolled, add a thiazide-like diuretic (chlorthalidone 12.5–25 mg or indapamide 1.25–2.5 mg) [^111CKQAs]. Beta-blockers are not first-line for hypertension but may be used if indicated for other reasons. Monitor for hypotension, renal function, and INR changes with new agents, and intensify lifestyle measures [^116phXpY].

---

## Blood pressure targets

- **General target**: < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated [^113Xz66w] [^112j6vuh].
- **Age-specific target**: 120–129/70–79 mmHg for adults < 65 years, including those with mechanical valves [^113Xz66w] [^1142u5ao].
- **Lower limit**: Avoid SBP < 120 mmHg or DBP < 70 mmHg to prevent hypotension-related complications [^1142u5ao].

---

## Pharmacological management

### Step 1: current therapy assessment

Amlodipine 10 mg daily is at the **maximum recommended dose** [^notfound]; if BP remains uncontrolled, add a second agent [^111CKQAs].

---

### Step 2: add a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker

- **Rationale**: RAS blockade reduces afterload, improves LV unloading, and may reduce aortic events in BAV [^notfound].
- **Options**: ARB (e.g. valsartan 160–320 mg daily) or ACE inhibitor (e.g. lisinopril 20–40 mg daily) [^111CKQAs].
- **Monitoring**: Check renal function and potassium 1–2 weeks after initiation; monitor INR if ACE inhibitor is used due to potential warfarin interaction.

---

### Step 3: add a thiazide-like diuretic if BP remains uncontrolled

- **Rationale**: Thiazide-like diuretics enhance BP control and are effective in combination therapy [^notfound].
- **Options**: Chlorthalidone 12.5–25 mg daily [^115X9Fw5] or indapamide 1.25–2.5 mg daily [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: Monitor electrolytes and renal function regularly.

---

### Step 4: consider additional agents if BP remains uncontrolled

- **Beta-blocker**: Consider if there is concomitant coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, or LV dysfunction.
- **Spironolactone**: Consider as a fourth-line agent for resistant hypertension [^114auHg5].
- **Hydralazine or alpha-blockers**: Reserve for resistant cases due to side effects and limited evidence.

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle measures are essential and should be **implemented in parallel with pharmacotherapy**:

- **Dietary sodium restriction**: < 2 g/day.
- **Weight management**: Aim for BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m².
- **Regular physical activity**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise.
- **Alcohol moderation**: ≤ 2 drinks/day.
- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended [^115yQsni].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Home BP monitoring**: Encourage daily monitoring with validated devices.
- **Clinic visits**: Reassess every 4–6 weeks until BP is at target, then every 3–6 months.
- **Laboratory monitoring**: Renal function, electrolytes, and INR (if applicable) at each visit.
- **Echocardiography**: Annual imaging of the aortic root and ascending aorta if diameter ≥ 4.0 cm [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Mechanical valve function**: Ensure proper anticoagulation and valve function at each visit.
- **Hypotension risk**: Avoid excessive BP lowering (SBP < 120 mmHg or DBP < 70 mmHg) [^1142u5ao].
- **Patient education**: Emphasize adherence, lifestyle changes, and symptom monitoring.

Arterial hypertension — hypertension accompanies AS in 35–45% of earlier series and in elderly patients with low flow, low gradient AS it was present in the vast majority; because hypertension primarily affects flow and gradients but less AVA, evaluation of AS severity with uncontrolled hypertension may not accurately reflect disease severity, so control of blood pressure is recommended before echocardiographic evaluation whenever possible, and reports should always include a contemporaneous blood pressure measurement.

Office blood pressure treatment targets in hypertensive patients — It is recommended that the first objective of treatment should be to lower BP to < 140/90 mmHg in all patients and that, if the treatment is well tolerated, treated BP values should be targeted to 130/80 mmHg or lower in most patients. In patients < 65 years receiving BP-lowering drugs, it is recommended that SBP should be lowered to a BP range of 120–129 mmHg in most patients. In older patients (aged ≥ 65 years) receiving BP-lowering drugs, it is recommended that SBP should be targeted to a BP range of 130–139 mmHg, with close monitoring of adverse effects. These BP targets are recommended for patients at any level of CV risk and in patients with and without established CVD. A DBP target of < 80 mmHg should be considered for all hypertensive patients, independent of the level of risk and comorbidities.

Coarctation of the aorta — clinical features, complications, and follow-up highlight key diagnostic and surveillance points. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is useful for evaluating the gradient across the CoA, as well as identifying a coexisting bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and other congenital defects. Echocardiogram is indicated in the evaluation of patients with CoA because a BAV coexists in at least 50% of cases. Upper extremity hypertension and lower extremity hypoperfusion are the hallmarks of CoA. Untreated CoA may be complicated by aortic dissection, heart failure, ruptured cerebral aneurysm, distal hypoperfusion, or the consequences of significant hypertension, and late complications following surgical or endovascular CoA repair may include undersized grafts, recurrent stenosis, aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm formation, and rupture. Hypertension is common after CoA repair, especially during exercise, and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring and exercise testing are useful in diagnosis and management. Lifelong clinical and imaging follow-up is important to evaluate for hypertension, recurrent coarctation, and aortic abnormalities after repair.

Introduction

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were first introduced over 35 years ago initially for coronary heart disease (CHD), but they soon gained wide recognition for their efficacy in hypertension (HTN). The initial indication, besides HTN, also included angina, peripheral vascular disease and some arrhythmic conditions. Amlodipine has many unique qualities that set it apart from other agents in this class. The aim of this review is to compare amlodipine with other antihypertensive agents with particular focus on the ability to improve cardiovascular (CV) health and reduce adverse CV outcomes.

Aortic stenosis — medical therapy and comorbidities: In asymptomatic aortic stenosis (AS), hypertension (n = 1340) was associated with a 56% higher rate of ischemic cardiovascular events and a 2-fold higher mortality rate (both P < 0.01), while medical therapy for hypertension follows standard guidelines with low-dose initiation and titration; there are no studies addressing specific antihypertensive medications in AS, diuretics may reduce stroke volume, ACE inhibitors may be advantageous, and consideration should be given to a higher target blood pressure for AS. Concurrent coronary artery disease (CAD) is common and all patients should be screened and treated for hypercholesterolemia with guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT); in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of statin therapy for mild to moderate AS, ischemic events were reduced by about 20% despite no reduction in aortic valve event rates. After transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), renin–angiotensin system blocker therapy was associated with a lower 1-year mortality with a relative risk reduction of about 20% to 50% and an absolute risk reduction between 2.4% and 5.0%, with benefit among patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) but not among those with reduced LVEF. Despite experimental and retrospective signals, 3 large well-designed RCTs failed to show benefit of statins for calcific AS progression, and there are no data to support the use of statins for prevention of progression of AS.

### Management of stage 1 hypertension in adults with a low 10-year risk for cardiovascular disease: filling a guidance gap: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114jixjA]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

High blood pressure (BP) is the leading cause of worldwide cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Patients and clinicians dealing with hypertension have benefited from the evidence of event-based randomized controlled clinical trials. One result from those trials has been the development of evidence-based guidelines. The commitment to using evidence from these event-based randomized trials has been a cornerstone in the development of guideline treatment recommendations. However, in some situations, evidence from event-based trials is not available to guideline writers or clinicians for assistance in treatment decision making. Such is the case for the management of many patients with stage 1 hypertension. The purpose of this scientific statement is to provide information complementary to the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines for the patient with untreated stage 1 hypertension (systolic BP/diastolic BP, 130–139/80–89 mmHg) with a 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease < 10% who fails to meet the systolic BP/diastolic goal (< 130/80 mmHg) after 6 months of guideline-recommended lifestyle therapy. This statement provides evidence from sources other than event-based randomized controlled clinical trials and offers therapy options for consideration by clinicians.

Persistent symptoms after valve intervention — Persistent symptoms occur in many patients after valve intervention, and the first step in evaluation is to assess valve function to ensure symptoms are not caused by persistent or recurrent stenosis, regurgitation, or a valve complication. The next step is to evaluate and treat any concurrent cardiac disease and noncardiac conditions that may be the cause of symptoms, and symptoms also may be attributable to irreversible consequences of valve disease, including LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and RV dysfunction. Treatment of symptoms for these patients is based on GDMT for HF and/or pulmonary hypertension.

### Amlodipine besylate and olmesartan medoxomil [^1139xC3c]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

For example, a patient with a baseline blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg has about a 48% likelihood of achieving a goal of < 140 mmHg (systolic) and a 51% likelihood of achieving a goal of < 90 mmHg (diastolic) on monotherapy with olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg, and about a 46% likelihood of achieving a goal of < 140 mmHg (systolic) and a 60% likelihood of achieving a goal of < 90 mmHg (diastolic) on monotherapy with amlodipine 10 mg. The likelihood of achieving these same goals increases to 63% (systolic) and 71% (diastolic) on amlodipine besylate and olmesartan medoxomil 5/20 mg, and to 68% (systolic) and 85% (diastolic) on amlodipine besylate and olmesartan medoxomil 10/40 mg.

Amlodipine besylate and olmesartan medoxomil is a combination of amlodipine besylate, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, and olmesartan medoxomil, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, indicated for the treatment of hypertension, alone or with other antihypertensive agents, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions (1).
Amlodipine besylate and olmesartan medoxomil may also be used as initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve their blood pressure goals (1).

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

General Considerations:

Majority of effect attained within 2 weeks (2.1)
May be administered with other antihypertensive agents (2.1)

Hypertension:

May be used as add-on therapy for patients not controlled on monotherapy (2.2)
Patients who experience dose-limiting adverse reactions on monotherapy may be switched to amlodipine and valsartan containing a lower dose of that component (2.2)
May be substituted for titrated components (2.3)
When used as initial therapy: Initiate with 5/160 mg, then titrate upwards as necessary to a maximum of 10/320 mg once daily (2.4)

2.1 General Considerations

Dose once daily. The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum of one 10/320 mg tablet once daily as needed to control blood pressure. The majority of the antihypertensive effect is attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy or a change in dose.

Amlodipine and valsartan may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

2.2 Add-on Therapy

A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with amlodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker) alone or with valsartan (or another ARB) alone may be switched to combination therapy with amlodipine and valsartan.

A patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions on either component alone may be switched to amlodipine and valsartan containing a lower dose of that component in combination with the other to achieve similar blood pressure reductions. The clinical response to amlodipine and valsartan should be subsequently evaluated and if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 3 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a maximum of 10/320 mg.

2.3 Replacement Therapy

For convenience, patients receiving amlodipine and valsartan from separate tablets may instead wish to receive tablets of amlodipine and valsartan containing the same component doses.

2.4 Initial Therapy

A patient may be initiated on amlodipine and valsartan if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is amlodipine and valsartan 5/160 mg once daily in patients who are not volume-depleted.

### Lower blood pressure after transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement is associated with increased mortality [^117Ts6W2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

we showed that lower DBP (< 60 mm Hg) and lower SBP (< 120 mm Hg) in the first month after TAVR or SAVR are each associated with increased all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality and repeat hospitalizations. In light of these and prior findings, a randomized strategy trial may now be appropriate in patients with AS treated with AVR to determine whether patients with lower BP measurements (SBP < 120 or 130 mm Hg or DBP < 60 mm Hg) should have their medication regimen adjusted to allow their BP to rise above these levels. Given the growing number of patients with AS undergoing valve replacement and the large percentage of patients with these lower BP values, clarifying BP targets and appropriate management strategies is both timely and consequential.

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) aortopathy progression and event risk — After isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) for BAV, the 15-year freedom from aortic events was 89% and was lower with baseline dilation (85% versus 93%; P = 0.001) in a series of 1,286 patients treated from 1960 to 1995; among 56 patients with isolated AVR for aortic regurgitation and aortic root dilation 4.0–5.0 cm, adverse aortic events occurred in 34% during follow-up. In a prospective study of 90 adults with BAV, the mean increase in ascending aortic diameter was 0.47 mm/y (range, 0.2–2.3 mm/y) over a 4.8-year follow-up; among adults with BAV without a TAA at baseline (aortic diameter < 4.5 cm), 13% developed a TAA at 14 ± 6 years after diagnosis and the 25-year risk of TAA was 26%. For many adults, an aortic root, ascending aortic, or both diameter ≥ 4.0 cm is considered dilated and should therefore be monitored over time with surveillance imaging to detect progressive dilation.

Aortic root and ascending thoracic aorta — definitions of dilation and aneurysm highlight limits of the standard rule. The conventional definition is "any artery that is dilated to at least 1.5 times its expected normal diameter". For example, "a man in his 40s would be expected to have an average aortic root diameter of 3.5 cm; applying the standard definition of ≥ 1.5 times reference diameter, his aortic root would have to reach 5.25 cm", yet "most experts would consider his aorta to be an aneurysm well below that diameter". In heritable aortopathy, "aortic repair would be recommended at a diameter of ≤ 5.0 cm", which "would not even be large enough to be termed an 'aneurysm'. The section notes that "The most important consideration in deciding the diameter thresholds at which to call the root and ascending aorta dilated or aneurysm is based on the natural history of such abnormal aortas", and cites a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) cohort undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) in which investigators "studied 201 patients… and followed them for 10 to 15 years; they found that those with baseline aortic diameters of 4.5 cm to 4.9 cm had a significantly increased risk of aneurysm".

Introduction

For patients with aortic stenosis (AS), the American and European guidelines for the management of patients with valvular heart disease recommend treating hypertension according to standard blood pressure guidelines. 1, 2 In patients with a history of AS who have undergone aortic valve replacement (AVR), the valve guidelines provide no specific recommendations for blood pressure management. 1, 2

Accordingly, the treatment of blood pressure in patients with AS or in patients with a history of AS treated with AVR matches those in the general population. 3 The recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association blood pressure guidelines define normal blood pressure as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 120 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 80 mm Hg. 3 Prescription of blood pressure‐lowering medication is recommended for patients with stage I hypertension (SBP 130–139 mm Hg or DBP 80–89 mm Hg) and with a prior cardiovascular event or at high risk for one. These criteria would apply to most patients with AS before and after AVR. 3 Other large meta‐analyses recommend a target SBP < 130 mm Hg as well. 4, 5 The SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) showed that targeting an SBP < 120 mm Hg yields better clinical outcomes than a target of < 140 mm Hg, a finding which was also observed in patients aged > 75 years regardless of their relative fitness or frailty. 6, 7 In patients treated with AVR, it would seem advantageous to try to treat hypertension to optimize unloading of the left ventricle as an adjunct to unloading from valve replacement. 8 Furthermore, several retrospective observational studies have shown improved long‐term clinical outcomes for patients taking inhibitors of the renin‐angiotensin system after AVR. 9, 10, 11 However, we recently observed that lower SBP (SBP 100–129 mm Hg compared with SBP 130–170 mm Hg) after transcatheter AVR (TAVR) was associated with increased mortality, even after multivariable adjustment, raising concern about optimal blood pressure targets after valve replacement in patients with AS. 12

In the present study, we aimed to clarify the relationship between blood pressure and clinical outcomes in a large group of patients with AS treated with TAVR or surgical AVR (SAVR). We analyzed the relationships between SBP and DBP and clinical outcomes separately and looked for thresholds below or above which risk increased. We hypothesized that lower SBP and DBP measurements, including levels commonly targeted in blood pressure guidelines, would be associated with increased mortality. These findings could have important implications for establishing specific blood pressure targets in patients with AS treated with AVR.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets are indicated in patients for whom treatment with both amlodipine and atorvastatin is appropriate.

Amlodipine

Hypertension

Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including amlodipine.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Case presentation

A 51-year-old man with a history of a heart murmur since childhood presented with periodic palpitations, headaches, flushing, nausea and vomiting. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.8 cm 2 and a mean gradient of 48 mmHg, as well as mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. During further workup, the patient was also found to have a functional 4 × 4 cm left adrenal pheochromocytoma with elevated plasma metanephrine and normetanephrine of 4.88 (nl 0–0.49) and 4.44 (nl 0–0.89) nmol/L respectively. Outpatient management of his pheochromocytoma included terazosin 2 mg twice daily, bisoprolol 10 mg daily, losartan 50 mg twice daily, and amlodipine 2.5 mg twice daily. Treatment with α-blockade was limited due to his severe aortic stenosis, as the patient experienced syncopal episodes with increased doses of terazosin. A staged surgical approach was planned: surgical AVR followed by adrenalectomy the next day.

The patient was brought to the operating room where femoral arterial and venous access was obtained under sedation using dexmedetomidine and midazolam. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl, midazolam, propofol, and rocuronium. Intubation was performed with 4% lidocaine topicalization and video laryngoscopy to minimize sympathetic stimulation. Intraoperative analgesia was augmented with a high dose sufentanil infusion and incremental boluses as needed. A clevidipine infusion and incremental clevidipine boluses were used to control very labile mean arterial pressures (MAP) up to 150 mmHg. Cannulation and initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were otherwise uneventful.

While on CPB, significant hypertension required clevidipine and nitroglycerin (NTG) infusions. Following placement of a 23 mm St. Jude mechanical valve in the aortic position (mean gradient of 10 mmHg), the patient was weaned from CPB with normal biventricular function. The immediate post-CPB period was marked by profound hemodynamic lability (MAP < 50 to > 150 mmHg) (Fig. 1). Severe hypertension required large boluses of NTG and clevidipine; and severe hypotension was treated with vasopressin.

### Amlodipine in hypertension: a first-line agent with efficacy for improving blood pressure and patient outcomes [^113mVZDe]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Amlodipine is an excellent first-line choice among the myriad options of antihypertensive agents. In the studies discussed in this manuscript, amlodipine was highly effective for the treatment of HTN and stable angina as evidenced by the fewer hospitalisations for unstable angina and revascularisation in randomised controlled trials. Amlodipine has also shown robust reductions on CV end points (especially stroke) but has not altered the prognosis in HF. Its abilities to prevent activation of counter-regulatory mechanisms, to slow the progression of atherosclerosis, to confer antioxidant properties and to enhance NO production are all unique actions. The management of HTN is shifting more towards dual or even triple combination therapy and requires a patient profiling approach as the number of comorbid states increases. Amlodipine is a superior option in the HTN armamentarium, not only for controlling BP but also for safely improving patient outcomes.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Initiate treatment at 3.5/2.5 mg, once daily. Adjust dose according to blood pressure goals waiting 1 to 2 weeks between titration steps (2.1).

2.1 General Considerations

The recommended starting dose of PRESTALIA is 3.5/2.5 mg once daily.

Adjust dosage according to blood pressure goals. In general, wait 7 to 14 days between titration steps. The maximum recommended dose is 14/10 mg once daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

PRESTALIA may be used as initial therapy if a patient is likely to need multiple drugs to achieve blood pressure goals. Consider use in patients unable to achieve adequate antihypertensive effect with amlodipine monotherapy because of dose-limiting peripheral edema caused by amlodipine [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Administered as monotherapy, perindopril erbumine is an effective treatment for hypertension in once-daily doses ranging from 4 mg to 16 mg daily. Amlodipine is effective in once-daily doses of 5 mg and 10 mg. Adverse reactions related to perindopril are generally uncommon and independent of dose, while those related to amlodipine are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily peripheral edema) and dose-independent phenomena, the former much more common than the latter [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

2.2 Dosage Adjustment in Renal Impairment

PRESTALIA is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearances < 30 mL/min. For patients with creatinine clearance between 30 and 80 mL/min (mild or moderate renal impairment), do not exceed 7/5 mg [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

2.3 Monitoring in Elderly Patients (Over 65 Years of Age)

Monitor blood pressure for up to two weeks following titrations at dosages above 7/5 mg in patients over 65 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Effects of a structured treatment algorithm on blood pressure goal rates in both stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension [^114A2kPB]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

This study analysed the efficacy of an angiotensin receptor blocker-based treatment algorithm for achieving goal blood pressure (BP) in patients with stage 1 (systolic BP (SBP) 140–159 mmHg or diastolic BP (DBP) 90–99 mmHg) or stage 2 (SBP ≥ 160 mmHg or DBP ≥ 100 mmHg) hypertension. In this 24-week, open-label, multicentre study, patients followed a six-step algorithm until goal BP (≤ 130/85 mmHg) was attained. Initially, olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg/day was administered for 4 weeks. The regimen was modified every 4 weeks until goal BP was attained: increase olmesartan medoxomil to 40 mg/day; add hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg/day; increase HCTZ to 25 mg/day; add amlodipine besylate 5 mg/day; increase amlodipine besylate to 10 mg/day. In patients with stage 1 hypertension, 80% (63/79) and 56% (44/79) achieved BP goals of ≤ 140/90 mmHg and ≤ 130/85 mmHg, respectively, with olmesartan medoxomil monotherapy (94% (74/79) and 89% (70/79) with olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ double therapy, and 96% (76/79) and 98% (77/79) with addition of amlodipine besylate (triple therapy)). Mean SBP/DBP reductions were 16.7/11.6, 24.8/15.8, and 26.4/16.5 mmHg for mono-, double-, and triple-therapy, respectively. In patients with stage 2 hypertension, 42% (42/100) and 19% (19/100) achieved BP goals of ≤ 140/90 mmHg and ≤ 130/85 mmHg, respectively, with monotherapy (75% (75/100) and 54% (54/100) with double therapy, and 90% (90/100) and 81% (81/100) with triple-therapy). Mean SBP/DBP reductions in stage 2 patients were 18.4/10.0, 32.7/16.3, and 39.1/19.4 mmHg for mono-, double, and triple therapy, respectively. Overall, most patients with stage 1 or stage 2 hypertension achieved goal BP.

### Amlodipine besylate and olmesartan medoxomil [^11733D4y]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Amlodipine besylate and olmesartan medoxomil may also be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve their blood pressure goals.

Patients with moderate or severe hypertension are at relatively high risk for cardiovascular events (such as strokes, heart attacks, and heart failure), kidney failure, and vision problems, so prompt treatment is clinically relevant. The decision to use a combination as initial therapy should be individualized and should be shaped by considerations such as baseline blood pressure, the target goal, and the incremental likelihood of achieving goal with a combination compared to monotherapy. Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient's risk.

Bicuspid aortic valve disease occurs in ~1 in 100 people and is associated with coexistent aortic coarctation, which should be excluded in patients with bicuspid aortic valve disease; BP should be tightly controlled and targeted ≤ 130/80 mmHg if tolerated. Contrary to a popular misconception, BP-lowering treatment is well tolerated even in patients with severe aortic stenosis, vasodilating drugs (including RAS blockers) appear to be well tolerated, and treatment of hypertension should be considered in these patients.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111Fn1My]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chronic aortic regurgitation — medical therapy: In asymptomatic patients with chronic AR (Stages B and C), treatment of hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 140 mm Hg) is recommended, and in patients with severe AR who have symptoms and/or LV systolic dysfunction (Stages C2 and D) but a prohibitive surgical risk, GDMT for reduced LVEF with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and/or sacubitril/valsartan is recommended. There is no evidence that vasodilating drugs reduce severity of AR or alter the disease course in patients with significant AR in the absence of systemic hypertension, and recommendations for GDMT for hypertension and HF apply to patients with chronic asymptomatic AR, as for the general population. In symptomatic patients who are candidates for surgery, medical therapy is not a substitute for AVR; however, medical therapy is helpful for alleviating symptoms in patients who are considered to be at very high surgical risk because of concomitant comorbid medical conditions.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Aortic valve disease medical therapy — recommendations for adults with aortic stenosis (AS), bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), and aortic regurgitation (AR) are as follows. CLASS I: It is reasonable to treat systemic hypertension in patients with AS while monitoring diastolic blood pressure to avoid reducing coronary perfusion (Level of Evidence: C); it is reasonable to administer beta blockers in patients with BAV and aortic root dilatation (Level of Evidence: C); and it is reasonable to use long-term vasodilator therapy in patients with AR and systemic hypertension while carefully monitoring diastolic blood pressure to avoid reducing coronary perfusion (Level of Evidence: C). CLASS IIb: It may be reasonable to treat patients with BAV and risk factors for atherosclerosis with statins with the aim of slowing down degenerative changes in the aortic valve and preventing atherosclerosis (Level of Evidence: C). CLASS III: Vasodilator therapy is not indicated for long-term therapy in AR for the following — an asymptomatic patient with only mild to moderate AR and normal LV function (Level of Evidence: B), an asymptomatic patient with LV systolic dysfunction who is otherwise a candidate for AVR (Level of Evidence: B), or an asymptomatic patient with either LV systolic function or mild to moderate LV diastolic dysfunction who is otherwise a candidate for AVR (Level of Evidence: C).

### Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^113ompT5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients

Excessive hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, was seen in 1.7% of patients treated with the maximum dose of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets (10/320/25 mg) compared to 1.8% of valsartan/HCTZ (320/25 mg) patients, 0.4% of amlodipine/valsartan (10/320 mg) patients, and 0.2% of HCTZ/amlodipine (25/10 mg) patients in a controlled trial in patients with moderate to severe uncomplicated hypertension. In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur in patients receiving angiotensin receptor blockers. Correct this condition prior to administration of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have not been studied in patients with heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, or in patients undergoing surgery or dialysis. Patients with heart failure or post-myocardial infarction patients given valsartan commonly have some reduction in blood pressure, but discontinuation of therapy because of continuing symptomatic hypotension usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed. In controlled trials in heart failure patients, the incidence of hypotension in valsartan-treated patients was 5.5% compared to 1.8% in placebo-treated patients. In the Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (VALIANT), hypotension in post-myocardial infarction patients led to permanent discontinuation of therapy in 1.4% of valsartan-treated patients and 0.8% of captopril-treated patients.

Since the vasodilation induced by amlodipine is gradual in onset, acute hypotension has rarely been reported after oral administration. Do not initiate treatment with Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with aortic or mitral stenosis or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

If excessive hypotension occurs with amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, place the patient in a supine position and, if necessary, give intravenous normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.

5.3 Increased Angina and/or Myocardial Infarction

Worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the dose of amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease.

### Lower blood pressure after transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement is associated with increased mortality [^112dTNRq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background Blood pressure (BP) guidelines for patients with aortic stenosis or a history of aortic stenosis treated with aortic valve replacement (AVR) match those in the general population, but this extrapolation may not be warranted. Methods and Results Among patients enrolled in the Medtronic intermediate, high, and extreme risk trials, we included those with a transcatheter AVR (n = 1794) or surgical AVR (n = 1103) who were alive at 30 days. The associations between early (average of discharge and 30 day post-AVR) systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) measurements and clinical outcomes between 30 days and 1 year were evaluated. Among 2897 patients, after adjustment, spline curves demonstrated an association between lower SBP (< 120 mm Hg, representing 21% of patients) and DBP (< 60 mm Hg, representing 30% of patients) and increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and repeat hospitalization. These relationships were unchanged when patients with moderate-to-severe aortic regurgitation post-AVR were excluded. After adjustment, compared with DBP 60 to < 80 mm Hg, DBP 30 to < 60 mm Hg was associated with increased all-cause (adjusted hazard ratio 1.62, 95% CI 1.23–2.14) and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 2.13, 95% CI 1.52–3.00), but DBP 80 to < 100 mm Hg was not. Similarly, after adjustment, compared with SBP 120 to < 150 mm Hg, SBP 90 to < 120 mm Hg was associated with increased all-cause (adjusted hazard ratio 1.63, 95% CI 1.21–2.21) and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.81, 95% CI 1.25–2.61), but SBP 150 to < 180 mm Hg was not. Conclusions Lower BP in the first month after transcatheter AVR or surgical AVR is common and associated with increased mortality and repeat hospitalization. Clarifying optimal BP targets in these patients ought to be a priority and may improve patient outcomes. Clinical Trial Registration Information URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

### Resistant hypertension: a brief review of pathophysiology [^1136rTb9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A 52-year-old male comes to the internal medicine clinic for a follow-up for the management of hypertension. He was initially diagnosed with hypertension 5 years ago. His other past medical history includes obesity and hyperlipidemia. His current medications currently include losartan 100 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, and amlodipine 10 mg. His physical exam is significant for an elevated in-office blood pressure of 160/105 mmHg, BMI 38, and neck circumference > 40 cm. He also reports snoring at night and having significant daytime sleepiness despite getting over 8 hours of sleep each night. This patient meets the most recent diagnostic criteria per the American Heart Association for resistant hypertension. Resistant hypertension is an increasingly prevalent phenotype encountered in both primary care and subspecialty clinics. Multiple comorbidities, including obesity, sleep apnea, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and diabetes mellitus, are associated with resistant hypertension. Our understanding of the potential etiologies for this condition continues to evolve rapidly. We used a narrative review to explore four research areas in the pathophysiology of resistant hypertension (the sympathetic nervous system, aldosterone excess, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation) and explore the novel therapies currently in development.

For example, a patient with a baseline blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg has about a 48% likelihood of achieving a goal of < 140 mmHg (systolic) and a 51% likelihood of achieving a goal of < 90 mmHg (diastolic) on monotherapy with olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg, and about a 46% likelihood of achieving a goal of < 140 mmHg (systolic) and a 60% likelihood of achieving a goal of < 90 mmHg (diastolic) on monotherapy with amlodipine 10 mg. The likelihood of achieving these same goals increases to 63% (systolic) and 71% (diastolic) on amlodipine and olmesartan medoxomil tablets 5/20 mg, and to 68% (systolic) and 85% (diastolic) on amlodipine and olmesartan medoxomil tablets 10/40 mg.

- Amlodipine and olmesartan medoxomil tablets are a combination of dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker and angiotensin II receptor blocker combination product indicated for the treatment of hypertension, alone or with other antihypertensive agents, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. (1).

- Amlodipine and olmesartan medoxomil tablets may also be used as initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve their blood pressure goals (1)

Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) blood pressure (BP) management — targets, measurement, and antihypertensive selection are specified. The current ISHLT guidelines advise a target MAP less than 80 mm Hg provided that the adverse effects of low BP can be avoided. In continuous-flow LVAD patients, the Doppler method underestimated SBP by 4 mm Hg and overestimated MAP by 9 mm Hg, and noninvasive BP measurements approximate the mean arterial pressure if a low pulse pressure is present but more accurately represent the systolic peak pressure when a high pulse pressure and aortic valve opening are present. Uptitration of antihypertensives when the SBP is assumed to be the MAP may result in symptomatic hypotension, and ambulatory monitoring may offer more comprehensive data and facilitate uptitration of neurohormonal blockade. Accurate reliable measurement of blood pressure in LVAD is key in reducing LVAD-related adverse events and titrating medical therapy to promote recovery (IIa, Level of Evidence: B); careful attention should be paid to aortic valve opening, hemodynamic status, and degree of pulsatility when interpreting noninvasive BP measurements (IIa, Level of Evidence: B); antihypertensives used (as needed) where possible should be consistent with guideline-directed HF therapy drugs to help promote reverse remodeling and improvement in myocardial function (IIa, Level of Evidence: C); neurohormonal blockade and beta blockers should be preferentially chosen for the treatment of hypertension during LVAD support (IIa, Level of Evidence: B); and the appearance of new hypertension or a significant change in pulse pressure should warrant further investigation for recovery (IIb, Level of Evidence: C).

The evidence supports the recommendation that older patients (> 65 years, including patients over 80 years) should be offered BP-lowering treatment if their SBP is ≥ 160 mmHg, and there is also justification to now recommend BP-lowering treatment for old patients (aged ≥ 65 but not > 80 years) at a lower BP (i.e.g.rade 1 hypertension: SBP = 140–159 mmHg). BP-lowering drugs should not be withdrawn on the basis of age alone, and in patients aged > 80 years, CV risk reduction was greatest in those who continued treatment rather than in those whose treatment was discontinued; as stated, these recommendations relate to relatively fit and independent older patients.

Data support the use of antihypertensive medications to control BP in adults with aortic stenosis and/or chronic aortic regurgitation and hypertension, and among adults with severe aortic stenosis who have undergone transcatheter aortic valve implantation, the use of ACEi or ARB to achieve BP control is associated with reduced mortality. However, there are no data from RCTs that examined optimal BP targets for adults with hypertension and chronic aortic regurgitation, chronic aortic regurgitation is often accompanied by a wide pulse pressure, and medications that lower heart rate may paradoxically increase SBP. The use of ACEi and ARB in adults with chronic moderate to severe aortic regurgitation and hypertension is associated with reductions in cardiovascular events and lower all-cause mortality.

Isolated systolic hypertension in the young — definition, risk, and management — recognizes that "some young, healthy people, and men in particular, may present with isolated grade 1 systolic hypertension (i.e. brachial SBP ≥ 140–159 mmHg and a normal DBP < 90 mmHg) and this may be associated with a normal central aortic SBP due to excessive peripheral systolic pressure amplification". Prognosis is uncertain because "it is unclear whether isolated systolic hypertension in the context of a normal aortic pressure is benign", though prospective data showed "young men with isolated systolic hypertension had a CV risk similar to that of individuals with high–normal BP" and the condition "was closely associated with smoking". Management emphasizes lifestyle and surveillance: "these young individuals should receive recommendations on lifestyle modification (particularly cessation of smoking); whether they should receive drug treatment is unclear, but they do require longer-term follow-up as many will develop sustained hypertension".

Aim

The "2022 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Aortic Disease" provides recommendations to guide clinicians in the diagnosis, genetic evaluation and family screening, medical therapy, endovascular and surgical treatment, and long-term surveillance of patients with aortic disease across its multiple clinical presentation subsets (ie, asymptomatic, stable symptomatic, and acute aortic syndromes).

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from January 2021 to April 2021, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINHL Complete, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline. Additional relevant studies, published through June 2022 during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee, where appropriate. Structure: Recommendations from previously published AHA/ACC guidelines on thoracic aortic disease, peripheral artery disease, and bicuspid aortic valve disease have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. In addition, new recommendations addressing comprehensive care for patients with aortic disease have been developed. There is added emphasis on the role of shared decision making, especially in the management of patients with aortic disease both before and during pregnancy. The is also an increased emphasis on the importance of institutional interventional volume and multidisciplinary aortic team expertise in the care of patients with aortic disease.

Treatment of hypertension — Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials indicate that a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) or a 5 mmHg reduction in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is associated with reductions in all major cardiovascular (CV) events by ~20%, all-cause mortality by ~10–15%, stroke by ~35%, coronary events by ~20%, and heart failure by ~40%, and these relative risk reductions are consistent irrespective of baseline BP within the hypertensive range, the level of CV risk, comorbidities, age, sex, and ethnicity.

Task Force 7 myocardial recovery guidelines — measuring blood pressure in left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients: Class IIa states that accurate reliable measurement of blood pressure in LVAD is key in reducing LVAD related adverse events and titrating medical therapy to promote recovery; careful attention should be paid to aortic valve opening, hemodynamic status, and degree of pulsatility when interpreting non-invasive BP measurements; anti-hypertensives used (as needed) where possible should be consistent with HF GDMT to help promote reverse-remodeling and improvement in myocardial function; and neurohormonal blockade and beta blockers should be preferentially chosen for the treatment of hypertension during LVAD support. Class IIb notes that the appearance of new hypertension or a significant change in pulse pressure should warrant further investigation for recovery.
