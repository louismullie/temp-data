## Question

corticosteroids in ARDS

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether corticosteroids should be used in ARDS, including when, how, and in whom, and what the risks and uncertainties are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the heterogeneity of ARDS. Then, I should verify the historical evolution of evidence from early high-dose regimens to modern low-to-moderate dose strategies. Next, I will examine pivotal trials and contemporary meta-analyses to quantify benefits and harms. After that, I need to check guideline positions and reconcile any differences. Then, I should identify key modifiers such as timing, etiology, and phenotype. Finally, I will translate this into practical, safety-conscious recommendations and highlight knowledge gaps that still need research.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this question is hard to answer. ARDS is a heterogeneous syndrome defined by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral infiltrates and non-cardiogenic edema, with mortality historically around 35–45% and substantial morbidity among survivors, so any pharmacologic signal must overcome both biological variability and the confounding effects of supportive care advances like lung-protective ventilation and prone positioning [^1175wryg] [^115Pu1L8].

> I need to check the historical trajectory of evidence. Early trials of high-dose, short-course corticosteroids failed to show benefit and sometimes harmed patients, which shifted attention to prolonged, low-to-moderate dose regimens initiated earlier in the disease course, a paradigm that aligns better with ARDS pathobiology of dysregulated inflammation and fibroproliferation in later phases [^1149jwqP] [^1113XDYb].

> Next, I should review pivotal trials. The ARDSNet LAZARUS trial in persistent ARDS showed no mortality benefit and suggested harm when steroids were started after day 14, despite improvements in oxygenation and ventilator-free days, which cautions me about late initiation and reinforces the importance of timing in any recommendation [^112wkX3F]. Wait, let me verify the direction of harm — yes, enrollment beyond 14 days was associated with higher 60- and 180-day mortality, so I should avoid starting steroids very late in the course [^112wkX3F]. In contrast, the DEXA-ARDS multicenter RCT in moderate-to-severe ARDS found dexamethasone increased ventilator-free days by about 4.8 days and reduced 60-day mortality from 36% to 21%, supporting early, short-course therapy in appropriately selected patients [^112Xcgd7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from single trials. I should double-check pooled evidence. Contemporary meta-analyses pooling 17–19 RCTs and approximately 2,790 patients show a modest but consistent mortality reduction with corticosteroids, with relative risk around 0.82–0.84 and absolute risk reduction near 3–5%, alongside improvements in ventilator-free days and oxygenation, though with increased hyperglycemia and uncertain effects on neuromuscular weakness and infection risk [^1123UdvM] [^114wJ7CP] [^1153wEmJ]. I should confirm that these analyses exclude outdated high-dose regimens; yes, they focus on modern low-to-moderate dose strategies, which strengthens external validity to current practice [^1143Bbga].

> Now, I will examine guideline positions and reconcile any discrepancies. The 2024 American Thoracic Society guideline issues a conditional recommendation to use corticosteroids in ARDS based on moderate-certainty evidence for mortality reduction, while emphasizing heterogeneity in dose, agent, and timing and calling for individualized decisions and close monitoring [^1175gJRH] [^114wJ7CP]. The 2024 SCCM focused update similarly issues a conditional recommendation for adults with ARDS, noting that updated analyses did not demonstrate a differential effect by steroid type or timing, and therefore no specific molecule or regimen is endorsed beyond the general suggestion to use corticosteroids in ARDS [^114Gnwzn] [^113i2dNB]. But wait, what if prior guidance was more restrictive? The 2017 SCCM/ESICM guidance suggested methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day for early moderate-to-severe ARDS within 14 days, reflecting the same timing principle even though the 2024 update removed the PaO2/FiO2 threshold and specific agent recommendation, which I should interpret as convergence on early use rather than abandonment of timing considerations [^112aHiZM] [^113i2dNB].

> I need to ensure I identify key modifiers that change the risk–benefit calculus. Timing matters: initiating steroids beyond 14 days is associated with harm in LAZARUS and should be avoided, whereas earlier initiation, particularly within the first week, appears more favorable, though precise thresholds vary across analyses and guidelines [^112wkX3F] [^113i2dNB]. Etiology also matters: influenza-related ARDS shows increased mortality with corticosteroids in observational cohorts, so I should avoid steroids in suspected or confirmed influenza unless there is a compelling non-ARDS indication, whereas COVID-19 ARDS consistently benefits from dexamethasone in randomized trials and meta-analyses, aligning with IDSA guidance [^113CPT6v] [^1118ns7V] [^115VayFK]. Severity and phenotype likely modify response, with hyperinflammatory subphenotypes showing greater steroid responsiveness in retrospective analyses, but I should caution that phenotyping is not yet ready for routine bedside use [^112dDD7E] [^115Pu1L8].

> Let me translate this into practical recommendations, but I should double-check dosing ranges and durations from trials. Reasonable regimens include dexamethasone 20 mg IV daily for 5 days then 10 mg daily for 5 days as used in DEXA-ARDS, or methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day for 7–14 days with a gradual taper to mitigate rebound inflammation, acknowledging that optimal duration remains uncertain and many trials stop at extubation or around 7–10 days [^112Xcgd7] [^113i2dNB] [^113crMig]. I should confirm that abrupt cessation is discouraged; yes, slow tapering over 6–14 days is advised to reduce relapse risk, especially after prolonged courses [^115PB789].

> Next, I should review safety and monitoring. Hyperglycemia is the most consistent adverse effect and requires protocolized insulin therapy, while infection surveillance is essential because steroids can blunt fever and delay recognition of secondary infections. Neuromuscular weakness remains a concern, particularly with prolonged high exposure, so minimizing concomitant neuromuscular blockade and implementing early mobilization are prudent [^114wJ7CP] [^113crMig]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines emphasize vigilance in immunocompromised patients and those in endemic settings; they do, and they also caution that late initiation may worsen outcomes, reinforcing the timing principle [^113crMig].

> I will now examine special populations and edge cases. In immunocompromised hosts, the balance may tilt against routine steroids due to infection risk, though data are limited and decisions should be individualized. In pediatrics, evidence is sparse and adult recommendations should not be extrapolated. In aspiration-related ARDS, small observational data suggest potential benefit, but I should treat this as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^113crMig] [^111dt3J3] [^115aFy7a]. For COVID-19 ARDS, dexamethasone is standard of care based on multiple RCTs and meta-analyses, and this should be integrated with ARDS best practices rather than considered separately [^1118ns7V] [^115VayFK].

> But wait, what about the strength of evidence and remaining uncertainties? The mortality signal is modest and the recommendation is conditional, largely due to heterogeneity in regimens, limited long-term outcome data, and the inclusion of many COVID-19 patients in pooled analyses. Ongoing large trials like GuARDS and CORT-E2 may refine agent selection, dosing, and duration, and future work should prioritize phenotype-guided enrichment and longer follow-up for functional outcomes and adverse events [^112FpHoD] [^112R2TWa].

> Putting this together, my bottom line is that corticosteroids can be considered for adults with moderate-to-severe ARDS, ideally initiated within the first week and avoided after day 14, with a preference for low-to-moderate dose regimens such as dexamethasone 20→10 mg daily for 10 days or methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day for 7–14 days with taper, while avoiding use in influenza-related ARDS and applying extra caution in immunocompromised patients. Decisions should be individualized, aligned with guideline-supported supportive care, and accompanied by glucose monitoring and infection surveillance [^112Xcgd7] [^1175gJRH] [^114Gnwzn] [^113CPT6v] [^113crMig].

Corticosteroids are **conditionally recommended** for ARDS by the 2024 ATS guideline [^1175gJRH] based on moderate-certainty evidence of reduced mortality and shorter mechanical ventilation, with a typical regimen of dexamethasone 20 mg IV daily for 5 days then 10 mg daily for 5 days [^112Xcgd7]. Benefits are most pronounced when started **within 14 days** of ARDS onset [^114iPFTc], and harm may occur if initiated after day 14 [^113crMig]. Hyperglycemia is the most common adverse effect [^112Xcgd7]; infection risk is uncertain but warrants vigilance [^113crMig]. Routine use is not supported in influenza-related ARDS due to potential harm [^113CPT6v] [^117UEQHu]. Overall, corticosteroids are a reasonable adjunct to lung-protective ventilation and prone positioning in moderate-to-severe ARDS, with individualized risk–benefit assessment [^115q8p1p].

## Clinical evidence supporting corticosteroid use in ARDS

### Major randomized controlled trials

- **DEXA-ARDS trial**: Dexamethasone 20 mg IV daily for 5 days then 10 mg daily for 5 days increased ventilator-free days and reduced 60-day mortality in moderate-to-severe ARDS [^112Xcgd7].

- **ARDS Network trial**: Methylprednisolone started ≥ 7 days after onset improved oxygenation and ventilation duration but did not reduce 60-day mortality; initiation ≥ 14 days increased mortality [^112wkX3F].

- **COVID-19 ARDS**: Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show dexamethasone reduces mortality in COVID-19 ARDS [^1118ns7V].

---

### Meta-analyses and systematic reviews

Meta-analyses show a **modest mortality reduction** (RR ~0.84) and fewer ventilator days with corticosteroids, with moderate certainty of evidence [^1123UdvM] [^114wJ7CP]. However, **heterogeneity** remains substantial across trials, with variability in agent, dose, timing, and patient population [^113crMig].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** | **Certainty of evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| ATS 2024 | Conditional recommendation for corticosteroids in ARDS | Moderate |
| SCCM 2024 | Conditional recommendation for corticosteroids in ARDS | Moderate |
| ESICM/SCCM 2017 | Consider methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day for early moderate-to-severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 < 200, ≤ 14 days) | Moderate |

---

## Optimal corticosteroid regimen

- **Agent**: Dexamethasone is the most studied and recommended; methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone are alternatives [^notfound].

- **Dose and duration**: Dexamethasone 20 mg IV daily for 5 days, then 10 mg daily for 5 days; total 10 days [^112Xcgd7].

- **Timing**: Initiate within 14 days of ARDS onset; avoid starting after day 14 due to potential harm [^112wkX3F] [^113kj1vd].

---

## Potential benefits of corticosteroid therapy

- **Mortality reduction**: Modest but consistent reduction in mortality [^1153wEmJ] [^114wJ7CP].

- **Shorter ventilation**: Reduced duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay [^112Xcgd7] [^1143Bbga].

- **Oxygenation**: Rapid improvement in oxygenation and lung compliance [^112wkX3F].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

- **Hyperglycemia**: Increased risk; requires close monitoring and insulin therapy [^114wJ7CP].

- **Infections**: Uncertain but possible increase; vigilant surveillance is recommended [^113crMig].

- **Neuromuscular weakness**: Possible association, especially with prolonged high-dose use [^112wkX3F].

- **Psychiatric effects**: Anxiety, agitation, and sleep disturbances may occur [^112R2TWa].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from corticosteroids

Moderate-to-severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200) benefits from **early corticosteroids** [^112Xcgd7] [^113kj1vd]. COVID-19 ARDS shows clear mortality benefit with dexamethasone [^1118ns7V]. Early ARDS (≤ 14 days) responds favorably, whereas **late initiation (> 14 days)** should be avoided [^112wkX3F] [^114iPFTc].

---

## Patient populations not benefiting or harmed by corticosteroids

Influenza-related ARDS may experience **increased mortality and infections** with corticosteroids [^113CPT6v] [^117UEQHu]. Mild ARDS lacks sufficient evidence to support routine corticosteroid use [^113CPT6v]. Immunocompromised patients warrant caution due to infection risk; decisions should be individualized [^113crMig].

---

## Current research gaps and ongoing studies

- **Optimal regimen**: Dose, duration, and agent remain uncertain; ongoing trials may clarify [^112FpHoD].

- **Subphenotypes**: Hyperinflammatory vs hypoinflammatory phenotypes may respond differently; precision strategies are under study [^111Uc5XU].

- **Long-term outcomes**: More data are needed on neurocognitive and functional outcomes [^112R2TWa].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Use**: Consider corticosteroids for moderate-to-severe ARDS, especially early in the course [^113kj1vd].

- **Regimen**: Dexamethasone 20 mg IV daily for 5 days, then 10 mg daily for 5 days [^112Xcgd7].

- **Avoid**: Do not start after day 14; avoid in influenza-related ARDS [^112wkX3F] [^113CPT6v].

- **Monitor**: Close monitoring for hyperglycemia, infections, and neuropsychiatric effects [^114wJ7CP].

---

Corticosteroids are **conditionally recommended** for ARDS, with the clearest benefits when started early in moderate-to-severe disease; dexamethasone 20→10 mg over 10 days is a pragmatic, evidence-based regimen. Clinicians should individualize use, avoid late initiation, and monitor for adverse effects, especially in influenza-related ARDS and immunocompromised patients [^113crMig].

### Exploring the heterogeneity of effects of corticosteroids on acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1148MJAm]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) were used as measurements of association. Outcome measures were pooled using a random-effects model because of anticipated heterogeneity among included studies. We treated risk ratio and hazard ratio as RR when pooling across studies. We estimated the point estimate and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the summary effect estimate (RR or RD). RCTs and cohort studies were analyzed separately. When one arm of a study contained no events, 0.5 was added to all cells of the two-by-two table. Heterogeneity was explored using the Q statistic and I 2. Heterogeneity was considered low, moderate, and high by I 2 values of 25%, 50%, and 75%, respectively. We hypothesized that the treatment response to corticosteroids in ARDS patients may vary by different mortality endpoints, by different etiologies of ARDS, and by different timing for starting treatment. We, therefore, conducted subgroup analyses to explore whether the treatment response varied by these variables of interest. All tests were two-sided and P values of < 0.05 were deemed significant. The data were analyzed using Stata software, V.11 (StataCorp).

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome [^114wZ6qR]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterised by lung inflammation with severe hypoxia, which usually develops over 4–48 hours and persists for days or weeks. The main causes of ARDS are infections, aspiration of gastric contents, and trauma. Between a third and a half of people with ARDS die from the disease, but mortality depends on the underlying cause. Some survivors have long-term respiratory or cognitive problems.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of interventions in adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to August 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 21 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: corticosteroids, low tidal volume mechanical ventilation, nitric oxide, prone position, and protective ventilation.

Corticosteroids rationale and ARDS evidence — early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, recommendations cautioned against systemic corticosteroids due to risk of worsening clinical status, delayed viral clearance, and adverse events, yet given the hyper-inflammatory state in COVID-19, immunomodulatory approaches including steroids continue to be evaluated to address ARDS and systemic inflammation; notably, a recent multicenter RCT in moderate to severe ARDS demonstrated a reduced number of ventilatory days and reduction in mortality with use of a 10-day regimen of dexamethasone.

### The role of rescue therapies in the treatment of severe ARDS [^1156Dq2b]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

ARDS is characterized by a non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema with bilateral chest radiograph opacities and hypoxemia refractory to oxygen therapy. It is a common cause of admission to the ICU due to hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Corticosteroids are not recommended in ARDS patients. Rescue therapies alleviate hypoxemia in patients unable to maintain reasonable oxygenation: recruitment maneuvers, prone positioning, inhaled nitric oxide, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation improve oxygenation, but their impact on mortality remains unproven. Restrictive fluid management seems to be a favorable strategy with no significant reduction in 60-d mortality. Future studies are needed to clarify the efficacy of these therapies on outcomes in patients with severe ARDS, and institution of these therapies may be considered on a case-by-case basis.

### Exploring the heterogeneity of effects of corticosteroids on acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117TTFLs]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

External validity should be noted for this meta-analysis. Included individual RCTs reported numerous exclusion criteria for patient enrollment. The results of this meta-analysis should not be generalized to patients with particular comorbidities. Most RCTs excluded patients with underlying diseases that might benefit from corticosteroids, such as inflammatory airway diseases or vasculitis. Were these patients enrolled, the study outcome might be more likely to favor the corticosteroid group. On the other hand, clinical trials also excluded patients with conditions that militate against the use of corticosteroids, such as active gastrointestinal bleeding, disseminated infections, extensive burns or immunocompromised status. Outside the scope of the generalizability of current data, the use of corticosteroids in ARDS should be individually evaluated. Underlying diseases are important considerations to justify the use of corticosteroids.

Strengths and limitations

The strengths of our study include a comprehensive search strategy to include all studies analyzed in previous meta-analyses but not be restricted to these studies and to evaluate short-term and longer-term outcomes of corticosteroid therapy. The diversity of treatment outcomes among different etiologies of ARDS was also evaluated. These analyses help explore the causes of inconsistency among previous meta-analyses and achieve a more concrete suggestion for the use of corticosteroids in ARDS. With inclusion of the data from cohort studies, the disparity between clinical trials and real-world practice was disclosed, and their consistent results or trends helped to increase the robustness of this meta-analysis. In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis to test the influence of study pooling strategy, an analysis that previous meta-analyses did not perform. Our study also has limitations. The number of RCTs and sample size were relatively small. There are only two studies in some subgroup analyses and underpower is a concern. Sparse data are another concern for data pooling by the random-effects model. With respect to the evaluation of an etiology-specific response to corticosteroids, the classification of ARDS etiologies was limited because the mix of study populations was diverse among several studies. Finally, study quality might be a confounding factor that we were unable to control in the subgroup analysis when we try to explore the association between follow-up duration and mortality. Earlier studies tend to be of poor quality and their follow-up duration was also shorter.

### Corticosteroid therapy for coronavirus disease 2019-related acute respiratory distress syndrome: a cohort study with propensity score analysis [^111ubrgm]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) constitutes a pandemic. Since the first confirmed case on January 22, 2020, the virus has been emerged in 216 countries. More than 14,765,000 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported, with an average mortality approaching 4.1% as of July 22, 2020. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to serious socioeconomic consequences worldwide.

Currently, there is no specific treatment or vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Up to 29% of the COVID-19 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as a consequence of cytokine storm. ARDS was the major cause of morbidity. Adjunctive corticosteroids may be theoretically beneficial, and has been widely used by clinicians to suppression of hyperinflammation in COVID-19 patients, especially those with critical illness. However, there was comprehensive controversy on its efficacy, due to the results of observational studies that showed corticosteroid treatment was associated with increased mortality and nosocomial infections for influenza and delayed virus clearance for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

In the early pandemic of COVID-19, lower mortality was reported among the critically ill subgroup of SARS patients treated with corticosteroids in a retrospective study. Since then, evidence is growing that corticosteroid treatment is beneficial for some COVID-19 patients. The Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial from the UK reported reduced mortality in patients treated with oral or intravenous dexamethasone 6 mg/d for up to 10 days. The efficacy was significant only in severe patients who receiving oxygen or invasive mechanical ventilation. A prospective meta-analysis of 7 RCTs of critically ill patients with COVID-19 also showed the association between systemic corticosteroids and lower all-cause mortality. Other two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) did not show benefit on mortality from intravenous dexamethasone or methylprednisolone treatment, but corticosteroid treatment increased ventilator-free days and number of days alive in patients with moderate to severe ARDS. A meta-analysis of corticosteroids on the mortality of ARDS showed beneficial effects of corticosteroids on short-term mortality may be counteracted by the delayed onset of adverse effects, such as secondary infection due to immunosuppression and altered tissue repair. A follow-up period of 28 days in these randomized trials may underestimate the late adverse effects of corticosteroids on all-cause mortality. In addition, most of the aforementioned trials studied dexamethasone, and evidence for methylprednisolone was limited.

### Exploring the heterogeneity of effects of corticosteroids on acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Q9gKF]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Our study demonstrated the diverse treatment effects of corticosteroids among different etiologies of ARDS (Table 2). It is biologically plausible that different etiologies of ARDS have different responses to corticosteroid therapy because the pulmonary fibroproliferative response to injury may occur in an injury-specific rather than a stereotyped manner. The main damage targets differ in ARDS caused by different etiologies. Therefore, it is not surprising that the efficacy of corticosteroid therapy differs among different etiologies. Additionally, our analysis showed that corticosteroids significantly increased mortality in influenza-related ARDS. The poorer outcome may be attributed to prolonged viral shedding and an increased risk of superinfection. An expert review also advised against use of corticosteroids in the management of H1N1 influenza A infection.

The dosage and timing of corticosteroid therapy in ARDS has changed over the last decades. Based on the equivalent doses of methylprednisolone, studies before 1990 usually used a high daily dose (30 mg/kg) and short period (≤ 2 days) regimen to prevent or treat ARDS. In the following two decades, most studies used a protocol of daily dose of ≤ 2 mg/kg with a gradual taper. Some investigators suggested different treatment dosages for early ARDS and persistent ARDS in which a duration of ARDS ≤ 3 days was considered as early ARDS and ≥ 5 days as persistent or unresolving ARDS. The treatment dose was suggested to be ≤ 1 mg/Kg for early ARDS, and 2 mg/Kg for persistent ARDS. We summarized the treatment outcomes of corticosteroid therapy initiated at different stages of ARDS (Table 3). Our analysis found that patients with persistent ARDS seemed more likely to benefit from corticosteroid therapy. In addition, the subgroup analysis of the ARDSnet steroid study suggested against starting corticosteroid therapy > 14 days after the onset of ARDS. These findings suggest a subgroup of ARDS might benefit most from corticosteroid therapy: persistent ARDS with the onset of ARDS < 14 days. Persistent ARDS indicates a specific subgroup or phenotype of ARDS that is characterized by exaggerated or unresolving lung inflammation. In this subgroup, the benefit of corticosteroid therapy may outweigh the treatment risk. Dosage and administration schedules may also affect treatment outcomes of corticosteroids. However, it was difficult to evaluate the effects of these two factors in the study-level analysis. Cohort studies did not use standardized treatment protocols and individual-level data are needed to conduct such analyses. In RCTs, therapeutic trials usually used a low-dose regimen (1 to 2 mg/kg/day) and similar administration schedules.

### Exploring the heterogeneity of effects of corticosteroids on acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113CPT6v]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The effectiveness of corticosteroid therapy on the mortality of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains under debate. We aimed to explore the grounds for the inconsistent results in previous studies and update the evidence.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science up to December 2013. Eligible studies included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and cohort studies that reported mortality and that had corticosteroid nonusers for comparison. The effect of corticosteroids on ARDS mortality was assessed by relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) for ICU, hospital, and 60-day mortality using a random-effects model.

Results

Eight RCTs and 10 cohort studies were included for analysis. In RCTs, corticosteroids had a possible but statistically insignificant effect on ICU mortality (RD, -0.28; 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.53 to -0.03 and RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.24 to 1.25) but no effect on 60-day mortality (RD, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.12 to 0.10 and RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.26). In cohort studies, corticosteroids had no effect on ICU mortality (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.49) but non-significantly increased 60-day mortality (RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.78). In the subgroup analysis by ARDS etiology, corticosteroids significantly increased mortality in influenza-related ARDS (three cohort studies, RR, 2.45, 95% CI, 1.40 to 4.27).

Conclusions

The effects of corticosteroids on the mortality of ARDS differed by duration of outcome measures and etiologies. Corticosteroids did not improve longer-term outcomes and may cause harm in certain subgroups. Current data do not support routine use of corticosteroids in ARDS. More clinical trials are needed to specify the favorable and unfavorable subgroups for corticosteroid therapy.

### Exploring the heterogeneity of effects of corticosteroids on acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1149THEP]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Results

We identified 1,771 citations from the search of electronic databases. Using the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria (Figure 1), seven RCTs, one post-hoc analysis of RCT, and 10 cohort studies were included for evaluation. The post-hoc analysis was classified as RCT for the analysis. Of the eight RCTs, three trials studied preventive rather than therapeutic use of corticosteroids in ARDS. A total of 1,474 subjects were analyzed, including 725 from RCTs and 749 from cohort studies. The details of the included studies are summarized in Additional file 1: e-Table S1. Quality assessment of the included studies suggested a low risk of bias in most RCTs (Additional file 1: e-Table S2) but the comparability and representativeness of the study patients were concerns in cohort studies (Additional file 1: e-Table S3, e-Table S4).

### Prolonged corticosteroid treatment in acute respiratory distress syndrome: impact on mortality and ventilator-free days [^117XhdKy]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

We read with interest the letter by Blot and colleagues recently published in Critical Care which concluded that the recommendations of the Corticosteroid Guideline Task Force of SCCM and ESICM for the use of adjunctive corticosteroids in early moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were based on insufficient evidence. In support of their view, the authors refer to the meta-analysis of Ruan et al. (reference in Blot and colleagues' letter) also published in Critical Care in 2014. We respectfully disagree with their comments and offer the following observations. First, the meta-analysis by Ruan et al. did not take into account how current understanding of disease pathophysiology impacts the administration of corticosteroid treatment in ARDS. The meta-analysis by Ruan et al. incorporated four randomized trials from the 1980s that investigated short-term (24–48 h) massive daily corticosteroid doses (up to 120 mg/kg methylprednisolone equivalent), an intervention that is obsolete and discredited by the present pathophysiological understanding of ARDS. Thus, the inclusion of these trials in the meta-analysis is mostly responsible for the inconsistency reported in their letter. Moreover, the conclusion by Ruan et al. that the benefits of corticosteroid treatment decreased over time are not supported by the actual findings of the cited trials (Figure 3 in, Figure 4 in and Table 5 in).

As the Corticosteroid Guideline Task Force state in the guideline, our recommendation for adjunctive use of corticosteroids in early moderate to severe ARDS is a conditional recommendation and not necessarily meant to imply a standard of care treatment. In our analysis the pooled relative risk estimate for hospital mortality (Fig. 1) with corticosteroids was 0.64 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46–0.89). Even if one excludes the four studies which Blot and colleagues appear to question, the pooled relative risk estimate for hospital mortality is 0.76 (95% CI 0.58–0.99), which is not significantly different from 0.64 (0.46–0.89). Independent of hospital mortality, the use of corticosteroids was associated with approximately a 7-day increase in ventilator-free days (mean difference 7.06 days, 95% CI 3.19–10.93) (supplementary digital content in). Given that our recommendation for adjunctive corticosteroids in ARDS is conditional in nature, ongoing and future prospective trials will certainly impact our future recommendations.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1116v4vi]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This document updates previously published Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), incorporating new evidence addressing the use of corticosteroids, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

Methods

We summarized evidence addressing four "PICO questions" (patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome). A multidisciplinary panel with expertise in ARDS used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to develop clinical recommendations.

Results

We suggest the use of: 1) corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence), 2) venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in selected patients with severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), 3) neuromuscular blockers in patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), and 4) higher PEEP without lung recruitment maneuvers as opposed to lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty), and 5) we recommend against using prolonged lung recruitment maneuvers in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).

Conclusions

We provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the management of ARDS. Individual patient and illness characteristics should be factored into clinical decision making and implementation of these recommendations while additional evidence is generated from much-needed clinical trials.

### Pharmacologic therapies for adults with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome [^114ZTpVZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple pharmacologic treatments have been studied for acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Objectives

Our objective was to determine the effects of pharmacologic treatments on clinical outcomes in adults with ALI or ARDS.

Search Strategy

We searched OVID versions of CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to week 2, January 2004), EMBASE (1980 to week 4, 2004), CINAHL (1982 to week 2, January 2004), and HEALTHSTAR (1995 to December 2003); proceedings from four conferences (1994 to 2003); and bibliographies of review articles and included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of pharmacologic treatments compared to no therapy or placebo for established ALI or ARDS in adults admitted to an intensive care unit, with measurement of early mortality (primary outcome), late mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, ventilator-free days to day 28, or adverse events. We excluded trials of nitric oxide, partial liquid ventilation, fluid and nutritional interventions, oxygen, and trials in other populations reporting outcomes in subgroups of patients with ALI or ARDS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, rated studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed methodologic quality of included studies. Disagreements were resolved by consensus in consultation with a third reviewer. For each pharmacologic therapy, we quantitatively pooled the results of studies using random effects models where permitted by the available data. We contacted study authors when clarification of the primary outcome was required.

Main Results

Thirty three trials randomizing 3272 patients met our inclusion criteria. Pooling of results showed no effect on early mortality of prostaglandin E1 (seven trials randomizing 697 patients; relative risk [RR] 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 1.17), N-acetylcysteine (five trials randomizing 239 patients; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.21), early high-dose corticosteroids (two trials randomizing 187 patients; RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.74), or surfactant (nine trials randomizing 1441 patients; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.12). Two interventions were beneficial in single small trials; corticosteroids given for late phase ARDS reduced hospital mortality (24 patients; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.81), and pentoxifylline reduced one-month mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.95) in 30 patients with metastatic cancer and ARDS. Individual trials of nine additional interventions failed to show a beneficial effect on prespecified outcomes.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Effective pharmacotherapy for ALI and ARDS is extremely limited, with insufficient evidence to support any specific intervention.

### Do we know enough to recommend corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome? [^114XAbFT]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

We read with interest the evidence-based recommendations for the use of prolonged corticosteroids in early moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) published in Critical Care Medicine by the Corticosteroid Guideline Task Force of SCCM and ESICM. Whether corticosteroids have to be administered in adult patients with ARDS remains a matter of debate. Based on nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including eight RCTs selected in the meta-analysis of Meduri et al. and one additional recent RCT, the task force found that the use of prolonged corticosteroids in early ARDS has a beneficial effect on in-hospital mortality (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.89). However, several caveats and limitations must be pointed out.

First, two trials from the meta-analysis (Rezk 2013, Sabry 2011), which were not found in the Medline/PubMed database, are at high risk of bias (especially concerning the blinding of participants and staff), and two others (Confalonieri 2005, Liu 2012), which show impressive results, are questionable. Indeed, in the Confalonieri study, delayed septic shock was far more often observed in the placebo group (52%) than in the hydrocortisone group (0%). It is unlikely that such a difference can be attributed to a beneficial effect of hydrocortisone in light of the results of the HYPRESS multicenter trial that showed that hydrocortisone did not prevent progression from severe sepsis to septic shock. In the Liu study, there was a major attrition bias since the placebo group showed markedly significant higher baseline arterial lactate concentrations.

As a result, Ruan et al.'s meta-analysis, which did not include these four small trials, found that corticosteroids in ARDS did not improve longer-term outcomes and even more could be harmful in certain subgroups, such as influenza-related ARDS.

In addition, corticosteroids did not seem to have significant side effects other than hyperglycemia. However, it can be speculated that the rate of side effects should be higher in a real-life population of ARDS, as patients with immunodepression, uncontrolled diabetes or at high risk of side effects were not included in these trials.

Considering all these points, we believe that the recommendations of the task force for adjunctive corticosteroids in ARDS are based on insufficient evidence, and at least should be limited to the subset of patients who could have been included in the supportive trials. It thus seems rather prudent to wait for the results of the ongoing multicentric trials evaluating this strategy.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1133Sizs]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) guideline — conclusions provide conditional recommendations supporting the use of corticosteroids in ARDS, VV-ECMO in selected patients with severe ARDS, neuromuscular blockers in early severe ARDS, and higher PEEP without LRMs in moderate to severe ARDS. With regard to differences from ESICM guidance, the document states "we suggest the use of higher PEEP in select patients" and clarifies that the recommendation is narrower "with regard to the patient population (moderate to severe ARDS only) and intervention (higher PEEP without accompanying recruitment maneuvers)"; for neuromuscular blocking agents, it notes "we suggest its use in early severe ARDS". For performance measurement, the committee determined that none of the new recommendations are suitable; measures retained from 2017 specify ventilation strategies limiting tidal volume to 4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight with inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O) in ARDS, and prone positioning for > 12 hours per day in severe ARDS.

### Early corticosteroids in severe influenza A / H1N1 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome [^117UEQHu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Rationale

Despite their controversial role, corticosteroids are often administered to patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to viral pneumonia.

Objectives

To analyze the impact of corticosteroid therapy on outcomes of patients having ARDS associated with influenza A/H1N1 pneumonia.

Methods

Patients from the French registry of critically ill patients with influenza A/H1N1v 2009 infection were selected if fulfilling criteria for ARDS, excluding patients having other indication for corticosteroids, or decompensated underlying disease as the primary cause for intensive care unit admission. Survival to hospital discharge was analyzed using Cox regression, accounting for the time to administration of steroids, and after adjustment on the propensity for receiving steroid therapy.

Measurements and Main Results

Of 208 patients with ARDS, 83 (39.9%) received corticosteroids (median initial dose of 270 mg equivalent hydrocortisone per day for a median of 11 d). Steroid therapy was associated with death, both in crude analysis (33.7 vs. 16.8%; hazard ratio, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3–4.3; P = 0.004) and after propensity score-adjusted analysis (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.5–5.4; P = 0.002), controlling for an admission severity Simplified Acute Physiology Score, version 3, greater than 50, initial administration of vasopressors, and immunodepression. Early therapy (≤ 3 d of mechanical ventilation) appeared more strongly associated with mortality than late administration. Patients receiving steroids had more acquired pneumonia and a trend to a longer duration of ventilation.

Conclusions

Our study provides no evidence of a beneficial effect of corticosteroids in patients with ARDS secondary to influenza pneumonia, but suggests that very early corticosteroid therapy may be harmful.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — Special considerations and dosing note that "The 2017 SCCM/ESICM guidelines had previously recommended giving methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/d within 14 days of the diagnosis of moderate to severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ratio of < 200) (4)". This panel "decided to remove the qualifier based on PaO2/FiO2 ratio from the most recent recommendation". Updated analysis "did not demonstrate a differential effect based on corticosteroid timing or type or dosage", so "a specific recommendation was not made for corticosteroid molecules". Reported dosing "range from 40 mg/d to 2 mg/kg/d of methylprednisolone equivalent with a common duration ranging from 7 to 30 days", and common molecules in RCTs include "Methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone with or without fludrocortisone".

### Corticosteroids in treatment of aspiration-related acute respiratory distress syndrome: results of a retrospective cohort study [^115aFy7a]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Excessive and protracted inflammation is the pathophysiological basis of ARDS, which would result in multi-organ dysfunction and even death. Corticosteroids are added to the medications because of their important role as anti-inflammatory elements. However, the role of corticosteroids in managing ARDS remains uncertain because of insufficient scientific evidence to provide clinicians with clear and robust guidance. Although existing studies were unable to provide clear evidence of the benefits or harmful effects of corticosteroids, some studies pointed out that patients would benefit patients from steroid administration after the onset of ARDS, particularly to reduce mortality. A systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the use of low-dose corticosteroids was associated with improved mortality and morbidity outcomes without notable side effects.

In the present study, corticosteroid therapy was administered in 64.6% of patients with aspiration-related ARDS, among which 66.0% responded to the treatment. The mean daily dose of methylprednisolone (or its equivalent) was 1.14 (SD 0.47) mg/kg, and the mean duration of treatment was 7.3 (SD 3.8) days. Based on our results, corticosteroid therapy was an independent protective factor for hospital mortality, which suggests that low-dose and short-term corticosteroid use might indeed be beneficial for patients with aspiration-related ARDS. Response to corticosteroid therapy, whether it is ineffective, effective, or toxic, is influenced by the dosage used and duration of the administration. The clinical side effects of systemic corticosteroids should not be ignored, such as new infection, hyperglycemia and GIB. One major concern is the high risk of infection, especially aspiration induced lung abscess, secondary to immunosuppression. The adverse events often lead to undesired results. High-dose and long-term corticosteroid therapy may cause serious side effects. In our study, the occurrence of adverse events did not differ between the patients treated with and without the low-dose and short-term corticosteroid schedule. Consequently, in future studies to elucidate the role of corticosteroids in aspiration-related ARDS, it should be taken into account not only which subset of patients can potentially benefit from its administration, but also the optimal dose and duration of corticosteroid therapy. Only in this way, we can achieve the balance between the beneficial and harmful effects of the inflammatory response.

Recommendations for Specific Treatment Questions

Question 1: Should Patients with ARDS Receive Systemic Corticosteroids?

Recommendation

We suggest using corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence).

Background

Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory medications that inhibit the synthesis of proinflammatory mediators present in ARDS. They are widely administered to patients with ARDS for the management of ARDS specifically and for concurrent conditions such as septic shock or pneumonia. More recently, corticosteroids have been found to reduce mortality in COVID-19–related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and severe community-acquired pneumonia. Corticosteroids were not addressed in the 2017 guidelines. Since that time, several multicenter RCTs evaluating the effect of corticosteroids on patients with ARDS have been published, prompting a recommendation for this intervention.

Evidence summary

Corticosteroids were evaluated in 19 RCTs including 2,790 patients. Pooled analysis demonstrated that corticosteroids probably decrease mortality (n = 17 studies; RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73–0.96; moderate certainty) and may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation (n = 9 studies; mean difference (MD), 4 d less; 95% CI, −5.5 to −2.5; low certainty) and the length of hospital stay (n = 4 studies; MD, 8 d shorter; 95% CI, −13 to −3; low certainty), although the effect on the length of ICU stay is uncertain (n = 4 studies; MD, 0.8 d shorter; 95% CI, −4.1 to +5.7; very low certainty). With regard to safety outcomes, corticosteroids probably increase the risk of serious hyperglycemia (n = 6 studies; RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01–1.23; moderate certainty), may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 5 studies; RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.43–3.34; low certainty), and have an uncertain effect on neuromuscular weakness (n = 2 studies; RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.62–1.18; very low certainty).

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^113R7BZM]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

New evidence is available examining the use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), warranting a focused update of the 2017 guideline on critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency.

Objectives

To develop evidence-based recommendations for use of corticosteroids in hospitalized adults and children with sepsis, ARDS, and CAP.

Panel Design

The 22-member panel included diverse representation from medicine, including adult and pediatric intensivists, pulmonologists, endocrinologists, nurses, pharmacists, and clinician-methodologists with expertise in developing evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines. We followed Society of Critical Care Medicine conflict of interest policies in all phases of the guideline development, including task force selection and voting.

Methods

After development of five focused Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes (PICO) questions, we conducted systematic reviews to identify the best available evidence addressing each question. We evaluated the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach and formulated recommendations using the evidence-to-decision framework.

Results

In response to the five PICOs, the panel issued four recommendations addressing the use of corticosteroids in patients with sepsis, ARDS, and CAP. These included a conditional recommendation to administer corticosteroids for patients with septic shock and critically ill patients with ARDS and a strong recommendation for use in hospitalized patients with severe CAP. The panel also recommended against high dose/short duration administration of corticosteroids for septic shock. In response to the final PICO regarding type of corticosteroid molecule in ARDS, the panel was unable to provide specific recommendations addressing corticosteroid molecule, dose, and duration of therapy, based on currently available evidence.

Conclusions

The panel provided updated recommendations based on current evidence to inform clinicians, patients, and other stakeholders on the use of corticosteroids for sepsis, ARDS, and CAP.

### Exploring the heterogeneity of effects of corticosteroids on acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Xt9yG]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite advances in critical care medicine over the past decades, the mortality rate for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains high. Because dysregulated inflammation is the cardinal feature of ARDS, systemic corticosteroids have been considered a potentially beneficial therapy. However, previous randomized trials have failed to provide convincing evidence to prove the efficacy of corticosteroids in decreasing the mortality of ARDS. Only secondary outcomes, such as oxygenation improvement and reduction of the duration of mechanical ventilation, have shown consistent findings in favor of corticosteroid therapy.

Published meta-analyses about corticosteroid therapy for ARDS reported inconsistent conclusions. Different study selections and heterogeneity on mortality endpoints and etiologies of ARDS may account for the inconsistent study results in previous meta-analyses. Measuring the treatment effects at short-term or longer-term follow-up may influence study results, because therapeutic effects of corticosteroids develop early but some adverse effects, such as infection, develop late. Using short-term outcome as the study endpoint may underestimate the risk of corticosteroid therapy and overestimate the overall benefit. In addition, the mechanisms of lung injury and fibroproliferative response to injury vary in pulmonary and extrapulmonary ARDS. Therefore, the treatment response to corticosteroids in ARDS may be different in ARDS of different etiologies. However, the influence of the etiologies of ARDS on outcomes of corticosteroid therapy has not been evaluated in previous studies.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of corticosteroid therapy in ARDS with the aim of updating the best available evidence and exploring the source of observed heterogeneity.

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^1116cD52]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Methodology and recommendation framework — Four of the five PICO questions had recent systematic reviews; reviewers used Covidence to screen studies, performed data extraction and risk of bias assessment independently and in duplicate, used Revman, v.5.3, for pooled analysis, assessed certainty with GRADE and created evidence profiles with GRADEPro, and applied the Instrument for assessing Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses (ICEMAN). Recommendations were developed using the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision framework, designated as strong (using the phrasing "we recommend") or conditional (using the phrasing "we suggest"), and after discussion the panel elected to not provide a specific recommendation for the PICO question addressing corticosteroid molecules in ARDS. Voting was by formal web-based vote, and consensus was defined as 80% agreement among at least 75% of panel members.

### Are corticosteroids useful in late-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome? [^111CNZvz]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by intense inflammation and alveolar-capillary disruption that can progress to a state of unresolving inflammation and disordered fibrosis, referred to as fibroproliferative, late-stage, or persistent ARDS. These pathophysiologic features may be responsive to corticosteroids, but early high-dose, short-duration therapy was proven ineffective. More recently, several small and one moderate-size multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigated low-to-moderate-dose prolonged corticosteroid treatment. The RCT and meta-analysis consistently demonstrated improved oxygenation and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation with methylprednisolone. The largest RCT also revealed less pneumonia and shock, and shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stay, but more cases of severe myoneuropathy, with methylprednisolone. There were virtually identical 60-day and 180-day mortality rates for methylprednisolone and placebo in the largest RCT. Sub-group analysis of that study showed significantly higher mortality with methylprednisolone than with placebo when enrollment occurred > 13 days after onset of ARDS, but small sample size and differences in subject characteristics probably confound those results. Most meta-analyses demonstrated trends toward better survival with methylprednisolone, and, when restricted to patients enrolled in RCTs who received prolonged administration of methylprednisolone that was initiated within the first 14 days of ARDS, one meta-analysis demonstrated better survival with corticosteroids. Importantly, the aforementioned studies have methodological limitations, and the number of subjects enrolled was small. Experts differ in their recommendations regarding corticosteroids for late-stage ARDS, although one consensus group supported a "weak" recommendation of low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids for ARDS of < 14 days duration. If corticosteroids are administered, infection surveillance, avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, and gradual taper of corticosteroids are recommended.

Corticosteroids in sepsis and septic shock — evidence summary reports that a total of 46 randomized controlled trials compared corticosteroids to placebo or standard care in sepsis or septic shock, with populations spanning sepsis (seven trials), CAP and sepsis (five), ARDS and sepsis (four), and the remainder septic shock; six trials examined pediatric patients, one included both adults and children, and the remainder included only adults. Corticosteroid use may reduce hospital/long-term mortality (from 60 d to 1 yr) (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–1.00, low certainty) and probably reduces ICU/short-term mortality (14–30 d) (RR 0.93; 95% Cl, 0.88–0.98, moderate certainty) in patients with sepsis or septic shock, and subgroup analysis based on corticosteroid type, duration, or dosage did not demonstrate any credible subgroup effects.

Discussion

Although significant advancements have been made in the management of ARDS, many questions remain. Several recommendations in this guideline are conditional in nature and, as such, require careful evaluation of patient and illness characteristics when considering their use. Future studies may serve to strengthen these recommendations or provide additional caveats to their implementation. Measures with more established evidence of benefit also exist, including lung protective ventilation for all patients with ARDS and prone positioning for those with severe ARDS. Although strong recommendations in favor of these measures have previously been made, translating evidence into practice has been fraught with challenges. Considerable practice variation exists in ARDS management, and evidence-based modalities remain underused. This underuse is associated with increased mortality, suggesting that there is significant opportunity to improve ARDS outcomes. To maximize these opportunities, future efforts must be made to facilitate access to readily available, granular data about ARDS management practices in real-world settings to allow for benchmarking, auditing, and continuous quality improvement. Additionally, it is crucial to understand the clinician-, systems-, and patient-level barriers to, and facilitators of, the use of evidence-based supportive care in ARDS to inform a comprehensive approach to implementation.

In addition to implementation research, there are several opportunities to address other areas of uncertainty. Much remains unknown about the impact of supportive measures used for ARDS on the long-term outcomes of survivors, an issue of vital importance to patients. There is a critical need for future clinical trials to not only consistently collect these data, but also to involve patient and family representatives to help identify and guide the selection of specific outcomes to study. There are also other modalities used in a small but significant minority of patients with ARDS, such as pulmonary vasodilators and alternative ventilator modes, for which further data are needed before meaningful recommendations can be made. Additionally, although supportive therapies are often used in combination rather than in isolation, it remains unknown whether combination treatments are synergistic. Treatment effects can also vary across individuals, a concept known as heterogeneity of treatment effect, which is an issue that may be especially relevant to ARDS. There is substantial heterogeneity in ARDS, including patient characteristics, underlying etiologies, mechanisms of injury, and degrees of severity. In light of these issues, there has been growing interest in identifying homogeneous subgroups in ARDS with potential differential responses to treatment. Although the methods for subphenotyping patients with ARDS are currently investigational, the identification of distinct subsets of patients may provide an opportunity to improve patient selection for clinical trials in the future and ultimately increase the likelihood of finding effective interventions.

Table 3
Subgroup analysis by timing of starting corticosteroid therapy

Three studies were excluded in this analysis due to no report of treatment timing.

Published meta-analyses reached inconsistent conclusions on the role of corticosteroids for ARDS. We summarize the study conclusions and study selection strategy of previous meta-analyses in Table 4. Among the included studies in these meta-analyses, an extremely protective effect for corticosteroids was observed in the two studies published by Meduri, but the effects were neutral and modest in other trials. In addition, inclusion or exclusion of trials of using corticosteroids in severe pneumonia into analysis also had an impact on the results of meta-analysis. Confalonieri and Meduri reported remarkable mortality reduction by corticosteroid therapy in a severe pneumonia study. Previous meta-analyses reporting significant mortality reduction of corticosteroid therapy usually included this pneumonia study. However, a large cohort study using a registry database reported that low-dose corticosteroids were associated with an increased mortality in pneumonia with septic shock.

Table 4
Comparisons of published meta-analyses

ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; RCTs, randomized controlled trials.

Systemic corticosteroid therapy may bring several unfavorable side effects, and one major concern in patients with ARDS is an increased risk of nosocomial infection secondary to immunosuppression. Because symptoms and signs of early infection may be masked by corticosteroids, previous RCTs performed intensive infection surveillance procedures during the study to reduce the risk of superinfection. However, these intensive surveillance procedures are not always performed outside of clinical studies. Our analysis showed that the infection risks reported in RCTs and cohort studies were conflicting (Figure 3). It is not known whether restrictive patient selection and infection surveillance procedures in RCTs played a role in making such a difference. Similar to the concern for mortality outcomes, the infection risk of corticosteroid therapy should be evaluated in an adequate time frame because the immunosuppressive effect may develop late in the clinical course. However, most studies evaluated infectious complications in a short duration (Additional file 1: e-Table S6) and the infection risk of corticosteroid therapy might, therefore, be underestimated.

### Efficacy and safety of corticosteroids for persistent acute respiratory distress syndrome [^112wkX3F]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

Persistent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by excessive fibroproliferation, ongoing inflammation, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and a substantial risk of death. Because previous reports suggested that corticosteroids may improve survival, we performed a multicenter, randomized controlled trial of corticosteroids in patients with persistent ARDS.

Methods

We randomly assigned 180 patients with ARDS of at least seven days' duration to receive either methylprednisolone or placebo in a double-blind fashion. The primary end point was mortality at 60 days. Secondary end points included the number of ventilator-free days and organ-failure-free days, biochemical markers of inflammation and fibroproliferation, and infectious complications.

Results

At 60 days, the hospital mortality rate was 28.6 percent in the placebo group (95 percent confidence interval, 20.3 to 38.6 percent) and 29.2 percent in the methylprednisolone group (95 percent confidence interval, 20.8 to 39.4 percent; P = 1.0); at 180 days, the rates were 31.9 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 23.2 to 42.0 percent) and 31.5 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 22.8 to 41.7 percent; P = 1.0), respectively. Methylprednisolone was associated with significantly increased 60- and 180-day mortality rates among patients enrolled at least 14 days after the onset of ARDS. Methylprednisolone increased the number of ventilator-free and shock-free days during the first 28 days in association with an improvement in oxygenation, respiratory-system compliance, and blood pressure with fewer days of vasopressor therapy. As compared with placebo, methylprednisolone did not increase the rate of infectious complications but was associated with a higher rate of neuromuscular weakness.

Conclusions

These results do not support the routine use of methylprednisolone for persistent ARDS despite the improvement in cardiopulmonary physiology. In addition, starting methylprednisolone therapy more than two weeks after the onset of ARDS may increase the risk of death. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00295269.).

### Evidence-based management of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome [^11535JdU]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

This report explores the efficacy of existing therapies for acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), primarily in terms of clinically important outcomes such as the duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital mortality. Of the 15 therapies reviewed, the strongest evidence suggests that ALI/ARDS should be managed with a low-tidal-volume, pressure-limited approach, with either low or moderately high positive end-expiratory pressure. To date there have been few large, sufficiently powered, randomized controlled clinical trials of ALI/ARDS therapies that addressed patient outcomes. However, there is relatively strong evidence to support conservative fluid management and high-fat, anti-oxidant nutritional formulations. Although most pharmacologic ALI/ARDS therapies have been ineffective, high-dose methylprednisolone is indicated in the subgroups of ALI/ARDS patients who have pneumonia or are at risk of ARDS due to fat embolization.

### Physiological and clinical variables identify ARDS classes and therapeutic heterogeneity to glucocorticoids: a retrospective study [^111Uc5XU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a complex and heterogeneous clinical syndrome defined on the basis of clinical criteria. In the 50 years since Ashbaugh and colleagues first described ARDS, substantial progress has been made in identifying causative factors of the syndrome and improving ventilatory support for patients. Although the mechanisms that cause ARDS are now better understood than ever before and decades of progress have been made in the experimental understanding of ARDS and in preclinical studies to identify potentially effective new therapies, most clinical trials of ARDS have not shown a benefit in terms of mortality. In recent years, an explanation for the failure of these clinical trials has been proposed, namely, that ARDS has widely defined criteria, which inevitably leads to clinical and biological heterogeneity. The large amount of clinical and biological heterogeneity in this syndrome is widely recognized as an important barrier to identifying effective treatments for ARDS.

To reduce heterogeneity, recent studies have focused on identifying specific ARDS subphenotypes or endophenotypes of patients who either have a higher risk of disease-related outcomes (prognostic enrichment) or respond differently to treatment (predictive enrichment), allowing for accurate drug trials in critical care. In 2014, Calfee and colleagues conducted a review of two reanalyses of baseline clinical and plasma biomarker data from patients with ARDS in randomized controlled trials (RCTs; the ARMA study and the ALVEOLI study) and identified two ARDS subgroups: a hyperinflammatory phenotype characterized by higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers, shock, metabolic acidosis, and mortality, and a second, non-hyperinflammatory phenotype. In addition, Famous et al. used latent class analysis to reanalyze baseline clinical and biomarker data from 1000 patients with ARDS in the RCT "Fluid and Catheterization Trial" (FACTT) and identified two different phenotypes that were similar but responded differently to fluid management strategies. A number of subsequent ARDS subphenotype studies have also identified two distinct ARDS phenotypes with similar clinical outcomes (mortality, ventilator-free days, organ failure-free days and days in the intensive care unit [ICU]). Importantly, with respect to the idea that the temporal evolution of ARDS may influence subphenotype assignment, studies have shown that both ARDS phenotypes remain stable over 3 days. Predictive enrichment has also been identified for both phenotypes in terms of differential treatment response to positive end-expiratory pressure strategies, fluid therapy, and simvastatin.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1175gJRH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: This document updates previously published Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), incorporating new evidence addressing the use of corticosteroids, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Methods: We summarized evidence addressing four "PICO questions" (patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome). A multidisciplinary panel with expertise in ARDS used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to develop clinical recommendations. Results: We suggest the use of: 1) corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence), 2) venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in selected patients with severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), 3) neuromuscular blockers in patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), and 4) higher PEEP without lung recruitment maneuvers as opposed to lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty), and 5) we recommend against using prolonged lung recruitment maneuvers in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty). Conclusions: We provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the management of ARDS. Individual patient and illness characteristics should be factored into clinical decision making and implementation of these recommendations while additional evidence is generated from much-needed clinical trials.

Material and methods

Databases and search strategy

The study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022314505) and performed according to the PRISMA statement. We systematically searched Embase, Medline, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (from 1963 to March 15th, 2022). The terms, including corticosteroids, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS, and randomized controlled trial, were searched alone or in combination without language restriction. Only human studies were included and the search strategy is detailed in the Supplementary Materials.

Eligibility criteria

Eligible RCT studies were searched and selected for analysis according to the criteria for participants, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and study design. Patients were eligible if they were diagnosed with ARDS (based on manifestations, the American-European Consensus Conference and the Berlin Definitions) and aged > 28 days (onset). The intervention included any corticosteroid treatment and the comparator included standard supportive care (such as mechanical ventilation, antibiotics, and fluid replacement) and placebo administration.

Two independent investigators (X.C. and S.L.) screened the titles and abstracts of the included articles. Any discrepancies between the two investigators were resolved through discussion, or decided by the third investigator (C.L.). When the data of the included articles was missing, the corresponding authors were contacted to obtain the data. The risk of bias and methodological quality were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0.

Data collection process

The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. In-hospital or ICU mortality was used to calculate the pooled 28-day mortality, unless actual 28-day mortality rates were reported or obtained from primary authors. Secondary outcomes included ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, 60-day mortality, length of ICU stay, length of in-hospital stay, and ventilation-free days to day 28. Adverse events included hyperglycemia and gastroduodenal bleeding. Patients with chronic diseases requiring long-term corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy were excluded. Data was collected by the two investigators (X.C. and S.L.) separately using a standardized table and any discrepancy was resolved through discussion, or decided by the third investigator (C.L.).

Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute respiratory distress syndrome, more specifically with respect to corticosteroids, ESICM/SCCM 2017 guidelines recommend to consider administering corticosteroids in patients with sepsis-induced early moderate-to-severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 of < 200 and within 14 days of onset).

### An evidence-based approach to acute respiratory distress syndrome [^114YGwWS]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

We provide an evidence-based approach to managing patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We searched MEDLINE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health for randomized trials evaluating lung-protective ventilation strategies, inhaled nitric oxide, prone positioning, and late-phase corticosteroids for managing these patients, and for additional literature related to long-term follow-up of ARDS survivors. The results of our review suggest that pressure- and volume-limited ventilation, according to the ARDS Network protocol, can reduce mortality for patients with acute lung injury, and so may an "open lung" approach to mechanical ventilation. Those 2 strategies are currently being compared in 2 multicenter randomized trials. Although both inhaled nitric oxide therapy and prone positioning can produce dramatic acute improvements in oxygenation for some patients, there is no evidence that these interventions can benefit patients with respect to patient-important outcomes. Therefore it is unreasonable to be dogmatic about the role of inhaled nitric oxide and prone positioning in ARDS. The role of corticosteroids in the late phase of ARDS is unclear and remains a very important unanswered question. With respect to long-term follow-up, we found that pulmonary dysfunction is probably not a major source of morbidity for ARDS survivors, whereas neuropsychological dysfunction is prominent. Ongoing research may suggest interventions to improve the outcome of ARDS and of critical illness in general.

Analysis of outcomes

Mortality

A MA of hospital mortality alone was presented in two SRs, while combined data on both hospital and 60-day mortality were presented in another SR. The quality of evidence supporting the relative risk (RR) of 0.51 (95% CI 0.24 to 1.09) in hospital mortality with steroids was very low(see GRADE evidence profile table 1). There was a serious risk of bias with only 75% of the Cochrane risk of bias recommendations followed. Inconsistency was also serious with point estimates varying widely, confidence intervals overlapping, a lack of consistent direction of effect and significant heterogeneity (I 2 52%). Imprecision was also serious. A posthoc power calculation suggests that the pooled studies only had an approximately 65% power and a sample size calculation based on the reported effect size suggested that sample size was inadequate (predicted sample size of 474; actual pooled sample size of 341 for hospital mortality). This is likely to be an underestimate of the sample size required, as the effect size is likely to be smaller than the pooled data suggest due to heterogeneity of the studies.

A further issue is the fact that the majority of these studies were performed in the prelung protection strategy era. The largest ARDS Network steroid study, LASARUS, changed its ventilation protocol during the study to reflect the results of the ARDS Network ARMA low tidal volume study.

The other hospital mortality analysis also reported low-quality data with an estimated RR of 0.62 (0.23–1.26). Combining hospital and 60-day mortality gave a RR estimate of 0.91 (0.71–1.18) with serious inconsistency and indirectness issues including the fact that this was a pooled estimate of both preventative and treatment studies.

Length of stay

A MA of hospital length of stay was presented in one SR and MA. A mean reduction of 4.8 days with steroid treatment was reported but the overall quality of the studies was very low.

Quality of life

This was not reported in the Included MA.

Economic data

No economic data were published in the trials included.

Treatment harms

Potential harms of treatment with steroids included excess hospital acquired infections, ICU acquired weakness and delirium. The only available MA reported a composite analysis of infection, ICU acquired weakness, diabetes, gastrointestinal bleeding and other complications. The RR reported was 0.82 (0.5–1.36) but the quality of the trials was low.

Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — methylprednisolone use is characterized by earlier initiation and specified dosing, with the task force noting a reduction in hospital mortality by approximately 7% and 11% in mild and severe ARDS, respectively, and that early (< 72 h) versus late (≥ 7 days) initiation shows response to a low dose (1 mg/kg/day vs 2 mg/kg/day) with faster disease resolution. An individual patient data analysis of four trials (n = 322) confirmed improved survival and decreased duration of mechanical ventilation. The task force suggested that methylprednisolone be considered in early ARDS (up to day 7 of onset; PaO2/FiO2 of < 200) at 1 mg/kg/day and in late (after day 6 of onset) persistent ARDS at 2 mg/kg/day followed by slow tapering over 13 days; methylprednisolone should be weaned slowly (6–14 days) and not stopped rapidly (2–4 days), and infection surveillance is recommended because glucocorticoids blunt the febrile response.

### Decreased mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients treated with corticosteroids: an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials with trial sequential analysis [^115uPiWP]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

There were some meta-analyses exploring the effects of corticosteroids on other conditions such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), sepsis, and community-acquired pneumonia. Glucocorticoid use was found to be associated with significant improvement in clinical outcomes in these conditions. One possible reason for these findings was that critical illness might be associated with an impaired hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis response to stress. ARDS is a devastating lung disorder and is associated with a high mortality rate. One study showed that critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) was common in ARDS (about 58%) and stress dose glucocorticoid was associated with prolong survival time. The early use of corticosteroid therapy might alleviate systemic inflammation caused by CIRCI and then was associated with survival benefit.

An anti-inflammatory pharmacologic intervention appears to be a reasonable strategy in ARDS in that dysregulated and excessive pulmonary inflammation is the pathophysiologic hallmarks of ARDS. Among the anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids are the main immunomodulatory agent for the treatment of ARDS. Early studies demonstrated that glucocorticoid treatment led to rapid improvements in pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ function in ARDS patients, with a significant reduction in bronchoalveolar lavage and plasma levels of proinflammatory mediators and chemokines. Animal experiments also found that corticosteroid treatment could alleviate lung injury and upregulate pulmonary glucocorticoid receptors. Unfortunately, clinical trials reported inconsistent results. Some trials found that glucocorticoids might reduce the risk of death in patients with ARDS. However, there also were some trials that failed to find such benefits. Until today, glucocorticoid use in ARDS remains highly controversial due to unclear benefits and potential side effects. Our meta-analysis pooled the latest data and suggested that glucocorticoids show beneficial effects in patients with ARDS without significant side effects. Therefore, glucocorticoids might be recommended as an adjunct to standard care for ARDS due to the beneficial effects. In addition, there has been significant progress in the management of ARDS in the past 20 years. High-quality clinical trials have confirmed that ventilation with lower tidal volumes and prone positioning can significantly decrease all-cause mortality of ARDS after 2000. With the progress of standards of care for patients with ARDS, whether glucocorticoid use can reduce the mortality rate of ARDS should be noted. When limiting to trials commenced after 2000, we found that glucocorticoid use is also associated with reduced mortality (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.69–0.95; P = 0.01; I² = 46), indicating glucocorticoid use is still applicable today.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111q5Y1S]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — implementation and safety considerations are outlined as follows: Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer, yet there is substantial heterogeneity in dosing, timing, and duration with uncertainty about the optimal course, and data on short- and long-term adverse effects are limited with low- to very-low certainty for other safety outcomes. Although evidence applies to intubated ARDS, corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit in some nonintubated groups; for nonintubated individuals, corticosteroids should be administered for those with ARDS etiologies known to benefit (COVID-19, severe community-acquired pneumonia), and the role in nonintubated patients with other etiologies remains uncertain. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit with regimens defined in large randomized controlled trials, whereas for other ARDS etiologies, several regimens used in clinical trials may reasonably be chosen based on an individual patient's risk profile for steroid side effects. The initiation of corticosteroid treatment > 2 weeks after onset of ARDS may be associated with harm, and the use of corticosteroids should be accompanied by close surveillance for adverse effects, particularly in higher-risk populations such as immunocompromised patients or those in regions endemic for tuberculosis or parasitic disease.

### Safety and efficacy of corticosteroids in ARDS patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCT data [^111TddKL]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Corticosteroids are an effective approach to reduce the risk of death in ARDS patients. However, this effect is associated with age, non-COVID-19 diseases, and methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone use. Therefore, evidence suggests patients with age ≥ 18 years and non-COVID-19 should be encouraged during the corticosteroid treatment. However, due to substantial differences in the use of corticosteroids among these studies, questions still remain regarding the dosage, optimal corticosteroid agent, and treatment duration in patients with ARDS. Therefore, further investigation is required.

### Decreased mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients treated with corticosteroids: an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials with trial sequential analysis [^1123UdvM]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition characterized by bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging and refractory hypoxemia. It is not uncommon in critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs) and is associated with considerable mortality. A recent international study found that nearly 10% of ICU patients suffered from ARDS, and the hospital mortality of ARDS patients was about 40%. Despite decades of research, current pharmacological therapies for ARDS are limited. Overwhelming lung inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Therefore, inflammation-directed therapies, such as glucocorticoid treatment, appear to be a reasonable strategy to treat ARDS patients.

Glucocorticoids have anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis effects and have been the most investigated immunomodulatory agent for the treatment of ARDS. However, the impact of corticosteroid therapy on clinically relevant outcomes in ARDS patients remains controversial. Clinical trials evaluating corticosteroids in the management of ARDS reported conflicting results, and previous meta-analyses were underpowered to draw determinate conclusions. Thus, we conducted an updated meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis to assess the effect of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with ARDS and determine whether the current evidence is reliable.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1175wryg]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterised by a profound deterioration in systemic oxygenation or ventilation, or both, despite supportive respiratory therapy. ARDS is an acute and progressive respiratory disease of a non-cardiac cause that is associated with progressively diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, reduced pulmonary compliance, and hypoxaemia. The main causes of ARDS include direct lung injury (e.g., pneumonia, gastric acid aspiration) or indirect lung injury (e.g., sepsis, pancreatitis, massive blood transfusion, non-thoracic trauma). Sepsis and pneumonia account for about 60% of cases. Between one third and one half of people with ARDS die from the disease, but mortality depends on the underlying cause. Some survivors have long-term respiratory or cognitive problems.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of interventions in adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 20 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: corticosteroids, low tidal-volume mechanical ventilation, nitric oxide, prone position, and protective ventilation.

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^1152wgtS]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corticosteroids in ARDS — In subgroup analyses, patients who received a longer course of corticosteroids (> 7 d) had higher rates of survival than those who received a shorter course (7 d or less) (p value for subgroup interaction = 0.04, moderate credibility). The use of corticosteroids may lead to fewer days of mechanical ventilation (low certainty) and a shorter hospital length of stay (low certainty), with uncertain effects on ICU length of stay (very low certainty), neuromuscular weakness (very low certainty) and GI bleeding (low certainty). There was probably an increase in hyperglycemia (RR 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01–1.23, moderate certainty). Evidence to Recommendation states that the panel decided that corticosteroids offered moderate desirable effects, driven primarily by moderate certainty evidence that corticosteroids reduce mortality and low certainty evidence that they reduce hospital length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation, while ongoing uncertainty remained due to small positive trials, lack of long-term outcomes, and that half of included patients had COVID-19 ARDS.

Despite significant advances in our understanding and management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the morbidity and mortality from ARDS remains high. Given the limited number of effective treatments for established ARDS, the strategic focus of ARDS research has shifted toward identifying patients with or at high risk of ARDS early in the course of the underlying illness, when strategies to reduce the development and progression of ARDS and associated organ failures can be systematically evaluated. In this review, we summarize the rationale, current evidence, and future directions in ARDS prevention.

### Exploring the heterogeneity of effects of corticosteroids on acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1117G9YC]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

ARDS is a heterogeneous disease with various etiologies and clinical courses. The effects of corticosteroids on ARDS were inconsistent in previous studies due to different outcome measures and study populations. This study shows that corticosteroids do not improve longer-term outcomes and may cause harm in certain subgroups of ARDS, such as influenza-related ARDS. Based on current available data, we do not suggest routine use of corticosteroids for ARDS. More clinical trials are needed to improve the overall quality of evidence and to specify the unfavorable and favorable subgroups of ARDS for corticosteroid therapy. Future studies should evaluate short-term as well as longer-term outcomes for comprehensive evaluation of the treatment efficacy of corticosteroids in ARDS.

Sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) corticosteroid guidance — in response to the five PICOs, the panel issued four recommendations addressing corticosteroid use, including a conditional recommendation to administer corticosteroids for patients with septic shock and critically ill patients with ARDS and a strong recommendation for use in hospitalized patients with severe CAP. The panel also recommended against high dose/short duration administration of corticosteroids for septic shock, and for ARDS was unable to provide specific recommendations regarding corticosteroid molecule, dose, and duration of therapy based on currently available evidence. New evidence was "warranting a focused update of the 2017 guideline", and a 22-member panel developed evidence-based recommendations for hospitalized adults and children.

### Exploring the heterogeneity of effects of corticosteroids on acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113QXsWE]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study found that the mortality outcomes of corticosteroid therapy in ARDS differed by duration of outcome measures. Corticosteroids had a possible but statistically insignificant effect on short-term mortality in RCTs but did not decrease longer-term mortality in either RCTs or cohort studies (Table 1). Within-study observation in studies reporting two mortality endpoints also suggested that the benefit of corticosteroid therapy decreased when follow-up was prolonged. This raises a concern that corticosteroid therapy in ARDS may bring initial benefits by suppressing the inflammatory process and reducing alveolocapillary permeability, but the beneficial effects are soon counteracted by the delayed onset of adverse effects, such as immunosuppression and altered tissue repair. We also found that the effect of corticosteroid therapy differed among different populations of ARDS patients. Corticosteroids may cause harm in certain ARDS subgroups, such as influenza-related ARDS. Taken together, current data do not support routine use of corticosteroids in ARDS. Given the heterogeneous nature of ARDS and the pleiotropic effects of corticosteroids, more clinical trials are needed to specify the favorable and unfavorable subgroups for corticosteroid therapy. For more comprehensive assessment of the effects of corticosteroid therapy, future studies should evaluate a mortality endpoint of adequate duration and the 60-day mortality used by the ARDSnet appears to be a reasonable study endpoint.

### Corticosteroids in COVID-19 ARDS: evidence and hope during the… [^117GViJq]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Over the intervening decades, many clinical trials have tested the utility of corticosteroids in critically ill patients with pneumonia, septic shock, or ARDS. However, due to limited sample sizes, variable dosing strategies, and inconsistent findings, results remained inconclusive. Uptake of this therapeutic approach was modest in 2014, with only 18% of 2377 patients with ARDS in the LUNG SAFE study receiving corticosteroids.
2. The DEXA-ARDS trial enrolled 277 patients with moderate to severe ARDS and found that patients randomized to high-dose dexamethasone compared with continued routine intensive care had lower 60-day all-cause mortality and more ventilator-free days.
5. In meta-analyses that incorporated these recent RCTs, corticosteroid use was associated with more rapid resolution of shock and mechanical ventilation in septic shock and possible lower mortality in both septic shock and ARDS.

6, 7 However, due to inconsistent findings across individual studies and lingering concern that important adverse effects such as secondary infection and delirium may be undermeasured and underreported in these clinical trials, many clinicians remained hesitant to prescribe corticosteroids for these conditions. At the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, guidance regarding corticosteroids was mixed. The findings not only guide management of patients with severe COVID-19, but also contribute to the evidence base informing treatment of ARDS among patients without COVID-19. Some clinicians may question why corticosteroids demonstrated benefit in patients with ARDS related to COVID-19, after decades of uncertainty and mixed findings for use of steroids in patients with ARDS.

However, the pooled estimates of treatment effect in ARDS in patients with COVID-19 are similar to pooled estimates from recent trials in ARDS in patients without COVID-19, 7 suggesting benefit may be similar regardless of ARDS etiology. The publication of these 3 randomized trials of corticosteroids and the prospective meta-analysis in this issue of JAMA represents an important step forward in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. While the RECOVERY results were embraced because they provided hope in the treatment of this catastrophic disease, numerous study limitations prevented complete confidence in using corticosteroids in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. These trials and the meta-analysis have strengthened confidence, further defined the benefit, and shifted usual care of COVID-19–related ARDS to include corticosteroids.

### Treatment of ARDS [^114poGVr]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI)/ARDS has led to important advances in the treatment of ALI/ARDS, particularly in the area of ventilator-associated lung injury. Standard supportive care for ALI/ARDS should now include a protective ventilatory strategy with low tidal volume ventilation by the protocol developed by the National Institutes of Health ARDS Network. Further refinements of the protocol for mechanical ventilation will occur as current and future clinical trials are completed. In addition, novel modes of mechanical ventilation are being studied and may augment standard therapy in the future. Although results of anti-inflammatory strategies have been disappointing in clinical trials, further trials are underway to test the efficacy of late corticosteroids and other approaches to modulation of inflammation in ALI/ARDS.

### Safety and efficacy of corticosteroids in ARDS patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCT data [^112XzBrW]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a serious condition, which is characterized as refractory hypoxemia caused by various factors and is usually secondary to a variety of lung diseases or extrapulmonary conditions, such as pneumonia, drowning and non-pulmonary sepsis. It could lead to respiratory failure, critical illness, and even death, particularly in children. A previous study showed that ARDS is estimated to be prevalent in 10.4% of patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) care. Although mechanical ventilation and fluid management have proved their efficacy for ARDS treatment in recent history, effective treatment remains a challenge, such as tidal volume, high positive end-expiratory pressure, advanced infection, and fewer drugs.

The concept of ARDS was first proposed in 1967 by Ashbaugh et al. ARDS is known as an excessive inflammatory response which is caused by damage to the alveolar capillary endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells, resulting in pulmonary interstitial edema, alveolar edema, airway occlusion, and alveolar atrophy. Corticosteroids were considered as one of the potential therapeutic drugs as early use of corticosteroids were shown to reduce systemic inflammatory response and accelerate the recovery of pulmonary infection. This may be related to the role of glucocorticoids, which can inhibit the synthesis of cytokines and reduce the proliferation and regulation of T cells, macrophages and others.

Currently, as few as 30–35% of children diagnosed with ARDS are administered steroids in clinical practice. However, in adults, many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using corticosteroids have been performed. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of conclusive evidence and guidelines for the use of corticosteroids in ARDS patients. This may be due to the conflicting data between recent and previous studies, and a significant heterogeneity being found among the results of the RCTs. In addition, the efficacy of corticosteroids has been found to be associated with several clinical variables, and in some cases, corticosteroids are not recommended routinely.

Therefore, the safety and efficacy of corticosteroids are still unclear. Hence, in this study, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the safety and efficacy of corticosteroid administration in patients with ARDS, compared to those without corticosteroids. In addition, subgroup analysis of glucocorticoid regarding age, etiology, type of corticosteroids, and treatment duration was also performed.

### Efficacy of dexamethasone treatment for patients with ARDS caused by COVID-19 (DEXA-COVID19) [^111hDGec]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Background: There are no proven therapies specific for Covid-19. The full spectrum of Covid-19 ranges from asymptomatic disease to mild respiratory tract illness to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure, and death. The efficacy of corticosteroids in viral ARDS remains controversial. Methods: This is an internationally designed multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial testing dexamethasone in mechanically ventilated adult patients with established moderate-to-severe ARDS caused by confirmed Covid-19 infection, admitted in a network of Spanish ICUs. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive either dexamethasone plus standard intensive care, or standard intensive care alone. Patients in the dexamethasone group will receive an intravenous dose of 20 mg once daily from day 1 to day 5, followed by 10 mg once daily from day 6 to day 10.

The primary outcome is 60-day mortality. The secondary outcome is the number of ventilator-free days at 28 days. All analyses will be done according to the intention-to-treat principle. The COVID-19 pandemic is a critical moment for the world. Severe pneumonia is the main condition leading to ARDS requiring weeks of MV with high mortality in COVID-19 patients. There is no specific therapy for Covid-19, although patients are receiving drugs that are already approved for treating other diseases. There has been great interest in the role of corticosteroids to attenuate the pulmonary and systemic damage in ARDS patients because of their potent anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties. However, the efficacy of corticosteroids in viral ARDS remains controversial.

We justify the need of this study based on the positive results of a recent clinical trial by our group, showing that dexamethasone for 10 days was able to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and increase hospital survival in patients with ARDS from multiple causes. Exclusion Criteria:

- Routine treatment with corticosteroids during the previous week irrespective of dose;
- Corticosteroid use within the previous 24 h of more than 20 mg of dexamethasone or equivalent;
- Patients with a known contraindication to corticosteroids;
- Decision by a physician that involvement in the trial is not in the patient's best interest;
- Pregnancy and breast-feeding;
- Participation in another therapeutic trial.

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^114Gnwzn]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — Recommendation: 2A) We "suggest" administering corticosteroids to adult critically ill patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty). Remark: We make no recommendation for corticosteroid use in pediatric patients with ARDS. Evidence summary: Eighteen RCTs compared corticosteroids to placebo or standard care in adult hospitalized patients with ARDS; Twelve (67%) used American-European Consensus Conference or Berlin criteria and 6 (33%) included patients with COVID-19; corticosteroid use probably reduces 28-day mortality (RR 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.95, moderate certainty) in critically ill patients with ARDS.

Sepsis — In patients with septic shock requiring vasopressors, the panel noted benefit regardless of dose and did not name a specific agent or regimen; commonly used regimens included IV hydrocortisone 200–300 mg/d in divided doses or continuous infusion for 5–7 days, with some studies adding fludrocortisone 50 μg enterally daily, while historical high-dose/short-duration regimens (over 400 mg/day of hydrocortisone equivalent for less than 3 days) are not supported due to adverse effects; if sepsis presents with severe community-acquired pneumonia or with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the panel states to administer corticosteroids as per those respective recommendations, and no specific recommendations on fludrocortisone use were made.

### Prolonged glucocorticoid treatment is associated with improved ARDS outcomes: analysis of individual patients' data from four randomized trials and trial-level meta-analysis of the updated literature [^114iPFTc]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the effect of prolonged glucocorticoid treatment for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Methods

We conducted two sets of intention-to-treat analyses: (1) a primary analysis of individual patients' data (IPD) of four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which investigated methylprednisolone treatment (n = 322) and (2) a trial-level meta-analysis incorporating four additional RCTs which investigated hydrocortisone treatment in early ARDS (n = 297). We standardized definitions to derive outcomes in all datasets. The primary outcome for the IPD analysis was time to achieving unassisted breathing (UAB) by study day 28. Secondary outcomes included mechanical ventilation (MV) and intensive care unit (ICU)-free days, hospital mortality, and time to hospital mortality by day 28.

Results

By study day 28, compared to the placebo group, the methylprednisolone group had fewer patients who died before achieving UAB (12 vs. 29%; p < 0.001) and more patients who achieved UAB (80 vs. 50%; p < 0.001). In the methylprednisolone group, time to achieving UAB was shorter [hazard ratio 2.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.95–3.43; p < 0.001], and hospital mortality was decreased (20 vs. 33%; p = 0.006), leading to increased MV (13.3 ± 11.8 vs. 7.6 ± 5.7; p < 0.001) and ICU-free days (10.8 ± 0.71 vs. 6.4 ± 0.85; p < 0.001). In those patients randomized before day 14 of ARDS onset, the trial-level meta-analysis indicated decreased hospital mortality (36 vs. 49%; risk ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.59–0.98, I (2) = 17%, p = 0.035; moderate certainty). Treatment was not associated with increased risk for infections (risk ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.56–1.08, I (2) = 26%; p = 0.13; moderate certainty).

Conclusions

Prolonged methylprednisolone treatment accelerates the resolution of ARDS, improving a broad spectrum of interrelated clinical outcomes and decreasing hospital mortality and healthcare utilization.

### Exploring the heterogeneity of effects of corticosteroids on acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116PFfW3]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Key messages

- ARDS is a heterogeneous disease with various etiologies and clinical courses. The effects of corticosteroids on ARDS were inconsistent in previous studies due to different outcome measures and study populations.

- This meta-analysis evaluated short-term and longer-term effects of corticosteroids on ARDS mortality. Pooled data showed that corticosteroid therapy did not decrease longer-term mortality.

- The effectiveness of corticosteroid therapy differed in different etiologies of ARDS. Corticosteroids might cause harm in certain subgroups of ARDS patients, such as influenza-related ARDS.

- Current data do not support routine use of corticosteroids for ARDS. More clinical trials are needed to improve the overall quality of evidence and to specify the unfavorable and favorable subgroups of ARDS patients for corticosteroid therapy.

### The relationship between high-dose corticosteroid treatment and mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a retrospective and observational study using a nationwide administrative database in Japan [^117C7QUc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a critical respiratory syndrome. Recent advances in treatment strategies, such as protective mechanical ventilation techniques, have improved the mortality of patients with ARDS, according to many clinical trials. However, no pharmacotherapies have yet been shown to be effective in improving the mortality rate; according to systematic reviews, mortalities due to ARDS were as high as 43 and 44% in 2008 and 2009, respectively.

A systemic inflammatory response is closely associated with the development of ARDS. Thus, anti-inflammatory corticosteroid treatment may be a logical choice for ARDS. However, according to previous studies and meta-analyses, the efficacy of corticosteroids in ARDS is still controversial; while some reports have shown improvement in the mortality, others have not. Furthermore, although meta-analyses have indicated the poor effectiveness of corticosteroids, they also highlight the difficulties in confirming the role of corticosteroids due to the heterogeneity of ARDS studies. The dosage of corticosteroids for the treatment of ARDS is also controversial. In the 1980s, a few randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) showed that high-dose corticosteroids did not improve mortality, and subsequently, for almost three decades, no RCTs have revisited this topic due to the results of these reports. However, the ARDS diagnostic criteria, supportive methods, and treatments for underlying diseases have changed over the years. In 1994, the American-European Consensus Conference (AECC) resulted in the development of new diagnostic criteria for ARDS, which were subsequently modified (Berlin definition). We therefore speculated that the effectiveness of high-dose corticosteroid treatment might be different in the present era. In this retrospective and observational study, we investigated the effectiveness of high-dose corticosteroid treatment using the Japanese nationwide administrative database: the diagnostic procedure combination (DPC). To minimize the bias associated with the retrospective collection of data (i.e. the baseline characteristics in the high-dose and non-high-dose corticosteroid groups), we employed propensity score weighting with a Cox proportional hazards model.

### Guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1143Lex9]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Aims

The purpose of this guideline is to provide an evidence-based framework for the management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that will inform both key decisions in the care of individual patients and broader policy. Our recommendations are neither dictates nor standards of care. We cannot take into account all of the features of individual patients and complex local factors; all we can do is to synthesise relevant evidence and to put it into the context of current critical care medicine. Similarly, our recommendations are not comprehensive: these guidelines have relevance to a fraction of the total number of decisions that are required of carers for these complex patients. Indeed, the current state of the art for the management of ARDS has been recently reviewedand comparable guidelines have been produced by national and international stakeholders.

Scope

The topics considered were chosen by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) in the light of results from a survey carried out for the Intensive Care Society (ICS), including 556 responses from 3200 members. Popular topics were excluded by the GDG if it was felt that there was a dearth of evidence (eg, appropriate diagnostic investigations and the role of specialist centres), when the evidence was not specific to ARDS (weaning from mechanical ventilation, nutrition and the timing of tracheostomy) and if there was overlap with existing guidelines (post-ICU (intensive care unit) care and rehabilitation).

Glucocorticoids

The administration of empiric steroids for severe ARDS has remained controversial and clinical trial results have varied significantly. One trial conducted found moderate-dose methylprednisolone significantly reduced duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, and ICU mortality. However, a larger study in 2006 by the ARDS Network showed no clinical benefit in patients treated with steroids within 7 days of ARDS onset, and increased mortality in patients treated 14 days after ARDS onset. More recently, the DEXA-ARDS trial studied patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS and found that patients who received dexamethasone experienced more ventilator-free days and lower mortality. Dexamethasone has also been shown to improve overall mortality in patients with hypoxemia due to moderate or severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Different ARDS subphenotypes display differing responses to corticosteroid treatment. A latent class analysis of the ARMA and ALVEOLI trials revealed the existence of two distinct phenotypes: (1) hyperinflammatory and (2) hypoinflammatory. The hyperinflammatory phenotype exhibits a higher overall mortality, and in a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 ARDS, had improved mortality with steroids, while the hypoinflammatory group had worse mortality with steroids. While the empiric use of glucocorticoids remains controversial in all patients with severe ARDS, there are likely select ARDS subgroups that derive benefit.

Objectives

To compare the design and results of randomized trials investigating prolonged glucocorticoid treatment (≥ 7 days) in patients with acute lung injury-acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI-ARDS), and review factors affecting response to therapy, including the role of secondary prevention.

Design

Trials were retrieved from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Two investigators collected data on study characteristics, treatment intervention, and outcomes. The methodological quality of trials was determined and data were analyzed with Review Manager 4.2.3.

Measurements and Results

Five selected trials (n = 518) consistently reported significant improvement in gas exchange, reduction in markers of inflammation, and decreased duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay (all p < 0.05). Two early small clinical trials showed marked reductions in the relative risk (RR) of death with glucocorticoid therapy (RR = 0.14, 95% CI 0.04–0.53; p = 0.004, I2 = 0%). Three subsequent larger trials, when combined, although nominally beneficial, did not reproduce the marked reductions observed in the earlier trials (RR = 0.84; 95% CI 0.68–1.03; p = 0.09, I2 = 9.1%), but achieved a distinct reduction in the RR of death in the larger subgroup of patients (n = 400) treated before day 14 of ARDS [82/214 (38%) vs. 98/186 (52.5%), RR = 0.78; 95% CI 0.64–0.96; p = 0.02, I2 = 0%].

Conclusions

Prolonged glucocorticoid treatment substantially and significantly improves meaningful patient-centered outcome variables, and has a distinct survival benefit when initiated before day 14 of ARDS.

### Acute respiratory failure in COVID-19: is it "typical" ARDS? [^112FHjAY]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids in COVID-19-related ARDS patients

Corticosteroids are considered a potential treatment for ARDS because of their role in reducing inflammation and fibrosis. Although the use of corticosteroids in ARDS patients remains controversial, treatment with corticosteroids is currently the only pharmacological intervention that may reduce morbidity and mortality. It is reported that treatment with high-dose corticosteroids for a prolonged period of time could accelerate the improvement of ARDS. Furthermore, methylprednisolone shortened periods of need for invasive mechanical ventilation and lowered mortality in ARDS patients. However, WHO recommended that systemic corticosteroids should not be routinely administered to COVID-19 or COVID-19-related ARDS patients. Studies reported that less than half of the COVID-19 patients were given systemic corticosteroids, mostly in severely ill patients with ARDS. Low-to-moderate dosage was administered depending on the severity of the disease, for as short time of treatment as possible. Although it has been reported that treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial for COVID-19-related ARDS patients, the effect of corticosteroids in such patients is still uncertain and needs to be further evaluated. In particular, the use of corticosteroids may affect virus clearance in COVID-19 patients. Further evidence is needed to evaluate the role of systemic corticosteroid therapy and its impact on long-term prognosis in this group of patients.

Materials and Methods

Search strategy

This systematic review was conducted using an a priori published protocol submitted to the PROSPERO website (Registration No.: CRD42012002583) and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. No institutional review board (IRB) approval or consents were needed for this systematic review because it evaluated published studies. We searched MEDLINE via the NCBI Entrez system, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Web of Science (WOS) up to December 2013. We also screened the bibliographies of retrieved studies and recent review articles to identify additional trials.

Keyword search was performed in MEDLINE, CENTRAL and WOS using the following terms: 'corticosteroids' AND ('ALI' OR 'acute lung injury' OR 'ARDS' OR 'acute respiratory distress syndrome'). The search was then limited to human studies. We also used MeSH term search in MEDLINE with the following terms: ('respiratory distress syndrome, adult' OR 'acute lung injury') AND ('hydroxycorticosteroids' OR 'glucocorticoids'). No language restrictions were applied.

The inclusion criteria included randomized controlled trial (RCT) and cohort study designs that reported mortality outcomes and had corticosteroid nonusers for comparison.

Quality assessment and data extraction

Two investigators (SYR and CTH) independently extracted data from the included studies into standardized data recording forms. Quality assessment of these studies was done using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for cohort studies.

Outcome measurement

The primary study endpoint was all-cause mortality. Different mortality measures were reported in the studies, including ICU mortality, hospital mortality and 60-day mortality. According to the duration of mean ICU and hospital stay reported in the included studies, we classified ICU mortality as short-term outcome, hospital mortality as a mid-term outcome, and 60-day mortality as a longer-term outcome. Additionally, two studies reported 14-day and 45-day mortality, and these two outcome measures were classified as ICU mortality and 60-day mortality, respectively. The secondary study endpoint was nosocomial infections related to corticosteroid therapy.

### Updated guidelines from the Society of Critical Care Medicine strongly recommend steroids for hospitalized adults with severe CAP… [^113A3WtV]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL QUESTION Should steroids be administered to hospitalized patients with sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia. BOTTOM LINE An updated guideline from a panel of experts convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine strongly recommends the administration of steroids for adults who are hospitalized with severe CAP. Conditional recommendations suggest that steroids should also be used in hospitalized adults with septic shock or ARDS. SYNOPSIS The Society of Critical Care Medicine assembled an expert panel, including intensivists, pulmonologists, endocrinologists, nurses, and pharmacists, to provide evidence-based recommendations for the use of steroids in hospitalized adults and children with sepsis, ARDS, and CAP. The panel conducted systematic reviews to find the best evidence for a series of questions.

A team of reviewers screened titles and abstracts, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias independently and in duplicate. Following a voting process, the panel issued four recommendations. A strong recommendation with moderate certainty of evidence supports the use of steroids for hospitalized adults with severe bacterial CAP, primarily based on evidence of decreased hospital mortality. This mortality benefit was not seen in patients with less severe CAP. Two conditional recommendations suggest that steroids should be used in adults with septic shock or ARDS based on reduced short-term mortality. The guideline recommends against the use of high-dose, short-duration steroids for septic shock due to the risk of adverse effects. This is defined as greater than 400 mg/day of hydro-cortisone equivalent for less than 3 days.

### Decreased mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients treated with corticosteroids: an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials with trial sequential analysis [^1153wEmJ]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The possible benefits associated with corticosteroid treatment in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients are not fully known. We conducted an updated meta-analysis to assess the effect of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with ARDS.

Methods

We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to January 2021 via Ovid to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of patients with ARDS. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included the number of ventilator-free days at day 28, oxygenation improvement (PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratios), and adverse events.

Results

Nine studies with 1371 participants were analyzed. The pooled analysis revealed that glucocorticoid use was associated with reduced mortality [relative risk (RR), 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74–0.93; P < 0.01; I² = 37], and the statistical power was confirmed by trial sequential analysis. Glucocorticoids might also significantly increase the number of ventilator-free days at day 28 (mean deviation 3.66 days, 95% CI 2.64–4.68; P < 0.01) and improve oxygenation (standardized mean difference 4.17; 95% CI 2.32–6.02; P < 0.01). In addition, glucocorticoid use was not associated with increased risks of new infection (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.70–1.01; P = 0.07) and hyperglycemia (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.99–1.23; P = 0.06).

Conclusions

The use of glucocorticoids might result in reduced mortality in patients with ARDS. Glucocorticoids might be recommended as an adjunct to standard care for ARDS; however, the optimal dose and duration of steroid therapy remains unknown and further studies are needed.

Dexamethasone Treatment for Patients With ARDS Caused by COVID-19; REMAP-CAP, Randomized, Embedded, Multifactorial Adaptive Platform Trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia; Steroids-SARI, Glucocorticoid Therapy for COVID-19 Critically Ill Patients With Severe Acute Respiratory Failure. The Steroids-SARI trial recorded adverse events but did not categorize them as serious or nonserious. Findings In this prospective meta-analysis of 7 randomized trials that included 1703 patients of whom 647 died, 28-day all-cause mortality was lower among patients who received corticosteroids compared with those who received usual care or placebo.

Meaning Administration of systemic corticosteroids, compared with usual care or placebo, was associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19. The corticosteroid groups included dexamethasone at low and high doses, low-dose hydrocortisone, and high-dose methylprednisolone. The Efficacy of Dexamethasone Treatment for Patients With ARDS Caused by COVID-19 trial and the COVID-19 Dexamethasone trial21 only enrolled patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. This corresponds to an absolute mortality risk of 32% with corticosteroids compared with an assumed mortality risk of 40% with usual care or placebo. There was little inconsistency between the trial results, and the summary OR was 0. 70 based on a random-effects meta-analysis.

For all-cause mortality comparing corticosteroids vs usual care or placebo, the fixed-effect summary OR was 0. 64 for trials of dexamethasone (3 trials, 1282 patients, and 527 deaths.

### Dexamethasone treatment for the acute respiratory distress syndrome: a multicentre, randomised controlled trial [^112Xcgd7]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Background

There is no proven specific pharmacological treatment for patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The efficacy of corticosteroids in ARDS remains controversial. We aimed to assess the effects of dexamethasone in ARDS, which might change pulmonary and systemic inflammation and result in a decrease in duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality.

Methods

We did a multicentre, randomised controlled trial in a network of 17 intensive care units (ICUs) in teaching hospitals across Spain in patients with established moderate-to-severe ARDS (defined by a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen of 200 mm Hg or less assessed with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cm H 2 O or more and FiO 2 of 0.5 or more at 24 h after ARDS onset). Patients with brain death, terminal-stage disease, or receiving corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs were excluded. Eligible patients were randomly assigned based on balanced treatment assignments with a computerised randomisation allocation sequence using blocks of 10 opaque, sealed envelopes to receive immediate treatment with dexamethasone or continued routine intensive care (control group). Patients in the dexamethasone group received an intravenous dose of 20 mg once daily from day 1 to day 5, which was reduced to 10 mg once daily from day 6 to day 10. Patients in both groups were ventilated with lung-protective mechanical ventilation. Allocation concealment was maintained at all sites during the trial. Primary outcome was the number of ventilator-free days at 28 days, defined as the number of days alive and free from mechanical ventilation from day of randomisation to day 28. Secondary outcome was all-cause mortality 60 days after randomisation. All analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01731795.

Findings

Between March 28, 2013, and Dec 31, 2018, we enrolled 277 patients and randomly assigned 139 patients to the dexamethasone group and 138 to the control group. The trial was stopped by the data safety monitoring board due to low enrolment rate after enrolling more than 88% (277/314) of the planned sample size. The mean number of ventilator-free days was higher in the dexamethasone group than in the control group (between-group difference 4.8 days [95% CI 2.57 to 7.03]; p < 0.0001). At 60 days, 29 (21%) patients in the dexamethasone group and 50 (36%) patients in the control group had died (between-group difference -15.3% [-25.9 to -4.9]; p = 0.0047). The proportion of adverse events did not differ significantly between the dexamethasone group and control group. The most common adverse events were hyperglycaemia in the ICU (105 [76%] patients in the dexamethasone group vs 97 [70%] patients in the control group), new infections in the ICU (eg, pneumonia or sepsis; 33 [24%] vs 35 [25%]), and barotrauma (14 [10%] vs 10 [7%]).

Interpretation

Early administration of dexamethasone could reduce duration of mechanical ventilation and overall mortality in patients with established moderate-to-severe ARDS.

### High-dose corticosteroid therapy in the adult respiratory distress syndrome… [^115mYLV9]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

AMONG the many controversies concerning the adult respiratory distress syndrome is the role of corticosteroids in its treatment. There are two main reasons for this uncertainty. First of all, it is important to recognize that this syndrome is the consequence of the lung's response to a wide variety of injuries to its capillary endothelium and alveolar epithelium that result in an almost uniform pattern of roentgenographic and physiological abnormalities: diffuse alveolar infiltrations caused by increased permeability pulmonary edema, severe hypoxemia caused by intrapulmonary shunting of blood, and marked decrease of lung compliance and functional residual capacity caused by alveolar flooding and changes in surface tension. Second, ARDS is not a disease but a disorder that is associated with many kinds of severe underlying medical and surgical conditions.

Although the exact pathogenetic sequence leading to this catastrophic syndrome is not known, there are at least several different pathways through which Flick MR, Murray JF. High-Dose Corticosteroid Therapy in the Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome. JAMA. 1984; 251: 1054–1056.

Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids were used by 70% of the respondents, with only 6% using them routinely. The preferred corticosteroid was methylprednisolone (56%), followed by hydrocortisone (41%). Prednisolone use was scarce (3%). There was also considerable variation in the dose of corticosteroids prescribed (Table 1). Among those respondents who prescribed corticosteroids (70% of total), eighteen per cent initiated corticosteroid therapy less than 72 hours after the onset of ARDS, a further 12% within one week, 38% between 7 and 14 days and 15% after two weeks. The duration of therapy was ≤ 1 week in 56% and between 8–14 days in 34%. Corticosteroids are being used for their anti-fibrotic properties alone in 42% and anti-inflammatory effect alone in 23%. The remaining 25% suggested they are using corticosteroids for both clinical effects. The method of corticosteroid cessation was abrupt in 37% and by a tapered reducing-dose regime in 63%. Free text comments highlighted that the use of corticosteroids were dependent on several other factors. These included: concomitant use of vasopressors (especially increasing doses); the presence of sepsis; radiological (CT) evidence of ARDS with active lung fibrosis; treatment failure/non-progressing patients; and evidence of endogenous steroid deficiency.

Table 1
The type and dose of steroid therapy initiated for acute respiratory distress syndrome

The data expressed as a percentage of responses to the total response for the type of corticosteroid initiated.

Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMB)

Eighty three percent of respondents use "occasional" or "individualised NMB as part of the management of ARDS. Fifteen per cent of respondents describe using NMB "routinely".

Prostaglandins or their derivatives

The majority of respondents (56%) reported never using prostaglandins or their derivatives in the management of ARDS, whilst 1.6% reported using them "routinely". The remaining responses (42%) were equally divided between "occasional" and "individualised" use.

Statins

Most had "never" used statins (74%) and few used them "routinely" (3%). The remainder declared that statin use was "occasional" or "individualised" according to the patient (or indeed if part of a clinical research study).

Sepsis, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and trauma — corticosteroid treatment recommendations are: For treatment of specific conditions, we suggest using IV hydrocortisone < 400 mg/day for ≥ 3 days at full dose in patients with septic shock that is not responsive to fluid and moderate- to high-dose vasopressor therapy (conditional, low quality of evidence). We suggest not using corticosteroids in adult patients with sepsis without shock (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest the use of IV methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day in patients with early moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO2 /FIO2, < 200 and within 14 days of onset) (conditional, moderate quality of evidence). Corticosteroids are not suggested for patients with major trauma (conditional, low quality of evidence).

Uncertainties and research priorities

Several questions about corticosteroids remain unanswered. The optimal corticosteroid regimen remains unknown; further research is needed to determine the appropriate formulation, dose, timing, and course of therapy to better guide clinical care. Additional longitudinal data are also needed to better understand the adverse consequences of corticosteroids. Finally, there is a possibility that corticosteroids have variable effects on different subpopulations of patients based on ARDS etiology, severity, patient characteristics, or other factors. Understanding the impact of corticosteroids on potentially vulnerable patients, such as those at increased risk for superimposed infections (e.g. immunocompromised patients) and metabolic complications (e.g. those with diabetes mellitus), is of particular importance. Two large, multicenter RCTs assessing the impact of corticosteroids on ARDS outcomes will soon be underway – Glucocorticoids in Adults with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (GuARDS) and Corticosteroid Early and Extended (CORT-E2). These trials may help answer questions about differential treatment effects in ARDS subgroups and strengthen the certainty of evidence surrounding corticosteroid use in ARDS overall.

Question 2: Should Patients with ARDS Receive VV-ECMO?

Recommendation

We suggest the use of VV-ECMO in selected patients with severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence)

### Corticosteroids in the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in adults: meta-analysis [^1149jwqP]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To systematically review the efficacy of steroids in the prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in critically ill adults, and treatment for established ARDS.

Data Sources

Search of randomised controlled trials (1966-April 2007) of PubMed, Cochrane central register of controlled trials, Cochrane database of systematic reviews, American College of Physicians Journal Club, health technology assessment database, and database of abstracts of reviews of effects.

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data into standardised forms; differences were resolved by consensus.

Data Synthesis

Steroid efficacy was assessed through a Bayesian hierarchical model for comparing the odds of developing ARDS and mortality (both expressed as odds ratio with 95% credible interval) and duration of ventilator free days, assessed as mean difference. Bayesian outcome probabilities were calculated as the probability that the odds ratio would be ≥ 1 or the probability that the mean difference would be ≥ 0. Nine randomised trials using variable dose and duration of steroids were identified. Preventive steroids (four studies) were associated with a trend to increase both the odds of patients developing ARDS (odds ratio 1.55, 95% credible interval 0.58 to 4.05; P(odds ratio ≥ 1) = 86.6%), and the risk of mortality in those who subsequently developed ARDS (three studies, odds ratio 1.52, 95% credible interval 0.30 to 5.94; P(odds ratio ≥ 1) = 72.8%). Steroid administration after onset of ARDS (five studies) was associated with a trend towards reduction in mortality (odds ratio 0.62, 95% credible interval 0.23 to 1.26; P(odds ratio ≥ 1) = 6.8%). Steroid therapy increased the number of ventilator free days compared with controls (three studies, mean difference 4.05 days, 95% credible interval 0.22 to 8.71; P(mean difference ≥ 0) = 97.9%). Steroids were not associated with increase in risk of infection.

Conclusions

A definitive role of corticosteroids in the treatment of ARDS in adults is not established. A possibility of reduced mortality and increased ventilator free days with steroids started after the onset of ARDS was suggested. Preventive steroids possibly increase the incidence of ARDS in critically ill adults.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in hospitalized adults — corticosteroid regimens across agents and durations were associated with several outcomes: Twelve trials suggested mortality reduction (relative risk [RR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45–1.01). Compared with placebo, corticosteroids shortened hospital stay (risk difference −2.96, 95% CI −5.18–0.75), reduced the need for mechanical ventilation (RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.26–0.79), prevented acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (RR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.10–0.56), and increased the risk for hyperglycemia (RR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.01–2.19), without other complications; typical agents listed were prednisone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone with a length of treatment of 4 to 10 days, and five additional studies were ongoing. The quality of evidence across outcomes was moderate, and the authors stated that "we agreed that the beneficial effects of treatment with corticosteroids outweighed the risks".

Corticosteroids

PICO question

In adults with ARDS, does the use of corticosteroids, compared with standard care, affect survival and selected outcomes?

Study identification

The search strategy was predefined as per the online appendix C. The role of corticosteroids in ARDS has been studied in RCT both in populations at risk of developing ARDS and in the established syndrome. These prevention and treatment trials have been separately analysed in most SR with MA; the results of the former have been excluded from this analysis. Eight, high quality SRs with MA, performed between 2008 and 2014, were identified (see PRISMA chart in online appendix A. A total of eight RCTs performed between 1985 and 2007 were included in these reviews. The largest single study enrolled only 180 patients.

A GRADE Summary of Findings table is shown below based on critical and important outcomes (table 1). A full GRADE evidence table can be found as part of the online appendix B.

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis indicated that glucocorticoid treatment might reduce overall mortality and duration of mechanical ventilation and improve oxygenation in patients with ARDS. Glucocorticoids might be recommended as an adjunct to standard care for ARDS; however, the optimal dose and duration of steroid therapy remains unknown and further studies are needed.

With regard to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), we suggest using higher PEEP without lung recruitment maneuvers (LRMs) as opposed to lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS, and we recommend against using prolonged LRMs in patients with moderate to severe ARDS.

### Pharmacological treatments in ARDS; a state-of-the-art update [^1113XDYb]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids

Given their effective anti-inflammatory properties, there has been extensive interest in the potential role of corticosteroids in both the prevention and treatment of ARDS. Different regimens have been investigated, varying from short courses of high-dose steroids to prolonged courses of lower doses.

High dose corticosteroids do not prevent ARDS in at risk subjects. Therapeutically, both high-dose and moderate-dose steroids have so far failed to demonstrate efficacy in ARDS. An ARDSnet randomized, double-blind trial in 180 patients with ARDS for more than seven days, showed no effect of prolonged treatment with moderate-dose methylprednisolone compared to placebo (Table 1). Although patients were liberated from mechanical ventilation earlier, patients receiving methylprednisolone were more likely to resume assisted ventilation, which was thought to be secondary to neuromuscular effects. In addition, initiation of treatment after 14 days of ARDS was associated with a harmful effect, with increased mortality at 60 and 180 days.

However, the role of low-dose corticosteroids in established ARDS remains uncertain, with one study of 91 patients demonstrating prolonged low-dose methylprednisolone therapy reduces severity of lung injury by Day 7 of treatment (Table 1).

Despite a systematic review and meta-analysis, the role of steroids in ARDS remains unclear, and in light of ongoing uncertainty, further trials are both planned (NCT01731795) and on-going (NCT01284452) (Table 2). It is also worth highlighting that the studies included used what are now considered injurious ventilation strategies. It remains uncertain if steroids provide benefit when combined with lung protective (and, therefore, less inflammatory) ventilator strategies.

Methods

Data sources and searches

This meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA). We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to January 2021 via Ovid to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs), using the following search terms: ("ALI" OR "acute lung injury" OR "ARDS" OR "acute respiratory distress syndrome") AND ("steroids" OR "corticoid" OR "corticosteroid" OR "glucocorticoids" OR "hydrocortisone" OR "prednisolone" OR "dexamethasone" OR "methylprednisolone") AND ("randomized controlled trial" OR "controlled clinical trial" OR "randomized" OR "randomly" OR "trial"). The detail of the search strategy is shown in Additional file 1. Publication species were limited to humans. Besides, bibliographies of identified studies were also searched manually.

Study selection

The eligibility of each study identified from the literature search was assessed independently in a blinded fashion by two researchers. English-language, peer-reviewed studies meeting the following criteria were included in this meta-analysis: (1) study design: RCTs; (2) participant: adult patients with ARDS; (3) intervention: glucocorticoids versus control; (4) at least one of the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, number of ventilator-free days at day 28, oxygenation improvement (PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratios), and adverse events. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion.

Data abstraction and quality assessment

Using a standardized data collection form, two investigators independently extracted the following data from each eligible study: first author, publication year, number of patients, inclusion criteria, corticosteroid type, corticosteroid dose, therapy duration, and main outcomes. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. If hospital mortality was not reported, we used the closest time point for our analysis. Secondary outcomes included the number of ventilator-free days at day 28, PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratios, and adverse events.

The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias of the eligible studies. This tool comprises seven domains, and each domain scores as low, unclear, or high risk of bias: adequate sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel to the research protocol, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other bias. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion.

### Early short-course corticosteroids in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^113r4AHs]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

As of 9 April 2020, the United States has over 400 000 cases of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Most patients will have mild illness, but older persons and those with comorbidities may develop severe disease necessitating hospitalization and time in the intensive care unit (ICU). The disease pathophysiology presents in 2 distinct overlapping phases, the initial pathogenic viral response followed by host inflammatory response with grades of severity associated with distinct clinical findings. The pathological progression in severe COVID-19 includes an excessive and unregulated proinflammatory cytokine storm resulting in immunopathological lung injury, diffuse alveolar damage with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and death.

In the absence of any proven antiviral therapy, the current clinical management is primarily supportive care, supplemental oxygen, and mechanical ventilatory support. Adjunctive therapy with immunomodulatory agents targeting the inflammatory cytokine storm are being evaluated. Studies of corticosteroid therapy for phylogenetically similar coronavirus infections showed no benefit and potential harm. Despite the frequent use in treating patients with COVID-19 in China, the role of corticosteroids is undefined. A more recent observational study reported improved outcomes in patients with COVID-associated ARDS that received corticosteroids.

We postulated that early treatment with a short course of corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19 may attenuate the excessive host respiratory and systemic inflammatory responses. We report the clinical characteristics and early outcomes of patients with COVID-19 receiving short courses of methylprednisolone.

### Role of corticosteroids in the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^115k7cBG]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence exploring the use of corticosteroids for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has targeted various stages of disease progression, from preventing ARDS in high-risk patients to halting disease evolution once ARDS has developed.

Objective

The aim of this review was to evaluate randomized, controlled trials describing the role of corticosteroids in preventing and treating ARDS.

Methods

English-language randomized, controlled trials were identified using MEDLINE via PubMed and EMBASE searches (key terms: acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury, and corticosteroids; years: 1968-January 2008).

Results

A total of 10 trials were found and included in this analysis. Trials describing the role of high-dose corticosteroids compared with controls in preventing ARDS found no benefit, with the range of occurrence of ARDS in at-risk populations from 14% to 64% and absolute increases in mortality from 4% to 31%. Conflicting evidence was found for treating late-phase ARDS with corticosteroids, with 13% hospital mortality among patients receiving corticosteroids versus 63% with controls (P = 0.03) in one small study, but no significant difference was found when evaluating 60-day mortality (corticosteroid group, 29.2% vs control, 28.6%) in another investigation. The use of high-dose corticosteroids for the treatment of early phase ARDS was not associated with significant differences in 45-day mortality (methylprednisolone, 60% vs control, 63%). However, one trial found that methylprednisolone taper for early ARDS was associated with significant improvement in lung function or extubation (69.8% vs 35.7%; P = 0.002), fewer days on mechanical ventilation (median, 5.0 vs 9.5; P = 0.002), higher intensive care unit survival (79.4% vs 57.4%; P = 0.03), but similar rates of hospital survival (methylprednisolone, 76.2% vs control, 57.1%; P = NS).

Conclusions

Data from clinical trials did not support the use of short-course, high-dose corticosteroids for preventing ARDS or for the treatment of early ARDS. Longer-course corticosteroids have not conclusively been associated with improved survival in the treatment of late-phase ARDS but have provided some benefits in other markers of disease severity in this setting and in early phase ARDS. Published trials support the administration of low- to moderate-dose corticosteroids in the treatment of early (< 7 days) and late-phase (days 7\2–14) ARDS, but this evidence is controversial.

### Guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^111t6ft5]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

GRADE recommendation statement

The use of corticosteroids in established ARDS should be the subject of a suitably powered, multicentre RCT with long-term follow-up (GRADE Recommendation: research recommendation).

GRADE recommendation justification

Current evidence includes the possibility of substantial patient benefit and the risk of harm appears small, although the group noted that the trials did not include longer term follow-up of survivors. However, the evidence is of low to very low quality from clinical trials, which were mostly conducted before the current era of lung protective ventilation. In addition, the lack of sufficient power in any individual study or in the combined MA and the heterogeneity of the dose, timing and agent used also influenced the decision. The group believed that a position of equipoise exists and the research recommendation reflects this view.

As a caveat, it is worth mentioning that specific steroid responsive disorders may mimic ARDS, for example, pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonia and diffuse alveolar haemorrhage.

Implications for future research

A large, multicentre study on steroids in established ARDS is currently planned.

### Safety and efficacy of corticosteroids in ARDS patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCT data [^111dt3J3]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute and critical disease among children and adults, and previous studies have shown that the administration of corticosteroids remains controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of corticosteroids.

Methods

The RCTs investigating the safety and efficacy of corticosteroids in ARDS were searched from electronic databases (Embase, Medline, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Chi square test and I 2 with the inspection level of 0.1 and 50%, respectively.

Results

Fourteen RCTs (n = 1607) were included for analysis. Corticosteroids were found to reduce the risk of death in patients with ARDS (relative risk (RR) = 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.70–0.87; P < 0.01). Moreover, no significant adverse events were observed, compared to placebo or standard support therapy. Further subgroup analysis showed that variables, such as adults (RR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.70–0.88; P < 0.01), non-COVID-19 (RR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.62–0.83; P < 0.01), methylprednisolone (RR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.56–0.88; P < 0.01), and hydrocortisone (RR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.63–0.98; P = 0.03) were associated with 28-day mortality among patients who used corticosteroids. However, no association was found, regarding children (RR = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.01–4.10; P = 0.30).

Conclusion

The use of corticosteroids is an effective approach to reduce the risk of death in ARDS patients. However, this effect is associated with age, non-COVID-19 diseases, and methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone use. Therefore, evidence suggests patients with age ≥ 18 years and non-COVID-19 should be encouraged during the corticosteroid treatment. However, due to substantial differences in the use of corticosteroids among these studies, questions still remain regarding the dosage, optimal corticosteroid agent, and treatment duration in patients with ARDS.

Justification and implementation considerations

Although pooled analysis demonstrated a mortality benefit with moderate certainty of evidence, multiple caveats prompted a conditional recommendation. There is substantial heterogeneity in the dosing, timing, and duration of corticosteroids in clinical trials in patients with ARDS, resulting in uncertainty about the optimal course of treatment. Data addressing the short- and long-term adverse effects of corticosteroids are also limited; infectious complications could not be systematically evaluated, and there is low- to very low-certainty evidence for other safety outcomes. Additionally, previous studies assessing the use of corticosteroids for varied indications have demonstrated the potential for harm even when used in short courses.

There are several factors to consider for implementation (Figure 2). Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer. As such, they have the potential to reach and benefit a substantial number of patients. With regard to corticosteroid dosing and administration, although the panel was not comfortable making recommendations for a specific agent and course of therapy, there are some considerations that may help guide clinicians when selecting a regimen. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (i.e. severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit from corticosteroids, with regimens that have been defined and evaluated in large RCTs. For other ARDS etiologies, any of several regimens used in clinical trials (Table E10 in the online supplement) could reasonably be chosen based on the individual patient's risk profile for steroid side effects. Although the duration of corticosteroid treatment has varied in clinical trials, corticosteroids were stopped at the time of extubation in a number of the included studies. Additionally, although the optimal timing of therapy is also unclear, it is important to note that the initiation of corticosteroid treatment > 2 weeks after the onset of ARDS may be associated with harm. Furthermore, the use of corticosteroids should be accompanied by close surveillance for adverse effects, particularly in patient populations that may be at higher risks of harm, such as patients who are immunocompromised, have metabolic syndrome, or live in regions where infections such as tuberculosis and parasitic disease are endemic. Finally, although this recommendation is based on evidence from trials on intubated patients with ARDS and applies specifically to this group, corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit in some groups of nonintubated patients with ARDS. For nonintubated individuals, corticosteroids should be administered for those with ARDS etiologies known to benefit from corticosteroid treatment (i.e. COVID-19, severe community-acquired pneumonia). The role of steroids in nonintubated patients with ARDS of other etiologies remains uncertain.

### Use of corticosteroids in acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1143Bbga]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Controversy remains as to whether low-dose corticosteroids can reduce the mortality and morbidity of acute lung injury (ALI) or the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) without increasing the risk of adverse reactions. We aimed to evaluate all studies investigating prolonged corticosteroids in low-to-moderate dose in ALI or ARDS.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Content, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and bibliographies of retrieved articles.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies reported in any language that used 0.5–2.5 mg.kg.d of methylprednisolone or equivalent to treat ALI/ARDS.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers and included study design, patient characteristics, interventions, and mortality and morbidity outcomes.

Data Synthesis

Both cohort studies (five studies, n = 307) and RCTs (four trials, n = 341) showed a similar trend toward mortality reduction (RCTs relative risk 0.51, 95% CI 0.24–1.09; p = 0.08; cohort studies relative risk 0.66, 95% CI 0.43–1.02; p = 0.06). The overall relative risk was 0.62 (95% CI 0.43–0.91; p = 0.01). There was also improvement in length of ventilation-free days, length of intensive care unit stay, Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome Score, Lung Injury Scores, and improvement in Pao2/Fio2. There was no increase in infection, neuromyopathy, or any major complications. There was significant heterogeneity in the pooled studies. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses showed that heterogeneity had minimal effect on treatment efficacy; however, these findings were limited by the small number of studies used in the analyses.

Conclusion

The use of low-dose corticosteroids was associated with improved mortality and morbidity outcomes without increased adverse reactions. The consistency of results in both study designs and all outcomes suggests that they are an effective treatment for ALI or ARDS. The mortality benefits in early ARDS should be confirmed by an adequately powered randomized trial.
