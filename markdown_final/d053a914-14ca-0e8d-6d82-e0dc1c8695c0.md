## Question

What could cause persistent halitosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what could cause persistent halitosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the etiologic framework and the relative contributions of oral versus non-oral sources. Then, I should verify the most common oral causes and their mechanisms. Next, I will examine upper and lower respiratory tract sources, followed by gastrointestinal and systemic contributors. After that, I need to consider special populations and iatrogenic or medication-related causes. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized differential and outline a practical diagnostic approach with attention to evidence quality and limitations.

> Let me first confirm the overarching framework. Persistent halitosis is best categorized as physiological halitosis from oral bacterial putrefaction versus pathological halitosis from identifiable disease, and in roughly 80–90% of cases the source is intraoral, with the remaining minority arising from the upper/lower respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, or systemic metabolic conditions, so I should anchor on the mouth first and then escalate outward as needed [^1b4e384c] [^5ced7101].

> I will now examine the oral cavity as the primary source. Wait, let me verify the key niches: the posterior dorsal tongue harbors a biofilm rich in anaerobes that generate volatile sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and methanethiol, periodontal disease provides additional anaerobic niches and substrates, and xerostomia reduces salivary clearance and antimicrobial activity, thereby amplifying malodor. These mechanisms are consistently supported across reviews and guidelines, and the circadian fluctuation of VSCs tracks with eating and oral hygiene patterns, which aligns with clinical observation [^1b4e384c] [^5ced7101] [^14a4f1c4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about non-oral sources. I should confirm the next most common contributors. Upper respiratory tract sources include chronic rhinosinusitis with postnasal drip, tonsillar disease such as chronic fetid tonsillitis, and occasionally nasal obstruction with mouth breathing and dryness. Lower respiratory tract sources like bronchiectasis and lung infections are less frequent but important when oral and ENT causes are excluded, and these patterns are reflected in clinical evidence summaries and ENT-focused reviews [^18c242a2] [^0904ac53].

> Next, I should review gastrointestinal etiologies, and I need to be careful here because popular belief overattributes halitosis to the stomach. Gastroesophageal reflux can contribute via acid or nonacid refluxate and gas, and there are case-level reports of halitosis from mesh erosion after hiatal hernia repair, but I should emphasize that most halitosis is not gastric in origin and that GERD-related halitosis is a minority signal that warrants targeted evaluation when suggested by history or concomitant symptoms [^02b375f0] [^3e7b972d].

> Let me consider systemic and metabolic causes. Dry mouth from medications, Sjögren syndrome, or radiation reduces salivary cleansing and predisposes to halitosis, and certain drugs or metabolic states produce malodorous volatiles. For example, cysteamine in cystinosis generates dimethyl sulfide and methanethiol in breath, and tobacco smoke delivers hydrogen sulfide and other volatiles that can persist in the airway, so medication reconciliation and exposure history are essential parts of the workup [^57436c4a] [^f683635a] [^3ea130a6].

> But wait, what if the patient is post-bariatric or has altered anatomy. I should double-check that. After Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, halitosis can persist despite good oral health, likely related to altered oral microbiota, reduced salivary flow, and tongue coating, and vomiting may worsen coating and VSCs; this means I need to assess salivary function, tongue hygiene, and dietary patterns in this subgroup rather than assuming a gastric source [^a405212e].

> I need to ensure I account for special populations and iatrogenic factors. Patients with advanced cancer often have halitosis from periodontal disease, infections, or xerostomia, and guidelines stress treating the underlying cause rather than masking odor. Post-COVID patients may report taste and smell disturbances and dry mouth that can contribute to halitosis. And although tongue scraping can reduce VSCs, rare complications like infective endocarditis have been reported in susceptible hosts, so I should counsel on safe technique and cardiac risk [^f473b7b2] [^d4383afd] [^a2f2d027].

> Let me synthesize a prioritized differential. Most likely causes are oral: poor hygiene with tongue coating, gingivitis or periodontitis, and xerostomia. Next, I should consider upper airway sources such as chronic rhinosinusitis and tonsillar disease. Then, lower respiratory conditions like bronchiectasis. Finally, I should evaluate for GERD, medication-induced dry mouth or volatiles, and systemic or anatomical contributors such as Sjögren syndrome or post-bariatric changes, keeping in mind that true gastrointestinal halitosis is uncommon and should be a diagnosis of exclusion after oral and respiratory sources are addressed [^1b4e384c] [^18c242a2].

> Next, I should review a practical diagnostic approach and verify the sequence. Start with a thorough oral examination including tongue coating, periodontal status, and salivary flow. If negative, proceed to ENT evaluation for rhinosinusitis and tonsillar disease. If still unexplained, consider chest evaluation for lower respiratory sources. Reserve gastrointestinal workup for patients with compatible reflux or alarm features, and maintain a high index of suspicion for medication effects and systemic dryness syndromes throughout, aligning with evidence-based reviews and expert guidelines [^18c242a2] [^1b4e384c].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence for interventions because it shapes counseling. Systematic reviews show that while tongue cleaning, zinc-containing products, and antibacterial mouthwashes can reduce organoleptic scores and VSCs, the certainty of evidence is low to very low, so I should frame these as reasonable, low-risk measures with modest expected benefit rather than guaranteed cures, and I should avoid overpromising outcomes [^0d49f4c4] [^18c242a2].

> In summary, persistent halitosis is most often oral in origin due to bacterial putrefaction on the tongue and in periodontal pockets, with xerostomia amplifying the problem. Non-oral sources include upper and lower respiratory disease and, less commonly, gastrointestinal or systemic metabolic causes. A structured, stepwise evaluation starting with the mouth and escalating outward, coupled with targeted management of identified sources, yields the best results while avoiding unnecessary invasive testing [^1b4e384c] [^18c242a2].

Persistent halitosis is most often due to **oral causes** such as poor hygiene, periodontal disease, tongue coating, and dry mouth [^1b4e384c], with bacteria producing volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) as the primary odor source [^14a4f1c4]. Non-oral causes include **chronic sinusitis, tonsillitis, GERD, and systemic conditions** like diabetes, liver, or kidney disease [^18c242a2] [^02b375f0]. Management focuses on **improving oral hygiene** (brushing, flossing, tongue cleaning, hydration) [^5ced7101], treating underlying disease, and using zinc or chlorhexidine rinses; persistent cases need dental, ENT, or gastroenterology evaluation [^f8422566].

---

## Oral causes of persistent halitosis

Oral causes account for **approximately 80–90% of halitosis cases** [^1b4e384c] [^14a4f1c4]. The most common include:

- **Poor oral hygiene**: Inadequate brushing and flossing allow food debris, plaque, and bacteria to accumulate, producing VSCs such as hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan [^14a4f1c4].

- **Periodontal disease**: Gingivitis and periodontitis provide anaerobic niches that generate VSCs and other malodorous compounds [^notfound].

- **Tongue coating**: The posterior dorsal tongue harbors bacteria and food debris; thick coating correlates with higher VSC levels [^notfound].

- **Dry mouth (xerostomia)**: Reduced salivary flow diminishes natural cleansing, allowing bacterial overgrowth and VSC accumulation [^57436c4a].

- **Dental infections**: Caries, abscesses, and necrotic tissue emit foul odors [^notfound].

---

## Non-oral causes of persistent halitosis

Although less common, **non-oral sources** are important in refractory cases:

| **Category** | **Specific conditions** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Respiratory tract | - Chronic sinusitis <br/> - Tonsillitis <br/> - Bronchiectasis <br/> - Postnasal drip | Infection, mucus, and bacterial overgrowth produce malodor [^18c242a2] |
| Gastrointestinal | - GERD <br/> - Hiatal hernia <br/> - Helicobacter pylori | Reflux, regurgitation, and bacterial metabolism cause odor [^02b375f0] |
| Systemic | - Diabetes <br/> - Liver disease <br/> - Kidney disease <br/> - Trimethylaminuria | Metabolic byproducts are excreted via breath [^notfound] |
| Medications | - Antidepressants <br/> - Antihistamines <br/> - Diuretics | Xerostomia and altered metabolism contribute to halitosis [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential to identify the cause:

- **History**: Onset, duration, hygiene, dry mouth, GERD, sinus, or systemic symptoms [^notfound].

- **Oral examination**: Plaque, calculus, periodontal pockets, tongue coating, caries, infections [^notfound].

- **Specialized tests**: Halimeter for VSCs, organoleptic testing, and BANA test for specific bacteria [^notfound].

- **Referral**: ENT for sinus/tonsillar disease; gastroenterology for GERD or GI sources; endocrinology for metabolic causes [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management targets the **underlying cause**:

- **Oral hygiene**: Brush twice daily, floss, clean the tongue, and use antibacterial rinses (chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium, or zinc-containing products) [^5ced7101].

- **Professional care**: Scaling, root planing, and treatment of periodontal disease [^f473b7b2].

- **Hydration**: Increase water intake, use sugar-free gum/lozenges, and consider saliva substitutes for xerostomia [^notfound].

- **Diet**: Limit odoriferous foods (garlic, onions, alcohol) and avoid tobacco [^5ced7101].

- **Medical treatment**: Treat sinusitis, GERD, or systemic disease; adjust medications causing dry mouth when possible [^notfound].

---

Persistent halitosis is **primarily oral** in origin, driven by bacterial metabolism of sulfur-containing substrates, with non-oral causes including respiratory, gastrointestinal, and systemic conditions. A **stepwise approach** — improving oral hygiene, treating disease, and using evidence-based rinses — resolves most cases, while refractory halitosis warrants specialist evaluation.

### Interventions for managing halitosis [^0d49f4c4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Halitosis or bad breath is a symptom in which a noticeably unpleasant breath odour is present due to an underlying oral or systemic disease. 50% to 60% of the world population has experienced this problem which can lead to social stigma and loss of self-confidence. Multiple interventions have been tried to control halitosis ranging from mouthwashes and toothpastes to lasers. This new Cochrane Review incorporates Cochrane Reviews previously published on tongue scraping and mouthrinses for halitosis.

Objectives

The objectives of this review were to assess the effects of various interventions used to control halitosis due to oral diseases only. We excluded studies including patients with halitosis secondary to systemic disease and halitosis-masking interventions.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 8 April 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 3) in the Cochrane Library (searched 8 April 2019), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 8 April 2019), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 8 April 2019). We also searched LILACS BIREME (1982 to 19 April 2019), the National Database of Indian Medical Journals (1985 to 19 April 2019), OpenGrey (1992 to 19 April 2019), and CINAHL EBSCO (1937 to 19 April 2019). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (8 April 2019), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (8 April 2019), the ISRCTN Registry (19 April 2019), the Clinical Trials Registry - India (19 April 2019), were searched for ongoing trials. We also searched the cross-references of included studies and systematic reviews published on the topic. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which involved adults over the age of 16, and any intervention for managing halitosis compared to another or placebo, or no intervention. The active interventions or controls were administered over a minimum of one week and with no upper time limit. We excluded quasi-randomised trials, trials comparing the results for less than one week follow-up, and studies including advanced periodontitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two pairs of review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We estimated mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 44 trials in the review with 1809 participants comparing an intervention with a placebo or a control. The age of participants ranged from 17 to 77 years. Most of the trials reported on short-term follow-up (ranging from one week to four weeks). Only one trial reported long-term follow-up (three months). Three studies were at low overall risk of bias, 16 at high overall risk of bias, and the remaining 25 at unclear overall risk of bias. We compared different types of interventions which were categorised as mechanical debridement, chewing gums, systemic deodorising agents, topical agents, toothpastes, mouthrinse/mouthwash, tablets, and combination methods. Mechanical debridement: for mechanical tongue cleaning versus no tongue cleaning, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported organoleptic test (OLT) scores (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.07; 2 trials, 46 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Chewing gums: for 0.6% eucalyptus chewing gum versus placebo chewing gum, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.11; 1 trial, 65 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Systemic deodorising agents: for 1000 mg champignon versus placebo, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome patient-reported visual analogue scale (VAS) scores (MD -1.07, 95% CI -14.51 to 12.37; 1 trial, 40 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for dentist-reported OLT score or adverse events. Topical agents: for hinokitiol gel versus placebo gel, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.27, 95% CI -1.26 to 0.72; 1 trial, 18 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Toothpastes: for 0.3% triclosan toothpaste versus control toothpaste, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -3.48, 95% CI -3.77 to -3.19; 1 trial, 81 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Mouthrinse/mouthwash: for mouthwash containing chlorhexidine and zinc acetate versus placebo mouthwash, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.18; 1 trial, 44 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Tablets: no data were reported on key outcomes for this comparison. Combination methods: for brushing plus cetylpyridium mouthwash versus brushing, the evidence was uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.48, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.24; 1 trial, 70 participants; low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low- to very low-certainty evidence to support the effectiveness of interventions for managing halitosis compared to placebo or control for the OLT and patient-reported outcomes tested. We were unable to draw any conclusions regarding the superiority of any intervention or concentration. Well-planned RCTs need to be conducted by standardising the interventions and concentrations.

### Serum lipidome unravels a diagnostic potential in bile acid diarrhoea [^5fb321f4]. Gut (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bile acid diarrhoea (BAD) is a gastrointestinal disease with high stool frequency, diarrhoea, faecal urgency and incontinence as primary symptoms. It is caused by a pathophysiological spill-over of bile acids to the colon, where these natural detergent molecules irritate the colonic mucosa causing the abovementioned symptoms.BAD can be idiopathic (primary BAD) or secondary to other diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease or cholecystectomy. Due to the nature of the symptoms, BAD is a socially debilitating disease with a high cost to the individualand at the societal level.BAD is normally treated with bile acid sequestrants that bind bile acids in the intestinal lumen diminishing the symptoms, but the effect of bile acid sequestrants is variable and they are associated with gastrointestinal side effects. Recently, a new treatment strategy based on the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist liraglutide has shown promising results. Studies have estimated that the prevalence of BAD is 1% in the adult population, but BAD is heavily underdiagnosed partly due to the use of different and often challenging diagnostic procedures. BAD can be diagnosed in several ways, but currently, the most accurate diagnostic test is the 75 selenium homotaurocholic acid (SeHCAT) test where the 7-day retention of an orally administered radio-labelled bile acid is measured. The SeHCAT test is not approved in all countries (including USA) where instead a 48-hour stool collection, trial and error with bile acid sequestrantsor a breath testcan be used. Also, 7-alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), which represents a surrogate marker for bile acid synthesis, and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), a surrogate marker of bile acid resorption and regulator of bile acid metabolism, can be used to diagnose BAD. All the current diagnostic methods have limitations. The SeHCAT test is expensive, entails radioactive exposure and requires two visits to the clinic with precisely 7 days interval; 48-hour stool collection is time-consuming and irksome; trial and error with bile acid sequestrants has a potential high false-negative rate; and the breath test is imprecise and time-consuming. Using C4 or FGF19 as diagnostic tools have still not been standardised for clinical use and often presents low sensitivity. Thus, new accurate diagnostic tools, which can be used worldwide, at low cost and with minimal intervention, are urgently needed.

### Halitosis [^d5e6b886]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Halitosis (oral malodor, bad breath) is a condition affecting millions of Americans and is a major concern to the general public. In healthy individuals complaining of bad breath, the mouth is the main source of their oral malodor, more specifically the posterior dorsum of the tongue. Halitosis may also indicate an underlying medical condition that necessitates treatment. In a patient with oral malodor for whom an underlying systemic problem has been ruled out, improved oral hygiene, removal of tongue plaque, and, if necessary, antibacterial mouth rinses are advised.

### Association between halitosis and female fecundability in China: a prospective cohort study [^dfa14cb5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Microorganisms, especially anaerobic bacteria, are the main cause of bad breath and PD. Previous studies showed that oral flora can go through uterine cavity, amnion cavity, placenta, and even fetus, and has been suggested to be an important risk factor for recurrent miscarriage, intrauterine death, preterm birth and neonatal death. For example, Porphyromonas gingivalis, which plays an important role in the development of halitosis, was found in both periodontal pocket and amniotic fluid of women at high-risk of premature labor. A recent study found that Porphyromonas gingivalis infection in female genital tract was associated with recurrent miscarriages. Elevated levels of inflammatory mediators in saliva and some mediators in serum have been found among pre-conception women with periodontal disease.

Oral bacteria are also found to be associated with infection at extra-oral locations, such as lung, vasculature and pancreas. Bacterial pathogens could activate a cascade of tissue-destructive pathways and elevated systemic levels of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, which could lead to chronic systemic inflammation. Such low-grade systemic inflammation is thought to present an endometrial effect similar to endometriosis, which could negatively affect fertility and conception. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that increased oral pathogenic bacteria might circulate through bloodstream, enter reproductive organ, and then, result in reduced fecundability.

### The safety and efficacy of an herbal chlorhexidine gel on… [^14a4f1c4]. isrctn.com (2025). Medium credibility.

Condition category Oral Health Plain English summary of protocol Background and study aims Halitosis is a common, yet socially stigmatizing condition that affects roughly 30–50% of the population. Ninety percent of all cases of halitosis are estimated to come. from the oral cavity, and the remainder from the gut microbiome and systemic disease. Halitosis that originates in the oral cavity is caused by volatile sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and Methanethiol, which are byproducts of the sulfur-. metabolizing bacteria that reside primarily in periodontal pockets, cheek mucosa and the dorsum of the tongue. The substrates of these bacteria are the sulfur-containing amino acids which are commonly found in everyday food sources. Thus, halitosis of oral origin is circadian, rising and.

falling in combination with ingestion and varying in intensity throughout a 24-hour period. Therefore, the aim of this study is to test the efficacy of an Herbal Chlorhexidine oral gel in subjects with chronic oral halitosis to determine the reduction in oral bacteria and associated VSC. What are the possible benefits and risks of participating. Participants may benefit from using the gel as it contains botanical ingredients known for their impact on halitosis so it is anticipated the treatment gel will have a longer lasting and more substantial affect. The treatment gel contains material commonly available in many mouthwashes with side-effects including dry mouth and unpleasant taste. eight, 15 and 22 Secondary outcome measures Current secondary outcome measures as of 11/01/2018: Quality of life is assessed using a modified Halitosis Associated Life Quality Test at the beginning and end of the trial period.

### Oxaliplatin [^dd8a55e2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Advise patients of the potential risk of hypersensitivity and that oxaliplatin injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to oxaliplatin and other platinum-based drugs. Instruct patients to seek immediate medical attention for signs of severe hypersensitivity reaction such as chest tightness; shortness of breath; wheezing; dizziness or faintness; or swelling of the face, eyelids, or lips [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

 Peripheral Sensory Neuropathy

Advise patients of the risk of acute reversible or persistent-type neurosensory toxicity. Advise patients to avoid cold drinks, use of ice, and exposure of skin to cold temperature or cold objects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

 Myelosuppression

Inform patients that oxaliplatin injection can cause low blood cell counts and the need for frequent monitoring of blood cell counts. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider immediately for bleeding, fever, particularly if associated with persistent diarrhea, or symptoms of infection develop [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome

Advise patients of the potential effects of vision abnormalities, in particular transient vision loss (reversible following therapy discontinuation), which may affect the patients' ability to drive and use machines [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Bile acid diarrhoea: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^bd9cf5c0]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

While part of the pathophysiology behind BAD has been elicited, there are gaps in knowledge as to what causes the disruption of the feedback loop in the case of idiopathic BAD. This may be limiting advances in diagnosis and treatment of the disease. 75 SeHCAT or C4 measuement is still the most commonly used methods for diagnosis though novel technologies such as e-nose are emerging. Spot faecal bile acid measurement may hold some potential but requires further validation and may prove difficult to use routinely in clinic. BAD is a treatable disease, however, the delay in diagnosis causes a significant increase in the diagnostic care cost as well as affecting the quality of life of patients. Further avenues for research should look into further defining the reasons behind the disruption of the negative feedback loops to target treatment.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^503631b1]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

General approach — first aid scene assessment and EMS activation criteria: The first step in the first aid response is to assess the scene for hazards and threats and to take actions to protect oneself, such as using personal protective equipment (PPE). First aid providers should assess the ill or injured person by checking for responsiveness, breathing, and potential injuries. Any abnormalities in responsiveness or breathing and any major injuries should be viewed as an emergency and should prompt activation of EMS. Signs of a first aid emergency requiring professional assistance include unresponsiveness or new confusion; breathing that is silent, abnormal sounding, too fast, or too slow; severe or life-threatening bleeding; persistent vomiting or diarrhea; pallor, weakness, lethargy, diaphoresis, weak or absent peripheral pulses; evidence of allergic reaction such as hives, facial swelling, difficulty breathing, or vomiting; loss of vision, hearing, speech, movement, or balance; severe pain, including chest and abdominal pain; unusual behavior, especially actions that may cause harm (eg, walking into traffic); bites and stings from venomous snakes, scorpions, spiders, and certain insects; exposure to toxins and poisons; and broken and dislocated limbs and joints. Whenever possible, first aid providers should approach from the direction that the person who needs help is facing, so as not to surprise or startle them and cause unnecessary movement.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of refractory celiac disease: expert review [^e77055be]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Nonresponsive celiac disease — Best Practice Advice 3: For patients with nonresponsive celiac disease, after exclusion of gluten ingestion, perform a systematic evaluation for other potential causes of symptoms, including functional bowel disorders, microscopic colitis, pancreatic insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, lactose or fructose intolerance, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Colonoscopy is indicated in patients with celiac disease and persistent or recurrent diarrhea because of the increased risk of microscopic colitis and inflammatory bowel disease, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth can be detected by means of breath testing. The low FODMAP diet is not indicated in all patients with nonresponsive celiac disease, and pancreatic insufficiency is common in this setting and can be treated with gluten-free pancreatic enzyme supplements. Refractory celiac disease should be strongly considered in patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms or signs of malabsorption after exclusion of other more common causes and malignancy.

### Association between halitosis and female fecundability in China: a prospective cohort study [^26574b16]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Time to pregnancy (TTP) defined as the time from removing the contraceptive measures to achieving conception with timely intercou r se, has been widely used as an informative measure of couple fertility in epidemiological studies. A TTP longer than 12 months is a usual cut-off to define infertility though a 24-month cut-off of TTP for infertility is also used. Infertility is defined as couples having had unprotected sex but failed to conceive naturally for 12 or 24 months. Extensive evidence has shown that advanced woman's age, smoking, drinking, obesity, endocrine disorders and environmental factors are associated with prolonged TTP and infertility.

Recently, three epidemiologic studies suggested that periodontal diseases (PD) and poor oral hygiene were also associated with increased TTP. It was postulated that bad oral health may exert adverse endometrial effects through systemic inflammation. However, little is known about the association between oral health problems and TTP in Asian populations.

Halitosis, commonly called "bad breath" or "oral malodor", is defined as an unpleasant or offensive odor mostly arising from the oral cavity. It is prevalent worldwide and affects all ages. More than 80% of the cases had intra-oral causes a, such as poor oral hygiene, gingivitis, periodontitis and dry mouth. Keeping clean and healthy oral conditions, as well as periodontal treatment have been shown to be the most basic and effective methods to prevent and reduce halitosis. Therefore, we hypothesize that halitosis might be a proxy for overall poor oral health. This study aimed to investigate the association between halitosis and female fecundability in a prospective study in Chinese women.

Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) — In individuals aged 18 y and older with persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends against BT; however, individuals aged 18 y and older with persistent asthma who place a low value on harms (short-term worsening symptoms and unknown long-term side effects) and a high value on potential benefits (improvement in quality of life, a small reduction in exacerbations) might consider BT.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^2a068fec]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

How to make the diagnosis of asthma in other contexts — Patients presenting with persistent cough as the only respiratory symptom may have cough‑variant or cough predominant asthma, but common causes of an isolated non‑productive cough also include chronic upper airway cough syndrome (often called 'postnasal drip'), cough induced by angiotensin‑converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, gastroesophageal reflux, chronic sinusitis, post‑infectious cough, inducible laryngeal obstruction, and eosinophilic bronchitis. In cough variant asthma, a persistent cough is the only symptom, or, in cough predominant asthma, the most prominent symptom, and the cough may be worse at night or with exercise, and in some patients it is productive. Spirometry is usually normal, and the only abnormality in lung function may be airway hyperresponsiveness.

### A proposed tailored investigational algorithm for women treated for gynaecological cancer with long-term gastrointestinal consequences [^bb4058ba]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B 12 deficiency is a potent cause for tiredness and is linked to memory problems, anaemia and breathlessness. Levels are often low in those with bile acid malabsorption and SIBO. Up to 23% of women treated for gynaecological cancer were previously reported to have decreased vitamin B 12 levels and in this cohort, it was detected in 30%.

Interpretation of all currently available investigations to diagnose SIBO is problematic and it is difficult to ascertain how effective treatment for SIBO is without systematic re-testing. A breath test should remain a first-line test in this patient cohort. In view of antibiotic stewardship, a duodenal aspirate may be helpful in people with recurrent SIBO or persistent symptoms.

Bile acid diarrhoea has an estimated prevalence in the general population of 1% and is frequently misdiagnosed as IBS. Bile acid malabsorption was diagnosed in 47% in our cohort. Some of these may have had primary bile acid diarrhoea and unrecognized pre-treatment, which exacerbated during treatment but for many, new onset symptoms were likely secondary to the effect of chemo-radiotherapy on the absorptive capacity for bile of the terminal ileum. Our finding is in keeping with other studies. Bile acid malabsorption is often thought as causing chronic watery stool. We have previously shown that a wide spectrum of symptoms improves when bile acid malabsorption is adequately treated. It is therefore particularly interesting that 40% of patients in whom we made this diagnosis only had urgency and did not report loose stool. In some, opioids or anti-diarrhoeal medication may have masked their diarrhoea; this highlights that urgency in this patient group may be a marker for bile acid malabsorption.

### Bile acid diarrhea-as bad as it gets? [^19b0ed3f]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bile acid diarrhea (BAD) is a common but under-recognized gastrointestinal condition that manifests with increased stool frequency and urgency, and a looser stool consistency. The aim of this review is to present recent advances in the pathophysiology, mechanisms, manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of BAD.

Recent Findings

Patients with BAD have evidence of accelerated colonic transit, increased gut mucosal permeability, altered stool microbiome composition, and decreased quality of life. Single, random stool measurements of bile acids, alone or in combination with fasting serum 7-alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, have shown good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of BAD. Novel therapeutic approaches include farnesoid X receptor agonists and glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists.

Summary

Recent research has led to a better understanding of the pathophysiology and mechanisms of BAD, which might pave the way towards more targeted treatment strategies for BAD. Newer, more affordable, and easier diagnostic methods facilitate the diagnosis of BAD.

### Occupational and environmental contributions to chronic cough in adults: chest expert panel report [^9052cef8]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Tobacco smoke deposition, composition, and oxidative burden — mechanistic factors relevant to chronic cough: Close to 60% of inhaled particulates are deposited in the lung, and unprotonated or free-based nicotine dissolves easily in lung fluid and passes into the blood; its amount correlates with the harshness or smoothness of the cigarette. Tobacco smoke generated by drawing a breath through the butt of a lighted cigarette, cigar, or pipe is called mainstream smoke. Mainstream smoke has a vapor phase and a particulate/tar phase, and both phases contain high concentrations of free radicals — estimated to be as much as 10^14 free radicals per puff of cigarette. The vapor phase contains cadmium, hydrogen cyanide, acetaldehyde, acrolein, hydrogen sulfide, and volatile organic compounds.

### Bile acid diarrhea in adults and adolescents [^dceaf66e]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Bile acids are central to enterohepatic signaling pathways activated through natural receptors, farnesoid X receptor [FXR mediates synthesis of fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF-19)], and G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1, also known as TGR5). Although bile acid diarrhea (BAD) is more commonly encountered in ileal resection or disease, there is evidence documenting "idiopathic" BAD in about 20% of adolescents and 30% of adults presenting with chronic, non-bloody diarrhea often attributed to irritable bowel syndrome. Mechanism(s) leading to increased hepatic synthesis and colonic bile acid levels in "idiopathic" BAD include reduced synthesis of FGF-19 by the ileal mucosa, or genetic variation in hepatocyte proteins klotho β and FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4) that mediate negative feedback of bile acid synthesis.

Purpose

The objective of this review is to summarize the diagnosis of BAD in adults and adolescents. In addition to 75 SeHCAT retention for diagnosis of BAD, studies have validated fasting serum 7αC4 and FGF-19, respectively, by-product and inhibitor of hepatic bile acid synthesis, as well as fecal bile acid measurements. These assays are widely available through reference laboratories, and they are being simplified (eg, measurement of primary fecal bile acids in a random stool sample). BAD has also been identified as a co-factor contributing to persistent diarrhea in other diseases in remission including inflammatory bowel disease, microscopic colitis, celiac disease, and neuroendocrine tumors. In summary, advances in diagnosis of BAD provide opportunities for generalists and pediatric and adult gastroenterologists to provide targeted treatment for BAD presenting as chronic non-bloody diarrhea.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert review [^87798869]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Investigating pathophysiologic mechanisms beyond inflammation — For persistent gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), subsequent testing should be guided by predominant symptom patterns. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) shows increased prevalence in IBD (odds ratio, 10.5; 95% CI, 2.5–44.8); however, falsely low fecal elastase may be secondary to diarrhea and the clinical significance of PEI in IBD remains undefined. For bile acid diarrhea (BAD), diagnostic options include assessment of 48-hour fecal bile acid excretion with reasonable diagnostic yield compared with 75SeHCAT retention, and serological testing of serum C4 and FGF19 may represent practical diagnostic tools, although further clinical validation is required; BAD may not only be important in CD with ileal disease but is also a common cause of functional diarrhea or diarrhea-predominant IBS. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in CD is common, occurring in up to 30%, may be particularly important in stricturing or fistulizing phenotypes and may be associated with hypomotility or loss of the ileocecal valve, whereas in UC the reported prevalence is lower and its role in producing symptoms less clear.

### Bile acid diarrhoea: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^9aba8363]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Key points

Idiopathic bile acid diarrhoea (BAD) is due to overproduction of bile acids (rather than malabsorption).
The negative feedback loops involved in bile acid synthesis are interrupted in BAD but there is lack of data regarding what causes the interruption.
There is increasing evidence of an interplay between the gut microbiota, farnesoid X receptor and fibroblast growth factor 19 in BAD.
Tests for BAD such as SeHCAT are not available worldwide but alternatives include plasma C4 testing and possibly faecal bile acid measurement.
Idiopathic BAD is due to overproduction of bile acids (rather than malabsorption).

### Diagnosis and management of bile acid diarrhoea: a survey of UK expert opinion and practice [^7c4dc2b8]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Excess bile acids in the colon are increasingly recognised as causing a wide spectrum of gastrointestinal symptoms, in particular intermittent or persistent diarrhoea, but also in many patients, bowel frequency, urgency, nocturnal defaecation, excessive flatulence, abdominal pain and sometimes faecal incontinence. This condition has been termed bile acid diarrhoea (BAD), bile acid malabsorption (BAM) or bile salt malabsorption and has also been known as cholerheic enteropathy when first described over 50 years ago.

Following ileal resection, or sometimes in other gastrointestinal disorders such as active Crohn's disease, during cancer chemotherapy or after pelvic irradiation, the reabsorption of conjugated bile salts in the terminal ileum is decreased, resulting in excess colonic bile acids producing fluid and electrolyte secretion. A clinical response occurs to bile acid sequestrants (BAS), including colestyramine, colestipol or colesevelam. In patients with no cause for secondary BAM, primary or idiopathic BAD is common and forms a subset of those diagnosed with chronic functional diarrhoea or irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhoea (IBS-D). Most of these patients have no defect in bile acid absorption. The mechanism of this condition is hepatic overproduction of bile acids, as shown by increased blood concentrations of the bile acid precursor 7α-OH-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) and secondary to impaired feedback by the ileal hormone fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19).

### Bile acid diarrhoea: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^771bbb20]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Urine

There has also been a study to detect volatile organic compounds in urine of patients with BAD. This revealed detection of 2-propanol and acetamide as markers of BAD, compared with healthy controls and patients with inflammatory bowel disease. This may prove a novel way to diagnose BAD but further validation studies are required.

There has also been some experimental work using an electronic nose to detect volatile organic compounds. This is still being investigated, however, the chemical signature profile of patients with BAD were different to those with ulcerative colitis and healthy controls. Its purported mechanisms include gut dysbiosis or dysfermention in response to disease. The main gases identified in patients with BAD were 2-propanolol and acetamide.

Therapeutic trials

Bile acid sequestrants are sometimes used in a therapeutic trial if no other diagnostic methods are available. In a series of 264 patients where 53% had BAD, 44% failed to respond to cholestyramine alone. Half of these non-responders derived benefit from Colesevelam (unlicensed but used with extended indication). Thus, lack of response to cholestyramine does not constitute exclusion of BAD hence therapeutic trials of bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine or colesevelam) are not recommended. This has been affirmed also by the BSG chronic diarrhoea guidelines. A patient-reported outcome study has shown that if the diagnosis of BAD is delayed, often by more than 5 years, due to poor recognition of the disease patients quality of life is affected negatively. Delayed investigation and treatment of BAD has been shown to almost double the diagnostic care-of-package cost.

### ACG clinical guideline: small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [^97633f86]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth — breath testing endpoints emphasize symptom-based outcomes and a methane-specific threshold: In hydrogen subjects, a key secondary endpoint could be diarrhea or loose stool, with other symptoms as exploratory secondary endpoints. Methane would be considered a special case in which constipation is a key feature and could be the primary symptom and endpoint with bloating a key secondary outcome. For methane, a value of no greater than 10 ppm would be considered successful eradication. Because methane production and constipation have been shown to be correlated, a key secondary endpoint could be reduction in methane from baseline with corresponding reduction in constipation.

### Methanogens and hydrogen sulfide producing bacteria guide distinct gut microbe profiles and irritable bowel syndrome subtypes [^0a508689]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is estimated to affect 1 in 10 people globally, with a prevalence of 11.8%–14.0% in North America. IBS subjects suffer from abdominal pain, bloating, and have alterations in stool form and frequency that occur for at least 6 months. Based on the predominant stool pattern, IBS is divided into 3 main subtypes: constipation-predominant (IBS-C), diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D), and mixed constipation and diarrhea (IBS-M).

Although the etiology of IBS remains incompletely understood, there is a growing body of literature suggesting a role for the intestinal microbiome. However, specific findings have been inconsistent between studies. This may be due to the heterogeneous nature of IBS and grouping different IBS subtypes together. Despite this, one consistent finding is the association between small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and the IBS-D subtype, based on a recent large meta-analysis of both breath testing and small bowel culture studies. A diagnosis of SIBO is based on the presence of increased hydrogen (H 2) on the breath test, and studies have found that SIBO is present in more than 80% of IBS-D subjects. However, new data suggest that another gas produced by gut microbes, hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), may also be involved in diarrheal conditions. H 2 S is a gasotransmitter (gaseous signaling molecule) and is involved in numerous functions throughout the body, including inflammation and mucosal repair in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. However, increased levels of sulfate-reducing bacteria (which produce H 2 S) have been linked to colorectal cancer and ulcerative colitis, which is associated with persistent diarrhea. More recently, we have found that increased H 2 S levels on the breath test may be associated with IBS-D, although clinically significant thresholds depend on the degree of diarrhea.

### Laser cryptolysis for the treatment of halitosis [^0904ac53]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the tonsils as a source of halitosis and to assess the efficacy of laser CO(2) cryptolysis for the treatment of oral bad breath caused by chronic fetid tonsillitis.

Methods

Fifty-three patients with halitosis originating from chronic fetid tonsillitis, who completed laser cryptolysis were enrolled in the study. The origin of halitosis was demonstrated by Finkelstein's tonsil smelling test, which included massaging the tonsils and smelling the squeezed discharge. All patients were treated by laser cryptolysis, an office procedure done under topical anesthesia. Subjective and objective postoperative assessment was based on self-and-family report and clinical assessment. Patients were reexamined 4 to 6 weeks post-treatment, and when the need for further laser treatment was determined.

Results

Complete elimination of halitosis required one session in 28 patients (52.8%), 2 sessions in 18 patients (34%), and 3 sessions in 5 patients (9.4%). Follow-up period ranged from 3 to 36 months (mean, 20.8 ± 8.5 months). No adverse effects or complications were encountered.

Conclusions

After excluding dental or periodontal, sinonasal, oral, pulmonary, or gastroenterological diseases as the origin of halitosis, chronic fetid tonsillitis remains a common cause of halitosis. Patients suffering from halitosis should be treated relying on their examination including Finkelstein's tonsil smelling test. Laser CO(2) cryptolysis is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated procedure for the treatment of halitosis.

### Laryngoscopic techniques modulate anaesthesiologists' perception of halitosis in patients: a randomised controlled trial [^1e6d36b2]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chinese anaesthesiologists experience a considerable degree of burnout and low job satisfaction. Anaesthesiologists are usually exposed to potential health risks, including occupational hazards, in their day-to-day practice. The occupational hazards include physical risks (e.g. noise), ergonomic risks (e.g. awkward postures) and mental risks (e.g. stress that may cause work absence or work-related disorders). Doleman et al. found an association between the patient's American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade and the anaesthesiologist's risk of increased stress as well as impairment of nontechnical skills during intubation. The administration of general anaesthesia is one of the most frequently conducted procedures in anaesthesiology. The mental and physical workloads can be intense during general anaesthesia, and the awkward posture that anaesthesiologists employ during intubation has been reported as a stressor. In addition, the patient's oral malodor would prove to be unpleasant or offensive for the anaesthesiologist during intubation.

Oral malodor, also known as halitosis or bad breath, ranges from 2% to more than 70% in the general population. – At our hospital, our pilot data found that nearly 40% of patients manifest halitosis during intubation, which poses an additional stressor that may be a potential risk to patient safety during anaesthesia. Despite the prevalence of the problem that halitosis poses for anaesthesiologists, objective data on this topic are absent from the literature.

Videolaryngoscopy – compared with Macintosh's direct laryngoscopy – facilitates a more ergonomic posture for anaesthesiologists, and provides an extended distance to the head of the manikin during intubation. Moreover, the greater proximity of the patient's mouth to the anaesthesiologist's nose might worsen the discomfort caused by the patient's halitosis and may impair the efficiency with which the anaesthesiologist operates.

The effects of different laryngoscopic techniques on anaesthesiologists' perception of patients' halitosis has remained largely unknown, although it is hypothesised that the greater proximity of the patient's mouth to the anaesthesiologist's nose could worsen the malodor-induced discomfort and possibly influence the anaesthesiologist's performance of duties.

The present clinical trial was designed to investigate the anaesthesiologist's perception of patients' oral malodor during intubation with different laryngoscopic techniques.

New techniques note that current breath tests have low sensitivity and specificity and need additional validation; the lactulose breath test has been criticized for high false-positive values and the glucose breath test for low sensitivity for detecting distal SIBO; a unique orally ingested capsule technology under development can measure in vivo hydrogen and carbon dioxide after a carbohydrate meal and may provide a better alternative to current breath hydrogen measurement techniques.

### Association of oral manifestations with severity of the disease in ulcerative colitis patients [^f064f7aa]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

In various studies, several oral manifestations have been linked to UC. These include PSV — characterized by pustules and ulcerations on the oral mucosa — Recurrent Aphthous Ulcers (RAU), Atrophic Glossitis (AG) affecting taste perception, Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS), Angular Cheilitis (AC) at the corners of the mouth, Dry Mouth (Xerostomia), altered taste perception, Halitosis (Bad Breath), and an increased risk of periodontitis. These manifestations can sometimes serve as early indicators of UC and are valuable for monitoring patients' health. Dentists and gastroenterologists may not always recognize the potential connection between the severity of gastrointestinal diseases and specific oral lesions in these patients. Consequently, this relationship often remains undiscovered. Poor oral and dental health is linked to a reduced risk of future UC. Patients with Crohn's disease who have proximal gastrointestinal or perineal involvement exhibit a higher incidence of oral lesions, estimated to be between 20% and 50%. Additionally, individuals with moderate and severe UC show a greater prevalence of oral manifestations.

This study investigates the relationship between oral signs and symptoms and disease severity, while also determining the prevalence of such signs and symptoms in these patients.

### Halitosis in obese patients and those undergoing bariatric surgery [^a405212e]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Patients undergoing bariatric surgery often complain of bad breath. However, the relationship between bariatric surgery and halitosis is relatively unknown. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare the occurrence of halitosis among patients before and after a specific type of bariatric surgery, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and its relationship with the tongue coating index, plaque index, and salivary flow rate.

Methods

A total of 62 patients with good oral health and in treatment for obesity at the walk-in clinic of Santa Casa Hospital, Belo Horizonte, Brazil, were selected. Of this sample, 31 were bariatric surgery candidates (control group) and 31 had already undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (case group). After completing a questionnaire, all patients underwent an oral clinical examination. Halitosis was measured using an organoleptic scale and a portable sulfide monitor.

Results

The Spearman correlation demonstrated a strong positive relation between the organoleptic rates and the concentration of volatile sulfur compounds determined using the sulfide monitor (rs = .58; P = 0.0001). No difference was found in the prevalence of halitosis between the 2 groups (P = 0.48). Only the salivary flow rate was significantly reduced in the control group compared with the case group (P = 0.02). In the case group, the concentration of volatile sulfur compounds correlated negatively with the salivary flow rate (P = 0.04) and positively with the tongue coating index (P = 0.005). The tongue coating index was significantly increased in those patients who did not brush the tongue (P < .04) and who had had episodes of vomiting (P = 0.02).

Conclusion

These data suggest that no significant association exists between halitosis and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. However, they do highlight the possible effect of this surgery on the oral cavity.

### Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline on the management of bile acid diarrhea [^f4286f10]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Chronic diarrhea affects about 5% of the population overall. Altered bile acid metabolism is a common but frequently undiagnosed cause.

Methods

We performed a systematic search of publication databases for studies of assessment and management of bile acid diarrhea (BAD). The certainty (quality) of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Patient population, intervention, comparator, and outcome questions were developed through an iterative process and were voted on by a group of specialists.

Results

The certainty of evidence was generally rated as very low. Therefore, 16 of 17 recommendations are conditional. In patients with chronic diarrhea, consideration of risk factors (terminal ileal resection, cholecystectomy, or abdominal radiotherapy), but not additional symptoms, was recommended for identification of patients with possible BAD. The group suggested testing using 75 selenium homocholic acid taurine (where available) or 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, including patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, functional diarrhea, and Crohn's disease without inflammation. Testing was suggested over empiric bile acid sequestrant therapy (BAST). Once remediable causes are managed, the group suggested cholestyramine as initial therapy, with alternate BAST when tolerability is an issue. The group suggested against BAST for patients with extensive ileal Crohn's disease or resection and suggested alternative antidiarrheal agents if BAST is not tolerated. Maintenance BAST should be given at the lowest effective dose, with a trial of intermittent, on-demand administration, concurrent medication review, and reinvestigation for patients whose symptoms persist despite BAST.

Conclusions

Based on a systematic review, BAD should be considered for patients with chronic diarrhea. For patients with positive results from tests for BAD, a trial of BAST, initially with cholestyramine, is suggested.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert review [^6aa481c1]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Functional mechanisms beyond active inflammation — evidence "suggest a role for mechanisms not directly attributable to gut inflammation such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), bile acid diarrhea (BAD), bowel damage from chronic inflammation, functional changes in motility or absorptive capacity; abnormalities in the enteric nervous system, presence of intestinal dysbiosis, or increased intestinal permeability".

### High prevalence of primary bile acid diarrhoea in patients with functional diarrhoea and irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhoea, based on Rome III and Rome IV criteria [^e641be4a]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Our study strongly supports recent international guidelines from the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States that are promoting increased awareness of primary BAD. The potential scale of this disorder may be estimated from a large survey across these 3 countries which has shown that approximately 5% (i.e. 1-in-20) of adults within the general population fulfil symptom criteria for either Rome IV functional diarrhoea or IBS-diarrhoea. Unfortunately, the high gastrointestinal illness burden and associated poor quality of life reported by such individuals is despite many having previously sought healthcare for their symptoms. A recently published worldwide study, performed across 30 countries and six continents, has yielded similar results. However, it could be argued that over of third of these individuals may have primary BAD instead, which would imply that an estimated 1.5% of the general population are suffering from the condition. Hence, testing for primary BAD is important given that it is common, frequently overlooked, and detrimentally impacts on physical and mental well-being, with open-label treatment leading to improved patient-related outcomes and a reduction in the number of subsequent diagnostic investigations. Unfortunately, testing modalities for primary BAD are not readily available across the globe. Currently, the 75 SeHCAT test is available in the United Kingdom, certain European countries, and Canada, but not in the United States where some centres test for BAD via alternate means, for example, serum bile acid precursors (i.e. 7a‑hydroxy‑4-cholesten-3-one) or measurement of faecal bile acids following a 48-hour stool collection. There have been recent advances in developing a simple, cheap, and readily available biomarker to screen for BAD, with promising data for serum FGF19 or detection of volatile organic compounds (presumed to be due to dysbiosis of colonic bile acids), however all require further validation.

### Recycling rate of bile acids in the enterohepatic recirculation as a major determinant of whole body 75SeHCAT retention [^99f184e3]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Measurement of the whole body retention of orally administered (75)SeHCAT is used to investigate patients with unexplained diarrhoea. Retention values of < 15% at 7 days post-administration are taken to indicate bile acid malabsorption (BAM). Whilst idiopathic BAM is frequently diagnosed with (75)SeHCAT, functional and morphological studies of the terminal ileum rarely show any abnormality, so the disorder may be more appropriately termed bile acid diarrhoea (BAD). In addition to malabsorption, excess bile acid may reach the colon, where the events leading to diarrhoea take place, as a result firstly of increased bile acid synthesis and secondly of an increased recycling rate of bile acids. Increased recycling has been largely ignored as a cause of BAD, but, as shown in this study, can readily result in excess bile acids reaching the colon even when ileal absorption efficiency is normal (i.e. 95–97%). There needs to be a re-evaluation of the causes of BAD in patients without a history of previous intestinal resection or evidence of ileal pathology, such as Crohn's disease.

### Bile acid diarrhoea: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^343e3c41]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The actual incidence of bile acid diarrhoea (BAD) is unknown, however, there is increasing evidence that it is misdiagnosed in up to 30% with diarrhoea-predominant patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Besides this, it may also occur following cholecystectomy, infectious diarrhoea and pelvic chemoradiotherapy.

BAD may result from either hepatic overproduction of bile acids or their malabsorption in the terminal ileum. It can result in symptoms such as bowel frequency, urgency, nocturnal defecation, excessive flatulence, abdominal pain and incontinence of stool. Bile acid synthesis is regulated by negative feedback loops related to the enterohepatic circulation, which are dependent on the farnesoid X receptor and fibroblast growth factor 19. Interruption of these feedback loops is thought to cause bile acid overproduction leading to BAD. This process may occur idiopathically or following a specific trigger such as cholecystectomy. There may also be an interplay with the gut microbiota, which has been reported to be significantly different in patients with severe BAD.

Patients with suspected BAD are investigated in various ways including radionucleotide imaging such as SeHCAT scans (though this is not available worldwide) and blood tests. However, other methods such as bile acid measurement in stool (either spot test or 48 hours samples) and urine tests have been explored. Importantly, delay in diagnosis and treatment of BAD greatly affects patient's quality of life and may double the overall cost of diagnosis.

### Bile acid diarrhoea: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^18da6909]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bile acid diarrhoea (BAD), sometimes also known as bile acid malabsorption or bile salt malabsorption (though this is not always the correct terminology), can result in symptoms such as bowel frequency, urgency, nocturnal defecation, excessive flatulence, abdominal pain and incontinence of stool. This phenomenon was first described in 1967 and was initially known as choleric enteropathy. It has since been classified primary BAD which is idiopathic and is usually secondary to hepatic overproduction of bile acids due to interruption of the negative feedback loop rather than malabsorption in the ileum. Secondary BAD is secondary to a terminal ileum resection or occurs in conditions such as Crohn's disease or postradiation where the terminal ileum reabsorbs bile acids as part of the enterohepatic circulation, thus being a true malabsorption syndrome.

Emerging evidence over the last decade has shown that BAD is not as uncommon as previously perceived. Up to 30% of patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have evidence of BAD as determined by 75 SeHCAT testing. Compared with controls, patients with IBS had lower 75 SeHCAT values and higher C4 levels but similar fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF-19) levels and more than 50% responded to bile acid sequestrant (colestipol). In addition to patients with ileal disease (eg, Crohn's disease and right hemicolectomy where the terminal ileum is resected or HIV causing enteropathy), BAD has also been reported in those following cholecystectomy, and those with postinfectious diarrhoea, as well as patients having metforminand those with pancreatic insufficiency(table 1). For those not responding to treatment, other additional causes should be sought, for example, bacterial overgrowth, pancreatic insufficiency or microscopic colitis, even if 75 SeHCAT testing has been abnormal. Another under recognised group are those with cancer especially those receiving pelvic chemoradiotherapy as > 50% have BAD.

Table 1
Causes of bile acid diarrhoea

Bile acids are vital in the digestion and absorption of fat. They are synthesised from cholesterol in the liver and excreted in bile as primary bile acids (PBA) (cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids). Dehydroxylation then occurs to form lithocolic and deoxycholic acid and these are reabsorbed via the enterohepatic circulation. There is a negative feedback process regulating this, working through the nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and FGF19. Disruption of this process results in excessive bile acid loss to the colon which, among other factors are contributory to symptoms of diarrhoea.

### Endocarditis after use of tongue scraper [^a2f2d027]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Tongue scraping is advocated as a therapy for managing halitosis and as a technique for preventing dental caries by reducing bacterial counts in the mouth. The practice has been in existence for centuries. A Cochrane review has concluded that tongue cleaning is marginally and temporarily more effective than use of a toothbrush in reducing a measurable marker for halitosis, exhaled volatile sulfur compounds. The use of tongue scrapers may not be limited to those with clinical halitosis, as 10%–30% of Americans report bad breath, and websites offer to solve the problem of "your bad breath" for a price. We report the case of a woman in whom infective endocarditis followed the use of a tongue scraper.

A 59-year-old woman with a known history of mitral valve prolapse with associated valvular regurgitation had onset of progressive malaise, fever, sweats, myalgia, and headache; the symptoms lasted 10 days. Two months previously she had begun cleaning her tongue with a plastic tongue scraper purchased at her local pharmacy. She had not undergone recent dental work. Her medical background included migraines, hypertension, mild quiescent psoriasis, and previous depression. Her medications were venlafaxine and candesartan.

### Ileal biofilms confirm SIBO-IBS hypothesis: comment on PMID 38798120 [^fc493e99]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

We share some concerns by Dr. Kashyap et al. on the rampant use of the lactulose hydrogen breath test (LHBT) for the diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). However, the SIBO–IBS hypothesis should not be completely dismissed as a potential pathomechanism in a subset of patients with disorders of gut–brain interaction.

We previously reported mucosal biofilms in the terminal ileum and colon in two‐thirds of IBS patients. Such biofilms represent an overgrowth of bacteria invading the mucus layer. We validated increased bacterial concentrations by molecular (qPCR), histologic (DAPI, FISH), and electron microscopic analysis. As per definition, biofilms in the terminal ileum represent a type of SIBO, which we like to term lower SIBO (in contrast to upper SIBO with bacterial overgrowth in the duodenum and proximal jejunum). Direct visualization of lower SIBO by endoscopy and histology is far less disputable than any measurement of breath test or radionucleotide transit time. The terminal ileum is a key metabolic hub involved in regulating bile acid homeostasis. Indeed, the increase of microbial biomass was associated with altered microbial bile acid metabolism and malabsorption, which could explain common IBS symptoms such as diarrhea and pain. A biofilm protects persister cells from antibiotics, explaining the temporary, non‐sustained clinical response commonly followed by repeated antibiotic cycles in IBS. These biofilms also consist of polymicrobial communities, including archaea and fungi, representing a microbial strategy to better withstand the harsh environment of the small intestine.

More recently, we found ileal biofilms in 24 out of 40 IBS‐D or IBS‐M patients (60%). LHBT was positive in 95% of biofilm‐positive patients vs. 54% of biofilm‐negative patients (Table 1, p < 0.01 Fisher's exact test). In contrast, one out of 24 biofilm‐positive patients was positive in the glucose hydrogen breath test (GHBT). Thus, lower SIBO (i.e. the presence of ileal biofilms) is highly prevalent in IBS‐D and IBS‐M, associated with positive LHBT (but not GHBT), in agreement with the SIBO‐IBS hypothesis. GHBT could not identify patients with lower SIBO.

### Oral manifestations in the post COVID-19 condition: a Systematic review with meta-analysis [^d4383afd]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency caused by Coronavirus disease (COVID‐19). Transmission of the disease has been found to occur from person to person, by respiratory tract droplets or contact. Individuals may have symptoms such as fever, cough, and fatigue. The acute condition of COVID‐19 shows remission from 2 to 6 weeks. Between 10% and 20% of patients report long‐term manifestations of persistent symptoms, or new symptoms and diseases. This condition is defined by WHO as a post‐COVID‐19 condition and occurs in individuals with a history of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, usually beginning 3 months after acute COVID‐19.

Although immunisation has drastically impacted the reduction of cases and deaths from acute COVID‐19, post‐COVID‐19 conditions are being described frequently. There are reports of symptoms different from those that occurred in the acute phase. The most cited symptoms are fatigue, difficulty breathing, decreased memory and concentration, and loss of taste and smell. Despite the growing volume of research on post‐COVID‐19 conditions, studies addressing oral manifestations are still scarce, especially regarding symptoms other than loss of smell and taste. In fact, oral symptoms are not frequently described in clinical studies on COVID‐19, and among the few existing studies, taste alterations are the most commonly reported oral manifestation.

Oral manifestations will continue to affect individuals with post‐COVID conditions, just like other persistent symptoms. It is essential to deepen our understanding of its symptoms and prevalence while ensuring that oral healthcare professionals are aware of its existence to enhance their clinical practice.

To summarise the main current scientific evidence to support clinical dental surgeons and researchers, this study aimed to investigate what are the oral manifestations of the post‐COVID‐19 condition and the frequency that they present.

### Halitosis [^bacafa58]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Halitosis can be caused by oral disease, or by respiratory tract conditions such as sinusitis, tonsillitis, and bronchiectasis, but an estimated 40% of affected individuals have no underlying organic disease.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with physiological halitosis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to July 2008 (BMJ Clinical evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found five systematic reviews, RCTs or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: artificial saliva; cleaning, brushing or scraping the tongue; diet modification; regular or single use of mouthwash; sugar-free chewing gums; and zinc toothpastes.

Treatment of underlying cause — The management of oral problems should primarily involve treatment of the underlying cause (with appropriate symptom control) (Category of guideline – suggestion; Level of evidence — V). Many oral problems have potentially treatable underlying causes. For example, halitosis may be the result of periodontal disease, and non-specific measures to manage halitosis may not resolve this problem. Additionally, uncontrolled periodontal disease may progress to cause important complications such as local infection (abscess), systemic infection (pneumonia), and/or loss of dentition.

### MASCC / ISOO expert opinion on the management of oral problems in patients with advanced cancer [^1b4e384c]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). High credibility.

Halitosis — terminology and aetiology — patients with genuine halitosis can be subclassified into physiological halitosis (no evidence of underlying condition) and pathological halitosis (evidence of underlying condition). Physiological halitosis is the most common type caused by bacterial putrefaction of intraoral substrates and poor/limited oral hygiene, while pathological halitosis may be due to infection, inflammation or malignancy. In ~90% such cases, the source of the malodour is the oral cavity, with other potential sources including the upper respiratory tract (nose, sinuses), the lower respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract or a systemic metabolic problem.

### Postinfectious cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^914b0444]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who complain of a persistent cough lasting > 3 weeks after experiencing the acute symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection may have a postinfectious cough. Such patients are considered to have a subacute cough because the condition lasts for no > 8 weeks. The chest radiograph findings are normal, thus ruling out pneumonia, and the cough eventually resolves, usually on its own. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of postinfectious cough, including the most virulent form caused by Bordetella pertussis infection, and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice.

Methods

Recommendations for this section of the guideline were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms "cough", "postinfectious cough", "postviral cough", "Bordetella pertussis", "pertussis infection", and "whooping cough".

Results

The pathogenesis of the postinfectious cough is not known, but it is thought to be due to the extensive inflammation and disruption of upper and/or lower airway epithelial integrity. When postinfectious cough emanates from the lower airway, this is often associated with the accumulation of an excessive amount of mucus hypersecretion and/or transient airway and cough receptor hyperresponsiveness; all may contribute to the subacute cough. In these patients, the optimal treatment is not known. Except for bacterial sinusitis or early on in a B pertussis infection, therapy with antibiotics has no role, as the cause is not bacterial infection. The use of inhaled ipratropium may be helpful. Other causes of postinfectious cough are persistent inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses, which leads to an upper airway cough syndrome (previously referred to as postnasal drip syndrome), and gastroesophageal reflux disease, which may be a complication of the vigorous coughing. One type of postinfectious cough that is particularly virulent is that caused by B pertussis infection. When the cough is accompanied by paroxysms of coughing, posttussive vomiting, and/or an inspiratory whooping sound, the diagnosis of a B pertussis infection should be made unless another diagnosis is proven. This infection is highly contagious but responds to antibiotic coverage with an oral macrolide when administered early in the course of the disease. A safe and effective vaccine to prevent B pertussis is now available for adults as well as children. It is recommended according to CDC guidelines.

Conclusions

In patients who have a cough lasting from 3 to 8 weeks with normal chest radiograph findings, consider the diagnosis of postinfectious cough. In most patients, a specific etiologic agent will not be identified, and empiric therapy may be helpful. A high degree of suspicion for cough due to B pertussis infection will lead to earlier diagnosis, patient isolation, and antibiotic treatment.

### Bile acid diarrhoea and FGF19: new views on diagnosis, pathogenesis and therapy [^b91a66b9]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic diarrhoea induced by bile acids is common and the underlying mechanisms are linked to homeostatic regulation of hepatic bile acid synthesis by fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19). Increasing evidence, including that from several large case series using SeHCAT (selenium homocholic acid taurine) tests for diagnosis, indicates that bile acid diarrhoea (BAD) accounts for a sizeable proportion of patients who would otherwise be diagnosed with IBS. Studies of other approaches for diagnosis of BAD have shown increased bile acid synthesis, increased faecal levels of primary bile acids, dysbiosis and different urinary volatile organic compounds when compared with healthy controls or with other diseases. The role of the ileal hormone FGF19 in BAD has been strengthened: a prospective clinical study has confirmed low FGF19 levels in BAD, and so a test to measure these levels could be developed for diagnosis. In animal models, FGF19 depletion by antibodies produces severe diarrhoea. Bile acids affect colonic function through farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and TGR5 receptors. As well as these effects in the colon, FXR-dependent stimulation of ileal FGF19 production could be a logical mechanism to provide therapeutic benefit in BAD. Further studies of FGF19 in humans hold promise in providing novel treatments for this cause of chronic diarrhoea.

### HALITOSIS… [^359606d4]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Interest in halitosis, or abnormally foul breath, has to a large extent been preempted by the oral surgeon and the rhinologist; from the references in the general literature one would surmise that it is a rare disease instead of a common condition, so little interest in the subject having been shown in the past. Every writer on the topic has emphasized the mouth, the teeth and the pharynx as sources of bad odors on the breath, attributing the fetor to decaying teeth, pyorrheal abscesses and necrotic pathologic processes in the pharynx, such as breaking-down tumors and gummas. Obviously, with the present national campaign of education and the much improved care of the teeth and the gums in children and in adults, the mouth has receded in importance as a source of bad breath; such conditions as necrotic growths are unusual and of academic interest only and play a small part.

### High prevalence of primary bile acid diarrhoea in patients with functional diarrhoea and irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhoea, based on Rome III and Rome IV criteria [^02e3651b]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

This study builds on the existing literature, whereby a systematic review found that in excess of a quarter of patients with symptoms compatible with IBS-diarrhoea have primary BAD. However, these findings were based on historic Rome I-III criteria and extrapolating to Rome IV required clarification given that the latter criteria for IBS has undergone substantial modifications and is characterised by frequent abdominal pain. The association between primary BAD and abdominal pain has previously been conflicting, thereby potentially leaving physicians in uncertainty as to the role of primary BAD in those with Rome IV IBS-diarrhoea. By undertaking a large observational study we have shown that over a third of patients with symptoms compatible with either functional diarrhoea or IBS-diarrhoea have primary BAD, a finding seen across both the Rome III and Rome IV criteria. Moreover, almost half of cases with primary BAD were categorised as being moderate to severe. In summary, these findings confirm that primary BAD is common, and generic testing for its possibility should be considered in patients presenting to secondary care settings with chronic diarrhoea of presumed functional origin regardless of whether or not they have abdominal pain.

Health effects of e-cigarette aerosol — The aerosol generated by e-cigarettes is inhaled and then exhaled by the user, can be discharged into the surrounding environment, and deposited on surfaces, exposing bystanders to secondhand and thirdhand aerosol similar to cigarette smoke. Known harmful toxicants and carcinogens have been found in e-cigarette emissions, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nicotine, volatile organic compounds, and fine and ultrafine particles. Metal and silica particles, some at higher levels than in conventional cigarettes, have been detected in e-cigarette aerosol from degradation of the metal coil used to heat the solution. There are limited data on human health effects, but studies suggest adolescent e-cigarette users are at increased risk of cough, wheeze, and asthma exacerbations.

### Bile acid diarrhea in patients with chronic diarrhea. current appraisal and recommendations for clinical practice [^90a5468a]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Bile Acid Diarrhea (BAD) is a common cause of chronic diarrhea, often accompanied by urgency, occasional fecal incontinence, abdominal pain, and fatigue. A nationwide survey has shown limited awareness of BAD within the Italian medical community, prompting a panel of experts to develop a Position Paper that outlines the most practical and cost-saving diagnostic investigations and treatments for this frequently overlooked condition. The document provides an overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and classification of the different types of Bile Acid Diarrhea (BAD). A key focus is the diagnostic approach to identifying and managing the many undiagnosed BAD patients in both primary care and specialized medical settings. Finally, the paper addresses the optimal therapeutic strategies for BAD, including traditional bile acid sequestrants and newer, promising treatments.

### Diagnosis and management of patients with reflux symptoms refractory to proton pump inhibitors [^5ab2084c]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

Approximately a third of patients with suspected gastro-oesophageal reflux disease are resistant or partial responders to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Many of these patients do not have gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, but suffer from functional heartburn or dyspepsia. The potential mechanisms underlying failure of PPI treatment in patients with reflux-related symptoms include persistence of isolated or mixed acid, weakly acidic, bile or gas reflux, impaired oesophageal mucosal integrity, chemical or mechanical hypersensitivity to refluxates and psychological comorbidity. After thorough clinical evaluation and failure of empirical changes in PPI dose regime, diagnostic investigations include endoscopy and reflux monitoring with pH or pH-impedance monitoring. If symptoms are clearly related to persistent reflux, baclofen, antireflux surgery or pain modulators can be considered. If not, pain modulators are the only currently available therapy.

Halitosis

Terminology

Patients with genuine halitosis (i.e. objective evidence of malodour) can be subclassified into those with physiological halitosis (i.e. no evidence of underlying condition) and pathological halitosis (i.e. evidence of underlying condition).

Aetiology

Physiological halitosis is the most common type: the cause of physiological halitosis is the bacterial putrefaction of food debris, epithelial cells, blood cells and saliva within the oral cavity (and particularly on the posterior part of the dorsum of the tongue) and poor/limited oral hygiene. The cause of pathological halitosis may be an infection, inflammation or malignancy. In ~ 90% such cases, the source of the malodour is the oral cavity, but other potential sources include the upper respiratory tract (nose, sinuses), the lower respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract or a systemic metabolic problem.

Management

Management depends on the type of halitosis: in patients with physiological halitosis, it primarily involves oral hygiene measures, whilst in patients with pathological halitosis, it primarily involves treatment of the underlying cause (if possible), e.g. antibiotics for infections (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V).

The management of physiological halitosis includes (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V) (a) generic oral hygiene measures (see above); (b) avoidance of odorous foodstuffs (e.g. garlic, onions); (c) alcohol cessation; (d) smoking cessation; (e) measures to reduce bacterial numbers (e.g. tongue cleaning, chlorhexidine — mouthwash); (f) measures to reduce bacterial substrate (e.g. tongue cleaning, "professional" dental/periodontal cleaning) and (g) measures to convert offensive volatile sulphur compounds to inoffensive non-volatile compounds (e.g. zinc salts — toothpaste, mouthwash; sodium bicarbonate/baking soda – toothpaste). Many oral care products are available to manage halitosis, and those with specific properties (see above) should be prescribed in preference to those with simply "masking"/cosmetic properties (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V). It should be noted that the evidence on managing halitosis in general is of limited quality.

### The challenge of objective confirmation of asthma diagnosis in primary care [^814da295]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Case Presentation

A 48-year-old woman with no smoking history reported cough and feeling short of breath with exertion beginning several months before her clinic visit. It was not clear whether she experienced any episodes of wheezing or chest tightness in association with her shortness of breath. She also reported longstanding nasal congestion and throat irritation, which are symptoms consistent with postnasal drip syndrome. She did not complain of chest pain or respiratory symptoms associated with nocturnal or early-morning awakening.

Her past medical history included eczema and a single episode of generalised hives. She reported sensitivities to trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole as well as to metronidazole. Skin prick testing revealed positive responses to house dust mites. There was no family history of atopy or asthma. She did not report a history of cardiovascular illness. On physical examination, the blood pressure was 130/90 bilaterally, heart rate was 76 beats/min and regular, with a respiratory rate of 10 breaths/min. Her body mass index was 32 kg/m 2. Air entry was equal bilaterally with no audible wheeze. There was mild nasal mucosal oedema and erythema without evidence of nasal polyps. Simple spirometry was carried out in the clinic for further assessment according to the American Thoracic Society Criteria. A chest X-ray and 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained at the initial visit were both normal.

### Oral manifestations in the post COVID-19 condition: a Systematic review with meta-analysis [^d3eb98e8]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

In contrast, in the combined analysis of taste and smell alterations, none of the tested moderators successfully explained the heterogeneity, leaving most of the variability unaccounted for. This suggests that unmeasured factors — such as methodological differences, variations in diagnostic criteria, population characteristics, and geographic factors — may be influencing the results. As with isolated taste alterations, symptom prevalence tended to decline over time, which may reflect natural recovery, differences in follow‐up duration, or attrition bias. The persistent unexplained heterogeneity in the combined analysis highlights the complexity of synthesising prevalence data from diverse study designs and populations (Supporting Information S4).

Regarding the inclusion criteria, the decision to include only studies with participants who tested positive for COVID‐19 stems from the need to confirm COVID‐19 during the acute phase to establish a causal link with the post‐COVID‐19 condition (chronic manifestations). Excluding cases not confirmed through clinical‐epidemiological criteria increases the specificity of the COVID‐19 surveillance system, allowing stronger attribution of oral health findings to the initial COVID‐19 infection. Nonetheless, this does not prevent clinicians from using the results of this systematic review to assess individuals with suspected post‐COVID‐19 condition, even in the absence of prior confirmatory testing.

Key question 3 — associated harms of environmental ("secondhand") e‑cigarette vapor — systematic evidence indicates potential bystander risk that is likely lower than conventional cigarettes, with a recent review including 16 heterogeneous studies concluding that environmental e‑cigarette aerosol may pose a health hazard to bystanders although the risk is likely to be less than the harm posed by conventional cigarettes, and noting concerns that studies with potential conflicts concluded non‑harm while those without conflicts concluded potential harm. Another systematic review of aerosols emitted by human vaping identified eight studies, all published in 2013 or 2014, most of which took place in highly controlled enclosed settings, and concluded that a variety of potentially toxic compounds are increased in e‑cigarette emissions (organic volatile compounds, nicotine, and metals) although at lower levels than with combustible cigarettes. One randomized controlled trial found that passive inhalation of either ENDS or combustible cigarettes increased smokers' urge to smoke a combustible cigarette.

### High prevalence of primary bile acid diarrhoea in patients with functional diarrhoea and irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhoea, based on Rome III and Rome IV criteria [^d1554615]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

A systematic review and meta-analysis has shown that between a quarter to a third of cases with chronic diarrhoea of presumed functional origin - i.e. diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-diarrhoea) or functional diarrhoea - actually have primary BAD. As such, recent guidelines from the United Kingdom, Canada, and United States recommend testing (where possible) for primary BAD in patients with suspected IBS-diarrhoea or functional diarrhoea. However, this guidance is based upon data derived using the historic Rome I-III criteria for IBS-diarrhoea and functional diarrhoea which, following the recent publication of the Rome IV criteria in 2016, have undergone substantial modifications. Whilst the previous Rome III criteria were relatively lax and defined the symptoms of IBS as abdominal pain or discomfort at least 2–3 days a month associated with altered bowel habit, the Rome IV criteria for IBS are far more stringent in that discomfort is no longer a recognised term whilst abdominal pain frequency has increased to at least one day per week. Consequently, a proportion of patients previously fulfilling criteria for IBS-diarrhoea under the Rome III criteria will no longer satisfy criteria for IBS-diarrhoea under the Rome IV criteria, and instead be allocated a diagnosis of functional diarrhoea.

Following this update in criteria, it may be envisaged that the prevalence of primary BAD will still remain high for patients with Rome IV functional diarrhoea. However, whether primary BAD can present as a painful disorder and thus mimic Rome IV IBS-diarrhoea is less clear. By means of its nomenclature, some physicians may merely view primary BAD as a relatively painless diarrhoeal disorder, a concept that would be supported by data showing primary BAD to be associated with rectal hyposensitivity and without any association for abdominal pain. In contrast, a few small studies have demonstrated colonic bile acids to correlate positively with visceral hypersensitivity and abdominal pain intensity. In view of this discrepant data, large studies to confirm a possible association between primary BAD and abdominal pain are needed, with the Rome IV criteria for IBS-diarrhoea and functional diarrhoea providing an opportunity to study this from a clinically meaningful perspective.

Hence, our primary aim was to determine whether the high prevalence of primary BAD reported for Rome III defined IBS-diarrhoea and functional diarrhoea is still applicable using the contemporaneous Rome IV criteria. Secondary outcomes were to identify any clinical characteristics that may be predictive of primary BAD.

### MASCC / ISOO expert opinion on the management of oral problems in patients with advanced cancer [^f8422566]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). High credibility.

Halitosis — management — management depends on the type of halitosis: in patients with physiological halitosis, it primarily involves oral hygiene measures, whilst in patients with pathological halitosis, it primarily involves treatment of the underlying cause (if possible), e.g. antibiotics for infections (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V). For physiological halitosis, measures include generic oral hygiene, avoidance of odorous foodstuffs, alcohol cessation, smoking cessation, measures to reduce bacterial numbers (e.g. tongue cleaning, chlorhexidine — mouthwash), measures to reduce bacterial substrate (e.g. tongue cleaning, "professional" dental/periodontal cleaning) and measures to convert offensive volatile sulphur compounds to inoffensive non-volatile compounds (e.g. zinc salts — toothpaste, mouthwash; sodium bicarbonate/baking soda — toothpaste) (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V). Many oral care products are available to manage halitosis, and those with specific properties should be prescribed in preference to those with simply "masking"/"cosmetic" properties (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V). It should be noted that the evidence on managing halitosis in general is limited and of low quality.

Rhinorrhea/sniffing in AR is described as very common with clear watery discharge, whereas NAR is common but less than AR overall; in acute infection it is common and may be clear to purulent and watery to mucoid with crusts; and in CRS (with or without nasal polyps) it is common and clear to mucoid. Ocular pruritus/watery discharge/red eyes is very common in AR but uncommon in NAR and acute infection and very uncommon in CRS. Nasal congestion or blocked nose/mouth breathing is very common and persistent in AR and very common, chronic, almost universal in CRS with nasal polyps. Facial or sinus pain/pressure is very uncommon in AR yet common in acute infection and in CRS without nasal polyps. Postnasal drip is uncommon and persistent in AR but very common in NAR and common in acute infection and CRS without nasal polyps. Nasal/palate/ear itching is common in AR and very uncommon in NAR, acute infection, and CRS with or without nasal polyps. Snoring is uncommon and persistent in AR but common in the other listed conditions, and sleep disturbance/sleep apnea is common across all listed conditions. Frequencies are based on expert evidence and opinion and the table was developed based predominantly on expert opinion.

### Definitions and guidelines for research on antibiotic persistence [^835849c2]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2019). High credibility.

Increasing concerns about the rising rates of antibiotic therapy failure and advances in single-cell analyses have inspired a surge of research into antibiotic persistence. Bacterial persister cells represent a subpopulation of cells that can survive intensive antibiotic treatment without being resistant. Several approaches have emerged to define and measure persistence, and it is now time to agree on the basic definition of persistence and its relation to the other mechanisms by which bacteria survive exposure to bactericidal antibiotic treatments, such as antibiotic resistance, heteroresistance or tolerance. In this Consensus Statement, we provide definitions of persistence phenomena, distinguish between triggered and spontaneous persistence and provide a guide to measuring persistence. Antibiotic persistence is not only an interesting example of non-genetic single-cell heterogeneity, it may also have a role in the failure of antibiotic treatments. Therefore, it is our hope that the guidelines outlined in this article will pave the way for better characterization of antibiotic persistence and for understanding its relevance to clinical outcomes.

### Bile acid diarrhoea: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^ff212a21]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Gut microbiome

Gut microbiota affect bile acids by causing deconjugation, dehydrogenation and dihydroxylation of PBA in the distal small intestine and colon. This process causes a change in the bile acid pool composition therefore activating FXR and thus inhibiting bile acid synthesis. However, it is not known whether a change in the gut microbiota has any effect on symptoms of diarrhoea. The amount of secondary bile acids (mainly DCA) in the bile acid pool depends on the rate of formation and absorption via the colon, the colonic transit time and colonic pH. There has been a correlation between high DCA levels and gallstones.

Gut microbiome is involved in the digestion of complex carbohydrates to form short chain fatty acids (SCFA), such as acetate, butyrate and proprionate. As both the levels of faecal bile acids in the colon and levels of SCFA are dependent on gut microbiota, any changes in faecal bile acids may affect SCFA and in turn effect the presence of diarrhoea. Patients with BAD also have a higher proportion of primary faecal bile acids, potentially due to decreased Bifidobacteria and Leptum species as well as an increased Escherichia coli in their gut microbiota. This may change the affinity of BAs to FXR and TGR5, thus leading to decreased FXR activation and to increased delivery of bile acids to the colon. Wang et al, have shown an increase in Bifidobacteria abundence with concurrent decrease in secondary faecal bile acids and resultant increase in acetate and proprionate levels. The relationship between the increase of SCFA with the decrease in total faecal bile acids has not been explored. The gut microbiome is also heavily involved in the lipid metabolism and absorption, and thus, dysbiosis may affect the interplay between lipids and bile acid synthesis.

There have also been studies investigating the differences in faecal microbiota of different gut conditions. The faecal microbiota of patients with severe BAD (< 5%) is significantly different to that of patients with diarrhoea secondary to IBS and that of patients with less severe forms of BAD.

### The effect of oral probiotics on oral hygiene and halitosis in orthodontic patients… [^838e2124]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

The Effect of Oral Probiotics on Oral Hygiene and Halitosis in Orthodontic Patients. ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Brackets, bands, ligatures and wires in patients receiving orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances are areas that trap food and impede oral hygiene. An ecological environment facilitating the growth of microorganisms emerges in the mouth and may cause caries, enamel white spots, gingival inflammation and halitosis. Despite the use of specialized orthodontic brushes, interdental brushes, mouthwashes and topical fluorides, plaque removal remains inadequate in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances. On the other hand, patients undergoing orthodontic treatment with aligners have been found to have better oral hygiene because of less plaque accumulation in their mouth.

Probiotics are defined as non-pathogenic bacteria that can benefit the host's general health when taken in sufficient amounts through nutrition. Nowadays probiotics can be used to enhance oral health as they are found to reduce dental bioﬁlm formation, prevent and decrease halitosis in children, adolescents and adults. To date, there are few randomized controlled trials examining the efﬁcacy of oral probiotics in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances and none reporting the incidence of halitosis and the effect of probiotics in orthodontic patients wearing aligners.

### The origin of halitosis in cystinotic patients due to cysteamine treatment [^f683635a]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cystinosis is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the intralysosomal accumulation of cystine. Cysteamine removes cystine from the lysosome and slows down the progression of the disease. One of its side effects is the induction of halitosis, which can interfere with patients' willingness to comply with cysteamine treatment.

Objective

To identify breath sulphur compounds causing halitosis induced by cysteamine therapy in patients with cystinosis.

Study Design

After the ingestion of 15mg/kg cysteamine whole blood (n = 4), urine (n = 4) and breath (n = 8) volatile sulphur compounds levels were measured every 60min over a 360min period by gas chromatography and the cysteamine plasma concentrations (n = 4) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography.

Results

The expired air of cystinotic patients contained elevated concentrations of methanethiol (MT, median maximum value 0.5 (range 0–11)nmol/L) and, in particular, dimethylsulphide (DMS, median maximum value 15 (range 2–83)nmol/L). DMS concentrations higher than 0.65nmol/L are known to cause halitosis. Maximal plasma values of cysteamine (median 46 (range 30–52)micromol/L) preceded those of MT and DMS, confirming that cysteamine is converted to MT and DMS. Less than 3% of the amount of cysteamine ingested was excreted as MT and DMS via expired air and 0.002% via urine.

Conclusion

Halitosis induced by cysteamine intake is caused by DMS and to a lesser extent by MT, excreted via the expired air. Further studies should focus on the possibilities of reducing the formation of these volatile sulphur compounds or masking their odour, which would improve the rates of compliance with cysteamine treatment.

### Prevalence and clinical features of bile acid diarrhea in patients with chronic diarrhea [^b5558198]. Journal of Digestive Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bile acid diarrhea:

- **Definition**: BAD is a form of chronic diarrhea characterized by impaired reabsorption of bile acids in the small intestine.
- **Pathophysiology**: In BAD, the acids recirculation between the liver and small intestine in the enterohepatic recirculation is disrupted, leading to an overabundance of bile acids in the colon, which can cause water and electrolyte secretion and result in diarrhea.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of BAD is estimated at 28.1% in patients with chronic diarrhea.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for BAD include ileal resection, as well as pathologies affecting the terminal ileum, such as Crohn's disease and radiation enteritis.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with BAD typically present with chronic watery diarrhea. Other symptoms may include urgency, bloating, and abdominal pain. The severity of symptoms can vary, with some patients experiencing mild to moderate diarrhea that responds well to treatment, while others may have more severe diarrhea and steatorrhea, which may not respond to treatment.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of BAD can vary depending on the underlying cause and the effectiveness of treatment. Patients with mild to moderate bile acid malabsorption generally respond very well to treatment with bile acid binders. However, patients with more severe bile acid malabsorption may not benefit from such treatment and may require dietary modifications.

### An unusual cause for halitosis [^3e7b972d]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

This report describes an unusual cause for halitosis and an unusual treatment for the underlying problem. Halitosis is a symptom which can result from a diverse range of underlying pathologies, most frequently those affecting the oral cavity or respiratory tract. Uncommonly, it arises due to pathology within the upper gastrointestinal tract. The case of a patient presenting with severe persistent halitosis attributable to mesh erosion occurring 8years after redo laparoscopic hiatus hernia repair is described. Full external healing of the erosion tract was observed such that no symptomatic oesophageal perforation resulted. Mesh erosion is typically managed with surgical intervention. In this case, the infected mesh was successfully removed endoscopically.

Rationale for best practice statements — history taking for gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in COVID-19. In outpatients with new-onset diarrhea, ascertain information about high-risk contact exposure; obtain a detailed history of symptoms associated with COVID-19, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell; and obtain a thorough history for other GI symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In outpatients with new-onset GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), monitor for symptoms associated with COVID-19, as GI symptoms may precede COVID-related symptoms by a few days, and in a high COVID-19 prevalence setting, COVID-19 testing should be considered. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain a thorough history of GI symptoms (ie, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), including onset, characteristics, duration, and severity.

### Palliative care assessment of dry mouth: what matters most to patients with advanced disease? [^57436c4a]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dry mouth is a highly prevalent and significant symptom for patients with advanced progressive diseases. The estimated prevalence of dry mouth in the general population is between 21 and 27%. In a UK study of 197 terminally ill cancer patients, it was the most prevalent symptom, occurring in 77%. Dry mouth was described as the 'orphan topic in supportive care' in 1997, as, up until this time, the research in dry mouth was largely in healthy patients, those with Sjogren's syndrome, or in those who had received radiotherapy to the head and neck.

One of the first studies on the epidemiology, aetiology and clinical features of dry mouth in advanced cancer patients was published in 2001. In this study, 78% of 120 patients reported dry mouth; it was the fourth most common symptom reported on a Memorial symptom assessment scale (MSAS) and the 3rd most distressing symptom. The majority (75%) of the patients reported by Davies experienced dry mouth either 'frequently' or 'almost constantly', and 86% rated the severity as either 'moderate', 'severe' or 'very severe'.

Saliva has a number of key functions, the most important of which is to lubricate food prior to swallowing. Saliva consists of more than 99% water, and along with secretions containing mucin glycoproteins, it helps to coat, lubricate and protect the hard and soft surfaces of the oral cavity. It contains amylase for digestion of starch and lingual lipase for fat digestion. Saliva has an antibacterial function, containing lysozymes that break down bacterial cell walls. The salivary flow is increased by mastication, and this allows for bolus formation and swallowing. Saliva triggers thirst perception and enhances taste perception. Dry mouth can result in functional difficulties such as difficulty chewing, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and taste disturbance (dysgeusia). Persistent dry mouth also predisposes to oral infections, dental caries and oral candidiasis. Furthermore, patients report dry mouth as a distressing symptom with a significant impact on their quality of life.

### Long-term outcomes in patients diagnosed with bile-acid diarrhoea [^b5ed6e7f]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Bile-acid diarrhoea (BAD) is a recognized cause of chronic diarrhoea; however, its detection remains suboptimal. Currently, there is a paucity of follow-up studies evaluating BAD. This work evaluates the natural history of BAD by examining individuals diagnosed with BAD [7 days of Se-homocholic acid taurine (SeHCAT) retention < 10%] and determining the use of and response to bile-acid sequestrants (BAS).

Materials and Methods

Of the 515 patients, 40% (207/515) who underwent an SeHCAT test at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals (2001–2012) for chronic diarrhoea had BAD. Of the 207 (51%) patients, 107 were diagnosed between 2001 and 2009. In accordance with the guidelines, all of these patients were commenced on BAS. In March 2013, these individuals were reassessed either in the clinic or over the telephone as part of a local service evaluation project. Comparisons were made of both pretreatment and post-treatment variables using a Wilcoxon rank test.

Results

Of the 107 patients, 54% (58/107) were followed up, with a median time since diagnosis of 6 years. Among them, 38% were still using BAS at follow-up, with 28% using alternative antidiarrhoeals. The median stool frequency decreased from seven stools per day to three (P = 0.0008) in those using BAS. The 34% of patients not receiving treatment had no change in their daily bowel frequency. The main reason for discontinuing treatment was poor tolerability of the BAS (colestyramine/colestipol).

Conclusion

Our findings indicate that BAD is a chronic condition that best improves with BAS. Consideration should be given to therapeutic options that have a better tolerability profile.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British society of gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^3b00e6c5]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Only patients who remain undiagnosed after extensive traditional investigation and failed medical therapy should be considered for manometry studies. In the future non-invasive MRI may find a role in the diagnosis of diarrhoeal conditions. Recent studies have shown that this technique can provide comprehensive measurements of both motility and transit and can identify specific abnormalities in patients with diarrhoea-predominant IBS.

Recommendations

If functional bowel disease or IBS-diarrhoea is suspected, we recommend that bile acid diarrhoea should be excluded with either 75 SeHCAT testing or fasting serum C4 (7α hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one) levels. A test and treat approach is recommended as opposed to blind empirical therapy unless no diagnostic test is available (Grade of evidence level 1, Strength of recommendation strong).
Patients with very low 75 SeHCAT values are most likely to have a response to treatment with bile acid sequestrants. We recommend this is tried if the 75 SeHCAT value is < 15% or the fasting serum C4 is raised above defined laboratory values (Grade of evidence level 2, Strength of recommendation strong).
We recommend colonic biopsies to exclude microscopic colitis. These should be at least from the left side (not rectal) and, as microscopic colitis can be patchy, right-side biopsies may improve diagnostic yield (Grade of evidence level 1, Strength of recommendation strong).
Both glucose and lactulose hydrogen breath tests have poor sensitivity and specificity and are not recommended for the diagnosis of small bowel bacterial overgrowth (Grade of evidence level 2, Strength of recommendation strong).
The utility of concurrent hydrogen and methane breath testing with measurements of orocaecal transit time could reduce a false positive diagnosis due to variability in intestinal transit, but has not been subject to definitive clinical study hence cannot be recommended (Grade of evidence level 4, Strength of recommendation strong).
We recommend investigating for intestinal transit with manometry only if there is clinical suspicion and failure to respond to therapy (Grade of evidence level 4, Strength of recommendation strong).

### Halitosis devised questionnaire evaluating a new treatment… [^130b8c54]. ClinicalTrials (2010). Low credibility.

Halitosis Devised Questionnaire Evaluating a New TreatmentClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Halitosis is a common symptom which can affect people of all ages. It may decrease self confidence and social interactions. Oral halitosos is the consequence of microbial breakdown of food debris, cells, saliva, and blood. The agents that give rise to halitosis include especially the volatile sulphur compounds, diamines, and short chain fatty acids of which only the VSC can be detected in the clinical setting, making the detection of halitosis often very hard. The most common cause for oral halitosis is poor oral hygiene due to gingivitis or periodontitis. Other causes include bacterial accumulation on the posterior tongue, tonsillitis and others. Dry mouth has been implicated as a potential cause in halitosis.

Due to the lack of quantitative objective measuring to the severity of halitosis and especially in the face of the subjective nature of halitosis as occurs commonly a subjectively measurement is necessary. As no current QOL exists for measurement of halitosis formulation of such a questionnaire can enable a measurement of subjective halitosis with change observed over time or with intervention. Quality of life questionnaires are common in medicine, however no such questionnaire exists for halitosis. We devised a specific QOL questionnaire for halitosis. This questionnaire consists of 20 questions covering functional limitation, physical discomfort, psychological discomfort, physical disability and social disability. The answers will be based on a common scale of 5 answers depending on the severity and ranging from a never bothering symptom to a symptom which as worse as can be.

Formulation of this a questionnaire can assist in measuring subjective halitosis with change observed over time or with intervention. Treating halitosis is a challenge due to the multitude of factors. However, some treatments, mainly in the form of nasal saline irrigation or oral solutions chlorine based or triclosan exist. Mouth dryness, although implicated as a factor, has not been targeted yet. Improving salivary flow may reduce the stasis of saliva thus reducing the concentration of proteins that bacteria dwell on as well as a better degradation of oral food debris.

### MASCC / ISOO expert opinion on the management of oral problems in patients with advanced cancer [^bb0f85fe]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

All patients need a regular oral hygiene regimen, and dependent patients need appropriate support with oral hygiene (Category of guideline – suggestion; Level of evidence — V)

Good oral hygiene reduces the risk of developing many oral problems in patients with advanced cancer (e.g. halitosis, oral infections). The principles of good oral hygiene are outlined in Box 2. Care must be taken when assisting patients with their oral hygiene, and gloves and a face mask may be indicated when undertaking oral care (infection control measure). The principles of denture care are outlined in Box 3. Patients with significant oral hygiene problems, particularly those with "complex" dental restorations, or significant dental/oral conditions, should be referred to relevant dental professionals for specialist treatment.

Box 2 Daily oral hygiene measures

Box 3 Daily denture hygiene measures

The management of oral problems should primarily involve treatment of the underlying cause (with appropriate symptom control) (Category of guideline – suggestion; Level of evidence — V)

Many oral problems have potentially treatable underlying causes. In such cases, the optimal management is treatment of the underlying cause, although patients may also require symptomatic treatment. If the underlying cause is not treated, it is likely that the oral problem will persist (and even worsen). Moreover, there is an increased risk of developing complications. For example, halitosis may be the result of periodontal disease, and non-specific measures to manage halitosis may not resolve this problem (see below). Additionally, uncontrolled periodontal disease may progress to cause important complications such as local infection (abscess), systemic infection (pneumonia), and/or loss of dentition.

The management of oral problems should be individualised (Category of guideline – suggestion; Level of evidence — V)

As with other problems in this group of patients, the management of oral problems should be individualised. Patients should receive the "optimal" management, which invariably involves treatment of the underlying cause (point 3). However, interventions may need to be amended as a result of the patient's performance status, their co-morbidities and especially their personal preferences. For example, the optimal management of poorly fitting dentures is to replace the relevant denture. However, relining the denture is an alternative strategy and can be performed at the bedside/in the patient's home.

### Definitions and guidelines for research on antibiotic persistence [^c136f21f]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2019). High credibility.

Spontaneous persistence

Persistence may be observed without any trigger and when the culture is in steady-state exponential growth and all parameters are kept constant, that is, during balanced growth (Fig. 3). In this case, persisters may occur spontaneously, and their fraction remains constant as long as the steady-state growth is maintained. Spontaneous persistence was previously called type II persistence. This form of persistence seems to be much less common than triggered persistence.

Effect of mutations

Importantly, apart from the environmental triggers mentioned above, all types of persistence may be increased (or reduced) by mutations. Although within a clonal population, persister and non-persister bacteria are typically isogenic, mutations have been identified that are able to increase the level of persistence or tolerance. For example, one of the first identified high persistence mutations, the hipA7 mutation, increases the level of triggered persistence in Escherichia coli by orders of magnitude, reaching persistence levels of about 20% of the population, whereas it is typically below 0.1% for wild-type strains. A high persistence mutation can be viewed as a tolerance mutation with partial penetrance in the whole population; only the subpopulation of persister bacteria will exhibit a phenotype owing to the mutation and will die slower. A high tolerance mutation reduces the killing rate of the whole population. In other words, 100% persistence is equivalent to tolerance.

We stress the fact that the definition of persistence presented here is not directly linked to a specific mechanism or to a physiological state of the bacteria. Rather, it is defined by the time-kill assay; therefore, we outline below some important considerations for increasing the reproducibility and reliability of persistence detection. Typical microbiology procedures developed for measuring uniform bulk phenomena need to be carefully re-evaluated when measuring survival that is dominated by a small subpopulation of cells.

Although we focus here on antibiotic persistence of bacteria, we believe that the definitions and guidelines should be relevant for heterogeneous responses to other drugs such as antifungalsand anticancer treatments.

Persistent infection versus antibiotic persistence

First, we would like to distinguish 'antibiotic persistence' from 'persistent infection', (Fig. 1). The latter is generally used to describe infections in the host that are not cleared by the host immune system, whereas antibiotic persistence describes a bacterial population that is refractory to antibiotic treatments, whether in vitro or possibly in the host. Persistent infections are typically multifactorial and involve mechanisms evolved by different pathogens to evade the immune system, such as antigenic mimicry in Helicobacter pylori, antigenic variation in Neisseria gonorrhoeae and inhibition of phagocytosisand immune evasion in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. As antibiotic persistence specifically addresses the ability of bacteria to survive antibiotic treatments, it may be an additional factor for the prolongation of persistent infections despite antibiotic treatment, for example, in recurrent urinary tract infections. Moreover, the same mechanisms may be involved in both immune evasion and antibiotic persistence, for example, biofilm formation.

Persistent infections versus antibiotic persistence.

Persistent infection is a general term to describe infections that are not efficiently cleared by the host, in contrast to the characteristic acute response that leads to clearance of many pathogens. Antibiotic persistence specifically describes the heterogeneous response of bacterial populations, in vitro or in the host, that results in a delayed clearance of the bacterial load by antibiotics.

Historically, the term 'persistent infection' was used before antibiotics were available to treat infections. To avoid ambiguity, we suggest using the term antibiotic persistence to distinguish between these phenomena when first mentioned in a publication. The focus in this article is on antibiotic persistence, although for simplicity, tradition and brevity, below, we use the word persistence.

### Should upper gastrointestinal endoscopy be part of the evaluation for supraesophageal symptoms of GERD? [^02b375f0]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

The past decade has witnessed increasing interest in the supraesophageal (ear, nose, and throat (ENT)) symptoms potentially caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Hoarseness, halitosis, problems with vocal presentations, excessive phlegm, frequent throat clearing, globus sensation, sore throat, cough, aspiration, laryngospasm, and laryngeal carcinoma are some, but not all of the ENT symptoms that have been attributed to GERD (1). The availability of highly effective medical and surgical therapies allows for control of these symptoms in many patients adding to the importance of accurately diagnosing GERD.

### Hydrogen sulfide-based therapeutics: exploiting a unique but ubiquitous gasotransmitter [^1a3b1cce]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2015). Medium credibility.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has become recognized as an important signalling molecule throughout the body, contributing to many physiological and pathological processes. In recent years, improved methods for measuring H2S levels and the availability of a wider range of H2S donors and more selective inhibitors of H2S synthesis have helped to more accurately identify the many biological effects of this highly reactive gaseous mediator. Animal studies of several H2S-releasing drugs have demonstrated considerable promise for the safe treatment of a wide range of disorders. Several such drugs are now in clinical trials.
