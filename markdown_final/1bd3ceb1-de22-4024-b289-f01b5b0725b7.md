## Question

What causes false-positive HSV serology results?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes false-positive HSV serology results. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about intrinsic cross-reactivity between HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies. Then, I should review assay design and platform-specific performance. Next, I will examine immunologic interferences and pre-analytical factors. After that, I need to consider population prevalence and predictive value. Finally, I will synthesize a hierarchy of causes and outline practical, guideline-aligned testing recommendations to minimize false positives [^1122UiLa] [^112jtTBc] [^112gFUdE].

> Let me start with the fundamental biology because that often explains a lot of test behavior. HSV-1 and HSV-2 share substantial antigenic homology, and even the nominally type-specific glycoprotein G antigens (gG-1 and gG-2) are only about 40% identical, so cross-reactive binding can occur and drive false positives across types; for example, samples that were HSV-2-only by Western blot had higher false HSV-1 reactivity on automated assays, and vice versa, underscoring bidirectional cross-reactivity as a core cause of false positivity [^112jtTBc] [^1122UiLa].

> Wait, let me verify the role of assay design because not all serologies are created equal. Non–gG-based assays using crude lysates historically show poor type specificity with high false-positive rates, especially calling HSV-2 positive in sera that are HSV-1 positive but HSV-2 negative; this is why best practice is to use gG-based type-specific assays whenever serology is pursued, although even gG-based tests are not perfectly specific due to residual cross-reactivity [^111SeSPb] [^1121gRzg] [^112jtTBc].

> Now, I should examine platform performance because instrument-specific behavior matters in real-world practice. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions, but comparative studies demonstrate that some automated platforms, notably DiaSorin, yield a disproportionate share of false positives and have substantially lower positive predictive value compared with Roche and Bio-Rad, meaning that in average-prevalence populations, nearly one in three DiaSorin HSV-2 positives may be false; this platform effect is a practical, recurrent cause of false positives that clinicians will actually encounter [^1122UiLa] [^112gFUdE] [^116P18ys].

> I need to check the impact of low-positive index values because weak reactivity near the cutoff often flags nonspecific binding. On DiaSorin, more than half of HSV-1 and about one fifth of HSV-2 results with index values less than 3.0 proved false positive on adjudication, and optimizing thresholds improves specificity somewhat but still does not fully align performance with higher-specificity platforms; thus, low-positive results are a common, predictable source of false positives that warrant confirmation [^116P18ys] [^112gFUdE].

> Next, I should review immunologic interferences that can artifactually trigger seroreactivity. Rheumatoid factor can cause false-positive HSV IgM by nonspecific binding and may resolve after RF absorption, reminding me to be cautious with isolated IgM signals; more broadly, polyclonal B-cell activation during other acute infections can create nonspecific antibody noise and cross-reactivity in serologic panels, providing another plausible mechanism for false-positive HSV serology in inflamed states [^116PfKQC] [^115Jx3dX].

> But wait, what if the population being tested has low disease prevalence? I should confirm the Bayes impact because positive predictive value falls as prevalence decreases even when specificity is high. In the United States, with HSV-2 seroprevalence around 12%, PPV for a positive HSV-2 result varies markedly by platform, from about 96% on Roche to roughly 69% on DiaSorin, meaning that many apparent "positives" in low-prevalence or low-risk populations will be false positives purely on statistical grounds [^112gFUdE] [^116P18ys].

> I will now examine pre-analytical and specimen-related contributors. Samples that required adsorption or repeat during initial Western blot processing were later more likely to show discordant automated results, suggesting interfering substances or borderline antibody levels as triggers of false positivity; additionally, certain sample matrices such as undiluted plasma are prone to invalids and interferences on some molecular platforms, underscoring that specimen quality and handling can sway serologic performance and interpretability [^1122UiLa] [^113b3tBH].

> Let me consider host biological variation because not every patient mounts the same epitope-specific response. A subset of truly infected individuals do not generate gG-targeted antibodies or may lose anti-gG reactivity over time; while this primarily causes false negatives, it also sets the stage for apparent type-discordant profiles and can complicate adjudication where one assay appears "falsely positive" against an imperfect reference, reminding me to interpret serology in clinical context and with appropriate confirmatory testing [^116k9P39].

> Hmm, wait a minute, age and demographic factors do not directly cause false positives, but they change pretest probability and, therefore, the PPV of a given assay in a given setting. Seroprevalence for HSV antibodies tends to increase with age and varies by sex and geography, so a result in a high-prevalence subgroup is more likely to be a true positive than the same result in a low-prevalence subgroup, which indirectly influences how often a laboratory positive will be false in practice [^111tQrfX] [^1126GfNY].

> Let me synthesize a hierarchy so I do not miss anything. The leading drivers of false-positive HSV serology are intrinsic cross-reactivity between HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies, assay design limitations with non–gG-based tests, platform-specific lower specificity and low-positive index values yielding spurious positives, immunologic interferences such as rheumatoid factor and polyclonal activation, low prevalence and the resulting PPV penalties in screening contexts, and pre-analytical or specimen factors that introduce noise; host variation in gG responses complicates classification and can make some discordances look like false positivity when the issue is actually sensitivity and epitope targeting [^1122UiLa] [^111SeSPb] [^1121gRzg] [^112gFUdE] [^116PfKQC] [^115Jx3dX].

> Hold on, I should verify that my recommendations align with guidelines and data to reduce harm from false positives. Best practice is a two-step algorithm: screen with a sensitive, type-specific assay and confirm positives, especially low-positive index results, with a more specific method such as Western blot or another orthogonal assay; avoid non–gG-based serology, be cautious interpreting isolated IgM, raise suspicion with low-positive indices on lower-specificity platforms, and consider the patient's pretest probability before ordering tests in the first place given USPSTF's stance against routine screening of asymptomatic individuals [^112jtTBc] [^116P18ys] [^111SeSPb] [^112gFUdE].

> Let me reconsider one point to avoid a common pitfall: it is tempting to think that simply "doing more serology" will clarify an equivocal clinical picture, but for active mucocutaneous disease, lesion PCR is the preferred diagnostic test, and relying on serology can compound false-positive and false-negative interpretation issues; therefore, reserve serology for specific use cases and confirm discordant or low-positive results before labeling a patient with lifelong infection [^116zd5PJ] [^112jtTBc].

False positive HSV serologic results occur due to **cross-reactivity with other herpesviruses** (especially HSV-1/HSV-2) [^1122UiLa] and **nonspecific antibody binding** from autoimmune or polyclonal immune states [^116PfKQC] [^115Jx3dX]. Assay design issues, such as **non-glycoprotein G antigens** [^111SeSPb] or **suboptimal cutoffs** [^112gFUdE], and **technical errors** (sample mix-ups, contamination) also contribute. Low-prevalence settings further reduce **positive predictive value**, increasing **false positives** [^112gFUdE] [^112jtTBc]. To minimize false positives, use glycoprotein G–based assays [^111SeSPb], confirm low-positive or equivocal results with Western blot [^112jtTBc] [^112UiWKn], and interpret results in clinical context [^11569rZ7].

---

## Cross-reactivity with other herpesviruses

HSV-1 and HSV-2 cross-reactivity occurs when antibodies to one type cross-react with antigens of the other, causing **false positives** in **type-specific assays** [^1122UiLa] [^112jtTBc]. Other herpesviruses, such as **CMV** or **EBV**, can also generate antibodies that cross-react with HSV antigens, leading to **false positives**.

---

## Nonspecific antibody binding

Autoimmune conditions — including **rheumatoid factor** and other **autoantibodies** — can bind nonspecifically in HSV assays and cause **false positives** [^116PfKQC], and **Polyclonal immune activation** (e.g. HIV, hepatitis) can produce nonspecific antibodies that cross-react in HSV assays.

---

## Assay design and antigen selection

Non-glycoprotein G assays have high **false-positive rates** due to **poor type specificity** [^111SeSPb] [^1121gRzg], and **Suboptimal cutoff values** can increase **false positives**, especially at low index values [^112gFUdE].

---

## Technical and procedural errors

Sample contamination or mix-ups in the laboratory can cause **false positives**, and **Improper sample handling** — including hemolysis or improper storage — can affect assay performance [^112aQgHy] [^11569rZ7].

---

## Population prevalence and predictive value

Low prevalence settings mean that even high-specificity assays have a lower **positive predictive value**, increasing **false positives** [^112gFUdE] [^112jtTBc].

---

## Strategies to minimize false positives

- **Use glycoprotein G–based assays**. Prefer glycoprotein G–based assays for higher specificity [^111SeSPb].
- **Confirmatory testing**. Confirm low-positive or equivocal results with Western blot or a second specific assay [^112jtTBc] [^112UiWKn].
- **Clinical correlation**. Interpret results with clinical context and risk factors [^11569rZ7].
- **Quality control**. Maintain strict laboratory quality control to prevent technical errors [^112aQgHy].

---

False positive HSV serologic results arise from cross-reactivity, nonspecific binding, assay design, technical errors, and low-prevalence settings. Using glycoprotein G–based assays, confirmatory testing, and clinical correlation **helps reduce false positives** [^112jtTBc].

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^1122UiLa]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

We found that the false positivity rate for HSV-1 or HSV-2 antibodies was higher in samples that were positive for antibodies to the other virus. For HSV-1, 17% (31 of 182) of samples that were seropositive for HSV-2 only by WB tested falsely positive for HSV-1 IgG on at least one automated instrument compared with 7.4% (33 of 444) of samples that were negative for any HSV antibodies by WB (two-sample z test: P -value < 0.001).

There was a similar trend for HSV-2, as 9.7% (17 of 175) of samples that were positive for HSV-1 only by WB tested falsely positive for HSV-2 IgG on at least one automated instrument, while only 5.2% (23 of 443) of samples that were negative for all HSV antibodies by WB tested falsely positive for HSV-2 IgG (two-sample z test: P -value = 0.06).

Notably, 76% of HSV-1 false positive and 74% of HSV-2 false positive test results came from the DiaSorin instrument. For HSV-1, the DiaSorin instrument had fewer false negative results than the other instruments, and there were no samples where it was the only instrument to falsely call a sample negative. However, for HSV-2, the DiaSorin instrument had numerous false negative results, and 43% (25 of 58) of the HSV-2 false negative results were unique to the DiaSorin instrument.

During initial clinical WB testing, 168 of the 979 (17.2%) samples were repeated with a larger sample volume or adsorbed for HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies and re-tested. These samples that required repeating or absorption were significantly more likely to give discordant results on at least one automated assay.

### Common use of inaccurate antibody assays to identify infection status with herpes simplex virus type 2 [^111SeSPb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

In recent proficiency testing of herpes simplex virus type-specific serologic evidence by the College of American Pathologists, commercially available herpes simplex virus antibody assays that were not glycoprotein-G based demonstrated high false-positive rates (14%-88%) for herpes simplex virus type-2 antibodies in sera that were positive for herpes simplex virus type-1 antibodies but negative for herpes simplex virus type-2 antibodies. Herpes simplex virus serologic testing should be performed with only glycoprotein-G-based tests.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^112gFUdE]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Due to the low prevalence of HSV-2, approximately 1 in 26 positive HSV-2 results on the Roche assay are false positives. The likelihood that a positive HSV-2 result is a false positive is even higher for the other assays: approximately 1 in 8 for Bio-Rad and nearly 1 in 3 for DiaSorin. This implies that if a population of 100,000 people were tested for HSV-2 IgG using the Roche, Bio-Rad, and DiaSorin assays, 440, 1,672, and 5,104 individuals, respectively, would receive false positive results.

Since HSV-1 is more prevalent, the positive predictive values are higher for all HSV-1 IgG assays. However, the lower specificities for the HSV-1 IgG assays mean that similar numbers of people (728 for Roche, 1,144 for Bio-Rad, and 5,876 for DiaSorin) would receive false positive HSV-1 IgG results if these assays were used to screen 100,000 people. The low HSV-1 negative predictive values (NPVs) also indicate that thousands of individuals (3,792 for DiaSorin to 9,360 for Roche) would test falsely negative for HSV-1 IgG if the assays were employed for population-based screening.

Using the semi-quantitative data, a different index threshold was considered to maximize each assay's sensitivity and specificity. Based on maximizing the receiver operating characteristic curves, for the DiaSorin assays, increasing the threshold to 1.725 for HSV-1 IgG or 1.135 for HSV-2 IgG would provide the optimal specificity and sensitivity. For both the Bio-Rad and Roche instruments, decreasing the threshold would also contribute to optimizing performance.

### Interference by rheumatoid factor in immunoglobulin M-class herpes simplex virus types 1 + 2 immunoassays [^116PfKQC]. Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 + 2 immunoglobulin (Ig)M antibodies assays are important tools for diagnosing pregnant women and their newborns. However, it is unclear whether high levels of rheumatoid factor (RF) interfere with serological methods used to test for HSV types 1 + 2 type-specific IgM antibodies. We report a case of a false-positive result for HSV 1 + 2 IgM antibodies due to gross overestimation of RF by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This result occurred in a 25-year-old Han Chinese woman who was 28 weeks pregnant with a fetus (sex of fetus unknown).

Antinuclear antibody (ANA) screening was performed, and RF-absorbent material was used. Test results for three antibodies of ANA (SSA, Ro-52, and SSB) were positive; the rest of the results were negative. Additionally, RF levels were significantly higher than normal, as measured by ANA screening. We observed an obvious decrease in HSV 1 + 2 IgM antibodies after the removal of RF. Based on our findings, the presence of high concentrations of RF may be responsible for false-positive HSV 1 + 2 ELISA results.

### High seroprevalence of herpes simplex virus type 2 infection in French human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected outpatients [^114BYacH]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

Using commercially available herpes simplex virus (HSV) type-specific serological diagnostic tests, HSV type 2 (HSV-2) antibody prevalence was assessed in two parallel prospective studies including 534 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected outpatients living in two areas of northern France. In the first cohort of 434 subjects, 223 (51%) individuals demonstrated a positive HSV-2 serological status while 66 (66%) of 100 subjects in the second cohort were seropositive for HSV-2 (51% versus 66%; P = 0.08). Among the 223 HSV-2-seropositive subjects identified in the first study cohort, only 22 (10%) had suffered from recurrent anogenital lesions during the past 12 months, while 154 (69%) had no clinical history of herpesvirus infection.

Our findings demonstrate high proportions of subclinical and undiagnosed HSV-2 infection in HIV-1-infected individuals and suggest that HSV type-specific serological testing in the French HIV-1-infected subpopulation could be an efficient strategy to diagnose clinically asymptomatic HSV-2 infections.

### Rapid diagnosis of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 bloodstream infections utilizing a sample-to-answer platform [^116f8FvM]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Bloodstream HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections can cause devastating outcomes with high morbidity and mortality, especially in neonates or immunocompromised individuals. Proper patient management for herpes simplex virus (HSV) bloodstream infections is time-sensitive and requires a rapid, accurate, and definitive diagnosis. The absence of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved molecular assays for HSV detection in blood, coupled with a lack of consensus on the optimal sample type, underscores the unmet need for improved diagnostics.

We prospectively compared the cycle threshold values in paired samples, including whole blood (WB), plasma, serum, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with bloodstream HSV infections. This analysis employed a modified use of the FDA-cleared Simplexa HSV-1 & 2 Direct assay. The clinical performance in serum was assessed by comparing the results of 247 remnant specimens on this sample-to-answer platform to established laboratory-developed tests in a blinded fashion. Serum samples exhibited significantly lower cycle thresholds than whole blood samples [2.6 cycle threshold (Ct) bias, P < 0.001].

The modified Simplexa assay demonstrated 100% positive percent agreement for the detection of HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA in serum samples and yielded an overall agreement of 95% (95% CI, 0.92 to 0.97), with a κ statistic of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.86) compared to the composite reference method. Discordance rates were 5.20% for HSV-1 and 0.81% for HSV-2. This investigation demonstrates that serum is an optimal specimen type for this diagnostic platform.

### Seroprevalence of Rift Valley and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses, Benin, 2022–2023 [^116i8EmH]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Discrepancies among detection rates of the two CCHFV ELISA tests and IFA were surprising. Unspecific ELISA reactivity can occur; for example, malaria or herpes virus infection might cause unspecific B-cell stimulation. Antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum parasites' histidine-rich proteins occur in approximately 25% of people in malaria-endemic areas and decrease the sensitivity of rapid diagnostic tests. During in vitro antigen production for serologic tests, fewer than six histidine residues are frequently added to expression constructs for protein purification. Increasing externally added histidine concentrations led to significantly decreased CCHFV indirect ELISA reactivity in potentially false-positive samples (ρ = 0.41; p = 0.0015).

- **Reactivities of likely true-positive samples**: Confirmed by IFA or immune capture ELISA, these reactivities were not affected by incremental histidine concentrations.

- **Suggested causes of observed reactivity pattern**: Data substantiated that antibodies potentially elicited by previous or acute Plasmodium infections targeting histidine-rich epitopes might have interacted with likely histidine-tagged indirect ELISA antigens. This interaction could cause the observed reactivity pattern, including multiple likely false-positive test results. Other histidine-rich immunogens might also have elicited potentially cross-reactive antibodies. Yet, malaria-associated immune responses remain the most plausible explanation because of the abundance of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa and a similar rate of potentially false-positive COVID-19 results in a previous serologic study.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^1118HTaK]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Clinical testing remnant samples cohort**:

	- HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG were measured in 979 remnant WB samples from 977 individuals from all four WB result categories: 444 negative for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG, 175 positive for HSV-1 but negative for HSV-2 IgG, 182 positive for HSV-2 IgG but negative for HSV-1 IgG, and 178 positive for IgG to both HSV-1 and HSV-2. For each instrument, we calculated concordance with the WB results (Table 1).

	**Samples and demographics**: The clinical remnant samples consisted of 474 (49%) women and 503 (51%) men, with a median age of 43 years (range: 3–91 years). The age distribution was bimodal, which was likely related to the two separate major indications for HSV serology testing — STI testing and pre-transplant screening. Most people identified as White and non-Hispanic (64.3%) and were from Washington state (87.1%).

### Simultaneous titration and phenotypic antiviral drug susceptibility testing for herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 [^116so8Lu]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2014). Low credibility.

Most herpes simplex virus (HSV) isolates from treatment-naïve patients are susceptible to antivirals. However, prolonged antiviral therapy can select for drug-resistant strains, especially in immunocompromised patients. Standard phenotypic methods for antiviral resistance testing are labor and time-intensive, and molecular resistance determinants are insufficiently understood for routine diagnostic use in genotypic resistance testing.
- **Objective**: To enable rapid, scalable antiviral susceptibility testing and minimize viral passage, we developed a 7-day, 96-well assay for simultaneous HSV 1/2 titration and phenotypic resistance testing for acyclovir and foscarnet.
- **Study design**: The assay was optimized and validated by testing clinical isolates and laboratory strains (n = 39) with known IC50 for acyclovir (23 resistant) and foscarnet (1 resistant) based on plaque reduction or dye-uptake assays. A chemiluminescent detection reagent was used for quantification of cytopathic effect instead of plaque counting or measuring dye-uptake. Drug concentrations inhibiting 50% of chemiluminescent signal reduction (IC50) were determined concurrently at each of three virus dilutions.
- **Results**: Results agree for 92.3% (acyclovir) and 100% (foscarnet) of isolates. For all three discordant samples, reference testing by plaque reduction agreed with the chemiluminescent assay. Reproducibility studies showed 100% qualitative agreement and 3–37% coefficient of variation based on IC50.
- **Conclusions**: Chemiluminescence detection as a surrogate for cellular viability with an automated system shows promise as an effective method for antiviral drug susceptibility testing.

### False positive antibody results against human T-cell lymphotropic virus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome [^116V2n8m]. Journal of Medical Virology (2005). Low credibility.

Taiwan suffered from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Our laboratory performed a series of virology and serology tests for SARS patients admitted to our hospital. Cross-reactivity was found when testing for antibodies against human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) in one patient with SARS. Therefore, antibodies against HTLV were examined in paired sera from 26 SARS patients. ELISA and a neutralization test were used to measure anti-SARS antibodies. Seroconversion for antibodies against SARS-CoV was observed in all patients.

Surprisingly, using ELISA for HTLV, sera from 13 patients were positive for HTLV (50%), and seroconversion for HTLV was also observed in 10 patients (38.5%). A Western blot for HTLV on the 26 paired sera from 13 HTLV-positive patients displayed 5 positive results for HTLV-I, 7 positive results for HTLV-II, 1 positive result for both HTLV-I and II, 9 negative results for either HTLV-I or HTLV-II, and 4 "indeterminate" results. The findings that antibodies to HTLV can be detected in blood samples collected from SARS patients provide important information for the safe handling of blood products. Without such knowledge, blood products can be mistakenly discarded even though they contain anti-SARS-CoV antibodies that may be potentially valuable for SARS therapy.

### Umbilicated papules in an immunocompetent patient [^113tBsVh]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

- **Question 2: Which of the following is the best test to diagnose this condition**:
	- A. Patch testing
	- B. Immunoglobulin (Ig) M/IgG serologic assay
	- C. Viral culture
	- D. Biopsy with histopathology
	- E. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

- **Answers**:
	* A. Patch testing – Incorrect. Patch testing is the diagnostic criterion standard for allergic contact dermatitis, not EH. PCR would be better for identifying the viral DNA in EH.
	* B. IgM/IgG serologic assay – Incorrect. Serologic assays for IgG and IgM antibodies to HSV identify only exposure to HSV infection and are not useful diagnostically. Serologic assay is the test of choice when no lesions are active and HSV infection status needs to be determined. PCR is the diagnostic test of choice during an active infection.
	* C. Viral culture – Incorrect. Although viral culture is highly available, is highly specific, can identify active HSV infection, and can indicate type of HSV, it takes several days to receive test results, and the test has high false negative rates. Because EH is potentially life-threatening, a more rapid diagnostic test would be the better choice.
	* D. Biopsy with histopathology – Incorrect. Multinucleate giant cells on histopathology are characteristic of EH, but this is not required. This is not the best diagnostic test for EH because it is time-consuming and nonspecific.
	* E. PCR – Correct. PCR for HSV viral DNA is the best answer choice for confirming the diagnosis of EH in terms of sensitivity (> 95% vs. 50%-75% with viral culture), efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. PCR allows for diagnostic results within a few hours.

### Effect of HSV-2 infection on subsequent HIV acquisition: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^114jaGa4]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Another potential threat to validity was misclassification bias of the exposure to HSV-2 infection. Misclassification bias can occur if HSV-2 exposure is defined solely according to HSV-2 antibody status at baseline and some unexposed individuals seroconvert to HSV-2 during the study. Although exposure status was defined solely on baseline HSV-2 infection status in half of the studies estimating the association between prevalent HSV-2 infection and HIV acquisition, we found only weak indication that the association between HSV-2 and HIV was lower in those studies. However, in our meta-regression analyses, estimates were significantly increased for unknown definition of the unexposed comparison group, which might be a proxy for poor study quality more generally.

To minimize the risk of reverse causation, we only included longitudinal studies and categorized estimates for the effect of incident HSV-2 infection on HIV acquisition according to the timing of HSV-2 infection compared with HIV seroconversion. For our principal meta-analysis and meta-regression, we restricted inclusion of estimates for incident HSV-2 infection to when incident HSV-2 infection was known with greatest certainty to have occurred before HIV seroconversion (i.e. timing 1), excluding any estimates for which HSV-2 infection was known to or might have occurred after HIV infection. By erring on the side of caution, we might have inadvertently excluded estimates for when HSV-2 infection occurred before HIV in studies where testing was not done sufficiently frequently to disentangle the sequence of infection.

### Rapid diagnosis of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 bloodstream infections utilizing a sample-to-answer platform [^117A2Liq]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Limit of detection**: The limit of detection (LOD) of the assay in serum was determined by testing serial dilutions of quantified and inactivated HSV-1 (MacIntyre strain, catalog number: NATHSV1–0005; ZeptoMetrix, Buffalo, NY) and HSV-2 (MS strain, catalog number: NATHSV2–0005; ZeptoMetrix, Buffalo, NY). HSV-1 and HSV-2 viral particles were provided at a concentration of 59,100 copies/mL and 50,900 copies/mL, respectively. Serial dilutions were prepared using pooled human serum that confirmed negative for HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA (material number: 1830–0002; Seracare, Milford, MA) to achieve the following concentrations in copies/mL: 20,000, 400, 200, 100, and 50. Multiple replicates, ranging from 5 to 12 at each dilution, were tested using the modified Simplexa assay. The LOD was defined as the concentration of the lowest dilution that could be detected with a probability greater than 95% and was determined by probit analysis.
- **Precision (intra and inter-assay reproducibility)**: The precision of the assay for HSV detection in serum was assessed using HSV-1 and HSV-2 whole virus diluted in pooled human negative serum. Both inter-assay and intra-assay reproducibility were evaluated. Three spiked serum samples containing HSV-1 and HSV-2 were utilized, sourced from the LOD study. These samples consisted of two concentrations at or near the LOD and one with a relatively high titer. Inter-assay reproducibility was assessed by testing these samples on three different days by two different technologists, while intra-assay reproducibility was evaluated by testing three spiked HSV-1 and HSV.

### Herpes simplex virus type 1 in Europe: Systematic review, meta-analyses and meta-regressions [^111fvSej]. BMJ Global Health (2020). Low credibility.

**Quality assessment**: Online supplementary Table S11 summarises the quality assessment of seroprevalence studies (n = 179). A total of 149 studies (83.2%) had high precision, 45 studies (25.1%) had low risk of bias (ROB) in the sampling methodology domain, and 12 studies (6.7%) had low ROB in the response rate domain. Only five studies (2.8%) had low ROB in both quality domains. Despite this, the meta-regression analyses (Table 3) did not demonstrate an association between these study quality variables and HSV-1 seroprevalence, suggesting a minimal impact on the findings of this study.

### The assessment of IgG avidity in the evaluation of perinatal herpes simplex virus infection [^111nnSAz]. Journal of Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

Classical serologic assays are not useful for the diagnosis of perinatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection during the acute phase of the disease. We report two cases of neonatal HSV infection that highlight the diagnostic value of HSV-specific IgG avidity and its contribution to further characterization of neonatal HSV infection.

### Development of a bead-based multiplex assay for use in multianalyte screening and surveillance of HIV, viral hepatitis, syphilis, and herpes [^1155CiFY]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). High credibility.

Here, we have described the development of a 10-plex assay for the simultaneous detection of IgG for antigens from HIV-1, HIV-2, HIV-1/2, HBV, HCV, HSV-1, and HSV-2. The 10-plex assay offers an opportunity to detect antibodies to multiple infections simultaneously. Our 10-plex assay results agreed well with the reference data, with an overall sensitivity of 92.2% and an overall specificity of 98.1% when HCV antigens were combined for diagnosis.

In this case, where multiple antigens were used to determine the diagnosis of one pathogen (e.g. hepatitis virus), specimens were positive if they contained antibodies to either of the antigens. This resulted in a kappa score of 0.89. The sensitivities and specificities of each of the pathogens were also assessed at the monoplex level or intrapathogen plex level, focusing on the different antigens used within a pathogen (e.g. triplex for HIV) and at the 10-plex level. The sensitivities and specificities of the monoplex or intrapathogen plex and the 10-plex assays were identical, indicating that there was no interference or cross-reactivity from multiplexing.

Examples of a monoplex and a 10-plex concordance plot are shown in Fig. 2A for HIV and Fig. S1 in the supplemental material for all other pathogens. The results for HSV, HCV, and HBV were also identical. Bland-Altman plots also showed good agreement between the two tests, with no systematic errors between the monoplex and multiplex data and with a low correlation between the difference and the mean (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2).

### Herpes simplex virus type 1 and other pathogens are key causative factors in sporadic Alzheimer's disease [^113PvvV9]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between viral infectious burden (IB) and cognitive decline. IB is defined as a composite serological measure of exposure to common pathogens. Strandberg et al. measured seropositivity to HSV-1, HSV-2, CMV, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 383 elderly patients with cardiovascular disease. Assessments, including the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and the Clinical Dementia Rating, were used to define cognitive impairment. The presence of three positive viral titers was associated with a 2.5 times higher risk for cognitive impairment after 12 months.

Katan et al. identified an association between Herpesviridae and cognitive decline using a composite serologic measure of exposure to both bacterial (Chlamydia pneumoniae and Helicobacter pylori) and viral (CMV, HSV-1, and HSV-2) pathogens. As reviewed by Strandberg, this association was primarily driven by viral IB.

Letenneur et al. investigated the risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) based on the presence or absence of serum anti-HSV IgG and IgM antibodies by following 512 elderly patients, who were initially free of dementia, over a period of 14 years. The presence of anti-HSV IgM antibodies is associated with primary infection or recent reactivation of HSV, while the presence of anti-HSV IgG antibodies indicates a lifelong HSV infection. Subjects who were IgM-positive at baseline exhibited a significantly higher risk of developing AD (hazard ratio = 2.55). In contrast, no significant increased risk for AD was found in IgG-positive subjects.

### Optimizing PCR positivity criterion for detection of herpes simplex virus DNA on skin and mucosa [^112XJPjA]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2007). Low credibility.

In 1997, we developed a PCR assay for the detection of herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA. Recently, we determined an optimal positivity criterion based on research specimens and a dilution study. We found that a cutoff of 50 HSV DNA copies/ml of swab specimen, a level 10-fold lower than our previous cutoff, minimizes misclassification.

### Incidence of serum antibody titers against herpes simplex virus in Japanese patients [^111tQrfX]. The Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) establishes latency in the sensory neuronal ganglia after primary infection and occasionally causes reinfection, mainly on the lips or genitalia. Previous reports revealed an age-related increase in HSV-immunoglobulin G seropositive subjects in both a hospital-based study and the general population in Japan. In this report, we retrospectively analyzed the results of serological tests against HSV, involving subjects diagnosed with or suspected of having HSV infection. A total of 1,216 subjects with at least one complement fixation (CF) result were included.

Of these, 771 subjects (63.4%) were positive at their first visit. When stratified by age, the incidence of positive patients increased linearly with age, from teenagers (44.9%) to those in their 80s (88.9%). Positivity in women was higher than in men overall, with significantly higher incidence observed in women aged in their 30s, 40s, and 60s.

When observing changing HSV-CF titers over time in 81 initially negative patients, 18 (22%) seroconverted during the 2,121-day observation period. In this study, we clearly show that the distribution of HSV-CF titers is similar to previous HSV-immunoglobulin G results. This correlation is likely due to the continual subclinical proliferation of HSV, thus maintaining CF titers. Our observations provide data on the incidence of HSV, reconfirming that serological examination is unreliable in diagnosing recurrent herpes, as the majority of infected subjects are asymptomatic.

### Evaluation of a new point-of-care serologic assay for herpes simplex virus type 2 infection [^112YWxre]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 2 infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. Because presentation is often atypical or subclinical, serologic testing is necessary for diagnosis, treatment, and counseling. In an urban clinic specializing in the treatment of sexually transmitted disease, a new point-of-care rapid serologic test was compared with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or Western blot for the detection of herpes simplex virus type 2. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay index cutoff value of 1.1, the rapid test was found to have a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 98%, a positive predictive value of 92%, and a negative predictive value of 99%. Increasing the cutoff index value to 3.5 increased the test sensitivity to 100%.

### Clinical correlates of index values in the focus HerpeSelect ELISA for antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) [^111w41PD]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical correlates of HerpeSelect ELISA index values are poorly understood. This study was designed to determine the effects of time of infection, test variability, and antibody avidity on index values. **Study design**: Sera (N = 313) from 81 patients with new HSV-2 infections and 236 sera from 32 patients with long-standing (median 11.3 years) HSV-2 were tested by HerpeSelect HSV-2 ELISA. High positive, low positive, and negative controls were run on 42 test plates to establish test variability.

- **Results**: Index values tended to rise after infection, peaking a median of 9–10 weeks post-infection (range 8–323 days). Of 32 patients with established HSV-2 infections, 7 (22%) had at least one low index value (> 1.1 to ≤ 3.5), and one had a transient seroreversion event. Test variability of index values was substantially lower than inter- or intra-patient variability. Median antibody avidity was higher in sera with high versus low index values in established infections, but unrelated to index value in patients with early infections.

- **Conclusions**: Index values or index value changes are not absolute indicators of early versus established HSV-2 infection or solely a function of test variability. Low antibody avidity may contribute to low index values once infection is established.

### Antibody tests for identification of current and past infection with SARS-CoV-2 [^117CuSZd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Positive serology results in pre-pandemic samples can be considered truly false positive. However, for contemporaneous samples from individuals considered not to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is a risk that some positive results do indicate a current or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Test manufacturers also carry out test evaluations in confounder or cross-reactivity panels of samples from individuals with other types of laboratory-confirmed respiratory infections or with conditions that produce antibodies that might cause false-positive results on a SARS-CoV-2 assay. Although we did not set out to systematically evaluate results in cross-reactivity panels, we have included these results separately where available.
- **Index tests**: This review evaluates serology tests to measure antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Antibodies are formed by the body's immune system in response to infections and can be detected in whole blood, plasma, serum, urine, or saliva, although the latter two are not applicable for detection of a response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The antibodies produced are largely specific to a particular virus and therefore can be used to differentiate between infections. There are three types of binding antibodies created in response to infection: IgA, IgG, and IgM. These effectively alert the body's immune system to the presence of a foreign pathogen. Neutralising antibodies (or Nabs) are antibodies that act to prevent the virus from further replication; they are less easily measured compared to IgA, IgG, or IgM and are not used to diagnose the presence or absence of the virus.

### Development, implementation, and impact of acceptability criteria for serologic tests for infectious diseases [^112aQgHy]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Serologic testing is essential for the diagnosis of some infectious diseases, yet it is fraught with potential pitfalls. To ensure that serologic tests perform adequately, all parts of the diagnostic process must be optimized. Recognizing that a lack of clinical data and correctly timed, paired sera frequently led to uninterpretable serology results at our laboratory, we developed and implemented simple acceptability criteria for serologic tests.

We assessed the impact of these criteria by comparing submissions and results for the year before and the year after the implementation. The number of serologic tests performed declined by 25% after the implementation of the acceptability criteria, despite an increase in requests for serologic tests. The inappropriate testing of acute-phase sera alone fell from 49 to 0% (P < 0.001) for the tests monitored. Conversely, the appropriate submission of paired sera rose from 9 to 19% (P = 0.006). The proportion of results classified as interpretable rose from 52 to 100% (P < 0.001).

We recommend that acceptability criteria be developed and applied to samples submitted to clinical microbiology laboratories for serologic testing.

### Screening for possible failure of herpes simplex virus PCR in cerebrospinal fluid for the diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis [^116RqPQW]. Journal of Medical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the reliability of herpes simplex virus (HSV) PCR testing in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for the detection of herpes simplex encephalitis. This was done by examining retrospectively the clinical follow-up of a large group of patients tested routinely by HSV-PCR. In addition, an attempt was made to assess the incidence of herpes simplex encephalitis in a central European population.

CSF samples from 1,427 patients from all Vienna hospitals were submitted for HSV-PCR testing during a period of 4 years and 8 months. Herpes simplex encephalitis was detected by PCR in 12 cases and by serological methods in one additional patient. Retrospective analysis of the course of disease, which was possible in 799 PCR-negative patients, led to the identification of three additional cases in which herpes simplex encephalitis appears to have occurred despite negative PCR results. The failure of the PCR in these patients is most likely due to the timing of obtaining CSF during the course of the disease.

A high specificity of the assay was demonstrated by the lack of false positive results in any of the 708 cases in which other causes for the neurological symptoms had been identified in the follow-up. The incidence of herpes simplex encephalitis in the population of Vienna was between 1 case per 469,000 to 577,000 individuals per year. The highest annual incidence was detected in the age group between 3 months and 3 years, which, however, could not be confirmed statistically.

### Effect of HSV-2 infection on subsequent HIV acquisition: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Ur2JK]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

HSV-2 and HIV are lifelong infections that affect genital sites and have similar risk factors, such as sexual behavior, which increases the risk of spurious association in observational studies because of confounding. We minimized this risk at the study level by focusing our analysis on adjusted estimates. However, the risk of residual confounding could not be entirely eliminated because many potential confounding factors were often not controlled for, even in adjusted estimates.

The presence of HSV-2 infection, particularly incident HSV-2 infection, might be a marker of having had sex with a partner infected with HIV due to the higher prevalence of HSV-2 among HIV-infected individuals than among non-HIV-infected ones. Except for serodiscordant-couple studies, in which partner HIV status was known, few studies controlled for partner characteristics. Additionally, some studies inappropriately adjusted for genital ulcer disease, potentially biasing pooled estimates toward the null value, because HSV-2 commonly causes genital ulcers, which act as a point of entry for HIV.

Nevertheless, we did not find any notable difference between crude and adjusted pooled estimates. In the meta-regression analysis, we found that adjustment for key confounders was not associated with the effect size. Confounding could also have arisen from combining estimates from heterogeneous studies, which is an important reason for conducting detailed meta-regression and subgroup analyses. Fewer estimates for incident HSV-2 than for prevalent HSV-2 increased the risk of confounding in some analyses.

Regarding specific circumstances for genital herpes, particularly amongst pregnant patients, the BASHH/RCOG 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining PCR testing from ulcers. This includes type-specific HSV, varicella zoster virus (VZV), and Treponema pallidum for syphilis. Consider obtaining enterovirus PCR testing where available, and Mpox and lymphogranuloma venereum PCR, depending on risk factors, in addition to testing for other tropical ulcerative diseases.

### Managing patients with genital herpes and their sexual partners [^115B7f2x]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

There is increasing recognition of the growing size and significance of the genital herpes epidemic. Recent developments in the wide-scale availability of type-specific herpes simplex virus (HSV) serologic assays have meant that many previously undiagnosed mild, atypical, and subclinical infections may now be diagnosed with some degree of confidence without the use of Western blots. The value of such diagnostics is controversial; however, the importance of HSV with its facilitation of HIV transmission and acquisition, the availability of various preventative strategies for limiting vertical HSV transmission, and the growing evidence that condoms, some educational and counseling interventions, and antiviral therapies may limit sexual transmission have challenged many of the arguments against wider testing of the population.

### Rapid diagnosis of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 bloodstream infections utilizing a sample-to-answer platform [^113b3tBH]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

Comparison of HSV detection and cycle threshold values in paired blood samples: A total of 18 samples from patients with known PCR-confirmed HSV-positive results were tested for the presence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA in blood or serum using the Simplexa Direct assay. Ct values were compared in a subset of these 18 samples where paired whole blood (WB), plasma, serum, or peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were available. HSV-1 or HSV-2 DNA was detected across different blood compartments, ranging from 18.8% (3/16 in PBMC) to 100% (14/14 in serum) of patients. Notably, both HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA were detected in the serum of all six patients presenting HSV-positive lesions, with a detection rate of 100%.

The detection rates for HSV DNA were comparable in whole blood and diluted phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plasma, with a detection rate of 94.4%. Furthermore, the two HSV-1 samples, for which HSV-1 was not detectable in whole blood or plasma, exhibited positive detection in serum, each with a Ct value of 38.6. Poor detection was observed in undiluted plasma and PBMC, with detection rates of 66.7% and 18.8%, respectively. Among the undiluted plasma samples (4 out of 18), invalid results and internal control failures were observed, with internal control amplification occurring in only 77.8% (14 out of 18) of the samples tested.

Four samples with initially invalid results were also invalid upon repeat, likely due to existing interfering substances in plasma. This observation aligns with findings from an article by Kuypers, which reported a high invalid rate with plasma samples.

### Serologic and viral genome prevalence of HSV, EBV, and HCMV among healthy adults in Wuhan, China [^1126GfNY]. Journal of Medical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

The worldwide infection rate of herpesvirus is high, but the detailed prevalence in China, especially the central area, remains unclear. In the present study, the prevalence of herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) was investigated in 303 healthy adults in Wuhan, a representative city in Central China. Viral-specific IgG and IgM titers were examined in the serum by chemiluminescent immunoassay, and the existence of viral genomic DNA in blood cells was determined by nested PCR. The overall IgG seroprevalences were 81.5%, 95.4%, and 93.7% for HSV, EBV, and HCMV, while the corresponding IgM seroprevalences were only 6.3%, 2.3%, and 0. The viral genomic DNA of HSV, EBV, and HCMV was identified in the blood samples of 5.9%, 14.2%, and 22.8% of the tested donors, respectively. Significantly, fewer HSV IgM-positive samples were found in the population over 20 years old than in the below 20 group. Females displayed higher chances for HSV IgG and genome positivity, and occupations such as waiters and medical staff were shown to be at higher risk for HCMV genome positivity. This study provided useful reference data for the HSV, EBV, and HCMV prevalence in Central China and suggested the potential importance of detecting viral genomes to complement serum test data.

### Acute hepatitis E infection associated with a false-positive serology against Epstein-Barr virus [^115Jx3dX]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E virus is a major cause of acute viral hepatitis. The diagnosis of acute hepatitis E is primarily based on the detection of antibodies and the presence of hepatitis E virus RNA. This report describes a case of acute hepatitis E associated with a false-positive serology for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This case suggests that the detection of anti-viral capsid antigen IgM must be interpreted with caution in cases of acute hepatitis E. When EBV RNA polymerase chain reaction is positive, it can be useful as false positivity of anti-viral capsid antigen IgM, which can otherwise be misinterpreted as an acute infection. The EBV false positivity was likely related to polyclonal stimulation of the immune system, which was favored by hepatitis E.

### Inaccuracy of certain commercial enzyme immunoassays in diagnosing genital infections with herpes simplex virus types 1 or 2 [^1121gRzg]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Type-specific serologic results may be inaccurate if not based on glycoprotein G (gG). Commercial tests based on crude antigen from Zeus Scientific (Raritan, NJ), Wampole Laboratories (Cranbury, NJ), and DiaSorin (Stillwater, MN), and one using gG-1 and gG-2 from Focus Technologies (Cypress, CA) were compared with Western blot on serum samples from patients with culture-documented first symptomatic episodes of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 (n = 17) or HSV-2 (n = 49) infection or recurrent genital episodes (HSV-1, 30; HSV-2, 49).

Concordance with Western blot results was as follows: 56% for Zeus, 63% for Wampole, 52% to 54% for DiaSorin, and 83% for Focus. Sensitivity and specificity, respectively, for HSV-1 were 77% and 53% (Zeus), 91% and 35% (Wampole), 98% and 8% (DiaSorin), 94% and 70% (DiaSorin predominant antibody), and 83% and 90% (Focus). For HSV-2, they were 88% and 81% (Zeus), 92% and 83% (Wampole), 96% and 54% (DiaSorin), 38% and 98% (DiaSorin predominant antibody), and 98% and 96% (Focus). Type-specific serologic testing for HSV should be performed with gG-based tests for an accurate diagnosis of symptomatic genital herpes.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^112UiWKn]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

This study demonstrates that currently available HSV serologic diagnostics have limitations precluding widespread use for HSV-1 and HSV-2 testing. Data support the CDC's recommended two-tiered algorithm for confirming HSV serological diagnoses, especially when specimens are first tested with the DiaSorin assays due to their lower specificities. The Roche HSV-2 assay performed the best compared to the WB. Overall, the Roche HSV assays minimize potential harm from false positives, as neither assay showed any false positives among individuals seronegative for both HSV subtypes by WB.

In addition, the Roche assay does not produce equivocal results and performs well across the index value range, unlike the DiaSorin and Bio-Rad assays, which have lower specificity at low index values and require additional testing to resolve equivocal results. Further work is required to adjudicate type-specific accuracy and reduce cross-reactivity among automated assays. Notably, no adsorption reagents are available for automated HSV serology assays, despite their role in resolving indeterminate results on the WB. Future work should examine how adsorption reagents could resolve low-positive index values on automated assays. Improvements and investments in HSV serological diagnostics remain necessary to support both clinical care and potential future screening.

### Serological testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and HSV-2 infection [^116izgFD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Serological tests for herpes simplex virus (HSV) that can accurately distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 are now commercially available. These tests detect antibodies to HSV glycoproteins G-1 and G-2, which evoke a type-specific antibody response. Focus Technologies produces the HerpeSelect-1 and HerpeSelect-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests and the HSV-1 and HSV-2 HerpeSelect1/2 Immunoblot. Diagnology has marketed POCkit-HSV-2, a point-of-care test for HSV-2 that allows blood from a finger stick to be tested in a clinic.

These tests can be used to confirm a genital herpes diagnosis, establish diagnosis of HSV infection in patients with atypical complaints, identify asymptomatic carriers, and identify persons at risk for acquiring HSV. Potential settings for use of these tests include sexually transmitted disease clinics, prenatal clinics, and clinics that care for patients with human immunodeficiency virus. Patient interest in HSV serological tests appears high.

### Validation of laboratory screening criteria for herpes simplex virus testing of cerebrospinal fluid [^1134KqbL]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2007). Low credibility.

Most patients with herpes simplex virus (HSV) central nervous system (CNS) infection have abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) indices. Therefore, we implemented screening criteria based on CSF values and host immune status to guide testing. All CSF samples submitted for HSV PCR analysis from January 1999 through December 2004 were included in the study. Specimens from patients with human immunodeficiency virus, a history of transplants, a white blood cell count greater than 5 cells/mm³, or a protein level of > 50 mg/dL were tested upon request. All other samples were rejected and frozen.

To validate our screening criteria, rejected specimens were pooled and tested retrospectively. Electronic medical records were also reviewed. A total of 1,659 HSV PCR requests from 1,458 patients were screened. Of the 1,296 specimens (78.1%) accepted for testing, 1,213 were negative, 7 were positive for HSV type 1 (HSV-1), 26 were positive for HSV-2, and 50 had unavailable results. Sixteen requests were rejected because an alternative microbiologic diagnosis had been established. Of the 347 samples rejected based on criteria, 222 (64.0%) remained available for pooled testing. No HSV-1-positive samples were identified in the rejected specimens. Two rejected specimens tested positive for HSV-2 DNA, but both met acceptance criteria which had not been communicated to the laboratory.

Few patients (7.8%) with rejected specimens were treated with acyclovir, suggesting a low clinical concern for HSV encephalitis. Acceptance criteria based on CSF parameters and host immune status were thus validated.

### Acute retinal necrosis six years after herpes simplex encephalitis: An elusive immune deficit suggested by insufficient test sensitivity [^116k9P39]. Journal of Medical Virology (2004). High credibility.

A patient presented with acute retinal necrosis of the left eye. Demonstration of herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA in the aqueous humor confirmed the diagnosis. Negative results of HSV type-specific antibody tests based on gG antigens suggested a primary HSV infection. However, the patient had a past history of laboratory-confirmed herpes simplex encephalitis six years ago. Using antibody tests based on whole viral lysate antigens, he was seropositive from the onset, and immunoblot testing confirmed a lack of anti-gG reactivity.

To assess whether this might be related to the apparent inability of his immune system to suppress clinically symptomatic HSV infection, serial samples were tested by an HSV neutralization test and a whole-blood flow cytometric assay to determine the frequency of HSV-specific CD4 lymphocytes. However, this did not yield evidence of obvious immunodeficiency; the patient reacted similarly to known positive controls by both assays. Although type-specific HSV serological tests based on gG are generally more specific than those based on whole viral lysate antigens, they have a somewhat lower sensitivity. A certain percentage of HSV-infected individuals do not develop antibodies against gG, and others may suffer a secondary loss of anti-gG reactivity. Thus, there is a risk of missing individual infected patients. Unless this potential problem is recognized, serious consequences might result. We therefore urge virologists and clinicians to exercise great care if highly specific antibody assays based on recombinant proteins are employed.

### First HSV-1 non primary genital herpes in two patients [^1147A3dW]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2016). Low credibility.

The first HSV-1 genital episodes in HSV-2 infected patients, however, had never been demonstrated until the two cases we observed. This scarcity could reflect the lower impact of HSV-2 on Western populations but questions the existence of cross-protection between viral types.

### Investigation of primary human immunodeficiency virus infection in patients who test positive for heterophile antibody [^111fZpHB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

In light of a recent report of three false-positive results of Epstein-Barr virus heterophile tests caused by HIV infection, we sought to assess the frequency of this occurrence. One hundred thirty-two positive heterophile antibody-tested serum samples were obtained from two tertiary care facilities in Boston to assess for HIV, and all tested negative for HIV plasma RNA. This study shows that false-positive results of heterophile tests are not frequently associated with primary HIV infection.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^1132xwoX]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**:

	- **Cohorts**: The HSV Western blot serum specimen remnant cohort initially consisted of samples selected from the University of Washington (UW) HSV WB sample remnants collected between January 2022 and April 2023. Sample selection was restricted to the 5,423 samples obtained within the UW Medicine system to ensure the availability of clinical metadata. This approach was meant to approximate a more typical HSV testing population, as all UW specimens were tested solely by WB without a prior screening test. This method helped avoid biasing specimens toward indeterminate results sent to our reference lab for WB confirmatory testing.

	- Based on the WB results, we randomly selected:
	- 449 samples that were negative for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies,
	- 177 samples positive for HSV-1 and negative for HSV-2 antibodies,
	- 182 samples positive for HSV-2 and negative for HSV-1 antibodies,
	- 184 samples positive for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies.

	- Each sample within each WB category originated from a different individual, with two persons contributing two samples each as their WB serological status changed during the sample selection timeframe. Their samples were randomly selected in two result categories. Due to low sample volume, 13 of the originally selected samples were unable to be tested, leaving 979 samples from 977 persons. Additionally, because of low sample volume and rare barcode errors, not all samples were able to be processed on all instruments. The number of samples from this cohort run on each instrument and their concordance with the WB result are presented in Table 1.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^116HuoLf]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

In December 2023, DiaSorin notified customers that HSV-2 reagent lots, including those used in this study, may have increased numbers of equivocal or false positive results. In our study, compared to the DiaSorin HSV-1 assay, the DiaSorin HSV-2 assay did not seem to be enriched for equivocal or false positive results, as the HSV-2 assay had fewer equivocal (16) or false positive (43) final results than the HSV-1 assay (21 equivocal and 133 false positive results). Of note, our data also confirms the high false positive rate of the DiaSorin HSV-2 assay seen from January to February 2021 by Quest Diagnostics Laboratory, especially for specimens with low-positive index values. Given the performance issues of the DiaSorin assay predate the manufacture of the lots subject to the notification, further consideration for the utility of the assay is warranted. Based on our receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, even if the threshold for the DiaSorin assays were increased, the best sensitivity and specificity for their HSV-2 assay would remain worse than the other assays tested.

Limitations of this study include the use of clinical remnants rather than fresh prospectively collected specimens. Most (86%) of the VRC cohort specimens were stored frozen for over 10 years. However, sensitivity analysis of testing performance by date of collection demonstrated no substantial difference in assay sensitivity for samples collected prior to 2000 (n = 555) versus after 2000 (n = 462; Table S4). This study was not specifically designed to assess the effects of demographics on assay performance.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for COVID-19 infection, specifically concerning serology, the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend considering the acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgG/IgM, or total antibodies 3–5 weeks after symptom onset when evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection is desired. It is advisable to avoid obtaining SARS-CoV-2 IgM alone for this purpose.

### Herpes simplex virus type 1 in Europe: Systematic review, meta-analyses and meta-regressions [^112MKySQ]. BMJ Global Health (2020). Low credibility.

HSV-1 seroprevalence increased with age, reflecting cumulative exposure, with age alone explaining about 50% of the seroprevalence variation. This confirms the general global age pattern seen in other regions, where age typically explained half of the seroprevalence variation, with the notable exception of Africa, where age explained 80% of the variation. There was also a substantial difference in seroprevalence among those aged 20 years, suggesting that older cohorts had higher exposure in their youth compared with the young cohort, thus affirming the decreasing trend in seroprevalence in recent decades.

Seroprevalence also varied by geographical location, with Eastern and Southern Europe, as well as Turkey, exhibiting higher seroprevalence rates compared with Northern and Western Europe, possibly mirroring the individual-level association between HSV-1 infection and lower socioeconomic status. This within-region variation has also been observed in other regions, with the exception of Africa, where the infection is homogenous and universal. Notably, seroprevalence in Europe was lower in men than in women, in contrast with all other regions, a finding that remains to be explained. Remarkably, clinical condition and a country's income (after adjustment for the European subregion) as well as study characteristics, did not appear to affect seroprevalence, probably highlighting that HSV-1 is a truly general population infection.

Detection of HSV-1, as opposed to HSV-2, in genital herpes was high at 34% and increasing.

### A systematic review of maternal TORCH serology as a screen for suspected fetal infection [^111kmH5K]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Low credibility.

The acronym 'TORCH' refers to well-recognized causes of perinatal infections: toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV). A TORCH serology panel is often used to test for maternal primary infection following detection of ultrasound abnormalities in pregnancy.
- **Aim**: This review aims to estimate the diagnostic yield of maternal TORCH serology in pregnancy following fetal ultrasound abnormalities.
- **Materials and methods**: Primary studies published since 2000 that assessed maternal TORCH serology for suspected fetal infection and included information on indications for testing, definition of positive TORCH serology results, and perinatal outcomes were included.
- **Results**: Eight studies with a total of 2,538 pregnancies were included. The main indications for testing were polyhydramnios, fetal growth restriction, and hyperechogenic bowel. There were 26 confirmed cases of congenital CMV, of which 15 had multiple ultrasound abnormalities. There were no cases of congenital toxoplasmosis, rubella, or HSV confirmed in any of the eight studies.
- **Conclusions**: The clinical utility of TORCH serology for non-specific ultrasound abnormalities such as isolated fetal growth restriction or isolated polyhydramnios is low. It is time to retire the TORCH acronym and the reflex ordering of 'TORCH' panels, as their continued use obscures, rather than illuminates, appropriate investigation for fetal ultrasound abnormalities.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^113Yxmpo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are one of the most common and stigmatized infections, affecting more than 4 billion people globally and over 100 million Americans. Most individuals are unaware of their infection status, and antibody testing is not recommended, partly due to poor test performance. In this study, we compared the test performance of the Roche Elecsys HSV-1 IgG and HSV-2 IgG, DiaSorin LIAISON HSV-1/2 IgG, and Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG assays to the gold-standard HSV western blot in 1,994 individuals, including 1,017 persons with PCR or culture-confirmed HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 infection.
- **Test performance metrics**: Across all samples, the Bio-Rad and Roche assays demonstrated similar performance metrics with low sensitivity (97%) for detecting HSV-1 IgG and both high sensitivity (> 97%) and high specificity (> 98%) for detecting HSV-2 IgG. The DiaSorin assay had higher sensitivity (92.1%) but much lower specificity (88.7%) for detecting HSV-1 IgG and comparatively poor sensitivity (94.5%) and specificity (94.2%) for detecting HSV-2 IgG.
- **Performance at low-positive index values**: The DiaSorin assay performed poorly, with 60.9% of DiaSorin HSV-1 results and 20.8% of DiaSorin HSV-2 results with positive index values < 3.0 yielding false positive results. Based on an estimated HSV-2 seroprevalence of 12% in the United States, positive predictive values for HSV-2 IgG were 96.1% for Roche, 87.4% for Bio-Rad, and 69.0% for DiaSorin, indicating that nearly one in three positive DiaSorin HSV-2 IgG results would be falsely positive.

Further development in HSV testing is needed to improve accuracy and reliability.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^1124YUrG]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

We reviewed the original WB blots for 25 of the samples that were discordant with the WB on two or three automated assays. These samples were selected to represent all four possible discordant situations (e.g. HSV-1 IgG positive by WB, but negative by the automated assays), and 12 of these samples were originally adsorbed or repeated during clinical testing. For this review, independent readers were aware that there was a discordance but blinded to what assays were discordant.

On review, no readers would have changed the final interpretation of any blots, but there were three samples — two for HSV-2 and one for HSV-1 — that were positive on the WB and negative on all three automated assays, where at least one reader would now recommend adsorbing the sample for further clarification. There were only three samples where all three automated instruments called the sample positive for HSV antibodies, and the WB was negative. All three samples were discordant for HSV-1 IgG, and the blot reviewers noted that the HSV-1 blot was more consistent with HSV-1 cross-reactivity than true HSV-1 IgG.

Overall, a review of the original WBs for a subset of samples where multiple automated assays were discordant with the WB found that 3 out of 25 samples would now be recommended for further testing (e.g. adsorption), but the expert readers agreed with the original clinical WB result in the vast majority of cases (88%). For this assay comparison study, the WB results were considered the ground truth even for samples where more than one assay was discordant with the WB.

### Performance of a novel test for IgM and IgG antibodies in subjects with culture-documented genital herpes simplex virus-1 or -2 infection [^111GaYeX]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Novel tests (BioPlex) for herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 IgG were compared with HerpeSelect HSV-1 and HSV-2 ELISAs for type-specific IgG. The sensitivity and specificity of BioPlex HSV-1 IgG were 94% (84/89) and 96% (119/124), respectively, with unselected sera, while the sensitivity and specificity of BioPlex HSV-2 IgG were 92% (109/118) and 98% (95/97), respectively. BioPlex IgM was compared with Diamedix IgM against sera from patients with culture-documented genital herpes. The test results were concordant in 81% of sera from HSV-1 patients and in 90% of sera from HSV-2 patients.

Use of BioPlex IgM in addition to BioPlex IgG tests increased HSV-2 seroconversion detection from 47% of subjects to 70%. Use of Diamedix IgM in addition to Focus IgG ELISA increased HSV-2 detection from 40% of subjects to 70%. IgM was detected by BioPlex in 63% of sera from patients with early HSV-2 infection (< 30 days) and in 59% of sera by Diamedix. IgM was also detected in a large proportion of sera from subjects with established HSV-2 infection (33% by BioPlex and 29% by Diamedix). The addition of IgM testing substantially increased the ability to detect seroconversion early in infection. IgM is an indicator of recent infection only in subjects who lack detectable IgG.

### No. 208-guidelines for the management of herpes simplex virus in pregnancy [^112KeUzV]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2017). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for genital herpes in pregnant patients, the SOGC 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining type-specific serology testing in pregnant patients without a history of HSV but with a previous partner with genital HSV. This helps determine the patient's risk of acquiring genital HSV during pregnancy before pregnancy or as early as possible in the pregnancy. It is advised to repeat testing at 32–34 weeks of gestation.

### Age patterns of HSV-2 incidence and prevalence in two Ugandan communities: A catalytic incidence model applied to population-based seroprevalence data [^113rz3tk]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Following standard RCCS methodology, sera from peripheral blood samples were tested for HSV-2 using the Kalon ELISA (Kalon Biological Ltd) with an index cutoff value of 1.5, which provided optimal test sensitivity and specificity in a Ugandan population in previous validation. All HSV-2 tests were conducted at the RHSP central laboratory in Kalisizo, Uganda. HIV serological testing employed a field-validated parallel 3-test rapid algorithm.

- **Syphilis seropositivity**: Defined by treponemal antibody status, it was determined using the SD Bioline Syphilis 3.0 (SD Biostandard Diagnostics, Private Limited). Syphilis titers were determined at the RHSP central laboratory for all participants with positive serology, using the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) non-treponemal test (Cypress Diagnostics). High-titer syphilis infection was defined as an RPR titer ≥ 1:8.
- **Genital swab testing**: Swabs were analyzed for trichomonas, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. Trichomonas tests were conducted using the OSOM Trichomonas Rapid Test (Sekisui). Chlamydia and gonorrhea tests were performed at the RHSP central laboratory using the Abbott m2000 RealTime CT/NG assay.

HIV, syphilis, and trichomonas point-of-care test results were returned by on-site counselors. Participants who tested positive, along with their partners, were treated according to Uganda Clinical Guidelines and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for the treatment of STIs. Partners were identified via passive referral. Participants diagnosed with chlamydia and gonorrhea were recontacted and provided with counseling, etiologic treatment, and referral.

### Coprevalence of Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus type-1 antibodies among United States children and factors associated with their acquisition [^115zCrgS]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2015). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) infections are common worldwide; however, age-specific prevalence of primary infection varies by race or ethnicity and geographical location. Comparing demographic groups could identify factors influencing the rate of acquisition. Age-specific antibody prevalence is relevant for determining when to administer prophylactic vaccines, and coprevalence suggests similar risk factors.
- **Methods**: Stored sera collected from the cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2003–2004 cycle were tested for EBV, CMV, and HSV-1 antibodies. Demographic information was obtained through self-reported questionnaires. Statistical analysis included logistic regression and multivariate analysis, adjusting for the multistage cluster design.
- **Results**: Overall, 36% of children had antibodies against two or more of the viruses. Coprevalence with EBV, CMV, and HSV-1 was higher in females, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans, compared with non-Hispanic whites, and in those without health insurance. Antibody prevalence was associated with lower household income and education, as well as greater crowding. Nearly all children with CMV or HSV-1 antibodies had been infected with EBV.
- **Conclusions**: There was a disproportionately high prevalence of EBV, CMV, and HSV-1 antibodies among Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic blacks, groups with a lower poverty income ratio and less household education. They might benefit from receiving prophylactic herpes vaccines when fairly young.

### Genotypic testing improves detection of antiviral resistance in human herpes simplex virus [^1114n6ZJ]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2023). High credibility.

Antiviral resistance in human herpes simplex viruses (HSV) remains a significant clinical challenge in immunocompromised populations. Although molecular tests have largely replaced viral culture for HSV diagnosis and molecular antiviral resistance testing is available for many viruses, HSV resistance testing continues to rely on phenotypic, viral culture-based methods, requiring weeks for results. Consequently, treatment of suspected HSV resistance remains largely empiric.
- **Methods**: We used HSV whole genome sequencing and a database of previously characterized HSV acyclovir and foscarnet resistance mutations to evaluate the performance of genotypic antiviral resistance testing among 19 control strains compared to in-house plaque reduction assay (PRA) and 25 clinical isolates sent for reference lab PRA antiviral resistance testing.
- **Results**: Among control strains, 23/29 (79.3%) results were concordant, 5 (17.2%) were indeterminate, and 1 (3.4%) was discordant. Indeterminate results were caused by variants of uncertain significance (VUS), including mutations without published phenotypes and mutations with contradictory results. Among clinical isolates, 14/40 (35%) results were concordant, 17 (42.5%) were indeterminate, and 9 (22.5%) were discordant. All discordant results were in reportedly phenotypically-susceptible HSV-1 strains yet possessed resistance mutations. Three contained resistant subpopulations. 6/8 (75%) discordant phenotypes were concordant with resistant genotypes upon repeat PRA.
- **Conclusions**: These data support the combination of genotypic and phenotypic testing to improve the detection of antiviral resistance in HSV.

### Light microscopy, culture, molecular, and serologic methods for detection of herpes simplex virus [^11569rZ7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) cause a variety of human diseases, ranging from acute to chronic and mild to severe. The absence of curative therapy results in lifelong carriage marked by recurrent outbreaks and allows transmission of the virus to uninfected individuals. Nonspecific lesions, variable presentation, and chronic carriage necessitate the use of different laboratory testing methods appropriate for each presentation.

A thorough understanding of the performance characteristics and limitations of available tests is critical for the selection of the appropriate test and interpretation of results. Clinical sensitivity, specificity, and the selection of the appropriate methodology are paramount to avoid misdiagnosis and guide therapy. In this article, we review the different methods for detection and typing of HSV, including light microscopy, culture, serology, and nucleic acid-based tests. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each method for diagnosing HSV infection, cite performance characteristics, and review appropriate clinical uses.

### Falsely positive anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies in a patient with hantavirus-induced acute kidney injury - a case report [^1176ab4N]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Hantavirus infection is an uncommon cause of acute renal failure with massive proteinuria. Serology tests to support a presumptive diagnosis usually require a few days. During the initial work-up, autoimmune causes, including anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) glomerulonephritis, need to be excluded because they require urgent therapy. In this case, the delay in serological testing caused a dilemma in treatment initiation.
- **Case presentation**: An 18-year-old patient was admitted to the hospital with acute renal failure, erythrocyturia, and massive proteinuria. Routine blood analysis showed leucocytosis (40.5×10^9/l) and a serum creatinine of 233 μmol/l. Infectious causes, such as leptospirosis or hantavirus infection, or an autoimmune disease, such as AAV or anti-GBM glomerulonephritis, were considered the most feasible underlying diagnoses. Before hantavirus serology results were known, anti-GBM antibodies tested positive. Treatment for anti-GBM glomerulonephritis was withheld due to the absence of other signs and symptoms of the disease and slight improvement in renal function. The diagnosis of acute hantavirus infection was later confirmed by seroconversion of a follow-up serum sample. Without further intervention, renal function recovered, and anti-GBM antibodies disappeared.
- **Conclusion**: Hantavirus infection may induce anti-GBM antibodies, falsely suggesting anti-GBM glomerulonephritis. Anti-GBM antibodies are supposed to be 100% specific. No earlier reports of false positive anti-GBM titers have been reported. Nevertheless, the anti-GBM antibodies in this case were seen as indicative of a misdiagnosis.

### Serologic detection of herpes simplex virus type 2 antibodies among pregnant women using a point-of-care test from Focus Diagnostics [^112e4x5A]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

Serologic assays that identify herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) type-specific antibodies have been commercially available for more than a decade. Greater acceptance of these tests is hindered by uncertainty regarding their performance in real-world clinical settings.
- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to compare the test characteristics of the Focus HerpeSelect Express Assay (EA) versus the Focus HerpeSelect enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for detection of HSV-2 type-specific antibodies among pregnant women enrolled from three geographic sites with varying prevalences of HSV-2 infection. A second objective was to evaluate the performance of an HSV-2 testing strategy in which EA screens and ELISA confirms HSV-2 serodiagnosis.
- **Study design**: We enrolled 399 pregnant women from Atlanta, GA, Moorestown, NJ, and Pittsburgh, PA, into this cross-sectional investigation. Capillary whole blood was obtained from study participants and evaluated for the presence of type-specific HSV-2 antibodies using the EA. Serum samples were also obtained from all study participants for subsequent identification of HSV-2 type-specific antibodies using both ELISA and the Focus Immunoblot assays.
- **Results**: We observed 96.2% agreement between results obtained with EA and ELISA. Overall, when compared to ELISA results, the sensitivity of EA for detection of HSV-2 type-specific antibodies was 94.2% and the specificity was 97.1%. Using Immunoblot results as our standard for performance calculations, the positive predictive value (PPV) of HSV-2 serodiagnosis increased from 91.7% to 98.2%.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^112jtTBc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Most high-throughput HSV serology assays detect type-specific IgG responses to the HSV-1 or HSV-2 glycoprotein G (gG 1 for HSV-1 and gG 2 for HSV-2), which share only approximately 40% amino acid identity. However, IgG to gG 1 and gG 2 may still be cross-reactive and insufficiently specific, leading the United States Preventive Task Force to recommend against screening for genital herpes infections among asymptomatic adolescents and adults. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) Treatment Guidelines recommend a two-step testing process, using a sensitive enzyme/chemiluminescence assay for screening, followed by a second, more specific confirmatory assay.

The gold standard for confirmatory serological diagnosis of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections is a western blot (WB) that detects serological responses to multiple proteins within a viral lysate. This assay is highly sensitive and specific, but it is laborious, costly, and only available in the United States at one reference lab. Here, we examined the sensitivity and specificity of three fully automated, high-throughput, type-specific HSV-1/2 IgG assays compared to the HSV western blot in two clinical cohorts comprising 1,994 individuals.

### Rapid diagnosis of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 bloodstream infections utilizing a sample-to-answer platform [^115yvpAc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex viruses are among the most ubiquitous in human infections. In most cases, HSV infections in individuals with an intact immune system are relatively mild and can cause discomfort, but often go unnoticed. In rare instances, HSV can enter the bloodstream, leading to more severe manifestations affecting multiple regions of the skin, the viscera, and the central nervous system. This is especially true for neonates and individuals with an immunocompromised status, for whom HSV infections or reactivations can be life-threatening. Neonatal disseminated HSV infection, for example, can result in devastating outcomes, with an untreated mortality rate of approximately 80% and up to 30% even with antiviral therapy. In solid organ transplantation recipients, HSV infection or reactivation can also lead to more severe manifestations, including esophagitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and potential graft loss. Therefore, achieving a rapid, accurate, and definitive diagnosis of HSV bloodstream infections is crucial in clinical settings. Rapid diagnosis enables timely administration of antiviral treatment, influences patient management decisions for those at high risk, and can contribute to shorter hospital stays, thereby reducing healthcare costs.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111kt5Ks]. ClinicalInfo (2025). High credibility.

The DHHS 2025 guidelines recommend that for primary prevention in genital herpes, specifically for patients with HIV, HSV-2-seronegative patients with HIV infection should advise their partners to be tested using HSV type-specific serology. This should be done before initiating sexual activity to reduce the risk of transmission of HSV-2.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^115FgtVo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

A second cohort consisted of serum specimens from persons with genital lesions that were PCR- or culture-positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2. This cohort was followed by the UW Virology Research Clinic, and individuals provided written informed consent approved by the UW Institutional Review Board (IRB). One serum specimen was selected from each of the 1,074 HIV-negative persons who tested positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2 by PCR and/or culture and were confirmed seropositive for the corresponding HSV type by WB. Samples were collected at least six months following a person's initial episode of genital herpes. Some persons with HSV-2 positive genital lesions had both HSV-2 and HSV-1 antibodies when tested with the WB, resulting in 131 samples positive for HSV-1 only with both viral and WB testing, 566 samples positive for HSV-2 only with both viral and WB testing, and 320 samples positive for HSV-2 with viral testing and both HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies on WB. Virological data on shedding rates in genital herpes infections — measured as the percent of swabs positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2 by non-type-specific PCR over the total number of swabs — were also available from 315 out of 1,017 persons in the Virology Research Clinic (VRC) cohort. Shedding rates are available in the Supplemental Data file.

### Laboratory diagnosis of neonatal herpes simplex virus infections [^114NbMdv]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common and often benign infection in humans. Although it less commonly affects newborns, infection in this age group can be devastating. Newborns often present with nonspecific clinical findings, making timely and accurate diagnosis of infection critical. A wide variety of tests are available for detecting herpes simplex virus infection, but only a subset are useful and validated in the newborn population.

The review summarizes available diagnostic testing for neonatal disease, including discussing limitations, unmet needs, and emerging data on molecular testing methods.
