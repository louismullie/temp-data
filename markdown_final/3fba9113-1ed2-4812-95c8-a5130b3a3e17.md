## Question

Max dose of Tylenol in cirrhosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the maximum safe dose of Tylenol (acetaminophen) in patients with cirrhosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality guideline sources that specifically address analgesic dosing in cirrhosis. Then, I should verify whether the recommendation is uniform across compensated and decompensated disease. Next, I will check the practical dosing schedule and whether it applies to all routes of administration. After that, I need to review the rationale for the lower limit compared with the general population. Finally, I will consider special scenarios, monitoring, and what to avoid so I can synthesize a clear, actionable answer.

> Let me first confirm the authoritative guidance. Multiple AASLD practice statements on palliative care and symptom management in decompensated cirrhosis consistently recommend acetaminophen as first-line analgesia at a maximum of 2 g/day, typically prescribed as 500 mg every 6 hours as needed, and they advise avoiding systemic NSAIDs and minimizing opioids when possible [^112TA27V] [^112kknEF] [^113HKWnn].

> Wait, let me verify whether this 2 g/day ceiling applies only to decompensated cirrhosis or also to compensated disease. The AASLD guidance is framed around decompensated cirrhosis, but contemporary reviews and perioperative guidance extend the same 2 g/day maximum to patients with cirrhosis more broadly, reflecting impaired hepatic metabolism and increased susceptibility to hepatotoxicity, so the 2 g/day limit is appropriate for both compensated and decompensated cirrhosis unless a hepatologist directs otherwise [^111nkKXt] [^111Bf8wx].

> I should confirm the practical dosing schedule. The standard regimen endorsed by AASLD is 500 mg orally every 6 hours as needed, not to exceed 2 g in 24 hours; this schedule balances analgesia with safety and is the preferred starting point in cirrhosis, with careful attention to total daily intake from all sources [^112TA27V] [^112kknEF].

> Hold on, I should verify whether this 2 g/day limit includes all routes and combination products. Yes, the maximum applies to total acetaminophen exposure from oral, IV, and rectal formulations, and from all combination products; exceeding this total increases the risk of dose-dependent hepatotoxicity, which is precisely why the cirrhosis-specific cap is set lower than in the general population [^113bQRHE] [^1159vpjH].

> Let me consider the rationale for the lower limit. Patients with cirrhosis have reduced hepatic reserve and altered drug metabolism, making them more vulnerable to acetaminophen-induced liver injury even at doses that are usually safe in those without liver disease; AASLD DILI guidance underscores that acetaminophen is a dose-dependent hepatotoxin with susceptibility at only 2–3 times therapeutic dosing in some contexts, supporting the conservative 2 g/day cap in cirrhosis [^115k2c6u] [^1134x8QL].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the standard 4 g/day might still apply in compensated cirrhosis; but that would be a mistake. I should double-check: while some older or non-cirrhotic data suggest short-term 4 g/day may be tolerated in certain populations, the cirrhosis-specific guidance and safety reviews consistently recommend a maximum of 2 g/day in cirrhosis due to impaired hepatic handling and risk of encephalopathy and coagulopathy, so I need to correct that assumption and adhere to 2 g/day in cirrhosis [^112TA27V] [^111nkKXt].

> Next, I should review special scenarios. In severe hepatic impairment or acute liver failure, acetaminophen is generally contraindicated; in decompensated cirrhosis with encephalopathy or coagulopathy, even 2 g/day may be too much and use should be individualized with hepatology input. For short-term needs, some perioperative guidance allows up to 2 g/day with caution, but chronic use should remain at or below 2 g/day, and any deviation should be coordinated with a liver specialist [^114A11bm] [^111Bf8wx].

> I need to ensure we account for hidden sources. Many prescription and over-the-counter products contain acetaminophen, and patients with cirrhosis may inadvertently exceed 2 g/day if these are not identified; explicit medication reconciliation and patient education to avoid duplicate acetaminophen are essential parts of safe prescribing in cirrhosis [^113bQRHE] [^113Yxcz9].

> Let me synthesize the clinical answer. In patients with cirrhosis, the maximum recommended dose of acetaminophen is 2 g per day, typically administered as 500 mg every 6 hours as needed, with the total daily dose including all routes and combination products not to exceed 2 g; this applies to both compensated and decompensated cirrhosis unless a hepatologist advises otherwise, and it reflects the increased risk of dose-dependent hepatotoxicity in liver disease [^112TA27V] [^112kknEF] [^111nkKXt].

The maximum recommended dose of acetaminophen (Tylenol) in patients with cirrhosis is **2,000 mg per day (2 g/day)** [^112TA27V], typically administered as 500 mg every 6 hours [^112kknEF]. This lower limit reflects the increased risk of hepatotoxicity in cirrhosis due to impaired hepatic metabolism and glutathione depletion [^111zBSar]. NSAIDs should be avoided because of bleeding and renal risks [^113Yxcz9] [^11361ekY], and opioids should be used cautiously and only when necessary due to the risk of encephalopathy [^112TA27V] [^112tGHz1]. Always monitor liver function and educate patients to avoid exceeding the daily limit or mixing with alcohol [^113bQRHE].

## Recommended maximum dose of acetaminophen in cirrhosis

- **Maximum dose**: 2,000 mg per day (2 g/day) [^112TA27V] in patients with cirrhosis [^111nkKXt].
- **Typical dosing**: 500 mg every 6 hours as needed [^112TA27V] [^112kknEF].
- **Total daily dose**: Do not exceed 2,000 mg per day [^112TA27V] [^113HKWnn].

---

## Rationale for dose limitation

The 2 g/day limit in cirrhosis is driven by **impaired hepatic metabolism** — reduced glutathione stores and altered drug processing increase hepatotoxic risk [^115k2c6u] — and by the **increased risk of hepatotoxicity**, as even therapeutic doses can cause liver injury in cirrhosis [^1134x8QL].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the recommended dose

Evidence includes **AASLD guidance** recommending acetaminophen as first-line analgesia at ≤ 2 g/day in cirrhosis [^112TA27V] and a **narrative review** indicating acetaminophen is safe at 2 g/day in cirrhosis, with toxicity risk rising above this threshold [^111nkKXt].

---

## Risks associated with exceeding the recommended dose

Exceeding 2 g/day in cirrhosis increases the risk of **hepatotoxicity**, including acute liver failure and death [^111vffkF] [^1159x4gH], and of **medication errors**, as unintentional overdose is common with multiple acetaminophen-containing products [^115H89Rg] [^113pgNA8].

## Alternative analgesic options

| **Analgesic** | **Recommendation in cirrhosis** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| NSAIDs | Avoid | - Bleeding <br/> - Renal injury <br/> - Ascites [^113Yxcz9] [^11361ekY] |
| Opioids | Use cautiously | - Encephalopathy <br/> - Sedation <br/> - Constipation [^112TA27V] [^112tGHz1] |
| Gabapentin | Safe at low doses | Neuropathic pain; monitor renal function [^113v4r41] [^111nkKXt] |
| Topical agents (lidocaine, capsaicin) | Safe | Minimal systemic absorption [^112kknEF] |

---

## Clinical monitoring and patient education

- **Liver function tests**: Monitor AST, ALT, bilirubin, and INR regularly [^116woNm2].
- **Patient education**: Emphasize adherence to 2 g/day and avoidance of alcohol [^112kknEF] [^111saNtS].
- **Medication review**: Identify hidden acetaminophen in combination products [^113bQRHE] [^113Yxcz9].

---

## Special considerations

In **severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C)**, avoid acetaminophen if possible; if absolutely necessary, use the lowest effective dose with close monitoring. For **acute pain**, short-term opioid use may be considered cautiously with lactulose to prevent encephalopathy [^112kknEF] [^1118N8rf].

---

The maximum recommended acetaminophen dose in cirrhosis is **2 g/day** [^112TA27V], balancing analgesia with hepatotoxic risk; avoid NSAIDs, use opioids cautiously, and monitor liver function and patient adherence [^111nkKXt].

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^112TA27V]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AASLD guidance statements — pain in patients with cirrhosis emphasize that multimodal pain management approaches are ideal and include a person-centered holistic, multidisciplinary approach, engaging a combination of expertise from across a number of specialties; pain in patients with DC requires a systematic approach that starts with assessing and treating reversible causes of pain; and localized pain should first be addressed with local, rather than systemic, therapies. Acetaminophen, 500 mg every 6 h, up to a maximum dose of 2 g/d, is the preferred first-line pharmacotherapy for the management of pain in patients with cirrhosis, and systemic NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis. We recommend avoiding opioids, when possible, for chronic pain. However, when necessary, opioid use should be approached with caution and with careful discussion with patients and caregivers. Low-dose oxycodone or hydromorphone can be started in select cases on an as-needed basis and titrated to effect, often in consultation with pain management experts.

### The safe use of analgesics in patients with cirrhosis: a narrative review [^111nkKXt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Pain is prevalent in patients with cirrhosis. Due to potential alterations in drug metabolism, risk for adverse effects, and complications from cirrhosis, physicians are often faced with difficult choices when choosing appropriate analgesics in these patients. Overall, acetaminophen remains the preferred analgesic. Despite its potential for intrinsic liver toxicity, acetaminophen is safe when used at 2 g/d. In contrast, non-selective nonsteroidals should be avoided due to their multiple side effects, including worsening renal function, blunting diuretic response, and increasing risk of portal hypertensive and peptic ulcer bleeding. Celecoxib can be administered for short term (≤ 5 days) in patients with Child's A and Child's B cirrhosis (50% dose reduction). Opioids carry the risk of precipitating hepatic encephalopathy and should generally be avoided, when possible. If clinical situation demands their use, opioid use should be limited to short-acting agents for short duration. Gabapentin and pregabalin are generally safe. Duloxetine should be avoided in hepatic impairment. Topical diclofenac and lidocaine seem to be safe in patients with cirrhosis.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^113Yxcz9]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug harms in cirrhosis — "NSAIDs are among the most commonly inappropriately used medications in patients with cirrhosis", yet "Multiple studies demonstrate the deleterious impact of NSAIDs in patients with cirrhosis attributable to risk of renal injury, bleeding, and ascites". In one trial, "23 patients with cirrhosis" receiving "five doses of 500 mg of naproxen (vs. placebo or celecoxib)" had adverse physiologic effects, and consequently "systemic NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis". Patients should also be informed that other products "may include APAP, which counts toward the daily limit".

### Treatment of pain in cirrhosis: advice to caregivers of those with rock livers [^113QTqJB]. Clinical Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

When one considers the significant role of the liver in medication absorption and metabolism, clinicians must appreciate the important ramifications for medication dosing and monitoring in patients with cirrhosis. For many medications, dose adjustments may be necessary to minimize toxicities or avoid adverse effects from drug accumulation. Clinicians could be well served if they can understand in some detail how pharmacokinetic properties are altered in cirrhosis.

Methods

A PubMed search of the English medical literature starting with 1980 using keywords cirrhosis, pain management, and analgesics was performed, and additional papers were found using references from the first round of papers.

Findings

Patients with cirrhosis often have significant reductions in first-pass metabolism, altered volumes of distribution, and marked reductions in both renal and hepatic elimination of drugs. These factors may contribute to much higher levels of drug exposure compared to the general population. In terms of drug dosing, FDA labeling is often ambiguous and even incongruous with observed pharmacokinetic changes.

Implications

This article may provide guidance for clinicians to optimize pain management in people living with cirrhosis.

Key Message

Current FDA labeling for dosing analgesic drugs in patients with cirrhosis is either vague or not consistent with findings from newer pharmacokinetic research. With this review, we hope to provide insight and guidance to clinicians on how to dose-adjust medications commonly utilized in pain management in these patients.

Cirrhosis evaluation and medication precautions in chronic hepatitis C — Assessing liver disease severity is an essential component of the workup and can usually be accomplished with noninvasive tests, with liver biopsy rarely required; persons with known or suspected cirrhosis are at increased risk and require frequent follow-up. They should also avoid hepatotoxic drugs, such as excessive acetaminophen (> 2 g/day) and certain herbal supplements; nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) should also be avoided, and ongoing imaging surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and gastroesophageal varices is recommended for patients with cirrhosis. Transient elastography provides point-of-care information regarding liver stiffness and can reliably discriminate between cirrhosis and lower stages of fibrosis.

Decompensated cirrhosis — pain management options include nonpharmacological strategies such as "Hot/cold", "Physical therapy", "Mindfulness/meditation", other behavioral therapies, and "Acupuncture (caution if platelets ≤ 50,000)", along with topical agents ("Lidocaine patches", "Capsaicin cream or patch", and "Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (e.g., diclofenac sodium 1% gel)"). Systemic options and starting doses include "APAP 500 mg q6h for a maximum of 2 g/d" and "Gabapentin 300 mg daily (starting dose) or pregabalin 50 mg b.i.d. (starting dose) (for neuropathic pain)", with the footnote "Renal dosing adjustments needed; cannot be stopped without tapering; can cause nausea, sedation, and ataxia". Opioid starts listed include "Fentanyl patch 12-μg starting dose (typically not recommended as the initial agent; avoid in patients with sarcopenia/cachexia or fever)" and "Oxycodone 2.5-mg p.o. q6–8h prn starting dose", and once comfort is the priority, "opioid medications should be titrated to meet the patient's needs without concerns for longer term impacts".

### Use of over-the-counter analgesics is not associated with acute decompensation in patients with cirrhosis [^113uSyAq]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Over-the-counter analgesics have been proposed to lead to decompensation of compensated cirrhosis or to further decompensation of an already decompensated patient. We performed a prospective, case-control study to investigate the effects of analgesics on acute hepatic decompensation.

Methods

Data from consecutive cirrhotic patients hospitalized at 2 tertiary care hospitals for decompensation of cirrhosis (cases, n = 91) were compared with that from consecutive patients with compensated cirrhosis that were followed in the liver clinic (n = 153) and with randomly selected noncirrhotic patients concurrently hospitalized with the cases (n = 89). All patients were given a structured questionnaire to collect information on recent use of acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and alcohol.

Results

Only 32 (35%) of the cirrhotic patients used over-the-counter analgesics (19% acetaminophen, 16% nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), compared with 80 of the cirrhotic controls (52%; 25% acetaminophen, 31% nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and 62 (70%) of the noncirrhotic controls. Acetaminophen use did not differ between groups, even for those with recent alcohol use. The doses and days of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use were higher among cirrhotic patients, compared with controls. Alcohol ingestion was significantly greater among patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, compared with controls.

Conclusions

In patients with cirrhosis, acetaminophen use at doses lower than those recommended is not associated with acute hepatic decompensation, even in patients with recent alcohol ingestion. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs might be associated with deleterious effects on cirrhosis. Alcohol ingestion is associated with decompensation in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^115QE87x]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Medication and immunosuppression management in pediatric HCV — In children with HCV-related advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, medications known to accelerate hepatic fibrosis (e.g., methotrexate) should be avoided, if possible. Although corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants may enhance HCV replication, they are not contraindicated in children with HCV infection, and chronic HCV infection should not delay bone marrow transplantation despite underlying liver disease being a risk factor for hepatic veno-occlusive disease. No dosage adjustments are necessary for commonly prescribed medications such as antimicrobial, antiepileptic, and cardiovascular agents. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin should be avoided, if possible, for patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices due to gastrointestinal bleeding and nephrotoxicity risks, and acetaminophen is a safe and effective analgesic for children and adolescents with chronic HCV infection when dosed per packaging recommendations.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^112kknEF]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AASLD decompensated cirrhosis — pain management emphasizes that acute pain (≤ 12 weeks) is more responsive to short-term opioid therapy than chronic pain, and optimal chronic pain management often involves multimodal, nonpharmacological approaches, including behavioral management, physical therapy, and procedural approaches. Behavioral approaches have not been specifically evaluated in patients with cirrhosis, but pain self-management programs, cognitive behavioral therapy, and physical and occupational therapy are safe and efficacious in other populations for the management of chronic pain. Procedural approaches have been largely untested in cirrhosis, but acupuncture is effective for chronic musculoskeletal pain and headache in general populations, and although there are no direct data about safety of acupuncture in patients with cirrhosis, observational studies of drug-related thrombocytopenia indicate that acupuncture is likely safe in patients with platelets > 50,000/mL, with a review evaluating potential benefits. Similarly, injections can be used for limited indications, such as knee osteoarthritis, though physical therapy remains first line. Because of impaired hepatic metabolism and the risk of precipitating encephalopathy, lower doses and less systemic therapies are generally preferred for pharmacological management of chronic pain in patients with cirrhosis. Local pharmacotherapies are generally first line for localized pain, and lidocaine patches and topical creams for localized neuropathic (e.g., capsaicin) and musculoskeletal pain (e.g., topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) are effective and have limited systemic absorption, rendering them likely safe (though untested) in persons with cirrhosis. Acetaminophen (APAP) dosing is described as up to 2 g daily (typically prescribed as 500 mg, every 6 hours, as needed).

Pain control in cirrhosis — "Opiates should generally be used at lower than standard doses and at longer dosing intervals than in the general population", and although randomized trials are lacking, "hydromorphone and fentanyl may be the preferred agents". For anxiolysis/sedation, "only short-acting benzodiazepines such as midazolam should be used". For non-opioid analgesia, "Tramadol… or acetaminophen, at a dose of no more than 2 g daily, is also recommended", whereas "routine use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which can impair renal blood flow in patients with cirrhosis", is cautioned and "oral combination products… especially when combined with an opioid, should not be used". Postoperative encephalopathy prevention includes bowel care: "Avoid constipation… ", "Polyethylene glycol solution may be used daily", and "rifaximin may be preferable… because it generally causes less bowel distention than lactulose".

Liver failure

Deciding analgesic therapy for patients with hepatic impairment can be a challenge, since most analgesics undergo hepatic metabolism. Cirrhosis is the most prevalent manifestation of liver disease, and it may be caused due to excessive alcohol intake, hepatitis infection or drug-induced toxicity. Since liver is the main site of metabolism for paracetamol, NSAIDs and opioids such as morphine, its dysfunction may lead to increased blood levels of these drugs, particularly those that are primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. On the contrary, changes in CYP enzymes may result in decreased efficacy of codeine and tramadol, which undergo biotransformation to active metabolites. Thus, a thorough understanding of the pharmacokinetic profile of analgesics may help in deciding the appropriate pharmacotherapy for patients with liver dysfunction. For instance, although paracetamol undergoes metabolic conversion to a hepatotoxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, clinically significant toxicity is observed only at large doses, and small doses of this drug may appear to be safe in such patients. Dose adjustment should be considered while administering NSAIDs and opioids to patients with hepatic impairment.

Disease-specific treatment recommendations are presented in the Supplementary materials section.

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^115Lekho]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — postoperative portal hypertension and medication safety in cirrhosis advises the following: Aggressively avoid exacerbations of portal hypertension and associated complications in the postoperative period. Appropriate measures include close monitoring of renal function and avoidance of volume excess or depletion, and Excess volume can increase the risk of variceal and other portal hypertensive bleeding. Due to disturbed metabolism and elimination, patients with cirrhosis are at especially high risk for medication-related complications; generally, use opiates at lower doses and with longer dosing intervals than in the general population, use only short-acting benzodiazepines, and Avoidance of constipation should be a priority in the management of these patients to minimize flares of hepatic encephalopathy in the postoperative period, noting that In patients who can take medications orally, rifaximin generally causes less bowel distention than nonabsorbable disaccharides (lactulose). Avoid medications that might be toxic in patients with portal hypertension and cirrhosis. Do not use NSAIDs because they can impair renal blood flow, patients with cirrhosis can be susceptible to acetaminophen toxicity at doses lower than those that may cause toxicity in the general population, and Do not prescribe combination opiate/acetaminophen pain relievers to take home after surgery because the patient may be unaware of the presence of acetaminophen in various over-the-counter products and unintentional acetaminophen overdose and hepatotoxicity can result.

### Early acetaminophen administration and mortality outcomes in critically ill patients with cirrhosis: a retrospective analysis from the MIMIC-IV database [^111zBSar]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The incidence of cirrhosis and mortality rates have continued to rise globally. Patients with cirrhosis frequently require hospitalization and ICU admission due to complications like decompensation and extrahepatic organ failure, which contribute to high short-term mortality and substantial healthcare cost. Acetaminophen is commonly used in the ICU for its analgesic and antipyretic effects. Controlled clinical trials have shown that short-term use of low-dose APAP is safe for patients with compensated cirrhosis. Additionally, a large systematic review found that APAP-induced hepatotoxicity predominantly results from accidental overdose, suggesting that standard APAP dosing may be feasible in cirrhotic patients. However, due to safety concerns, conducting clinical trials to definitively assess whether early APAP use is beneficial or harmful in cirrhotic patients remains unlikely. Therefore, we utilized real-world data to explore the relationship between early APAP use and clinical outcomes in patients with cirrhosis.

It is well-established that APAP undergoes first-pass metabolism in the liver. This process can result in the depletion of glutathione (GSH), mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and activation of apoptotic pathways, ultimately exacerbating liver tissue damage. The potential hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen, which may lead to primitive biliary cholangitis and liver failure, underscores its harmful effects in critically ill cirrhotic patients. Impaired liver function in cirrhosis reduces APAP detoxification, increasing its toxicity risk. Early APAP use was identified as an independent risk factor for mortality in critically ill cirrhotic patients, underscoring the need for cautious use after ICU admission. Markers such as lactate and SIRS may help predict 28-day mortality when used alongside APAP status. Impaired bacterial clearance in cirrhotic patients heightened their susceptibility to SIRS, which exacerbates liver function deterioration and consequently leads to higher mortality. Moreover, multiple large-scale trials have identified promising therapeutic strategies for temperature management in critically ill patients, and our results suggested that temperature management might be a promising target.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^114svRWo]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for drug-induced liver injury, more specifically with respect to patients with acetaminophen overdose (diagnosis), AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that acetaminophen is a dose-dependent hepatotoxin causing acute pericentral liver injury when doses of > 4 g are ingested within a 24-hour period or excessive doses over several days.

### What is the most appropriate dose of-acetylcysteine after massive acetaminophen overdose? [^111D2esu]. Clinical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

While the traditional intravenous N -acetylcysteine (NAC) dosing regimen works well for the vast majority of acetaminophen overdoses, there may be cases of massive overdose where additional NAC may be necessary. Recent evidence suggests that patients with acetaminophen concentrations above the "300-line" develop hepatotoxicity at a higher rate than those below the 300-line, suggesting that an increase of dose may be beneficial at this cut-off. Additional clinical data suggest a further increase in doses at the 450-line and 600-lines. I propose a strategy for step-wise increases in NAC dosing in response to high acetaminophen concentrations at the 300-, 450-, and 600-lines after acute massive acetaminophen overdoses.

CHALLENGES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN

Cirrhosis presents unique challenges in pain management. First, consensus is lacking for the management of pain, and pharmacologic options are limited. There are recommendations to limit the use of acetaminophen (≤ 2 g per day) and avoid nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)/opioids. If opioids are to be considered, expert opinion recommends weak opioids such as tramadol or hydromorphone for nociceptive pain and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or gabapentin for neuropathic pain. Efficacy data, however, are limited.

Second, virtually any pharmacologic intervention can be difficult and dangerous for patients with cirrhosis. For example, NSAIDs are used by 10%–30% of patients with cirrhosis, increasing the risk of ascites, kidney injury, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Even short‐term use of NSAIDs can be deleterious, as just five doses of 500 mg of naproxen has been correlated with decreased kidney function, decreased response to furosemide, and inhibited platelet aggregation and thromboxane B 2 production in patients with cirrhosis. Prescription rates for gabapentin have also increased severalfold. Both opioids and gabapentinoids are associated with unique harms in cirrhosis, including worse health‐related quality of life (HRQOL)and increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a frequent complication of cirrhosis that markedly increases mortality. The mechanisms for the harms of psychoactive medications are multifold. First, cirrhosis pushes toxins from the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. ammonia) that would be normally detoxified by the liver into the bloodstream. These toxins impact brain and muscle function, leading to depression, sleep disturbance, impaired physical function, and poor HRQOL. These toxins lead to a dominant inhibitory tone in the brain that is exacerbated by drugs like gabapentin and benzodiazepines. Second, because opioids prolong intestinal transit time, a key determinant of toxin translocation from the gut, increased toxin load results. Despite the fact that opioids are not thought to be efficacious in chronic noncancer painand are associated with significant side effects, as many as half of patients with cirrhosis are prescribed opioids. Opioid prescription occurs more frequently in cirrhosis than in other chronic diseasesand is associated with a higher risk of opioid‐related toxicity and overdose in patients with liver disease. Furthermore, opioids are often prescribed with benzodiazepines, compounding the risk of adverse events, including fallsand potential overdose deaths. Thus, it is imperative to select pain management modalities to improve pain control while avoiding serious complications (Figure 1). To do so, we need to better understand and characterize the mechanistic drivers of pain in cirrhosis.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^112jwbSD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Short-acting opioids — tramadol dosing and precautions include: initial oral dosage (in opioid-naïve) is 25 mg every morning; titration may increase by 25 mg per day every 3 days to 100 mg tramadol/d (25 mg every 6 hr), with subsequent increments of 50 mg/d every 3 days to 200 mg/d (50 mg every 6 hr), after which 50 to 100 mg may be given every 4 to 6 hr; maximum daily dose of tramadol is 400 mg/d, and for the combination product the maximum is 4000 mg/d APAP with 2000 mg/d APAP in chronic alcoholics or in hepatic impairment. Analgesic timing is stated as Analgesic Onset (min): < 60, Peak (min): ~120 to 180, Duration (hr): 6, and t½ (hr): 6.3 ± 1.4. In special populations, in elderly patients > 75 years give < 300 mg/d in divided doses and use caution in debilitated patients; in hepatic dysfunction decrease dosage to 50 mg once every 12 hr in patients with cirrhosis; in renal dysfunction CrCl > 30 ml/min requires no change in dose or frequency, whereas CrCl < 30 ml/min requires increasing the dosing interval to 12 hr and decreasing maximum daily dose to 200 mg; dialysis patients can receive their regular dose on the day of dialysis (< 7% of a dose is removed by hemodialysis). Other considerations note that tramadol inhibits reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine and concomitant use with MAOIS SSRIs may increase risk of seizures, serotonin syndrome; dose carefully or use another agent in patients on serotonergic agents; seizures are reported within the recommended dosage range, with increased risk above the recommended dosage range and in patient with seizure disorder, history of seizures, in conditions with increased risk of seizures, or with other drugs that increase seizure risk; observe maximum dose limits.

### Cirrhosis inpatients receive more opioids and fewer nonopioid analgesics than patients without cirrhosis [^115khvEp]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Goals/Background

Pain is common among cirrhosis patients, particularly those hospitalized with acute illness. Managing pain in this population is challenging due to concern for adverse events and lack of guidelines for analgesic use. We sought to characterize analgesic use among inpatients with cirrhosis compared with matched noncirrhosis controls, as well as hospital-level variation in prescribing patterns.

Methods

We utilized the Vizient Clinical Database, which includes clinical and billing data from hospitalizations at > 500 US academic medical centers. We identified cirrhosis patients hospitalized in 2017–2018, and a matched cohort of noncirrhosis patients. Types of analgesic given-acetaminophen (APAP), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, and adjuvants (eg, gabapentinoids, antidepressants) were defined from inpatient prescription records. Conditional logistic regression was used to associate cirrhosis diagnosis with analgesic use.

Results

Of 116,363 cirrhosis inpatients, 83% received at least 1 dose of an analgesic and 58% had regular inpatient analgesic use, rates that were clinically similar to noncirrhosis controls. Cirrhosis inpatients were half as likely to receive APAP (26% vs. 42%, P < 0.01) or NSAIDs (3% vs. 7%, P < 0.01), but were more likely to receive opioids (59% vs. 54%, P < 0.01), particularly decompensated patients (60%). There was notable variation in analgesic prescribing patterns between hospitals, especially among cirrhosis patients.

Conclusions

Analgesic use was common among inpatients, with similar rates among patients with and without cirrhosis. Cirrhosis patients-particularly decompensated patients-were less likely to receive APAP and NSAIDs and more likely to receive opioid analgesics. Because of lack of evidence-based guidance for management of cirrhosis patients with pain, providers may avoid nonopioid analgesics due to perceived risks and consequently may overutilize opioids in this high-risk population.

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^1159x4gH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity — dose thresholds, clinical course, laboratory pattern, decontamination, and outcomes are described: at the usual therapeutic dosage of up to 4,000 mg every 24 hours, APAP is widely used, but APAP-induced ALF may occur after single intentional overdose of greater than 10–15 g or unintentional ingestion of large quantities (> 10 g) over several days; patients may progress to liver failure within 72–96 hours after toxic ingestion, and laboratory studies show transaminase elevations often exceeding 3,000 U/L with coagulopathy and relatively mild hyperbilirubinemia; patients with suspected APAP hepatotoxicity should receive immediate intervention, and early gastric decontamination with 1–2 g/kg of single-dose activated charcoal is effective if administered within the first 4 hours after ingestion, with data to support administration after 4 hours with improved outcomes especially when coadministered with N-acetylcysteine (NAC); APAP-induced ALF is associated with an approximately 28% mortality rate, and up to a third of patients will require LT.

### What dose of paracetamol for older people? [^117DdNeF]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

Paracetamol, on its own or in combination with other analgesics, is widely used to treat pain associated with acute and chronic conditions. It is considered safe enough to have a general sales licence (GSL) for use by "adults, elderly and children over 16 years" and has few listed cautions or contraindications.1,2 However, recently the effectiveness and safety of paracetamol for some conditions have been challenged, 3,4 and there are published case reports of liver failure associated with therapeutic doses.5–9 Here, we review the use of paracetamol, its pharmacokinetics, the mechanisms by which it can cause liver damage and consider whether frail older people are at greater risk of adverse effects. We also discuss if dose reduction should be considered in some circumstances.

### Acetaminophen and acetylcysteine dose and duration: past, present and future [^113pTZsz]. Clinical Toxicology (2012). Low credibility.

Acetylcysteine has been utilized successfully in the treatment of acetaminophen overdose since the 1970s. Although prospective trials as to efficacy and safety of acetylcysteine were conducted, there were no randomized controlled trials. This commentary addresses the reasons for this, and the background to choice of dose of acetylcysteine utilized in the oral and IV dosing regimens. Nomograms to predict possible hepatotoxicity based upon time of ingestion of acetaminophen were developed from a relatively arbitrary definition of toxicity as an aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (ALT/AST) greater than 1000 IU/L. While these have proved generally useful, patients still continue to develop hepatic damage after acetaminophen overdose, particularly if they present late after ingestion. The optimum management of these patients remains unclear, and one area of uncertainty is the dose and duration of acetylcysteine in various circumstances. This article discusses the issues that need to be elucidated to better target changes in acetylcysteine dose. The potential for measurements of other markers to improve treatment selection is the subject of further research.

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: toward precision therapy for pain [^115qZTRF]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic therapy can be used as an adjunct or to address comorbid symptoms in the general population; however, options are very limited in patients with cirrhosis and are associated with adverse effects. Topical NSAIDs, such as diclofenac gel, or acetaminophen (500 mg every 6 h, maximum dose of 2 g per day) can be used for nociceptive pain. If necessary, opioids can be used in the short term for acute pain (e.g. hydromorphone 1 mg every 6 h as needed; oxycodone 2.5 mg by mouth every 6–8 h as needed; or fentanyl patch in select patients).TCAs (e.g. nortriptyline 10 mg nightly) can be used with caution for multiple symptoms, as well as neuropathic pain. Low‐dose SNRIs can be used for neuropathic pain or to relieve associated depression or fatigue with a small risk of hepatotoxicity. Gabapentin at low starting doses (e.g. 300 mg per day) or pregabalin (e.g. 50 mg twice per day) can relieve neuropathic pain or associated sleep difficulties or anxiety. Lidocaine patches can be used for peripheral neuropathic pain or postherpetic neuralgia. Topical capsaicin can also be used for peripheral neuropathic pain.

### Tramadol hcl and acetaminophen [^1179hZ3L]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Elderly patients (65 years of age or older) may have increased sensitivity to tramadol. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Tramadol and acetaminophen are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in patients with impaired hepatic function have not been studied. Based on information using tramadol immediate-release tablets in subjects with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, tramadol exposure was higher and half-lives of tramadol and active metabolite M1 were longer than in subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

As tramadol and acetaminophen are both extensively metabolized by the liver, the use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

8.7 Renal Impairment

The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in patients with renal impairment has not been studied. Based on studies using tramadol extended-release tablets, the excretion of tramadol and metabolite M1 is reduced in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min. In patients with creatinine clearances of less than 30 mL/min, it is recommended that the dosage of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets not exceed 2 tablets every 12 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. The total amount of tramadol and M1 removed during a 4 hour dialysis period is less than 7% of the administered dose based on studies using tramadol alone. Monitor closely for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension.

### Preventive strategies in chronic liver disease: part I. alcohol, vaccines, toxic medications and supplements, diet and exercise [^111saNtS]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Chronic liver disease is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. Hepatitis C virus infection is the most frequent cause of chronic liver disease and the most common indication for liver transplantation. Preventive care can significantly reduce the progression of liver disease. Alcohol and hepatitis C virus are synergistic in hastening the development of cirrhosis; therefore, patients with hepatitis C infection should abstain from alcohol use. Because superinfection with hepatitis A or B virus can lead to liver failure, vaccination is recommended. Potentially hepatotoxic medications should be used with caution in patients with chronic liver disease. In general, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided; acetaminophen in a dosage below 2 g per day is the safest choice. Many herbal remedies are potentially hepatotoxic, and only milk thistle can be used safely in patients who have chronic liver disease. Weight reduction and exercise can improve liver function in patients with fatty liver.

### The effect of acetaminophen (four grams a day for three consecutive days) on hepatic tests in alcoholic patients – a multicenter randomized study [^113whBEv]. BMC Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Overall, treatment of pain or fever for 3 days with acetaminophen appears safe in newly-abstinent alcoholic patients, such as those presenting for acute medical care. This study and other prospective data suggest that short-term maximal therapeutic acetaminophen dosing does not cause liver injury in alcoholics.

### Acetaminophen [^113bQRHE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hepatic Injury

Administration of acetaminophen in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of liver failure and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of acetaminophen [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. The maximum recommended daily dose of acetaminophen includes all routes of acetaminophen administration and all acetaminophen-containing products administered, including combination products.

Use caution when administering acetaminophen in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

5.2 Serious Skin Reactions

Rarely, acetaminophen may cause serious skin reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. Patients should be informed about the signs of serious skin reactions, and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.

5.3 Risk of Medication Errors

Take care when prescribing, preparing, and administering Acetaminophen Injection in order to avoid dosing errors which could result in accidental overdose and death. In particular, be careful to ensure that:

the dose in milligrams (mg) and milliliters (mL) is not confused;
the dosing is based on weight for patients under 50 kg;
infusion pumps are properly programmed; and
the total daily dose of acetaminophen from all sources does not exceed maximum daily limits [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.4 Allergy and Hypersensitivity

There have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with the use of acetaminophen. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, respiratory distress, urticaria, rash, and pruritus. There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue acetaminophen immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occur. Do not use acetaminophen in patients with acetaminophen allergy.

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^112apxvN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

APAP toxicity — N-acetylcysteine (NAC) initiation, route, and treatment endpoints are outlined: NAC is the only effective antidote for APAP hepatotoxicity, the IV form has become the preferred route of administration, and administration of NAC should begin as soon as toxicity is suspected. In patients with suspected APAP toxicity, we recommend early administration of NAC. GRADE recommendation: strong, low quality of evidence. The duration of NAC treatment should be individualized based on the patient's clinical condition and laboratory values, and continuing treatment beyond the initial protocol may be based on persistent coagulopathy (INR > 1.5) and encephalopathy. Commonly used stopping targets include improvement of INR to < 1.5; others have suggested using an ALT < 50% of peak value (or 3 consecutive values all < 1,000 IU/L), an INR < 2, and/or an undetectable APAP level. In patients with APAP overdose, we recommend single-dose activated charcoal administration if ingestion is known to have occurred within 4 hours.

### Acetylcysteine injection (acetylcysteine) [^112cCJ6B]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Maintenance Dose

Determine need for continued treatment with acetylcysteine injection after the loading dose. Choose ONE of the following based on the acetaminophen concentration:

The acetaminophen concentration is above the possible toxicity line according to the nomogram (see Figure 1):

Continue acetylcysteine injection treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of three separate doses over an infusion period of 21 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].
Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment.

The acetaminophen concentration could not be obtained:

Continue acetylcysteine injection treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of three separate doses over an infusion period of 21 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].
Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment.

For patients whose acetaminophen concentration is below the "possible" toxicity line (see Figure 1) and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion:

Discontinue acetylcysteine injection.

The acetaminophen concentration was in the non-toxic range, but time of ingestion was unknown or less than 4 hours:

Obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration and consider the patient's clinical status to decide whether or not to continue acetylcysteine injection treatment.
If there is any uncertainty as to patient's risk of developing hepatotoxicity, it is recommended to administer a complete treatment course.

Continued Therapy After Completion of Loading and Maintenance Doses

In cases of suspected massive overdose, or with concomitant ingestion of other substances, or in patients with preexisting liver disease; the absorption and/or the half-life of acetaminophen may be prolonged. In such cases, consideration should be given to the need for continued treatment with acetylcysteine injection beyond a total of three separate doses over a 21-hour infusion period.

Acetaminophen levels and ALT/AST and INR should be checked after the last maintenance dose. If acetaminophen levels are still detectable, or if the ALT/AST are still increasing or the INR remains elevated; dosing should be continued and the treating physician should contact a US regional poison center at 1–800–222–1222, alternatively, a "special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose" at 1–800–525–6115 for assistance with dosing recommendations, or 1–877–484–2700 for additional information.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in austere environments: 2024 update [^115FE9uj]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acetaminophen (APAP) for pain management — APAP, also known as paracetamol, is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic agent whose analgesic and antipyretic actions appear limited to the central nervous system and, for this reason, APAP is ineffective as an anti-inflammatory; research suggests that APAP may also act as a cannabinoid system modulator. The most commonly reported side effect is GI discomfort, and the most common severe effects are hepatotoxicity from significant overdose with hepatocellular damage and death; toxicity from a single administration < 150 mg/kg for adults or 200 mg/kg for children is rare, and care should be taken in chronic alcoholics and other patients with hepatic dysfunction where the maximum safe daily dose may not be known. APAP has the advantage of being lightweight and low bulk, is available in PO, PR, and IV formulations, and multiple studies comparing IV against PO and PR administrations have found clinical equipoise.

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: toward precision therapy for pain [^112beYqC]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment

The treatment of nociceptive pain generally involves analgesics or interventions directed at the pain source (e.g. surgery to decompress nerves, intra‐articular injections). Common analgesics, such as acetaminophen, NSAIDs (topical and oral), and opioids, are used. Topical NSAIDs treat musculoskeletal injuries with low risk. Oral NSAIDs in patients without portal hypertension, acetaminophen, or both are first‐line treatments for mild to moderate pain, based on individual patient risk factors. Muscle relaxants can be used to relieve acute low back and neck pain. Opioids, such as oxycodone or hydrocodone, may be used for acute pain that is severe or unresponsive to initial therapies; however, the recommended usage is for no more than three days given the risks of adverse effects, including complex dependency or even addiction. First‐line medications should be continued during this period.

In light of the potential for chronic pain to be mixed, as well as for peripheral nociceptive input to lead to central sensitization and nociplastic pain, the first‐line self‐directed nonpharmacologic, noninterventional therapies recommended for nociplastic pain may also be useful in patients who appear to have primarily nociceptive pain. Beginning with these treatments before considering pharmacologic agents or other interventions also aligns with the stepped method recommended for addressing chronic pain, generally.

### Hepatotoxicity associated with chronic acetaminophen administration in patients without risk factors [^116LSGy8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the literature regarding the potential of acetaminophen to cause toxicity in adult patients without risk factors, when used chronically in daily doses ≤ 4 g.

Data Sources

Key tertiary literature was reviewed, along with searches of MEDLINE (1966-July 2001). International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-May 2001), and PREMEDLINE (July Week 5, 2001). Key search terms included acetaminophen, paracetamol, toxic hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, liver dysfunction, overdose, drug toxicity, and poisoning.

Data Synthesis

Most tertiary references state that the maximum daily dose of acetaminophen is 4 g. Patients taking more than this amount, especially those with certain risk factors, are more likely to develop toxicity. However, a few patients may develop toxicity regardless of risk. An evaluation of the literature regarding the toxic potential of acetaminophen when given at doses ≤ 4 g/d chronically (≥ 4 d) to adult patients without risk factors was conducted.

Conclusions

Acetaminophen should be used cautiously on a chronic basis because several case reports show that it may be hepatotoxic at therapeutic doses.

### Opioid and benzodiazepine prescription among patients with cirrhosis compared to other forms of chronic disease [^111Vdt81]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

In a large, nationally representative database, we demonstrated that despite a propensity for adverse drug-related side effects, individuals with cirrhosis had the highest rates of opioid, benzodiazepine and dual opioid and benzodiazepine prescription. Individuals with cirrhosis are being frequently prescribed opioids, and a significant proportion of individuals with cirrhosis are being prescribed opioids at very high doses (≥ 90 OMEs). Among individuals with cirrhosis, those with alcoholic liver disease appeared to have the highest rates of benzodiazepine and dual opioid/benzodiazepine prescription, and those with HCV were most likely to have high dose opioid prescription. Overall, patterns of opioid and benzodiazepine prescription appeared to be correlated with demographic factors and comorbid conditions, with variable rates based on age, sex, geographic region and the presences of mental health conditions and other substance abuse history.

Highest rates of opioid, benzodiazepine and dual prescription in cirrhosis

In this study, we have added to the existing literature by confirming in a large, nationally representative database the very high rates of prescription opioid and benzodiazepine use in cirrhosis, occurring in one-third and one-fifth of patients, respectively. Importantly, in this study, we have been able to place these rates and patterns of prescription in context relative other comparator chronic diseases that have similarly high overall healthcare utilisation. The reasons for this discrepant patterns of prescription in cirrhosis remain largely unknown and represent an important area for future investigation. Chronic pain is a common symptom across these disease states and thus variable rates of prescription would not be anticipated to reflect the burden of symptomology. In clinical practice, there remains prevalent misconceptions regarding safety of acetaminophen among individuals with chronic liver disease, and this may in part drive higher use of alternative forms of analgesics, but this has not been definitively shown in prior studies. Additionally, this factor alone is unlikely to explain this degree of discrepancy in rates of prescriptions and thus dedicated evaluation of patient and provider perceptions and other factors influencing pain management in cirrhosis is needed. Relatedly, another important finding of note was the rates of high dose (≥ 90 OMEs) opioid prescription among patients with cirrhosis, which occurred in 29% of individuals with cirrhosis. Prevalence of high dose opioid prescription was higher in this cohort compared with a large recent VA cohort where > 100 OME occurred in 21% of patients, though the overall prevalence of opioid prescription was much higher in that VA population (77%). Given that it is well established that risk of adverse drug effects parallels OMEs, further understanding of these prescribing patterns is urgently warranted.

### The effect of acetaminophen (four grams a day for three consecutive days) on hepatic tests in alcoholic patients – a multicenter randomized study [^115eyywX]. BMC Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatic failure has been associated with reported therapeutic use of acetaminophen by alcoholic patients. The highest risk period for alcoholic patients is immediately after discontinuation of alcohol intake. This period exhibits the largest increase in CYP2E1 induction and lowest glutathione levels. Our hypothesis was that common liver tests would be unaffected by administration of the maximum recommended daily dosage of acetaminophen for 3 consecutive days to newly-abstinent alcoholic subjects.

Methods

Adult alcoholic subjects entering two alcohol detoxification centers were enrolled in a prospective double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects were randomized to acetaminophen, 4 g/day, or placebo for 3 consecutive days. The study had 95% probability of detecting a 15 IU/L difference in serum ALT.

Results

A total of 443 subjects were enrolled: 308 (258 completed) received acetaminophen and 135 subjects (114 completed) received placebo. Study groups did not differ in demographics, alcohol consumption, nutritional status or baseline laboratory assessments. The peak mean ALT activity was 57 ± 45 IU/L and 55 ± 48 IU/L in the acetaminophen and placebo groups, respectively. Subgroup analyses for subjects presenting with an elevated ALT, subjects fulfilling a diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis and subjects attaining a peak ALT greater than 200 IU/L showed no statistical difference between the acetaminophen and control groups. The one participant developing an increased international normalized ratio was in the placebo group.

Conclusion

Alcoholic patients treated with the maximum recommended daily dose of acetaminophen for 3 consecutive days did not develop increases in serum transaminase or other measures of liver injury. Treatment of pain or fever for 3 days with acetaminophen appears safe in newly-abstinent alcoholic patients, such as those presenting for acute medical care.

Continue ACETADOTE treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of either two or three separate doses over an infusion time of 20 or 21 hours, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].
Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment.

For patients whose acetaminophen concentration is below the treatment line (see Figure 1) and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion:

Discontinue ACETADOTE.

The acetaminophen concentration was in the non-toxic range, but time of ingestion was unknown or less than 4 hours:

Obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration and consider the patient's clinical status to decide whether or not to continue ACETADOTE treatment.
If there is any uncertainty as to patient's risk of developing hepatotoxicity, it is recommended to administer a complete treatment course.

Continued Therapy After Completion of Loading and Maintenance Doses

In cases of suspected massive overdose, or with concomitant ingestion of other substances, or in patients with preexisting liver disease; the absorption and/or the half-life of acetaminophen may be prolonged. In such cases, consideration should be given to the need for continued treatment with ACETADOTE beyond the total 300 mg/kg dose.

Acetaminophen levels and ALT/AST and INR should be checked after the last maintenance dose. If acetaminophen levels are still detectable, or if the ALT/AST are still increasing or the INR remains elevated; dosing should be continued and the treating physician should contact a US regional poison center at 1–800–222–1222, alternatively, a "special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose" at 1–800–525–6115 for assistance with dosing recommendations, or 1–877–484–2700 for additional information.

AASLD Practice Guidance — pruritus management in decompensated cirrhosis (DC) notes that initial treatment includes moisturizing creams, avoidance of hot baths and rubbing of the skin, minimizing use of harsh soaps and detergents, and using loose-fitting clothing and cool humidified air; antihistamines may have sedating effects or exacerbate encephalopathy and are generally not efficacious for pruritus attributable to cholestasis, though their sedating properties may help pruritus-mediated sleep disturbances. Cholestyramine was shown to be effective in randomized studies with small numbers of patients (n = 8 and n = 10), and the recommended starting dose for cholestyramine is 4 g/d, with titration up to 16 g/d as needed and tolerated. For RIF, RIF should be initiated at a quarter dose and titrated slowly to 150–300 mg twice daily with careful monitoring of liver biochemistries, and RIF should not be used in patients with bilirubin levels > 2.5 mg/dL. Naltrexone for this indication requires a low dose, starting with 12.5 mg daily and up-titrating every 3–7 days to reach the maximum dose of 50 mg/d, and naltrexone use is also often inappropriate in persons receiving opioids for pain because it can block opioid binding, thus reducing analgesia and potentially causing opioid withdrawal. Sertraline has been shown to reduce cholestatic pruritus symptoms at 75- to 100-mg doses and, because sertraline is largely metabolized in the liver, it requires careful administration, for example a starting dose of 25 mg with titration in patients with DC.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

HIV/HCV coinfection — vaccination, hepatotoxic medication limits, cirrhosis surveillance, and antiretroviral therapy are addressed as follows: acetaminophen should be limited to < 2 g/day, and HCV-infected patients should be tested for previous or concurrent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection; those without evidence of immunity to HBV should be vaccinated, and patients should be screened for immunity (HAV IgG or antibody total) and those susceptible should be vaccinated (BIII). Coinfected patients with cirrhosis are at risk of life-threatening complications and should be managed in consultation with a gastroenterologist or hepatologist; individuals with cirrhosis should undergo serial screening for HCC and some experts recommend performing ultrasonography at 6- to 12-month intervals, alfa-fetoprotein should not be the sole screening method, and HIV infection is not an absolute contraindication to liver transplantation so coinfected patients with decompensated liver disease and/or early HCC may be considered for transplantation at specialized transplant centers. Coinfected patients should be treated with ART in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents, and dose adjustment of certain ARV agents may be needed in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) — definitions for strength and quality are specified as follows. Strong recommendations are offered when the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects. Conditional recommendations are offered when trade-offs are less certain — either because of low-quality evidence or because evidence suggests that desirable and undesirable effects are closely balanced. Quality of evidence levels are defined as High: We are very confident that the true effect closely aligns with that of the estimate of the effect; Moderate: We have a moderate level of confidence in the estimate of effect. It is likely that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect; Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. The true effect may be different from the estimate of effect; and Very Low: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

### The effect of acetaminophen (four grams a day for three consecutive days) on hepatic tests in alcoholic patients – a multicenter randomized study [^11427CKr]. BMC Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Previous research by our group involving administration of acetaminophen to alcoholic subjects for 2 days supports the findings of the current study. Therapeutic acetaminophen dosing in a total of 132 subjects showed no effect on serum ALT, AST, bilirubin or INR. Recently, Bartels et al studied the administration of acetaminophen for 4 days. He also found no difference in serum glutathione S-transferase (GST), an indicator of hepatocyte enzyme release similar to ALT and AST. Although they are few, all prospective studies in alcoholic subjects to date have failed to find liver injury associated with therapeutic doses of acetaminophen.

There are limitations to the generalizability of our results. We only studied the maximal recommended daily dose of acetaminophen (4.0 g/day), so our data should not be extrapolated to either intentional or unintentional overdoses. Larson et al reported on patients entered into the Acute Liver Failure registry. Among patients with liver injury thought to be acetaminophen-related, referred to a liver service participating in the registry and fulfilling the diagnosis of acute liver failure, 51% reported therapeutic intent and 63% reported use of an acetaminophen-opioid combination drug. Most patients ingested an overdosage of acetaminophen with a mean dosage of 7.5 g/day (range 1–78 g/day). It is crucial to distinguish between ingestion of a true therapeutic dose and ingestion of an overdose despite therapeutic intent.

Our results do not apply to all alcoholic patients. By including subjects with higher aminotransferase levels than previously studied, we were able to enroll more than 95% of alcoholic volunteers screened. However, we did not study patients with decompensated alcoholic liver disease. Our results might therefore not apply to patients with liver disease severe enough to impair hepatic synthetic function.

We evaluated a 3-day course of acetaminophen therapy. As cytochrome induction wanes substantially in the first 2 days, an alcoholic patient would be expected to be at highest risk during the first day following cessation of alcohol intake. We did not study alcoholic patients that continued to ingest alcohol concurrently with acetaminophen. However, acute ingestion of alcohol inhibits rather than increases NAPQI formation, so it is unlikely that acute alcohol consumption would increase the susceptibility of alcoholic patients to liver injury. The metabolism of acetaminophen produces a protein adduct of acetaminophen composed of a cysteine residue covalently bound to acetaminophen. In the future, this assay could allow quantitation of the amount of acetaminophen actually metabolized by a patient and allow stratification and analysis of the risk of hepatotoxicity in patients receiving acetaminophen.

### Acute liver failure [^112P7dzw]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Acute liver failure is a rare and severe consequence of abrupt hepatocyte injury, and can evolve over days or weeks to a lethal outcome. A variety of insults to liver cells result in a consistent pattern of rapid-onset elevation of aminotransferases, altered mentation, and disturbed coagulation. The absence of existing liver disease distinguishes acute liver failure from decompensated cirrhosis or acute-on-chronic liver failure. Causes of acute liver failure include paracetamol toxicity, hepatic ischaemia, viral and autoimmune hepatitis, and drug-induced liver injury from prescription drugs, and herbal and dietary supplements. Diagnosis requires careful review of medications taken, and serological testing for possible viral exposure. Because of its rarity, acute liver failure has not been studied in large, randomised trials, and most treatment recommendations represent expert opinion. Improvements in management have resulted in lower mortality, although liver transplantation, used in nearly 30% of patients with acute liver failure, still provides a life-saving alternative to medical management.

Opioid selection and safety in cirrhosis — when opioids are required, "prophylactic medications should be considered proactively to prevent constipation and encephalopathy (e.g., lactulose)", and "codeine, morphine, and tramadol should generally be avoided in patients with cirrhosis". "Tramadol is often inappropriately selected for first-line use in patients with cirrhosis because of the perception that it is not an opioid", yet it "has variable pharmacokinetics across persons with cirrhosis… and has notably unpredictable side effects, including hypoglycemia". For transdermal fentanyl, "The patch comes in set doses with the lowest option of a 12-μg/h patch, which may be too high for patients with cirrhosis", and "cachexia is a relative contraindication to transdermal fentanyl", while "methadone should only be used in consultation with a specialist". "First-line opioids for patients with cirrhosis generally include low-dose hydromorphone (e.g., 1 mg p.o. or 0.4 mg i.v.) or oxycodone (e.g., 2.5 mg p.o.) with extended dosing intervals". Initiation should follow best practices: "Prescribing clinicians should adhere to best practices for risk assessment, setting patient expectations, and monitoring when starting opioids", "first-line treatment should be a 7-day supply of low-dose, short-acting opioids", and "Patients require close follow-up", with risk factors assessed such as "past opioid use disorder" and "concurrent benzodiazepine use" or other prescriptions in "prescription drug monitoring program data".

Short-acting opioids — morphine: Initial oral dosage (in opioid-naïve) is 10 to 30 mg every 4 hr. There is no optimal or maximum dose of morphine; patients on LOT are likely to become tolerant and require doses higher than the usual dosage range to maintain the desired effect. Timing parameters are Analgesic Onset (min): 30, Peak (min): 60, Duration (hr): 3 to 5, and t½ (hr): 2 to 4 in adults. In special populations, for the elderly or debilitated give with extreme caution and use a lower dose; for hepatic dysfunction use carefully in patients with cirrhosis and consider reducing dose or extending dosing interval by 1.5 to 2 times, noting half-life may be doubled (3 to 4 hr) and bioavailability is increased; and for renal dysfunction reduce dose or, if severe renal impairment exists, avoid use. Other considerations include that M6G, an active metabolite, may accumulate in renal impairment, and M3G, a metabolite without analgesic activity, may accumulate in renal impairment and has been implicated in morphine-induced neurotoxicity, hyperalgesia, and allodynia.

2.1 General Dosing Information

Acetaminophen Injection may be given as a single or repeated dose for the treatment of acute pain or fever. No dose adjustment is required when converting between oral acetaminophen and Acetaminophen Injection dosing in adults and adolescents who weigh 50 kg and above. Calculated maximum daily dose of acetaminophen is based on all routes of administration (i.e., intravenous, oral, and rectal) and all products containing acetaminophen. Exceeding the maximum mg/kg daily dose of acetaminophen as described in Tables 1 to 3 may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of liver failure and death. To avoid the risk of overdose, ensure that the total amount of acetaminophen from all routes and from all sources does not exceed the maximum recommended dose.

2.2 Recommended Dosage: Adults and Adolescents

Adults and adolescents weighing 50 kg and over: the recommended dosage of Acetaminophen Injection is 1,000 mg every 6 hours or 650 mg every 4 hours, with a maximum single-dose of Acetaminophen Injection of 1,000 mg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 4,000 mg per day (includes all routes of administration and all acetaminophen-containing products including combination products).

Adults and adolescents weighing under 50 kg: the recommended dosage of Acetaminophen Injection is 15 mg/kg every 6 hours or 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours, with a maximum single-dose of Acetaminophen Injection of 15 mg/kg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 75 mg/kg per day (includes all routes of administration and all acetaminophen-containing products including combination products).

2.3 Recommended Dosage: Children

Children 2 to 12 years of age: the recommended dosage of Acetaminophen Injection is 15 mg/kg every 6 hours or 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours, with a maximum single-dose of Acetaminophen Injection of 15 mg/kg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 75 mg/kg per day.

Non-APAP ALF — NAC and corticosteroid considerations are summarized: In patients with non-APAP ALF, we suggest the initiation of NAC. GRADE recommendation: strong, moderate quality of evidence. NAC improved transplant-free survival in nonacetaminophen ALF with early coma grade (grades I–II), with 52% in the treatment group compared with 30% in the placebo group, and a meta-analysis with 8 retrospective and 8 RCTs of 488 patients demonstrated that overall survival, posttransplant survival, and TFS were better in the NAC-treated group compared with controls. Corticosteroid therapy may be effective in patients with hypersensitivity or autoimmune features; some studies shortened the time to peak bilirubin from 17 to 12 days without difference in outcome, and others comparing prednisone dosing of 40 mg with < 40 mg showed improved survival in the low-dose prednisone group compared with controls (100% vs 91.7%; P = 0.35). Immune checkpoint inhibitor hepatitis is reported in up to 20% of those receiving therapy, and corticosteroid therapy is indicated for persistent grade 2 or any grade 3 or 4 elevation of aminotransferases or bilirubin.

### The effect of acetaminophen (four grams a day for three consecutive days) on hepatic tests in alcoholic patients – a multicenter randomized study [^1176RL8f]. BMC Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Claims of a potential acetaminophen-alcohol interaction have prompted some healthcare providers to recommend a decreased dose or complete avoidance of acetaminophen for patients who drink alcohol. If patients who drink alcohol are instructed to avoid acetaminophen altogether, they will likely use other OTC analgesics such as aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs). NSAIDs and aspirin cause significant morbidity and mortality at or near the therapeutic dosage. Precise data are not available, but it is estimated that 100,000 Americans are hospitalized and 16,000 patients die each year in the United States from gastrointestinal hemorrhage, ulcers and perforations secondary to NSAIDs and aspirin. The FDA has recognized the significance of this risk and since 1998 has mandated that OTC NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and naproxen sodium carry an alcohol warning.

The alcohol warning on all common OTC analgesics advises people who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day to consult a doctor before using these drugs. Healthcare providers are commonly faced with the question of which OTC analgesic is the safest for patients who occasionally drink alcohol as well as for those patients who are suspected or confirmed alcoholics. The answer to this question requires an assessment of the risks of each analgesic. A recent study suggested that NSAID treatment produces a tenfold increase in risk of gastrointestinal bleeding for patients within 1 week of initiating therapy. Although we did not directly compare the safety of NSAIDS to acetaminophen, we were unable to find any evidence of liver injury in "high risk" subjects ingesting acetaminophen. Acetaminophen is present in many OTC products. Inadvertent concurrent use of these products could exceed the maximum recommended dosage of 4 g/day. The relative susceptibility of alcoholic patients and other patients in doses above 4 g/day is unclear.

### The effect of acetaminophen (four grams a day for three consecutive days) on hepatic tests in alcoholic patients – a multicenter randomized study [^114vNV8U]. BMC Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

A series of post-hoc analyses were performed to explore the possibility that a subgroup of participants could have had a different response to acetaminophen administration (i.e. that a susceptible subpopulation exists). None of the analyses indicated a statistical difference between the acetaminophen and placebo groups, although some analyses had few subjects and limited power to detect a difference. The ALT stayed the same or decreased from baseline in 31% of subjects in the placebo group and 36% of subjects in the acetaminophen group. The ALT increased above baseline in 66% of participants with a maximum increase of 1–254 IU/L in the acetaminophen group and 1–158 IU/L in the placebo group. A total of 32 participants (24 acetaminophen, 8 placebo) developed an ALT greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at some point during the course of the study (Figure 2). A total of 11 subjects developed an ALT greater than 200 IU/L at some time during the study (9 acetaminophen, 2 placebo). The maximum ALT and AST measures were 312 and 448 IU/L, respectively. One subject developed coagulopathy; this subject was in the placebo group and had an INR of 1.8 on day 3. A bilirubin that exceeded the upper limit of normal at any time was found in 20 (6.4%) in the acetaminophen group and 6 (4.4%) in the placebo group.

There were 156 participants (106 acetaminophen, 50 placebo) that entered the study with a serum ALT above the ULN. The ALT group means of those with a baseline ALT greater than the ULN were consistently two to three times higher throughout the trial, regardless of group assignment (Figure 3).

To assess the effect of acetaminophen administration on participants fulfilling a case definition of alcoholic liver disease, a post-hoc analysis was performed using the 44 subjects in whom the baseline AST/ALT ratio was 2.0 or greater. The mean ALT of the group without evidence of alcoholic liver disease was significantly higher throughout the trial than the group with evidence of alcoholic liver disease; however, the acetaminophen and placebo groups were not statistically different (Figure 4). The peak ALT measure of these 44 subjects was 75 IU/L compared to 312 IU/L for the entire study sample. No subject with an AST to ALT ratio of 2.0 or greater developed an ALT more than three times the ULN or reported any study-related adverse events.

### Acetylcysteine [^114Ps9oE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.6 Recommendations for Repeated Supratherapeutic Acetaminophen Ingestion

Repeated supratherapeutic acetaminophen ingestion (RSI) is an ingestion of acetaminophen at dosages higher than those recommended for extended periods of time. The risk of hepatotoxicity and the recommendations for treatment of acute acetaminophen ingestion (i.e., the revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram) do not apply to patients with RSI.

Therefore, obtain the following information to guide Acetylcysteine injection treatment for RSI:

Acetaminophen serum or plasma concentrations. A reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy.
Laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance: AST, ALT, bilirubin, INR, creatinine, BUN, blood glucose, and electrolytes.

For specific Acetylcysteine injection dosage and administration information in patients with RSI, consider contacting your regional poison center at 1–800–222–1222, or alternatively, a special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose at 1–800–525–6115.

### Asymptomatic alanine aminotransferase elevations with therapeutic doses of acetaminophen [^114kp2NL]. Clinical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

While acetaminophen overdose has been recognized as a cause of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations for over 40 years, recent studies have reported asymptomatic ALT elevations in research subjects who are administered with therapeutic doses (4 g/d or less) of acetaminophen for more than 4 days. While the clinical course of these elevations is not completely defined, available evidence suggests that even in high risk groups the elevations are not accompanied by evidence of hepatic dysfunction and that resolve if treatment is continued. Toxicologists should consider therapeutic acetaminophen use as a cause of ALT elevation. Further study of the mechanism of ALT elevations may provide new insight into other causes of drug-induced liver injury and hepatic adaptation.

### Increased risk of acute liver failure by pain killer drugs in NAFLD: focus on nuclear receptors and their coactivators [^1112W8dt]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a global condition characterized by an accumulation of lipids in the hepatocytes. NAFLD ranges from simple steatosis, a reversible and relatively benign condition, to fibrosis with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), potentially leading to cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. NAFLD can increase the susceptibility to severe liver injury with eventual acute liver failure induced by specific hepatotoxic drugs, including acetaminophen (APAP), which is commonly used as analgesic and antipyretic. Although several animal models have been used to clarify the predisposing role of hepatic steatosis to APAP intoxication, the exact mechanism is still not clear. Here, we shed a light into the association between NAFLD and APAP toxicity by examining the peculiar role of nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-β (PGC-1β) in driving fatty acid metabolism, inflammation and mitochondria redox balance. The knowledge of the mechanism that exposes patients with NAFLD to higher risk of acute liver failure by pain killer drug is the first step to eventually claim for a reduction of the maximal diurnal dose of APAP for subjects with liver steatosis.

### Unexpected paracetamol (acetaminophen) hepatotoxicity at standard dosage in two older patients: time to rethink 1 g four times daily? [^113qDf6h]. Age and Ageing (2016). Low credibility.

We present two cases of acute hepatotoxicity associated with elevated paracetamol (acetaminophen) levels in older patients. Both patients were receiving a standard European dose of oral paracetamol (2 × 500 mg QDS) with no risk factors for slowed metabolism (weight < 50 kg, interacting medications, hepatic enzyme inducers, history of liver disease). Significantly, both patients had recently had a dose escalation from 'as needed' dosing to 4 g daily, and the medication was being administered by nursing staff. Our experience shows that even when prescribed appropriately at the usual therapeutic dosage, paracetamol can be hepatotoxic.

### Acute-on-chronic liver failure clinical guidelines [^113KZZoB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

In patients with cirrhosis and chronic liver disease, acute-on-chronic liver failure is emerging as a major cause of mortality. These guidelines indicate the preferred approach to the management of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology. The scientific evidence for these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process. In instances where the evidence was not appropriate for Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, key concept statements were developed using expert consensus. These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable and should be viewed as the preferred, but not only, approach to clinical scenarios.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 Hepatic Injury

Administration of acetaminophen in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of liver failure and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of acetaminophen [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. The maximum recommended daily dose of acetaminophen includes all routes of acetaminophen administration and all acetaminophen-containing products administered, including combination products.

Use caution when administering acetaminophen in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

5.2 Serious Skin Reactions

Rarely, acetaminophen may cause serious skin reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. Patients should be informed about the signs of serious skin reactions, and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.

5.3 Risk of Medication Errors

Take care when prescribing, preparing, and administering OFIRMEV (acetaminophen) Injection in order to avoid dosing errors which could result in accidental overdose and death. In particular, be careful to ensure that:

the dose in milligrams (mg) and milliliters (mL) is not confused;

the dosing is based on weight for patients under 50 kg;

infusion pumps are properly programmed; and

the total daily dose of acetaminophen from all sources does not exceed maximum daily limits [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.4 Allergy and Hypersensitivity

There have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with the use of acetaminophen. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, respiratory distress, urticaria, rash, and pruritus. There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue OFIRMEV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occur. Do not use OFIRMEV in patients with acetaminophen allergy.

Acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity — burden and dose relationship: In North America, APAP overdose is believed to result in 100,000 calls to poison control centers, 500,000 emergency room visits, and at least 500 deaths annually, and the annual number of ALF cases from APAP dwarfs that from all idiosyncratic reactions combined. APAP is a dose-related hepatotoxin with susceptibility to liver injury in doses only 2 to 3 times therapeutic dosing.

Patients with acute HCV infection rarely require hospitalization unless nausea and vomiting are severe; although acute liver failure is very rare (< 1%), patients with an INR > 1.5 and those with signs of acute liver failure (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy) should be immediately referred to a liver transplant center, and use of HCV antiviral regimens in acute liver failure should be managed by a clinician experienced in HCV treatment, ideally in consultation with a liver transplant specialist.

### Treating acetaminophen overdose: thresholds, costs and uncertainties [^117PRnyb]. Clinical Toxicology (2013). Low credibility.

The United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) modified the indications for N-acetylcysteine therapy of acetaminophen (paracetamol) overdose in September 2012. The new treatment threshold line was lowered to 100 mg/L (662 μmol/L) for a 4 hours acetaminophen concentration from the previous 200 mg/L (1325 μmol/L). This decision has the potential to substantially increase overall costs associated with acetaminophen overdose with unclear benefits from a marginal increase in patients protected from hepatotoxicity, fulminant hepatic failure, death, or transplant. Changing the treatment threshold for acetaminophen overdose also implies that ingestion amounts previously thought not to require acetaminophen concentration measurements would need to be revised. As a result, more individuals will be sent to hospitals in order that everyone with a predicted 4 hours concentration above the 100 mg/L line will have concentrations measured and potentially be treated with N-acetylcysteine. Before others consider adopting this new treatment guideline, formal cost-effectiveness analyses need to be performed to define the appropriate thresholds for referral and treatment.

Acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity — diagnosis and management for intentional versus unintentional overdose are contrasted by timing, dose patterns, coingestants, laboratory features, and treatments. Time course differs as "Single time point" versus "Several days of repeated use", and dosing descriptions include "Supratherapeutic (typically > 4 g over 24 h)" and "Repeated therapeutic (up to 4 g per day) or supratherapeutic dosing". Intentional cases show "24–72 h: rapid rise in ALT to > 1000 IU/L… total bilirubin is typically < 10 mg/dL" with peaks at "72–96 h", while unintentional cases are often delayed but still have a "rapid rise in ALT to > 1000 IU/L". Risk assessment states to "Use modified Rumack-Matthew nomogram to estimate risk of hepatotoxicity", whereas in repeated-use cases levels are "Often undetectable at initial presentation" and "APAP-protein adducts useful but assay not commercially available". Gastrointestinal decontamination for intentional overdose includes "Activated charcoal (1 g/kg, max dose 50 g) if within 4 h of ingestion", whereas for unintentional overdose it is "Usually not helpful nor recommended". N-acetylcysteine regimens include oral "140 mg/kg load followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 h" and intravenous dosing with "150 mg/kg load over 15–60 min, followed by 50 mg/kg (12.5 mg/kg/h)… then 100 mg/kg (6.25 mg/kg/h) over 16 h (overall total 300 mg/kg over 24 h)", with continuation "at 6.25 mg/kg/h until ALT is decreasing and INR is < 2". For acute liver failure risk, the table advises "Close monitoring in intensive care unit and consider prompt referral to a liver transplant center". Coingestants differ, with "Diphenhydramine and other sedatives" in intentional cases and "Opioids often used in combination" in unintentional cases.

### N-acetylcysteine for non-paracetamol (acetaminophen)-related acute liver failure [^114xRKbf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute liver failure is a rare and serious disease. Acute liver failure may be paracetamol-induced or non-paracetamol-induced. Acute liver failure not caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) has a poor prognosis with limited treatment options. N-acetylcysteine has been successful in treating paracetamol-induced acute liver failure and reduces the risk of needing to undergo liver transplantation. Recent randomised clinical trials have explored whether the benefit can be extrapolated to treat non-paracetamol-related acute liver failure. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 2011 guideline suggested that N-acetylcysteine could improve spontaneous survival when given during early encephalopathy stages for patients with non-paracetamol-related acute liver failure.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of N-acetylcysteine compared with placebo or no N-acetylcysteine, as an adjunct to usual care, in people with non-paracetamol-related acute liver failure.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (searched 25 June 2020), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 6) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 25 June 2020), Embase Ovid (1974 to 25 June 2020), Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS) (1982 to 25 June 2020), Science Citation Index Expanded (1900 to 25 June 2020), and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (1990 to 25 June 2020).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials that compared N-acetylcysteine at any dose or route with placebo or no intervention in participants with non-paracetamol-induced acute liver failure.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We conducted meta-analyses and presented results using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We quantified statistical heterogeneity by calculating I 2. We assessed bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and determined the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included two randomised clinical trials: one with 183 adults and one with 174 children (birth through age 17 years). We classified both trials at overall high risk of bias. One unregistered study in adults is awaiting classification while we are awaiting responses from study authors for details on trial methodology (e.g. randomisation processes). We did not meta-analyse all-cause mortality because of significant clinical heterogeneity in the two trials. For all-cause mortality at 21 days between adults receiving N-acetylcysteine versus placebo, there was inconclusive evidence of effect (N-acetylcysteine 24/81 (29.6%) versus placebo 31/92 (33.7%); RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.37; low certainty evidence). The certainty of the evidence was low due to risk of bias and imprecision. Similarly, for all-cause mortality at one year between children receiving N-acetylcysteine versus placebo, there was inconclusive evidence of effect (25/92 (27.2%) versus 17/92 (18.5%); RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.53; low certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence due to very serious imprecision. We did not meta-analyse serious adverse events and liver transplantation at one year due to incomplete reporting and clinical heterogeneity. For liver transplantation at 21 days in the trial with adults, there was inconclusive evidence of effect (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.06; low certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to serious risk of bias and imprecision. For liver transplantation at one year in the trial with children, there was inconclusive evidence of effect (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.81; low certainty of evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to very serious imprecision. There was inconclusive evidence of effect on serious adverse events in the trial with children (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.51; low certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to very serious imprecision. We did not meta-analyse non-serious adverse events due to clinical heterogeneity. There was inconclusive evidence of effect on non-serious adverse events in adults (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.45; 173 participants; low certainty of evidence) and children (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.16; 184 participants; low certainty of evidence). None of the trials reported outcomes of proportion of participants with resolution of encephalopathy and coagulopathy or health-related quality of life. The National Institute of Health in the United States funded both trials through grants. One of the trials received additional funding from two hospital foundations' grants. Pharmaceutical companies provided the study drug and matching placebo, but they did not have input into study design nor involvement in analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence is inconclusive regarding the effect of N-acetylcysteine compared with placebo or no N-acetylcysteine, as an adjunct to usual care, on mortality or transplant rate in non-paracetamol-induced acute liver failure. Current evidence does not support the guideline suggestion to use N-acetylcysteine in adults with non-paracetamol-related acute liver failure, nor the rising use observed in clinical practice. The uncertainty based on current scanty evidence warrants additional randomised clinical trials with non-paracetamol-related acute liver failure evaluating N-acetylcysteine versus placebo, as well as investigations to identify predictors of response and the optimal N-acetylcysteine dose and duration.

Initiate N-acetyl cysteine therapy if the patient already has coagulopathy and increased serum transaminases.

### National poison center calls before vs after availability of high-dose acetaminophen (paracetamol) tablets in Switzerland [^111pTSfX]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Nevertheless, the wide utilization of 1000-mg acetaminophen in Switzerland is concerning considering the ongoing debate regarding the evidence of effectiveness. A 2011 meta-analysisfound that acetaminophen has a marginal benefit compared with placebo in acute pain, and NICE recently released guidance removing acetaminophen from the list of recommended treatments for chronic pain management because of a lack of effectiveness and increased risk of harm. In addition, it has been shown that acetaminophen users were more likely to remedicate early, thereby suggesting a lack of effectiveness and a potential for unintentional poisoning.

The limited effectiveness of acetaminophen for pain, particularly chronic pain, is important to consider in light of the potential for toxic effects with large quantities reaching supratherapeutic dosages greater than the maximum daily dose of 4000 mg. While this maximum daily dose threshold is debated, with some experts recommending it be reduced to 3250 mg, the evidence of the potential for liver damage above 10 000 mg is clear. In our analysis, among calls with acetaminophen monointoxications and information on the ingested dose, we observed that the 1000-mg tablets were overrepresented among those with exposure exceeding 10 000 mg. While we did not observe differences in deaths or severe outcomes, we note that more than 90% of patients with exposure greater than 10 000 mg received the antidote, thereby minimizing the likelihood of severe negative outcomes.

The ITS analysis revealed a significant increase in the reporting of acetaminophen-related calls to the National Poison Centre within 1 year of the 1000-mg tablet being added to the market. While the total number of calls was small in comparison with the total tablets sold, particularly following 2012, these results suggest that adding a more potent formulation of acetaminophen was associated with increased harm. This result is in line with previous studies showing that reducing the available pack sizes of acetaminophen may lead to sustained reductions in the total number of poisonings. However, while Hawton and colleaguesidentified that pack size restriction legislation in the United Kingdom was associated with a decrease in acetaminophen-related deaths, they did not observe a reduction in liver transplantation registration or transplantation. Moreover, while legislation limiting prescription medications has led to changes in utilization patterns, a study by Bateman et alconcluded that legislations limiting OTC drugs were unlikely to be successful. Thus, given that the 1000-mg acetaminophen tablets are currently only available with a medical prescription, we could expect a greater impact of regulations limiting (or withdrawing) the 1000-mg tablet than in studies analyzing the impact of limiting pack sizes of the 500-mg OTC formulations.

### The effect of acetaminophen (four grams a day for three consecutive days) on hepatic tests in alcoholic patients – a multicenter randomized study [^114sk8CU]. BMC Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is a safe and effective over-the-counter (OTC) analgesic and antipyretic that has been used clinically for over 50 years. It is widely considered an appropriate first-line treatment for patients with fever, as well as for a variety of conditions causing mild to moderate pain.

Acetaminophen is used by over 50 million adults in the United States each week. Reports of hepatic failure and death following the intended therapeutic use of acetaminophen by patients who consume alcohol have been published. Some practitioners recommend that the maximum dose of acetaminophen be lowered from the current dose of 4 g/day or that acetaminophen be avoided completely in alcoholic patients. As acetaminophen is used without injury by a large number of people with a history of alcohol ingestion, the apparent overall risk appears low. A systematic review of acetaminophen use in alcoholic subjects concluded that there was little credible evidence implicating therapeutic doses of acetaminophen as a cause for fulminant hepatotoxicity in alcoholics. Nevertheless, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that the labels of non-prescription analgesic drugs, including acetaminophen products, warn patients who consume more than three alcoholic drinks daily to discuss the use of acetaminophen with their doctor.

The principal determinant of acetaminophen-induced liver injury is believed to be the reactive metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), produced primarily by CYP2E1-mediated oxidation of acetaminophen. The primary defense against the toxic actions of this metabolite is the hepatic store of reduced glutathione (GSH). Plasma GSH concentrations are thought to provide a reasonable surrogate assessment of hepatic GSH stores. Published data suggest that that the plasma GSH concentration is decreased in alcoholic subjects, particularly in those ingesting acetaminophen.

Previous research has shown that a 2-day course of acetaminophen in subjects with chronic alcoholism did not cause changes in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin or international normalized ratio (INR). It has been proposed that the 2-day course of treatment was of insufficient duration to induce hepatic injury. The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to determine if a 3-day course of acetaminophen dose (4.0 g/day) affects the serum ALT, AST or INR, and (2) to determine if the plasma concentration of reduced glutathione is affected by this acetaminophen dosing regimen.

### Acetaminophen and codeine [^117Tv9ti]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatotoxicity

Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product. The excessive intake of acetaminophen may be intentional to cause self-harm or unintentional as patients attempt to obtain more pain relief or unknowingly take other acetaminophen-containing products.

The risk of acute liver failure is higher in individuals with underlying liver disease and in individuals who ingest alcohol while taking acetaminophen.

Instruct patients to look for acetaminophen or APAP on package labels and not to use more than one product that contains acetaminophen. Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately upon ingestion of more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day, even if they feel well.

Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia

Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect (see Dependence). Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.

Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic, or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION; WARNINGS).

Management of APAP overdose

After a single‐time‐point APAP overdose, symptoms of nausea and vomiting ensue within 12–24 h, peaking at about 72 h, and resolving rapidly thereafter. The severity of necrosis is linked to the extent of excess dosing and can lead to hyperacute ALF because of its rapid onset. Administration of oral or intravenous NAC is an effective antidote, given as a loading dose followed by maintenance doses over several days. If NAC is administered within 12 h of ingestion, it virtually assures that the liver damage will be minimal. The characteristic laboratory profile of APAP hepatotoxicity includes very high aminotransferase levels with low bilirubin. The coagulopathy can be severe, and a prolonged INR is a bad prognostic sign.

Management in the early hours after an APAP overdose includes activated charcoal by ingestion or gavage, and certainly NAC, even if given more than 12 h after APAP ingestion. For unintentional cases, NAC is also given, although its efficacy may be limited. Development of signs and symptoms of liver failure (encephalopathy, primarily) are concerning, and once they are present, nearly one‐third of patients either die or require a liver transplant. The remaining patients make a full and complete recovery within 7 days.

Prognosis

Several prognostic scores have been developed and evaluated including the King's College Hospital score, Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score, and the Acute Liver Failure Study Group prognostic index. In countries in which the over‐the‐counter sale of APAP has been restricted, the incidence of serious APAP toxicity has fallen. Outcomes have also generally improved over the past two decades, likely because of improvements in intensive care, with only 8% of patients undergoing transplantation.

Guidance statements

45 APAP is a dose‐dependent hepatotoxin that leads to acute pericentral liver injury when doses exceeding 4 g are ingested within a 24‐h period or excessive doses over several days.
46 APAP overdose is the leading cause of ALF among adults in the United States.
47 A diagnosis of APAP hepatotoxicity relies on a history of excessive APAP ingestion, detection of an elevated serum APAP level following single‐time‐point ingestion, and exclusion of competing causes of acute hepatocellular liver injury.
48 Gastric lavage and activated charcoal should be given to all patients presenting within 4 h of a single‐time‐point APAP overdose.
49 Intravenous or orally administered NAC can prevent liver injury nearly completely if given within 12 h of ingestion, but is also recommended for patients presenting later.
50 The prognosis in APAP‐related ALF is related to the degree of encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and acidosis.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^112v8aUY]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acetaminophen overdose:

- Definition: Acetaminophen overdose is defined as the ingestion of a dose of acetaminophen that exceeds the recommended limit, typically > 4 g within a 24-hour period or excessive doses over several days.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of acetaminophen overdose involves its action as a dose-dependent hepatotoxin, causing acute pericentral liver injury. Acetaminophen is metabolized in the liver, and in overdose situations, its toxic metabolite can cause hepatocellular necrosis. In some cases, renal insufficiency can also occur, attributed to cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase isoenzymes present in the kidney.
- Epidemiology: In 2021, US poison control centers recorded over 80,000 cases related to acetaminophen products. The incidence of acetaminophen overdose in Iceland is estimated at 16 per 100,000 person-years.
- Disease course: Clinical manifestations of acetaminophen overdose can include symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, mental status changes. Hepatotoxicity is indicated by elevated liver enzymes, and in severe cases, it can lead to ALF, characterized by encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The severity of liver damage, as indicated by laboratory tests such as serum transaminases and coagulation profile, is a key determinant of prognosis. The prognosis in acetaminophen-related ALF is related to the degree of encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and acidosis.

### Effect of maximal daily doses of acetaminophen on the liver of alcoholic patients… [^1141Fgfb]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Acetaminophen, 1000 mg, or placebo was administered orally 4 times daily for 2 consecutive days and liver test results were monitored for 2 more days. Acetaminophen was not administered until the alcohol had been eliminated. Results. Conclusion Repeated administration of the maximum recommended daily doses of acetaminophen to long-term alcoholic patients was not associated with evidence of liver injury. Group assignments were blinded for patients, staff, and investigators. Patients received either acetaminophen purchased commercially or 2 placebo tablets in identical pill casings. Study medications were dispensed either by nursing staff or study investigator and recorded on a drug dispensing form. Patients had 24-hour nursing supervision. Patients who left the detoxification facility during the study were dropped from the trial.

After randomization, 29 subjects elected not to stay at the facility for the required 4 days. No patient withdrew from the study because of an adverse event. One patient in the study was diagnosed as having a subdural hematoma that was related to head trauma suffered prior to study enrollment. Of the 16 subjects in the acetaminophen-treated group who withdrew, 2 received a single dose, 5 received 2 to 4 doses, and 9 received 5 to 8 doses. Benson17 administered acetaminophen to patients with chronic liver disease in a prospective study. In a pilot phase, 6 patients with various types of liver cirrhosis were treated with 4 g/d of acetaminophen for 5 days. No change in the AST level was found. Subsequently, 20 patients with liver disease were randomly assigned to receive either acetaminophen or placebo for 13 days in a crossover trial.

There was no difference in the bilirubin, AST, and ALT levels or other studies between the acetaminophen-treated and placebo-treated groups. Limitations of our study include that the acetaminophen dose did not exceed the maximum therapeutic daily dose of acetaminophen and was administered for only 2 days. Therefore, our data should not be applied to supratherapeutic or overdose ingestions of acetaminophen. Our study also excluded subjects who had AST or ALT elevations greater than 120 U/L.

### Supratherapeutic dosing of acetaminophen among hospitalized patients… [^113pgNA8]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

The main outcome measures included acetaminophen exposure rate and supratherapeutic dosing rate among hospitalized patients, hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for risk factors for supratherapeutic dosing, and changes in liver function test before and after supratherapeutic dosing. Results A total of 14 411 patients were exposed to acetaminophen, of whom 955 exceeded the 4 g per day maximum recommended dose. In addition, 22. 3% of patients who were 65 years or older and
17. 6% of patients with chronic liver diseases exceeded the recommended limit of 3 g per day. A supratherapeutic dosing instance was defined as any cumulative administration of acetaminophen of more than 4 g/d. Secondary analyses of patients who were 65 years or older and patients with CLD were performed using a supratherapeutic dosing threshold of 3 g/d.
15. Of the 14 411 study patients, 955 exceeded the 4 g/d limit.

Overall, 955 of 23 750 of all hospitalized adults were exposed to supratherapeutic dosing of acetaminophen. In addition, 22. 3% of patients 65 years or older and
17. 6% of patients with CLD exceeded the recommended limit of 3 g/d. Averaged over their entire hospital stays, patients who received a supratherapeutic dosing had more administrations per day and a higher dose per administration. Almost half of the instances of supratherapeutic dosing were more than 5 g/d. Each patient who received supratherapeutic dosing had a mean of 4. 9 incidences, comprising a mean of
2. 9 days. Figure 2B demonstrates the distribution of the total number of supratherapeutic dosing days for the supratherapeutically dosed patient population. About 40% of the patients received supratherapeutic dosing for 3 days or more and 4. 0% for 10 days or more.

### Consensus-based recommendations on management of acetaminophen poisoning… [^111MhsX3]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

The recommended dose is 50 to 100 g for adults and 25 to 50 g for children. An acetaminophen concentration sample drawn before 4 hours after ingestion cannot be used to risk-stratify patients on the acetaminophen nomogram. A nondetectable concentration at 2 to 4 h after ingestion typically excludes significant ingestion, but consultation with a poison center or toxicologist is recommended. line. 9 A line beginning at 300 μg/mL at 4 hours was derived as 50% greater than the original nomogram line to denote patients and increased risk of developing liver injury. 10 Acetylcysteine should be initiated if a serum or plasma acetaminophen blood concentration drawn 4 to 24 hours after ingestion falls on or above the treatment line. If the concentration falls on or above the high-risk line, many clinicians would provide an increased dose of acetylcysteine. However, the medical literature is insufficient to allow recommendation of a specific acetylcysteine dose in this circumstance.

Objective To develop consensus guidelines for the management of acetaminophen poisoning in the US and Canada. Evidence Review. Acetylcysteine is administered orally or intravenously. The initial dose should be administered as soon as the need for treatment becomes evident. More than 15 different regimens were identified, but the comparative effectiveness of these regimens has not been evaluated. 11 The panel recommended use of a regimen that delivers at least 300 mg/kg orally or intravenously during the first 20 to 24 hours of treatment. Repeated supratherapeutic ingestion is defined as multiple ingestions for a period greater than 24 hours. Unlike the patient with acute ingestion, management is determined by the patient's presentation. If the acetaminophen concentration is greater than 20 μg/mL or the aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase level is abnormal, acetylcysteine should be administered until stopping criteria are met. If the acetaminophen concentration from samples drawn 4 to 24 hours after ingestion is above the nomogram treatment line, acetylcysteine is needed. If the concentration from samples drawn 4 to 12 hours after ingestion is below the treatment line but above 10 μg/mL, it should be measured again 4 to 6 hours after the first measurement.
