## Question

How should you adjust nph when patient is npo for surgery the next day

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to adjust NPH insulin when a patient will be NPO for surgery the next day. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overall perioperative glucose targets and the critical distinction between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Then, I should verify the evening-before and morning-of-surgery NPH dose adjustments. Next, I will confirm holding prandial insulin while NPO, set the monitoring cadence, and outline a correction strategy. After that, I need to consider when to escalate to an intravenous insulin infusion and how to transition back to subcutaneous dosing. Finally, I should plan postoperative restart, consider special populations, and emphasize documentation and team communication.

> Let me first confirm the overarching goals and constraints so I don't jump to conclusions: perioperative target glucose is typically 80–180 mg/dL, and patients with type 1 diabetes must not have basal insulin withheld because of DKA risk, whereas type 2 patients have more flexibility but still benefit from continuous basal coverage to avoid hyperglycemia and ketosis [^116ZkrXc] [^notfound].

> I will now examine the evening-before-surgery dosing question for NPH, but wait, let me verify what is guideline-based versus protocol-based: ADA guidance specifically highlights giving half of the NPH dose on the day of surgery and 75–80% of usual for long-acting analogs, while some perioperative protocols using a GIK approach reduce the evening long-acting dose by 50% the night before surgery; this supports a reasonable approach to reduce a bedtime NPH dose if used once daily to mitigate nocturnal hypoglycemia risk during fasting, with the caveat that the ADA reference centers its explicit NPH instruction on the day of surgery, not the night before [^116ZkrXc] [^115bYuSy].

> Hold on, I should verify morning-of-surgery NPH dosing since that drives immediate safety while NPO: ADA guidance explicitly recommends giving half of the usual NPH dose on the morning of surgery, and for twice-daily NPH regimens, giving half of the usual morning dose maintains basal coverage while attenuating peak-related hypoglycemia; I need to ensure basal is never fully withheld in type 1 diabetes, and if a case is very early with only one missed meal in a low-risk type 2 patient, some centers consider more aggressive morning reductions, but the safer, guideline-aligned default is the 50% NPH dose with close monitoring [^116ZkrXc] [^116ZkrXc] [^112h4xn9].

> Next, I should review prandial insulin management while NPO: short- and rapid-acting insulins should be held in the absence of carbohydrate intake to prevent hypoglycemia, with any hyperglycemia managed by correction-only dosing per protocol rather than scheduled prandial dosing until oral intake resumes [^116ZkrXc] [^113ZJis3].

> Let me consider the monitoring cadence so I don't miss trends: capillary blood glucose should be checked at least every 2–4 hours while NPO, with heightened surveillance if insulin is adjusted or if glucose is outside target ranges; this frequency aligns with ADA perioperative recommendations and facilitates timely correction for excursions [^116ZkrXc].

> I need to ensure the correction strategy is appropriate in an NPO state: use rapid-acting insulin as correction only within a basal-plus-correction framework rather than sliding-scale alone, because scheduled basal with as-needed correction achieves safer and more reliable control in noncritical settings than reactive-only approaches [^113ZJis3] [^113ZJis3].

> But wait, what if subcutaneous adjustments aren't sufficient or surgery is prolonged? For anticipated prolonged fasting, poor preoperative control, difficulty maintaining targets, or type 1 diabetes with elevated ketosis risk, consider an intravenous insulin infusion in a monitored setting, recognizing the risks of hypoglycemia and transition-related errors; when a VRIII is used, run appropriate dextrose-containing fluids and institute hourly glucose checks to maintain safe ranges and avoid rebound hyperglycemia or ketosis [^112h4xn9] [^112m1EAN].

> Hold on, I should verify the transition back to subcutaneous insulin so there's no insulin gap: when converting from a VRIII back to subcutaneous insulin, overlap the infusion for 30–60 minutes after the subcutaneous dose is given, and time the transition with a meal whenever feasible to reduce the risk of rebound hyperglycemia or DKA in type 1 diabetes [^115QPMa4].

> Let me think about postoperative restart of NPH to avoid both under- and over-treatment: resume the patient's usual basal regimen when oral intake is reliable, but be prepared to adjust for stress, infection, or altered nutrition; involve the diabetes team if glucose persistently lies outside target ranges, and remember that basal-bolus strategies are preferred over sliding scale in hospitalized noncritical patients [^115QPMa4] [^113ZJis3].

> I should double-check special populations because fixed percentage rules can be misleading: although the earlier reasoning suggested an additional 25–30% NPH reduction for eGFR below 50 mL/min, I need to be cautious — renal impairment increases hypoglycemia risk and usually warrants individualized down-titration and closer monitoring rather than a single fixed decrement; in frail or elderly patients, more conservative basal doses with tighter surveillance are prudent, and in type 1 diabetes, basal must never be completely withheld even when intake is uncertain [^112h4xn9].

> Let me verify safety and communication steps so errors don't undermine the plan: insulin is a top high-risk medication perioperatively, so documenting the exact perioperative insulin plan, communicating it across anesthesia, surgery, and nursing teams, and specifying monitoring and transition criteria are essential to prevent hypoglycemia, ketosis on cessation of VRIII, and medication errors during handoffs [^112m1EAN] [^116pbNNB].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially conflated "a 20–30% reduction" with "give 75–80% of usual" for long-acting analogs and assumed the same construct universally applied to NPH the night before; let me reconsider and reconcile: ADA's explicit statement is to give half the NPH dose on the day of surgery and to give 75–80% of long-acting analog or pump basal, while a 50% evening reduction appears in specific perioperative protocols such as GIK, so the most defensible, reference-aligned approach is 50% of NPH on the morning of surgery, consider a prudent evening reduction if once-daily NPH is given at bedtime, and otherwise individualize based on diabetes type, fasting duration, and monitoring capacity [^116ZkrXc] [^115bYuSy].

Reduce NPH insulin to **50% of the usual dose** [^116ZkrXc] on the morning of surgery when the patient is NPO [^116ZkrXc]. This balances hypoglycemia risk from fasting with the need for basal insulin to prevent hyperglycemia and ketosis [^112h4xn9]. Monitor blood glucose **every 2–4 hours** [^116ZkrXc] perioperatively; use rapid-acting insulin for correction if needed [^113ZJis3], and resume the usual regimen when oral intake is tolerated [^115QPMa4] [^notfound].

---

## Rationale for adjusting NPH insulin

NPH insulin has a **peak effect at 4–6 hours** and a duration of 12–16 hours, which increases hypoglycemia risk during fasting [^112acZtU]. Reducing the dose mitigates this risk while maintaining basal insulin to prevent hyperglycemia and ketosis [^112wYwRV].

---

## Recommended adjustment of NPH insulin dose

Give the usual evening NPH dose the **evening before surgery** [^112QZi8M] and 50% of the usual morning NPH dose on the **morning of surgery** [^116ZkrXc] [^112K77AP]. This approach **balances hypoglycemia risk** with the need for basal insulin [^112h4xn9].

---

## Monitoring and management during the perioperative period

- **Blood glucose monitoring**: Check every 2–4 hours while NPO [^116ZkrXc] [^113ZJis3].
- **Correction insulin**: Use rapid-acting insulin for hyperglycemia as needed [^116ZkrXc] [^113ZJis3].
- **Hypoglycemia management**: Treat promptly with IV dextrose if glucose < 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) [^1135fvsi].

---

## Resumption of usual insulin regimen postoperatively

Postoperatively, once **oral intake resumes**, restart the usual insulin regimen when the patient can eat and drink without nausea or vomiting, and **adjust insulin doses** based on postoperative glucose trends and intake [^115QPMa4] [^116cFsPm].

---

## Special considerations

In **type 1 diabetes**, always provide basal insulin to prevent DKA [^112h4xn9]; in **type 2 diabetes**, individualize adjustments based on insulin sensitivity and hypoglycemia risk [^113ZJis3].

---

## Summary table: perioperative NPH insulin management

| **Time period** | **NPH insulin dose** | **Monitoring** | **Additional management** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Evening before surgery | Usual dose | ∅ | ∅ |
| Morning of surgery | 50% of usual dose | ∅ | ∅ |
| Perioperative period | ∅ | Every 2–4 hours | Rapid-acting insulin for correction |
| Postoperative period | Resume usual regimen when oral intake tolerated | ∅ | Adjust doses based on glucose trends |

---

Reduce NPH insulin to **50%** on the morning of surgery to balance hypoglycemia risk with basal insulin needs. Monitor glucose every 2–4 hours; use rapid-acting insulin for correction as needed, and resume the usual regimen when oral intake is tolerated [^112K77AP].

When transferring from a variable-rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII) back to oral treatment or subcutaneous insulin, if the patient has type 1 diabetes and a VRIII has been used, it must be continued for 30–60 minutes after the patient has had their subcutaneous insulin. Premature discontinuation is associated with iatrogenic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

- **Restarting oral hypoglycaemic medication**: Oral hypoglycaemic agents should be recommenced at pre-operative doses once the patient is ready to eat and drink. Withholding or reduction in sulphonylureas may be required if food intake is likely to be reduced. Metformin should only be restarted if the estimated glomerular filtration rate exceeds 50 ml.min−1.1.73 m−2.

- **Restarting subcutaneous insulin for patients already established on insulin**: Conversion to subcutaneous insulin should commence once the patient is able to eat and drink without nausea or vomiting. The pre-surgical regimen should be restarted but may require adjustment because the insulin requirement may change as a result of postoperative stress, infection, or altered food intake. The diabetes specialist team should be consulted if blood glucose levels are outside the acceptable range (6–12 mmol.l−1) or if a change in diabetes management is required.

The transition from intravenous to subcutaneous insulin should take place when the next meal-related subcutaneous insulin dose is due, for example, with breakfast or lunch.

For the patient on basal and bolus insulin, there should be an overlap between the end of the VRIII and the first injection of subcutaneous insulin, which should be given with a meal.

### Near-miss hypoglycemia: Reflections on perioperative glucose management guidelines in diabetics [^116ZkrXc]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Low credibility.

The "Standard of Medical Care in Diabetes" from the American Diabetes Association (ADA), updated in 2021, provides the following seven clinical practice recommendations and guidelines:

- **Target range for blood glucose**: The range in the perioperative period should be 80–180 mg/dL (4.4–10.0 mmol/L).
- **Preoperative risk assessment**: This should be performed for patients with diabetes who are at high risk for ischemic heart disease and those with autonomic neuropathy or renal failure.
- **Metformin**: It should be withheld on the day of surgery.
- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: These must be discontinued 3–4 days before surgery.
- **Oral glucose lowering agents**: Withhold any such agents the morning of surgery or procedure and give half of NPH dose or 75–80% doses of long-acting analog or pump basal insulin.
- **Blood glucose monitoring**: Monitor at least every 2–4 hours while the patient is taking nothing by mouth and dose with short- or rapid-acting insulin as needed.
- **Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and ultra-long-acting insulin analogs**: There are no data on their use and/or influence upon glycemia in perioperative care.

The pump basal infusion of our patient could have been reduced to 75% of baseline as per the fifth ADA guideline instead of being discontinued. This approach would have likely attenuated the hyperglycemia and possibly the hypoglycemia from overcorrection with insulin. It is important to remember that guidelines are just recommendations and that case-specific circumstances are paramount. In our case, a repeat glucose measurement after 1.5 hours was not frequent enough for that particular set of circumstances, despite the sixth ADA guideline timeline.

### Current practice in the perioperative management of patients with diabetes mellitus: A narrative review [^112QZi8M]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Low credibility.

Guidelines differ somewhat in insulin dose adjustments before surgery for patients using multiple daily injections of insulin, and these guidelines are summarized in Table 2. Most guidelines recommend reducing the long-acting insulin dose the day before and the day of surgery by 20–30%, depending on the timing of insulin and whether it is used once or twice daily. For premixed and short-acting insulin, there are usually no dose adjustments required the day before surgery. On the day of surgery, most guidelines recommend halving the dose for premixed insulins and withholding short-acting insulins without meals.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) has been a mainstay of treatment in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) for many years, with approximately 15% of patients using it. It delivers a fixed hourly rate of a rapid-acting insulin analogue, which acts as a patient's basal insulin. To supplement this, patients can administer bolus doses of insulin to match their carbohydrate intake. CSII offers improved glycemic control over multiple daily injections of insulin and a lower risk of hypoglycemia. A retrospective observational study demonstrated that patients with T1DM maintain lower hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values on CSII over a 1–10-year period compared to pre-CSII values. The CPOC recommends that patients continue their CSII in the perioperative period, provided they have a short fasting time (no more than one missed meal). It is believed that CSII is safer as it avoids the potential risks associated with variable rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII). Of note, most insulin pumps have not been developed for the perioperative setting, and dislocation of the pump or interactions with other devices can present challenges.

### Symlinpen [^1142A25B]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Proper patient selection is critical to the safe and effective use of Symlin. Before initiating Symlin, the patient's HbA1c, recent blood glucose monitoring data, history of insulin-induced hypoglycemia, insulin regimen, and body weight should be reviewed. Symlin therapy should only be considered in patients with type 1 diabetes or patients with type 2 diabetes using mealtime insulin who fulfill the following criteria: they have failed to achieve adequate glycemic control despite individualized insulin management and are receiving ongoing care under the guidance of a healthcare professional skilled in the use of insulin and supported by the services of diabetes educator(s).

- **Patients not suitable for Symlin therapy**:
	- Poor compliance with insulin regimen.
	- Poor compliance with prescribed self blood glucose monitoring.
	- HbA1c > 9%.
	- Severe hypoglycemia requiring assistance during the past 6 months.
	- Presence of hypoglycemia unawareness.
	- Confirmed diagnosis of gastroparesis.
	- Requirement of drugs that stimulate gastrointestinal motility.
	- Pediatric patients.

Symlin should be prescribed with caution to persons with visual or dexterity impairment.

Symlin alone does not cause hypoglycemia. However, Symlin is indicated to be coadministered with mealtime insulin therapy, and in this setting, there is an increased risk of severe hypoglycemia, particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes. If severe hypoglycemia associated with Symlin occurs, it is usually seen within th- [content incomplete].

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^111xVEMh]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of diabetes mellitus type 1, specifically in relation to hypoglycemia management, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend prescribing glucagon to all patients taking insulin or at high risk for hypoglycemia. It is essential that family members, caregivers, school personnel, and others providing support to these patients are aware of the glucagon's location and are educated on how to administer it. The guidelines prefer glucagon preparations that do not require reconstitution.

### Be-smart (basal early strategies to maximize HbA1c reduction with oral therapy): Expert opinion [^11671ErK]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Basal insulin should be injected at the appropriate time, usually at bedtime, in line with the prescribing information. In some circumstances, such as administration by caregivers or for nursing home residents, basal insulin may also be administered in the morning or afternoon, preferably at the same time daily.

Basal insulin analogues offer the advantage of flexible timing, making administration simple and less intrusive. They require only one injection per day and do not demand adherence to inflexible meal patterns, quantities, or composition. For Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, the preferred injection time is bedtime.

- **First-generation basal insulin analogues**: Both Gla-100 and Insulin Detemir are best administered at bedtime. Insulin glargine can be administered at any time each day, irrespective of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels.

- **Second-generation basal insulin analogues**: Insulin Degludec and Gla-300 offer more flexibility in the timing of injection and can be administered at any time of the day, provided they are administered at the same time each day.

If a dose of basal insulin is missed, it can be redressed by immediately administering the dose, ensuring a gap of at least 8 hours between injections. After taking this dose, the patient can return to their regular dosing schedule.

### Peri-operative management of the surgical patient with diabetes 2015: Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland [^11636UrF]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Management of existing therapy

With appropriate guidance, patients with diabetes should be allowed to retain control and possession of, and continue to self-administer, their medication. Many patients will have several years' experience and be expert in self-medication. The aim is to avoid hypo- or hyperglycaemia during the period of fasting and the time during and after the procedure, until the patient is eating and drinking normally.

For people likely to miss only one meal, this can often be achieved by manipulating the patient's normal medication using the guidance provided. Glycaemic control in patients with diabetes is a balance between their carbohydrate intake and utilisation, such as through exercise. It also depends on what medication they take and how those medications work.

- **Short starvation period (no more than one missed meal)**: Some agents, like sulphonylureas, meglitinides, insulin, and to some extent thiazolidinediones, act by lowering glucose concentrations. Doses need to be modified or the agents stopped during periods of starvation. Others work by preventing glucose levels from rising, such as metformin, glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and may be continued without the risk of hypoglycaemia. The time of day and the expected duration of the operation need to be considered.

### The basis for weekly insulin therapy: Evolving evidence with insulin icodec and insulin efsitora alfa [^111GSJXY]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

- **Management during hospitalization, fasting, and exercise**: During hospitalization and for surgeries, patients and healthcare providers need to consider the implications of using ultra-long-acting basal insulin. These concerns were evident when Ultralente was first introduced and later during the development of IDeg, which currently is the once-daily basal insulin with the longest half-life. Although not often realized in clinical practice, these concerns remain relevant for every new long-acting basal insulin, including once-weekly insulins. To the best of our knowledge, no specific reports exist about study participants admitted to hospitals while using these once-weekly insulins during phase 2 or 3 studies. Protocols from the phase 3 program regarding how these common clinical situations were managed should offer some insights, but dedicated hospital studies and real-world experience will truly inform clinical practice. As discussed earlier, research is currently evaluating the effects of efsitora compared to IGlar on the frequency and severity of hypoglycemia in situations where such risk increases, like exercise and fasting (NCT identifier NCT04957914), but no data are available at the time of this writing.

In the opinion of the authors, patients hospitalized for protracted illnesses and those requiring a steady source of enteral or parenteral nutrition might theoretically benefit from continuing once-weekly basal insulin if they were already using it and were at steady state prior to admission.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypoglycemia, particularly for patients with post-bariatric hypoglycemia, the general principles outlined in the EASO 2017 guidelines recommend continuing basal insulin at discharge for patients who still require insulin during their postoperative hospital stay. This approach should include strict glucose monitoring and the tapering of insulin units to avoid hypoglycemia.

### Practical recommendations of the obesity management task force of the European Association for the Study of Obesity for the post-bariatric surgery medical management [^117BXdg7]. Obesity Facts (2017). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypoglycemia, more specifically with respect to patients with post-bariatric hypoglycemia, general principles from the EASO 2017 guidelines recommend directing treatment in the first 7–10 days after surgery toward fasting glucose values. Patients are instructed to test blood glucose at least BID — fast in the morning (target values: 100–120 mg/dL) and during the day (< 180 mg/dL 2 hours following a meal).

### Peri-operative management of the surgical patient with diabetes 2015: Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland [^116pbNNB]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Pre-operative assessment:

Appropriate and early pre-operative assessment should be arranged. A pre-operative assessment nurse may undertake the assessment with support from either an anaesthetist or a diabetes specialist nurse. It should occur sufficiently in advance of the planned surgery to ensure optimisation of glycaemic control before the date of proposed surgery. The aim is to ensure that all relevant investigations are available and checked in advance of the planned surgery, that the patient understands how to manage his/her diabetes in the peri-operative period, and that the period of pre-operative fasting is minimised.

- **Recommendation**: Tests should be ordered to assess co-morbidities in line with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on pre-operative testing. This should include urea and electrolytes and ECG for all patients with diabetes; however, a random blood glucose measurement is not indicated.

Planning admission (including day surgery):

The aim is to minimise the fasting period, ensure normoglycaemia (capillary blood glucose (CBG) 6–10 mmol.l −1), and minimise as far as possible disruption to the patient's usual routine. Ideally, the patient should be booked first on the operating list to minimise the period of fasting. If the fasting period is expected to be limited to one missed meal, the patient can be managed by modification of his/her usual diabetes medication. Patients should be provided with written instructions from the pre-operative assessment team about management of their diabetes medication on the day of surgery.

### Peri-operative management of the surgical patient with diabetes 2015: Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland [^112m1EAN]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Errors in insulin prescribing are common, and insulin has been identified as one of the top five high‐risk medications in the inpatient environment. The wide range of preparations and devices available for insulin administration (currently > 60) increases the potential for error. One-third of all inpatient medical errors leading to death within 48 hours of the error involve insulin administration. Common errors include mistakes when abbreviating the word "units", failure to use a specific insulin syringe, and errors when preparing insulin infusions. The use of pre-filled syringes of insulin for infusion may reduce the risk and should be considered by Trusts.

- **Safe use of VRIIs**: Variable-rate intravenous insulin infusions are over-used in the peri-operative setting. Their use is associated with hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, ketosis on cessation, and hyponatremia. There seems to be a significant risk of hypoglycemia in patients with a capillary blood glucose (CBG) of 4–6 mmol/L and on a VRIII. Patients often return to surgical wards from the theater with an intravenous insulin infusion in place but no directions for its withdrawal. Hospitals should have written guidelines for both the safe use of the VRIII and conversion from the VRIII to the usual diabetes treatment.

To ensure a steady supply of substrate, it is recommended that glucose 5% in saline 0.45% with potassium chloride 0.15% or 0.3% should be administered concurrently with the VRIII, at a rate to meet the patient's maintenance fluid requirements. It is imperative that there is hourly monitoring of the CBG to keep the CBG at 6–10 mmol/L.

### Diabetes: Have we got it all wrong? Hyperinsulinism as the culprit: Surgery provides the evidence [^114yGAZC]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Exploring the hyperinsulinemia of T2DM, there are at least three possible explanations for the excessive basal insulin secretion in T2DM that seem reasonable. Insulin secretion is elevated: 1) as a feedback mechanism to overcome insulin resistance, 2) in response to changes in plasma glucose or plasma free fatty acids, or 3) in response to a signal from the gut. Since the only intervention with bariatric surgery is imposed on the gut, the third explanation seems most plausible and forms the basis of a new hypothesis that will be discussed later.

To investigate if fasting insulin is reduced after gastric bypass surgery because of changes in glucose, free fatty acids, and/or insulin resistance, the values for fasting insulin from our study mentioned above are plotted against values for glucose, NEFA, and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) (Fig. 4 A–C).

- **Correlations of fasting insulin**: Fasting insulin was correlated with fasting plasma glucose (A), fasting plasma free fatty acids (NEFAs) (B), and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) (C). Fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and ISI were previously reported. Group symbols: square = lean control group; triangle = obese (nondiabetic) group; circle = diabetic group.

	- **Time symbols**: Black square, triangle, and circle = presurgery; white triangle and circle = week of surgery; gray triangle and circle = 3 months postsurgery.
	- **Group labels**: L = lean control group; OB = obese (nondiabetic) group before surgery; DB = diabetic (obese) group before surgery; OA = obese group after surgery; DA = diabetic group after surgery. wk, week; mos, months.

In agreement with many other reports, prior to surgery.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^113ZJis3]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of in-hospital hyperglycemia, particularly in relation to insulin therapy, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend preferring basal insulin or a basal plus bolus correction insulin plan for the treatment of non-critically ill hospitalized patients with poor or no oral intake.

### Immediate preoperative hyperglycemia correlates with complications in non-cardiac surgical cases [^1177eZCN]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2021). Low credibility.

These prior studies, like our own, could not determine whether treatment of hyperglycemia will be beneficial or detrimental. Some previous studies in both surgical and non-surgical populations have shown that attempts at tight blood glucose control can perversely worsen outcomes, presumably by causing dangerous hypoglycemia. However, other studies indicate that coordinated preoperative care for diabetes by a clinical program focused on controlling glucose before and after surgery can reduce antibiotic use 24 hours after surgery and reduce hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes. Nonetheless, future research should focus on whether treating hyperglycemia — using insulin immediately pre-procedure to bring serum glucose levels below threshold values such as 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) or 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) — can change the risk of postoperative complications, or if preoperative hyperglycemia is simply a marker of unmodifiable risk.

Our study has many limitations, the most significant of which are that:

1. There was no standardized procedure for determining from which patients a serum, plasma, or whole blood glucose concentration would be obtained.
2. The vast majority of elective surgical patients at our institution did not have an immediate preoperative glucose level available (n = 41,216).
3. We could not evaluate whether attempts were made to control hyperglycemia pre-, intra-, or postoperatively.

We were also unable to obtain data on other important risk factors for infection or complication, such as intraoperative hypothermia or specific type of procedure.

### Insulin injections in relation to meals in the hospital medicine ward: comparison of 2 protocols [^1162mCxP]. Endocrine Practice (2011). High credibility.

To investigate whether changing the prandial regular insulin to a rapid-acting insulin analogue in hospital medicine wards improves the timing of insulin delivery in relation to meals and enhances patient safety and glucose control, an open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted in type 2 diabetic patients. Insulin lispro with meals and basal insulin glargine (intervention) was compared with regular insulin before meals and basal neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin twice daily (control).

The primary endpoint was the rate of targeted timing of insulin to meals (target time). In the intervention group, target time was defined as insulin administered from 15 minutes before to 15 minutes after the patient started a meal. For the control group, target time was defined as insulin administered from 30 minutes before to 30 minutes after the patient started a meal. Hypoglycemic, hyperglycemic, and severe hyperglycemic patient-days were also compared between the groups.

Twenty-seven patients in the intervention group and thirty-three patients in the control group were studied. The percentage of times that the insulin was given within target time was significantly higher in the intervention group as a whole (88.9% vs. 70.1%, P < .001) and was higher for lunch and the evening meal (90% vs. 66.7% and 94.7% vs. 70.1%, P < .001). The rate of hypoglycemia was lower in the intervention group (1.85% vs. 15%, P < .001). The rate of hyperglycemia was similar in both groups (68.2% vs. 59.8%, P = 0.224), but the intervention group had a higher rate of severe hyperglycemia (28.9% vs. 12.9%, P = 0.003).

### Insulin therapy for type 2 diabetes: rescue, augmentation, and replacement of beta-cell function [^114Cvv4p]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is characterized by progressive beta-cell failure. Indications for exogenous insulin therapy in patients with this condition include acute illness or surgery, pregnancy, glucose toxicity, contraindications to or failure to achieve goals with oral antidiabetic medications, and a need for flexible therapy. Augmentation therapy with basal insulin is useful if some beta-cell function remains. Replacement therapy with basal-bolus insulin is required for beta-cell exhaustion. Rescue therapy using replacement regimens for several weeks may reverse glucose toxicity. Replacement insulin therapy should mimic normal release patterns.

- **Basal insulin therapy**: Uses long-acting insulins (i.e. neutral protamine Hagedorn [NPH], ultralente, glargine), which are injected once or twice a day and continued on sick days.

- **Bolus (or mealtime) insulin**: Utilizes short-acting or rapid-acting insulins (i.e. regular, aspart, lispro) to cover mealtime carbohydrates and correct glucose levels.

The starting dose of 0.15 units per kg per day for augmentation or 0.5 units per kg per day for replacement can be increased as needed. About 50 to 60 percent of the total daily insulin requirement should be a basal type, and 40 to 50 percent should be a bolus type. The mealtime dose is the sum of the corrective dose plus the anticipated requirements for the meal and exercise. Adjustments should be made systematically, starting with fasting, then preprandial, and finally, postprandial glucose levels. Basal therapy with glargine insulin provides similar to lower A1C levels with less…

### SPL drug information for insulin glargine [^1111PdvU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of insulin glargine SC (also known as Lantus, Toujeo, Toujeo MAX) in patients with intermittent hemodialysis:

- **Dose adjustments**: Reduce dose. Reduce dose by 50%. Dose adjustments should generally follow the indication-specific recommendations as described in the adult dosing section but titrated more gradually. In patients experiencing hypoglycemia, consider more aggressive dose reductions (e.g. by 25% to 40%) depending on severity.

### Assessment of the mixing efficiency of neutral protamine Hagedorn cartridges [^116jxJqj]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2010). Low credibility.

Reliable application of neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin requires prior resuspension of the suspension by tipping over the cartridge 20 times. This procedure is considered annoying by patients. The goal of this investigation was to assess the efficiency of the mixing procedure when performed less frequently than recommended. Neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin cartridges from five different manufacturers (Sanofi-Aventis, Lilly, Berlin-Chemie, B. Braun, and Novo Nordisk) were emptied with doses of 28 IU in the morning and the evening over 5 days.

While the first dose was obtained following a regular resuspension procedure (20x tipping over), the consecutive doses were obtained after 3, 6, 10, or 20 mixing procedures (12 cartridges per experimental series, two doses/day). Insulin concentrations of doses 1, 2, 6, and 10 were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Between dosing, cartridges were stored at room temperature in a horizontal position. Comparable insulin concentrations were seen in the first correctly prepared doses.

Pronounced and substantial deviations from the selected dose were observed with most of the cartridges, in particular when resuspending only 3 and 6 times. Mean absolute percentage deviations when tipping 3 times and maximally observed overdoses were: Insuman Basal: 1.1% ± 1.0/4 IU, Humulin N: 2.6% ± 3.4/19 IU, Berlinsulin H Basal: 4.4% ± 6.0/26 IU, Insulin B. Braun Basal: 10.4% ± 8.9/38 IU, and Protaphane: 4.7% ± 4.1/19 IU (all p < 0.05 vs. Insuman Basal). Only one cartridge with three metal mixing bullets (Sanofi-Aventis) was tested.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^114Sjo19]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, specifically with respect to insulin therapy and delivery systems, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend offering insulin pump therapy, preferably with continuous glucose monitoring. This is advised for young and adult patients with T2DM who are on multiple daily injections and able to use the device safely, either independently or with a caregiver. Decisions on the choice of the device should be based on the patient's circumstances, preferences, and needs.

### Dantrium [^115fMnuM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2006). Low credibility.

The following gradual titration schedule is suggested for **pediatric patients**. Some patients will not respond until a higher daily dosage is achieved. Each dosage level should be maintained for seven days to determine the patient's response. If no further benefit is observed at the next higher dose, the dosage should be decreased to the previous lower dose:

- 0.5 mg/kg once daily for seven days, then
- 0.5 mg/kg t.i.d. for seven days
- 1 mg/kg t.i.d. for seven days
- 2 mg/kg t.i.d.

Therapy with a dose four times daily may be necessary for some individuals. However, doses higher than 100 mg four times daily should not be used (see Box Warning).

- **For malignant hyperthermia**:

- **Preoperatively**: Administer 4 to 8 mg/kg/day of oral Dantrium in three or four divided doses for one or two days prior to surgery, with the last dose given approximately three to four hours before scheduled surgery with a minimum of water.

This dosage is usually associated with skeletal muscle weakness and sedation (sleepiness or drowsiness). Adjustments can typically be made within the recommended dosage range to avoid incapacitation or excessive gastrointestinal irritation (including nausea and/or vomiting).

- **Post crisis follow-up**: Oral Dantrium should also be administered following a malignant hyperthermia crisis, in doses of 4 to 8 mg/kg per day in four divided doses, for a one to three-day period to prevent recurrence of the manifestations of malignant hyperthermia.

### Peri-operative management of the surgical patient with diabetes 2015: Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland [^117STmYb]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Management of intra-operative hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia

If the capillary blood glucose (CBG) exceeds 12 mmol.l −1 and insulin has been omitted, capillary blood ketone levels should be measured if possible, using point‐of‐care devices. If the capillary blood ketones are > 3 mmol.l −1 or there is significant ketonuria (> 2+ on urine sticks), the patient should be treated as having diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Diabetic ketoacidosis is a triad of ketonaemia > 3.0 mmol.l −1, blood glucose > 11.0 mmol.l −1, and bicarbonate < 15.0 mmol.l −1 or venous pH < 7.3. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency, and specialist help should be obtained from the diabetes team.

If DKA is not present, the high blood glucose should be corrected using subcutaneous insulin or by altering the rate of the variable rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII), if in use. If two subcutaneous insulin doses do not work, a VRIII should be started.

- **Sent case**: Treatment of hyperglycaemia in a patient with type-1 diabetes. Subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin (such as Novorapid ®, Humalog ®, or Apidra ®) should be given, up to a maximum of 6 IU, using a specific insulin syringe, assuming that 1 IU will drop the CBG by 3 mmol.l −1. Death or severe harm as a result of maladministration of insulin, including failure to use the specific insulin syringe, is a 'Never Event'. If the patient is awake, it is important to ensure that the patient is content with the proposed dose, as patients may react differently to subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin. The CBG should be checked hourly, and a second dose should be considered only after 2 hours.

### Misled by the morning "fasting" plasma glucose [^115Tym4f]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2015). Low credibility.

Due to its ease and simplicity of measurement, the morning fasting plasma glucose (FPG) has been used as a surrogate marker for the entire basal day when titrating once-nightly basal insulin. This is common in obese, insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes, where late and large evening meals elevate the FPG, leading to dosing of basal insulin beyond the actual basal requirements. This contributes to hypoglycemia and weight gain associated with this therapy. It is recommended that during basal insulin titration, the evening meal be limited and hypoglycemia be monitored early in the morning. This is the bewitching time when the "peakless" basal insulin's action is peaking, and the pre-dawn phenomenon of increased insulin sensitivity is observed.

### Improved glycaemic control by switching from insulin NPH to insulin glargine: a retrospective observational study [^116yxJST]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2009). Low credibility.

Insulin glargine (glargine) and insulin NPH (NPH) are two basal insulin treatments. This study investigated the effect on glycaemic control of switching from an NPH-based regimen to a glargine-based regimen in 701 patients with type 1 (n = 304) or type 2 (n = 397) diabetes, using unselected primary care data.

- **Methods**: Data for this retrospective observational study were extracted from a UK primary care database (The Health Improvement Network). Patients were required to have at least 12 months of data before and after switching from NPH to glargine. The principal analysis was the change in HbA(1c) after 12 months of treatment with glargine; secondary analyses included change in weight and total daily insulin dose. Inconsistent reporting of hypoglycemic episodes precludes reliable reporting of this outcome. Multivariate analyses were used to adjust for baseline characteristics and confounding variables.

- **Results**: After adjustment, both diabetic cohorts showed statistically significant reductions in mean HbA(1c) 12 months after the switch. Type 1 and type 2 patients with baseline HbA(1c) ≥ 8% had reductions of 0.57% (p < 0.001) and 0.47% (p < 0.001), respectively. There was no significant change in weight or total daily insulin dose while on glargine. The majority of patients received a basal-bolus regimen prior to and after the switch, with a mean of 79.3% before and 77.2% after the switch in type 1 patients, and 80.4% and 76.8%, respectively, in type 2 patients.

### Hypoglycemia [^113BaFCd]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2018). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for hypoglycemia, specifically concerning general principles, DC 2018 guidelines recommend adopting the following strategies to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes at high risk:

- **Pharmacotherapy**: Avoid using pharmacotherapies associated with an increased risk of severe hypoglycemia.

- **Education**: Provide standardized education focusing on the rigorous avoidance of hypoglycemia while maintaining overall glycemic control.

- **Self-monitoring**: Advise increasing the frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose, including periodic assessment during sleeping hours.

- **Glycemic targets**: Offer less stringent glycemic targets with avoidance of hypoglycemia for up to three months.

- **Training and follow-ups**: Provide blood glucose awareness training and structured diabetes education, and ensure frequent follow-ups.

### Management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized adult patients in non-critical care settings: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1135fvsi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of in-hospital hyperglycemia, specifically with respect to insulin therapy, the ES 2022 guidelines recommend considering the continuation of insulin pump therapy rather than changing to subcutaneous (SC) basal-bolus insulin therapy. This is applicable in hospitals with access to personnel with expertise in insulin pump therapy for adult patients already using insulin pump therapy for diabetes management before admission and who are hospitalized for a non-critical illness. It is advisable to transition to scheduled SC basal-bolus insulin before discontinuing insulin pump therapy in patients with an anticipated hospital length of stay of more than 1–2 days where expertise in insulin pump therapy is not accessible.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^1142RU2U]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, specifically in managing hypoglycemia, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend prescribing glucagon for all patients taking insulin or those at high risk for hypoglycemia. It is important to ensure that family members, caregivers, school personnel, and others providing support to these patients are aware of the glucagon's location and are educated on how to administer it. Prefer glucagon preparations that do not require reconstitution.

### Best practices and tools for titrating basal insulins: Expert opinion from an Indian panel via the modified Delphi consensus method [^113BtUQi]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

The importance of SMBG in the optimization of titration is often debated in clinical practice. In persons with T2DM on bedtime neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin or only a basal insulin, only fasting state (i.e. before breakfast) SMBG is required. In persons taking more than one insulin, SMBG testing before each meal and before the bedtime snack is needed. The guideline-recommended frequency of SMBG testing is very unrealistic in practice. Therefore, a defined frequency of SMBG testing during titration and after achieving the agreed-upon targets, which is more realistic and practical, is the need of the hour.

### Near-miss hypoglycemia-reflections on perioperative glucose management guidelines in diabetics [^117GApMM]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Low credibility.

More diabetic patients are using insulin pumps to administer subcutaneous insulin instead of manual subcutaneous injections. Insulin pumps require continuous self-management, including changing infusion sites every two days and manually adjusting insulin levels. These pumps administer insulin continuously via the subcutaneous route through two types of doses: basal (background insulin) and bolus (for increase in blood sugar from meals) insulin. The pumps give insulin based on pre-programmed basal and bolus rates set by the patient and their healthcare provider. Patients are advised to check their glucose levels between 5 and 10 times per day.

Perioperatively, patients using an insulin pump may continue with their usual basal infusion rate if the catheter and pump remain in place and if the patient can resume self-management postoperatively. If the pump is to be discontinued at home prior to surgery, basal insulin can be administered two to three hours prior to pump discontinuation. A treatment approach that may have worked better at managing the preoperative hyperglycemia in this patient is to restart her pump insulin infusion. Even if a decision is made to hold pump infusions, it can be beneficial to keep the device on in the perioperative setting and utilize its glucose measurement capabilities. Insulin pumps measure glucose from the interstitium, a distinct physiological compartment than the blood, and accordingly, the readings from these devices are different from those obtained by a finger-stick (capillary glucose) or a venous sample. This difference should be kept in mind.

### Improved glycaemic control by switching from insulin NPH to insulin glargine: a retrospective observational study [^112pTfPH]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2009). Low credibility.

- **Adjusted HbA1c reduction over 12 months**: In patients switching from NPH to glargine, adjusted for significantly correlated demographic and clinical covariates, including concomitant use of bolus insulin, age, weight, hypoglycemia, and baseline HbA1c (in the 3 months prior to insulin initiation). †p-values were determined by the paired t-test for the difference in mean HbA1c following the switch from NPH to glargine.

- **Proportion of patients reaching HbA1c levels**: In both cohorts, 31% of patients achieved an HbA1c level of 7% within 12 months of switching from NPH to glargine. Overall, 18% of patients with type 1 diabetes and 20% with type 2 diabetes achieved a reduction in HbA1c of ≥ 1%.

- **Episodes of hypoglycemia**: During the 12 months prior to the switch from NPH to glargine, 115 hypoglycemic episodes were reported by patients with type 1 diabetes (0.38 episodes per patient/year), while 131 episodes were reported by patients with type 2 diabetes (0.33 episodes per patient/year). After switching to glargine, the respective data were 244 episodes for patients with type 1 diabetes (0.80 episodes per patient/year) and 286 episodes for patients with type 2 diabetes (0.72 episodes per patient/year) during the following 12 months.

### Combination of oral antidiabetic agents with basal insulin versus premixed insulin alone in randomized elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115cxgnU]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2007). Low credibility.

To compare the initiation of insulin therapy by adding once-daily insulin glargine to oral antidiabetic agents (OADs) with switching patients to premixed 30% regular, 70% human neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin (70/30) without OADs.

- **Design**: A 24-week, multicenter, open, randomized (1:1), parallel study.
- **Setting**: Three hundred sixty-four poorly controlled patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were treated with once-daily morning insulin glargine with continued OADs (glimepiride+metformin) (glargine+OAD) or twice-daily 70/30 alone. Insulin dosage in each group was titrated to target fasting blood glucose (FBG) of 100 mg/dL or less (or = 6.7 mmol/L) and hemoglobin (Hb)A(1c) levels between 7.5% and 10.5% on OADs (glargine+OAD, n = 67; 70/30, n = 63).
- **Measurements**: HbA(1c), FBG, hypoglycemia, insulin dose, and adverse events were recorded.
- **Results**: HbA(1c) decreased from baseline to endpoint for both glargine+OAD (from 8.8% to 7.0%) and 70/30 (from 8.9% to 7.4%); adjusted mean HbA(1c) decrease for glargine+OAD and 70/30 was -1.9% and -1.4%, respectively (P = 0.003). More patients reached HbA(1c) of 7.0% or less without confirmed nocturnal hypoglycemia with glargine+OAD (n = 37, 55.2%) than with 70/30 (n = 19, 30.2%) (P = 0.006). FBG decreased significantly more with glargine+OAD (-57 mg/dL (-3.2 mmol/L)) than with 70/30 (-40 mg/dL (-2.2 mmol/L)) (P = 0.002).

Anaesthesia (2025). Low credibility.

The pharmacokinetic and dynamic profile of GLP-1 RAs must also be considered. The half-life of these drugs varies, ranging from a few hours to a week. Thus, if a person who takes a 1 mg weekly dose of semaglutide for the treatment of diabetes mellitus stops for one week, their plasma concentration will be the same as someone who is on 0.5 mg weekly and has not stopped. Good data show that the longer GLP-1 RAs are ceased, the lower the likelihood of increased residual gastric content. However, even one week of cessation is associated with a high risk of residual gastric content in patients who fasted appropriately for surgery. This evidence, as well as case reports of patients withholding GLP-1 RAs for a full week, suggests that this is also clearly an insufficient duration of cessation to reduce the risk of pulmonary aspiration. Recent data suggest that withholding GLP-1 RAs for up to three weeks is also associated with increased gastric volume.

The individual patient profile is clearly relevant. All people taking GLP-1 RAs have at least two risk factors for delayed gastric emptying: the drug plus either diabetes mellitus or obesity (or both). Indeed, six of the ten published case reports included people with at least three different risk factors for pulmonary aspiration, which includes other conditions or drugs that may delay gastric emptying. Similarly, the nature of the procedure must also be considered, as emergency surgery may itself be a risk factor for pulmonary aspiration.

### Randomized study comparing a basal-bolus with a basal plus correction insulin regimen for the hospital management of medical and surgical patients with type 2 diabetes: Basal plus trial [^116APghL]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

In this multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized study, we enrolled 375 adult patients admitted to general medicine and surgery services. Patients had a known history of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and a blood glucose (BG) level before randomization between 140 and 400 mg/dL. Additional criteria included a history of T2D for more than three months, age between 18 and 80 years, and treatment at home with diet alone, any combination of oral antidiabetic agents, or low-dose insulin therapy at a daily dose of ≤ 0.4 units/kg before admission. Upon admission, oral antidiabetic agents were discontinued, and BG was measured before meals and at bedtime. Patients were included in the study when BG was greater than 140 mg/dL.

Patients previously treated with low-dose insulin had their insulin regimen continued and were invited to participate if their BG exceeded 140 mg/dL. Exclusion criteria comprised patients with an admission blood glucose greater than 400 mg/dL before randomization, a history of hyperglycemic crises, hyperglycemia without a known history of diabetes, or those expected to require ICU admission. Additionally, patients undergoing cardiac surgery, receiving corticosteroid therapy, those with clinically relevant hepatic disease or impaired renal function (serum creatinine ≥ 3.0 mg/dL), a history of diabetic ketoacidosis, pregnant patients, and those with any mental condition rendering them unable to give informed consent were excluded from the study.

### A practical approach to the clinical challenges in initiation of basal insulin therapy in people with type 2 diabetes [^111AnqHm]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

There are other situations when starting insulin therapy is appropriate, irrespective of other or previous treatments. These situations include periods of metabolic decompensation due to inter-illnesses, glucocorticoid treatment, or scheduled surgery. Even though insulin therapy is typically instituted for a few days or weeks in these circumstances, such a short course of treatment may reduce glucotoxicity, and improve β-cell function and metabolic control in the longer term. These situations go beyond the scope of this review and may require not only basal insulin use, but also rapid-acting insulins.

### Daily insulin doses and injection frequencies of neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH) insulin, insulin detemir and insulin glargine in type 1 and type 2 diabetes: a multicenter analysis of 51964 patients from the German/Austrian DPV-wiss database [^111CW8xd]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

We performed a comparative analysis of the use of long-acting insulin analogues — neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH), detemir (Det), and glargine (Gla) — and quantified injection frequencies and daily insulin doses in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes in daily practice.

- **Methods**: A total of 51,964 patients from 336 centers in Germany and Austria with type 1 and type 2 diabetes on exclusive insulin therapy were retrospectively analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 42.1%/75.9% (type 1/type 2) of patients used NPH, 19.9%/6.7% Det, and 38.0%/17.4% Gla, with similar glycemic control and proportions of severe hypoglycemia for NPH/Det/Gla in type 1 diabetes. The mean HbA1c was 7.98%/7.98%/8.07%, and the mean proportion of severe hypoglycemia was 11.06%/11.93%/10.86%. For type 2 diabetes, the mean HbA1c was 7.61%/7.78%/7.61%, and the mean proportion of severe hypoglycemia was 5.66%/4.48%/5.03%. In type 1 diabetes, the mean daily injection frequencies for NPH, Det, and Gla were 1.9, 1.8, and 1.1, respectively, with total daily insulin injections at 5.3, 5.6, and 5.0. The adjusted mean daily basal insulin doses were 0.36 IU/kg (NPH), 0.39 IU/kg (Det), and 0.31 IU/kg (Gla). The mean daily total insulin dose was lowest for Gla at 0.74 IU/kg, followed by NPH at 0.76 IU/kg and Det at 0.81 IU/kg. In type 2 diabetes patients, mean daily injection frequencies were 1.6 for NPH, 1.4 for Det, and 1.1 for Gla, with total daily insulin injections at 4.0, 4.1, and 3.6. The mean daily basal insulin dosages were 0.30 IU/kg (NPH), 0.33 IU/kg (Det), and 0.29 IU/kg (Gla), while mean total insulin doses per day were 0.63 IU/kg (NPH), 0.77 IU/kg (Det), and 0.67 IU/kg (Gla).

### Lantus Solostar [^112yzVHG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study G), adult patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to 5 years of treatment with once-daily LANTUS or twice-daily NPH insulin. For patients not previously treated with insulin, the starting dosage of LANTUS or NPH insulin was 10 units daily. Patients who were already treated with NPH insulin either continued with the same total daily NPH insulin dose or started LANTUS at a dosage that was 80% of the total previous NPH insulin dosage.

The primary endpoint for this study was a comparison of the progression of diabetic retinopathy by 3 or more steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale. HbA1c change from baseline was a secondary endpoint. Similar glycemic control in the two treatment groups was desired to avoid confounding the interpretation of the retinal data. Patients or study personnel used an algorithm to adjust the LANTUS and NPH insulin dosages to achieve a target fasting plasma glucose of ≤ 100 mg/dL. After adjusting the LANTUS or NPH insulin dosage, other antidiabetic agents, including premeal insulin, were to be adjusted or added.

The average age of participants was 55 years. The majority were White (85%), and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 34.3 kg/m². The mean duration of diabetes was 11 years. The LANTUS group had a smaller mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c compared to the NPH insulin group, which may be explained by the lower daily basal insulin doses in the LANTUS group. The incidences of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia were similar between groups.

### Preoperative hypoglycemia in a patient receiving insulin detemir [^111ZYEC8]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

The insulin regimen of a Type 2 diabetic patient presenting for surgery had been recently changed from a 70/30 mixture of insulin aspart protamine and aspart to insulin detemir and insulin glulisine. Preoperative instructions were given to take the usual dose of basal insulin but to abstain from short-acting insulin. On the morning of surgery, the patient's blood glucose was low and remained so despite the administration of intravenous dextrose. A review of the basal insulin dose revealed it had been inappropriately increased to manage elevated postprandial glucose levels. Doses of basal insulin exceeding basal requirements can cause hypoglycemia in a fasting state.

### Symlinpen [^112f3h94]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Important considerations pertaining to Symlin and insulin dose adjustments**: Symlin dosage differs depending on whether the patient has type 1 or type 2 diabetes [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]. Symlin should be used only in patients who can fully understand and adhere to proper insulin adjustments and glucose monitoring. Insulin and Symlin dose adjustments should be made only as directed by a healthcare professional skilled in the use of insulin. When initiating Symlin, reduce mealtime insulin doses, including premixed insulins, by 50% to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. To reduce the risk of nausea, wait at least 3 days before titrating Symlin to the next dose increment. Monitor blood glucose frequently, including pre- and post-meals and at bedtime, particularly when initiating Symlin or increasing the Symlin dose. After the initial 50% reduction in mealtime insulin dose, individualize insulin dose adjustments based on glycemic control and tolerability (e.g. if nausea occurs, it may affect the dose of insulin required). An increased frequency of mild-to-moderate hypoglycemia should be viewed as a warning sign of increased risk for severe hypoglycemia. If Symlin therapy is discontinued for any reason (e.g. surgery or illnesses), the same initiation protocol should be followed when Symlin therapy is reinstituted [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

- **Patients with type 2 diabetes using mealtime insulin**: Reduce mealtime insulin doses (including premixed insulins) by 50%, then initiate Symlin at 60 mcg subcutaneously, injecting immediately prior to meals.

### Intensifying insulin regimen after basal insulin optimization in adults with type 2 diabetes: A 24-week, randomized, open-label trial comparing insulin glargine plus insulin glulisine with biphasic insulin aspart (LanScape) [^116cC4bQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

To test the hypothesis that a 'basal plus' regimen — adding once-daily main-meal fast-acting insulin to basal insulin once daily — would be non-inferior to biphasic insulin twice daily as assessed by glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration (predefined as ≤ 0.4%) but would provide superior treatment satisfaction, an open-label trial was conducted.

This trial enrolled adults to an 8- or 12-week run-in period during which oral therapies, except metformin, were stopped and the insulin glargine dose was titrated. Those with fasting glucose at 7% (53mmol/mol) were randomized to either insulin glargine/glulisine once daily (n = 170) or insulin aspart/aspart protamine 30/70 twice daily (n = 165) for 24 weeks, with dose titration to achieve glucose targets using standardized algorithms.

- **Results**: For HbA1c, the basal plus regimen was non-inferior to biphasic insulin (least squares mean difference, 0.21%, upper 97.5% confidence limit 0.38%), meeting the predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.4%. Treatment satisfaction, evaluated through the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire change version and Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire total scores, significantly favored the basal plus regimen. There was no significant difference between the basal plus and biphasic insulin groups regarding responders (HbA1c < 7%; 20.6% vs. 27.9%; p = 0.12), weight gain (2.06 vs. 2.50 kg; p = 0.2), diabetes-specific quality of life (Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life average weighted impact [AWI] score), and generic health status (five-dimension European Quality of Life questionnaire). Overall hypoglycaemia rates were similar between the groups.

From February 2008 to October 2009, 234 patients consented to participate. Of these, 23 patients were excluded after randomization because they received less than 24 hours of insulin treatment (n = 14), treatment with continuous insulin infusion during parenteral nutrition (n = 3), withdrew consent (n = 3), or had their surgery canceled (n = 3). A total of 104 patients in the basal-bolus regimen and 107 patients in the SSI group were included in the analysis. Of them, 105 patients were recruited at Grady Memorial Hospital, 101 patients at Emory University Hospital, and five patients at the Veterans Administration Medical Center. The groups were well-matched; the characteristics of the patients did not differ in terms of sex, age, racial distribution, BMI, or duration of diabetes. On admission, 17.1% of patients were treated with diet alone, 63% with oral agents alone, 9.5% with a combination of oral agents and insulin, and 10.4% with insulin alone.

- **Clinical characteristics and outcomes**: The mean admission glucose level for the entire cohort was 190 ± 92 mg/dL, and the mean A1C was 7.72 ± 2.2%. In the basal-bolus group, the mean admission BG was 197 ± 104 mg/dL and the A1C was 8.08 ± 2.4%, which were higher than in the SSI group (184 ± 80 mg/dL and 7.38 ± 1.9%, respectively). However, these differences did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.548 and P = 0.070, respectively). The mean BG at randomization in the basal-bolus group was 202 ± 51 mg/dL, and in the SSI group, it was 194 ± 56 mg/dL. The mean glucose before surgery was 178 ± 71 mg/dL.

### Novolog [^112ygNSN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Inform patients that their ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. Advise patients who have frequent hypoglycemia or reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycemia to use caution when driving or operating machinery.

Advise patients that changes in insulin regimen can predispose them to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, and that changes in insulin regimen should be made under close medical supervision [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Hypoglycemia with medication errors**: Instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between insulin products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Advise patients that hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with Novolog. Inform patients of the symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin pumps**: Train patients in both intensive insulin therapy with multiple injections and in the function of their pump and pump accessories. This Novolog product can be used with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps labeled for use with Novolog (insulin aspart). Refer to the insulin pump user manual to see if Novolog can be used. See recommended infusion sets in the insulin pump user manual. Instruct patients to replace insulin in the reservoir at least every 7 days or according to the user manual, whichever is shorter; infusion sets and infusion set insertion sites should be changed according to the manufacturer's user manual.

### Sterile diluent [^111UJqV2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

If you use HUMALOG with NPH insulin, it is important to note that NPH insulin is the only type of insulin that can be mixed with HUMALOG. Do not mix HUMALOG with any other type of insulin. HUMALOG should be drawn into the syringe first before you draw up your NPH insulin. Consult your healthcare provider if you are unsure about the proper way to mix HUMALOG and NPH insulin. Administer your injection immediately.

- **Giving your HUMALOG injection with a syringe**: Inject your insulin exactly as your healthcare provider has instructed you. They should advise whether you need to pinch the skin before injecting. HUMALOG acts quickly, so administer your injection within 15 minutes before or immediately following a meal. Rotate your injection sites within the selected area for each dose to reduce the risk of developing lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Avoid injecting in areas where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps as well as in regions that are tender, bruised, scaly, hard, scarred, or damaged.

- **Giving your HUMALOG using an insulin pump**: HUMALOG should be administered into an area of your body as recommended in the instructions that accompany your insulin pump. Follow the manufacturer's user manual to change your infusion set and rotate the infusion set insertion site. Rotate your insertion sites within the selected area for each insertion to reduce the risk of developing lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the insertion sites.

### Current practice in the perioperative management of patients with diabetes mellitus: A narrative review [^115FFxjQ]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Low credibility.

The prevalence of diabetes is increasing, and patients with diabetes mellitus have both an increased likelihood of requiring surgery and of developing postoperative complications. We summarize available evidence underpinning guidelines on preoperative assessment and optimization, perioperative management of prescribed insulin and oral hypoglycemic medication, intraoperative glycemic control, and postoperative patient care.

### Basal insulin analogues in the management of diabetes mellitus: What progress have we made [^112acZtU]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Insulin remains the most effective and consistent means of controlling blood glucose levels in diabetes. Since 1946, neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) has been the predominant basal insulin in clinical use. However, absorption is variable due to the need for resuspension, and the time-action profile (peak activity 4–6 hours after subcutaneous administration) increases the propensity for between-meal and nocturnal hypoglycemia.

In the 1980s, recombinant DNA technology enabled modifications to the insulin molecule, resulting in the soluble long-acting insulin analogues glargine and detemir. Both exhibit a lower risk of hypoglycemia compared with neutral protamine Hagedorn due to improved time-action profiles and reduced day-to-day glucose variability. Glargine is indicated for administration once daily and detemir once or twice daily.

Degludec is the latest prolonged-acting insulin, which forms long subcutaneous multi-hexamers that delay absorption. Recent phase III trials in type 1 and type 2 diabetes show that degludec was non-inferior to comparators (predominantly glargine) with a minimal, although inconsistent, reduction in overall hypoglycemia and a small absolute difference in nocturnal hypoglycemia.

Newer developmental agents include LY2605541 and glargine U300. LY2605541 comprises insulin lispro combined with polyethylene glycol, which increases its hydrodynamic size and retards absorption from the subcutaneous tissue. Glargine U300 is a new formulation of glargine, resulting in a flatter and more prolonged time-action profile than its predecessor.

### Advances in diabetic management: Implications for anesthesia [^116z7DFL]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

The past 20 years have seen an explosion in advances for the management of Type I diabetes mellitus. Not only have new delivery systems, such as the continuous subcutaneous insulin pump, emerged, but also better and more stable types of insulin with predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have been developed. An artificial pancreas is now on the horizon. This progress has had a significant impact on the modern perioperative care of diabetic patients.

### Study protocol of a randomised controlled trial comparing perioperative intravenous insulin, GIK or GLP-1 treatment in diabetes-PILGRIM trial [^115bYuSy]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Subjects in the glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) arm will receive the following treatment:

- **Preparation**: The day before surgery, the evening dose of long-acting insulin will be reduced by 50%. On the day of surgery, the regular insulin dose and oral glucose-lowering tablets will be withheld, if applicable.

- **GIK infusion**: A solution of 10 mmol potassium-chloride and a calculated insulin dose will be added to a 500 mL glucose 5% solution. The infusion will begin 30 minutes before surgery at a rate of 83 ml/hr. The insulin dose in the GIK infusion will be calculated using the formula:

	- **Formula**: I = (PG-7)/(200/W) + 8, where I = insulin amount, PG = glucose 30 minutes preoperative, W = body weight in kg.

- **Glucose monitoring**: Glucose levels will be measured every 60 minutes after the start of surgery, beginning 30 minutes prior to surgery.
	- If glucose is 4–6 mmol/l, stop infusion and measure again in 30 minutes.
	- If glucose is 8 mmol/l, treat according to the algorithm.

### Peri-operative management of the surgical patient with diabetes 2015: Association of anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland [^116cFsPm]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

The postoperative blood glucose management plan and any alterations to existing medications should be clearly communicated to ward staff. Patients with diabetes should be involved in planning their postoperative care. If subcutaneous insulin is required in insulin-naïve patients, or if the type of insulin or the timing is to change, the specialist diabetes team should be contacted for advice.

### Current practice in the perioperative management of patients with diabetes mellitus: A narrative review [^112h4xn9]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Low credibility.

- **Insulin**: There are several ways to manage a patient's insulin in the preoperative period. The most common methods are: (1) continuation of the patient's normal multiple daily injections of insulin but at a reduced dose before surgery; (2) commencement of a variable rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII); (3) continuation of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) – usually via a pump; or (4) fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) – the latter only used for management of diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic non-ketotic (HHONK) state.

The VRIII was advocated as a replacement for Alberti's 'glucose–insulin–potassium' (GIK) in the 1990s. Although Alberti's regimen was a significant improvement in the perioperative management of the patient with diabetes, it had inherent limitations, including a high risk of error owing to the number of additives to the fluid bag, and it was also wasteful. However, all guidelines caution on the inherent risks of VRIII unless used in a highly monitored environment, such as intraoperatively or in a critical care environment, because of the risk of hypoglycaemia or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) if inappropriately managed. Of note, patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) always need insulin to avoid the development of DKA.

### Novolog [^1129s49D]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The safety and effectiveness of subcutaneous Novolog were compared to regular human insulin in 596 adult type 1 diabetes patients, 187 pediatric type 1 diabetes patients, and 91 adult type 2 diabetes patients using NPH as basal insulin (see Tables 3, 4, 5). The reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was similar to regular human insulin.

The safety and effectiveness of Novolog administered by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) via external pump were compared to buffered regular human insulin administered by CSII, to lispro administered by CSII, and to Novolog injections with NPH injection. Overall, the reduction in HbA1c was similar to the comparator.

### Elective peri-operative management of adults taking glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors: A multidisciplinary consensus statement: A consensus statement from the Association of Anaesthetists, Association of British Clinical Diabetologists, British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society, Centre for Perioperative Care, Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care, Royal College of Anaesthetists, Society for Obesity and Bariatric Anaesthesia and UK Clinical Pharmacy Association [^115RjSjb]. Anaesthesia (2025). Low credibility.

Given the dearth of high‐quality peri‐operative studies, there remains uncertainty regarding optimal peri‐operative management of patients taking GIP/GLP‐1 RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors. This consensus statement synthesizes existing evidence and provides pragmatic recommendations to support clinicians and patients with shared decision-making (see online Supporting Information Appendix S1). For patients taking GIP/GLP1‐RAs, the continuation of treatment is currently recommended, but should be supported through risk assessment and stratification, shared decision-making, and the use of peri‐operative techniques to mitigate the risk of pulmonary aspiration. Patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors should stop these medications one day pre‐operatively.

While we focus on the peri‐operative use of individual drugs, there are multiple factors that may adversely affect the risk of pulmonary aspiration, glycaemic dysregulation, cardiac, renal, and glycaemic deterioration and ketotic states; clinicians should take each of these into account in delivering individualized care. Finally, we focus on elective peri‐operative care, but in the setting of emergency surgery, endoscopy, and other settings, recommendations may be less applicable.

The limitations of these recommendations are due largely to the limited evidence base. Studies at the time of writing are predominantly case reports or retrospective clinical trials with potential for bias. We recognize that the evidence in this field continues to evolve and therefore these recommendations are only valid at the time of writing.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^112KrFgn]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of type 1 diabetes mellitus, the ADA 2025 guidelines specifically address insulin therapy. They recommend providing education on adjusting mealtime insulin doses according to carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake to improve glycemic outcomes and quality of life while minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia. Additionally, education should include how to modify the insulin dose, or correction dose, based on current glycemia, glycemic trends (if available), management during sick days, and anticipated physical activity.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^115XsNHG]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

For inpatient care of diabetes mellitus type 1, specifically in the management of hospitalized patients, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend the continuation of insulin pump or automated insulin delivery during hospitalization when clinically appropriate. This should be accompanied by confirmatory point-of-care blood glucose measurements for insulin dosing and hypoglycemia assessment and treatment, provided that resources and training are available and conducted according to an institutional protocol.

### EADSG guidelines: Insulin therapy in diabetes [^111xUSSf]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Insulin is the preferred treatment for glycemic control in critically ill patients. For non-critically ill patients with good nutritional intake, basal, meal-related, and correction insulin doses are preferred. Subcutaneous rapid- or short-acting insulin before meals or every 4–6 hours may be used in patients not on regular meals or in those receiving continuous enteral or parenteral nutrition to correct hyperglycemia. For non-critically ill patients with poor oral intake or those who are taking nothing by mouth (NPO), basal insulin or a basal plus bolus correction insulin regimen is preferred. Basal-bolus is favored over sliding scale insulin (SSI) due to improved glycemic control and reduced hospital complications. Premixed insulin is recommended in the outpatient setting and basal-bolus therapy in the inpatient setting.

- **Recommendations**: Consider using a basal plus bolus correction insulin regimen, with the addition of meal-related insulin in patients who have good nutritional intake in non-critically ill patients (Grade A, EL I). Avoid sliding scale insulin in the inpatient hospital setting (Grade A, EL I).

- **Treatment for critically ill patients**: In critically ill patients, continuous IV insulin is preferred. When the patient is able to take regular meals, basal and correction insulin doses are administered. When transitioning T1DM or T2DM patients to outpatient SC insulin, SC basal insulin should be started 2–4 hours before the IV insulin is discontinued.

### Counseling for insulin icodec: A proposed practitioner's guide [^116Rfm4e]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Low credibility.

- **Technicalities**: Initial dosage and titration are critical when initiating insulin icodec. According to published literature, a weekly dose of 70 units can be initiated, equivalent to starting a once-daily basal insulin at 10 units per day. Steady state is typically achieved within 3–4 weeks. For patients already using once-daily degludec, detemir, glargine U100, or neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin (NPH), the initial dose of icodec may be calculated from their weekly dose. However, studies suggest a 50% loading dose may be beneficial. The first injection of icodec can be administered at any time of day, regardless of when the last insulin injection was given.

- **Intensification/dose titration**: Titration can occur at once-weekly or circaseptan intervals. If fasting plasma glucose is above the target, increments of 20 units are recommended; similar decrements are advised if glucose levels fall below the target. Patients should measure three pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose values on two days prior to and the day of the weekly titration.

The titration scheme for insulin icodec aims to balance glycemic control and minimize hypoglycemia, guided by phase 2 and 3 studies from the icodec clinical development program.

- **Interchange from other basal insulins**: When transitioning patients from once-daily or twice-daily basal insulins, the weekly icodec dose should be calculated as the total daily basal dose multiplied by seven.

### Near-miss hypoglycemia-reflections on perioperative glucose management guidelines in diabetics [^117FyeHJ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetics are completely dependent on the administration of exogenous insulin, fluid therapy, and glucose to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis. As a result, diabetic ketoacidosis is a particular concern in type 1 diabetics. Administration of insulin, glucose, and potassium should be considered perioperatively until oral intake is resumed. When possible, intravenous glucose infusion and insulin therapy should be continued when a type 1 diabetic is NPO. Recent NPO guidelines that allow clear liquids to be consumed up to two hours prior to surgery can assist preoperatively in avoiding and treating hypoglycemia.

Perioperative blood glucose management is not currently addressed by the ASA guidelines. Different approaches and recommendations exist. Regardless of the clinician's preference, vigilance is paramount in perioperative glucose management, and patient-specific judgment is particularly valuable in glucose management decisions.

### Comparison of insulin pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) to alternative methods for perioperative glycemic management in patients with planned postoperative admissions [^116S6b3k]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with diabetes who use insulin pumps, specifically continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), often require surgeries that necessitate postoperative hospital admission. However, there are currently no defined guidelines for the perioperative use of CSII.

- **Methods**: This retrospective single-institution study identified subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes by electronically searching 2005–2010 anesthesia preoperative assessments for the keyword "pump". Surgical cases (n = 92) were categorized based on the intraoperative insulin delivery method. The groups were: (a) CSII continuation of basal rate with or without correctional insulin bolus(es) (n = 53); (b) conversion to intravenous insulin infusion (n = 20); and (c) CSII suspension with or without correctional insulin bolus(es) (n = 19). These groups were compared on mean intraoperative blood glucose (BG) and category of most extreme intraoperative BG.

- **Results**: Differences were observed in baseline characteristics, including diabetes duration (p = .010), anesthesia time (p = .011), proportions receiving general anesthesia (p = .013), and preoperative BG (p = .033). The conversion group had the longest diabetes duration and anesthesia time, a higher proportion of general anesthesia recipients, and a higher mean preoperative BG than the continuation group. There was no significant difference in mean BG per surgical case between the continuation (163.5 ± 58.5 mg/dl), conversion (152.3 ± 28.9 mg/dl), and suspension groups (188.3 ± 44.9 mg/dl; p = .128). The suspension group experienced a greater percentage of cases (84.2%) with one or more intraoperative BG > 179 mg/dl compared to the continuation (45.3%) and conversion groups.

### Current practice in the perioperative management of patients with diabetes mellitus: A narrative review [^112caBro]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Low credibility.

A multicentre, randomised, blind, placebo-controlled superiority trial in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery examined the use of subcutaneous liraglutide as an adjunct to improve glycaemic control. The primary endpoint was the difference between groups for any intravenous insulin given in the operating theatre to maintain blood glucose > 8–10 mmol L−1. They found that 43% of patients from the liraglutide group needed insulin compared with 61% in the placebo group — a difference of 18% (95% CI, 5.9–30.0; P = 0.003).

Another multicentre RCT (n = 280) hypothesised that linagliptin (5 mg), a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor combined with a fast-acting supplemental insulin, would result in non-inferior glycaemic control compared with a basal-bolus insulin regimen in T2DM patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. A basal-bolus regimen consists of a combination of a once-daily long-acting or intermediate-acting insulin along with very rapid-acting insulin used at mealtime. Usually, the basal dose consists of approximately 50% of the total daily insulin dose. They found that the mean daily blood glucose was higher in the linagliptin group (9.5 [2.3] mmol L−1) compared with the basal-bolus group (8.8 [2.3] mmol L−1; P = 0.03). However, patients with linagliptin experienced fewer hypoglycaemic events (1.6% vs 11%, P = 0.001) and needed fewer daily insulin injections (2.0 [3.3] vs 3.1 [3.3]; P < 0.001).

### Outpatient insulin therapy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus: Scientific review [^112wYwRV]. JAMA (2003). Low credibility.

Newer insulin therapies, including the concept of physiologic basal-prandial insulin and the availability of insulin analogues, are changing clinical diabetes care. The key to effective insulin therapy is an understanding of principles that, when implemented, can result in improved diabetes control.

- **Objective**: To systematically review the literature regarding insulin use in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).

- **Data sources**: A MEDLINE search was performed to identify all English-language articles of randomized controlled trials involving insulin use in adults with type 1 or type 2 DM from January 1, 1980, to January 8, 2003. Bibliographies and experts were used to identify additional studies.

- **Study selection and data extraction**: Studies were included (199 for type 1 DM and 144 for type 2 DM, and 38 from other sources) if they involved human insulins or insulin analogues, were at least 4 weeks long with at least 10 patients in each group, and reported glycemic control and hypoglycemia. Studies of insulin-oral combination were similarly selected.

- **Data synthesis**: Twenty-eight studies for type 1 DM, 18 for type 2 DM, and 48 for insulin-oral combination met the selection criteria. In patients with type 1 DM, physiologic replacement with bedtime basal insulin and a mealtime rapid-acting insulin analogue results in fewer episodes of hypoglycemia than conventional regimens. Rapid-acting insulin analogues are preferred over regular insulin in patients with type 1 DM since they improve HbA1C and reduce episodes of hypoglycemia.
