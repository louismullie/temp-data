## Question

At what age can women typically discontinue routine Pap smear screening?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking at what age women can typically discontinue routine Pap smear screening. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-credibility guidelines and exactly how they define "adequate prior screening". Then, I should verify the rationale for stopping at 65 and whether any major organization recommends a different age. Next, I will check exceptions where screening should continue beyond 65, including inadequate prior screening, high-risk history, and limited life expectancy. After that, I should review real-world adherence and the consequences of under-screening before 65. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer with clear documentation requirements and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the core recommendation. The USPSTF gives a D recommendation against routine cervical cancer screening after age 65 in women who have had adequate prior screening and are not otherwise high risk, which in practice means screening can stop at 65 if the adequacy criteria are met [^9b3b0f72] [^136e1609]. The American Cancer Society aligns with this, recommending cessation at age 65 after documented adequate negative screening and no history of CIN2+ in the prior 25 years, again contingent on meeting the prior-screening thresholds [^d226d771] [^8e6cc07d]. ACOG similarly endorses stopping at 65 with adequate prior negative results, reinforcing the same stopping age and criteria [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the definition of "adequate prior screening", because that is the linchpin. Adequate negative prior screening is defined as either 2 consecutive negative HPV tests, 2 consecutive negative cotests, or 3 consecutive negative cytology results within the past 10 years, with the most recent test performed within the recommended interval (typically within 3–5 years depending on modality) [^9b3b0f72] [^d226d771] [^8e6cc07d]. I should double-check that this applies to tests done after age 55 as well; yes, the USPSTF explicitly notes that the most recent test should be within 5 years and that routine screening should continue for at least 20 years after treatment of a precancerous lesion, even if that extends past 65, which underscores the importance of recency and context [^9b3b0f72].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about simply stopping at 65 for everyone. I need to ensure I capture the exceptions where screening should continue beyond 65. If documentation of adequate prior screening is unavailable, women should continue screening until the cessation criteria are met, because a substantial fraction of women approach 65 without adequate screening history and remain at nontrivial risk [^9b3b0f72] [^d226d771] [^b8950fa2]. Women with a history of CIN2+ in the past 25 years or cervical cancer should continue surveillance beyond 65, as their risk remains elevated and guideline-based management should follow risk-based pathways rather than routine cessation rules [^d226d771] [^10579d94]. Additionally, women with limited life expectancy should discontinue screening regardless of age, whereas those with reasonable life expectancy and ongoing sexual activity may still warrant individualized consideration if prior screening is inadequate or unknown [^d226d771] [^10579d94].

> I should confirm the evidentiary rationale for stopping at 65 when criteria are met. Modeling and decision analyses suggest minimal incremental benefit to extending screening beyond 65 in adequately screened women, while the harms of false positives, colposcopies, and overtreatment persist, supporting cessation at 65 under those conditions [^136e1609] [^f4c86509]. Observational data also show that most invasive cervical cancers in women over 65 occur in those who did not meet adequacy criteria, reinforcing the focus on ensuring adequate screening before stopping rather than extending screening indiscriminately [^b126796f] [^cdf06b6b].

> Next, I should review real-world adherence, because under-screening before 65 changes the calculus. A meaningful proportion of women reach 65 without adequate screening, with estimates ranging from roughly 13% to over 30% depending on cohort and documentation completeness, which means many will need catch-up screening rather than immediate cessation at 65 [^9b3b0f72] [^b8950fa2]. Let me consider whether extending screening to 70 helps; modeling suggests only modest mortality gains from extending beyond 65, whereas the burden of additional procedures rises, so the balance still favors adhering to the 65-year cutoff once adequacy is documented [^f4c86509].

> But wait, what if a patient is 66 and has no records from the prior decade? I should confirm the practical approach. In the absence of documented adequate negative screening, clinicians should continue screening until the criteria are met, and if records cannot be obtained, it is reasonable to offer screening to close the gap, recognizing that HPV-based testing can be more sensitive in this context and may expedite meeting cessation criteria [^9b3b0f72] [^d226d771] [^f011f871]. I need to ensure I also note that once screening is appropriately stopped, it should not be resumed solely due to a new sexual partner, which is a common misconception [^9b3b0f72].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. Women can typically discontinue routine Pap smear screening at age 65, but only if they have documented adequate prior negative screening and no history of CIN2+ in the past 25 years. Adequate prior screening means 2 consecutive negative HPV tests, 2 consecutive negative cotests, or 3 consecutive negative cytology results within the last 10 years, with the most recent test within the recommended interval, and if these criteria are not met, screening should continue until they are fulfilled [^9b3b0f72] [^d226d771] [^8e6cc07d]. I should emphasize that this applies to average-risk women; those with high-risk histories, immunocompromise, or limited life expectancy require individualized decisions and may need ongoing surveillance or cessation regardless of age [^d226d771] [^10579d94].

Routine Pap smear screening can be discontinued at **age 65** for average-risk women who have documented adequate prior screening — defined as 3 consecutive negative cytology results or 2 consecutive negative cotests (HPV plus cytology) within the past 10 years, with the most recent test within 5 years [^9b3b0f72] [^d226d771]. Screening should continue beyond 65 if these criteria are not met or if there is a history of CIN2+ or cervical cancer [^d226d771] [^10579d94]. Once screening is stopped, it should not be resumed, even with new sexual partners [^9b3b0f72]. For women with a hysterectomy (cervix removed) for benign reasons, screening is not indicated at any age [^273a21eb].

---

## Criteria for discontinuing Pap smear screening

The USPSTF and ACS provide clear criteria for stopping routine Pap smear screening at age 65:

- **Adequate prior screening**: 3 consecutive negative cytology results or 2 consecutive negative cotests (HPV plus cytology) within the past 10 years, with the most recent test within 5 years [^9b3b0f72] [^d226d771].

- **No history of CIN2+**: No cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher, or cervical cancer, in the past 25 years [^d226d771] [^8e6cc07d].

- **Hysterectomy**: No screening is indicated after hysterectomy with removal of the cervix for benign disease [^273a21eb] [^3960d1c6].

---

## Rationale for discontinuation at age 65

The recommendation to stop screening at 65 is based on evidence that the risk of cervical cancer is low in adequately screened women, and continued screening yields minimal benefit while increasing harms such as false positives, unnecessary colposcopies, and anxiety [^136e1609] [^f4c86509]. Modeling shows that extending screening beyond 65 in adequately screened women does not significantly reduce cervical cancer incidence or mortality [^136e1609] [^f4c86509].

---

## Exceptions and special considerations

Certain women should continue screening beyond age 65:

- **Inadequate prior screening**: Women who do not meet the criteria for adequate prior screening should continue until they do [^9b3b0f72] [^d226d771].

- **History of CIN2+ or cervical cancer**: Women with a history of high-grade lesions or cervical cancer should continue surveillance for at least 25 years after treatment [^10579d94] [^cdf06b6b].

- **Immunosuppression**: Women with HIV or other immunocompromised states have higher risk and may need continued screening [^notfound].

- **Limited life expectancy**: Screening may be discontinued at any age if life expectancy is limited [^d226d771] [^ce1c959b].

---

## Consequences of inadequate screening

Many women reach age 65 without adequate screening, leading to persistent cervical cancer risk [^436782b3]. Under-screened older women account for a significant proportion of cervical cancers, underscoring the need to ensure adequate screening before cessation [^b126796f] [^cdf06b6b].

---

## Patient counseling and shared decision-making

Clinicians should discuss the rationale for stopping screening, the adequacy of prior screening, and the risks and benefits of continued screening. Shared decision-making is essential, especially for women with concerns about sexual activity or new partners [^9b3b0f72] [^d226d771].

### Cancer screening in the older patient [^35dfc576]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Although there are clear guidelines that advise at what age to begin screening for various cancers, there is less guidance concerning when it may be appropriate to stop screening. The decision to stop screening must take into account patients' age; overall health and life expectancy; the natural history of the disease; and the risks, expense, and convenience of the screening test, and any subsequent testing and treatment. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American Academy of Family Physicians suggest that Papanicolaou smears can be discontinued in women at 65 years of age, provided they have had adequate recent normal screenings. Evidence suggests that cessation of breast cancer screening at approximately 75 to 80 years of age is appropriate, although American Geriatric Society guidelines recommend cessation at a more advanced age. Studies support continuing colon cancer screening until approximately 75 years of age in men and 80 years of age in women for patients without significant comorbidities. Prostate cancer screening, if conducted at all, may be discontinued at approximately 75 years of age in otherwise healthy men. Ultimately, the decision to screen or to discontinue screening must be made after careful discussion with each patient, using evidence-based guidelines and individual patient preferences.

### Cervical cancer screening and incidence by age: unmet needs near and after the stopping age for screening [^436782b3]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Leading professional organizations recommend cervical cancer screening for average-risk women aged 21–65 years. For average-risk women aged > 65 years, routine screening may be discontinued if "adequate" screening with negative results is documented. Screening is recommended after age 65 years for women who do not meet adequate prior screening criteria or are at special risk.

Methods

Authors examined the most recent cervical cancer incidence data from two federal cancer surveillance programs for all women by age and race, corrected for hysterectomy status. The 2013 and 2015 National Health Interview Surveys were analyzed in 2016 to examine the proportion of women aged 41–70 years without a hysterectomy who reported that they never had a Pap test or that their most recent Pap test was > 5 years ago (not recently screened).

Results

The incidence rate for cervical cancer among older women, corrected for hysterectomy status, did not decline until age ≥ 85 years. The proportion not recently screened increased with age, from 12.1% for women aged 41–45 years to 18.4% for women aged 61–65 years.

Conclusions

Even among women within the recommended age range for routine screening, many are not up to date, and a substantial number of women approach the "stopping" age for cervical cancer screening without an adequate prior screening history. Efforts are needed to reach women who have not been adequately screened, including women aged > 65 years, to prevent invasive cervical cancer cases and deaths among older women.

### Screening for cervical cancer: will women accept less? [^8db7ceec]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

U.S. professional organizations increasingly agree that most women require Papanicolaou smear screening every 2 to 3 years rather than annually and that most elderly women may stop screening. We sought to describe the attitudes of women in the United States toward less intense screening, specifically, less frequent screening and eventual cessation of screening.

Methods

We conducted a random-digit-dialing telephone survey of women in 2002 (response rate of 75% among eligible women reached by telephone). A nationally representative sample of 360 women aged 40 years or older with no history of cancer was surveyed about their acceptance of less intense screening.

Results

Almost all women aged 40 years or older (99%) had had at least one Pap smear; most (59%) were screened annually. When women were asked to choose their preferred frequency for screening, 75% preferred screening at least annually (12% chose screening every 6 months). Less than half (43%) had heard of recommendations advocating less frequent screening. When advised of such recommendations, half of all women believed that they were based on cost. Sixty-nine percent said that they would try to continue being screened annually even if their doctors recommended less frequent screening and advised them of comparable benefits. Only 35% of women thought that there might come a time when they would stop getting Pap smears; of these, almost half would not stop until after age 80 years. The strongest predictor of reluctance to reduce the frequency of screening was a belief that cost was the basis of current screening frequency recommendations.

Conclusion

Most women in the United States prefer annual Pap smears and are resistant to the idea of less intense screening. Concern that cost considerations rather than evidence form the basis of screening recommendations may partly explain women's reluctance to accept less intense screening.

### Do age-based discontinuation recommendations influence cervical cancer screening rates? Evidence from the United States' behavioral risk factor surveillance system, 2016 and 2018 [^71fa53b9]. Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that women with adequate prior screening and average cervical cancer risk discontinue routine cervical cancer screening after age 65. This study's objective was to estimate how the USPSTF recommendation affects Papanicolaou (Pap) test rates among women at age 66 in the United States. We used nationally representative 2016 and 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data for women ages 56–76 (n = 226,031) and a regression discontinuity design to estimate changes in annual Pap test rates at age 66. Among women age 66–76, 22.5% reported receiving a Pap test within the past one year. At age 66, annual Pap rates declined by 5.9 percentage points (p.p.) (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: -7.7, -4.1) off a pre-66 rate of 39%. The change varied by race/ethnicity, education, and marital status. Pap rates did not change discretely for non-Hispanic Black women (0.8 p.p.; 95% CI: -5.4, 7.1) but did for women from other racial/ethnic groups. The decline was larger for women who graduated college (-9.0 p.p.; 95% CI: -12.0, -5.9) than for women without a college degree and for women who were never married (-9.4 p.p., 95% CI: -17.3, -1.5) than for women who were married/partnered or divorced/separated. The USPSTF recommendation to discontinue cervical cancer screening after age 65 leads to a sharp decline in Pap test rates at age 66 but disparately affects women based on race, education and marital status. Further study is needed to assess the consequences of these changes.

### Screening for cervical cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^9b3b0f72]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Cervical cancer screening — timing to start, stop, and exceptions — notes that cervical cancer is rare before age 21 years and evidence suggests that screening earlier than age 21 years, regardless of sexual history, would lead to more harm than benefit. For women older than 65 years, adequate prior screening is defined as 3 consecutive negative cytology results or 2 consecutive negative cotesting results within 10 years before stopping screening, with the most recent test occurring within 5 years, and routine screening should continue for at least 20 years after spontaneous regression or appropriate management of a precancerous lesion, even if this extends screening past age 65 years. Once screening has stopped, it should not resume in women older than 65 years, even if they report having a new sexual partner. Screening may be clinically indicated in older women with an inadequate or unknown screening history, and recent data suggest that approximately one-fourth of women aged 45 to 64 years have not been screened for cervical cancer in the preceding 3 years; in practice, women with limited access to care, women from racial/ethnic minority groups, and women from countries where screening is not available may be less likely to meet criteria for adequate prior screening.

Modeling age to stop screening — Modeling studies indicate low incremental benefit to extending screening beyond typical stop ages. Screening until age 69 years was associated with a 5% to 8% reduction in cancer mortality compared with screening until age 64 years. Using Canadian data and assuming typical adherence, extending cytologic screening from age 55 to age 70 years reduced the remaining lifetime risk of cervical cancer from 1 in 440 to 1 in 1206, while extending primary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening from age 55 to age 70 years reduced the risk from 1 in 1940 to 1 in 6255. For USPSTF 2018 strategies, cessation at age 65 years conserved 99.6% of the life-years gained from extending screening to age 70 years, and achieving a very small gain in life-years by extending from age 65 to age 70 years would come at a cost of 3% more colposcopies.

### Do women ≥ 50 years of age need as much screening as women [^b07c32b1]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

European recommendations state that cervical cancer screening should start at the latest at 30 years and stop not before 60 years of age. Screening intervals should be between 3 and 5 years.

International Agency for Research on Cancer recommendations for cervical cancer screening suggest 5-yearly screening over 50 years of age; 3-yearly screening is recommended at age 25–49 years in countries with the necessary resources.

The overtreatment is intrinsic in cervical cancer screening: for preventing one invasive cancer, seven to eight preinvasive lesions should be treated.

Considering invasive cervical cancer, several studies show a trend of decreasing risk with increasing number of smear tests.

Detection rates (DRs) for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) fall with increasing age and number of previous smears.

The low risk level in well-screened women after 50 years of age might not justify the costs and harms associated with screening, such as overdiagnosis, anxiety, unnecessary treatment and reduction in quality of life associated with false-positive results. On the basis of age and screening history, a subset of women could be identified, for whom the risk of preinvasive and invasive lesions is negligible and screening might be safely stopped before the currently recommended age limit or different screening intervals might be adopted at different ages.

The balance between the risk of being diagnosed with a preinvasive or invasive lesion and that of getting a false-positive cytohistological report must be discussed considering ethic and practical implications.

Objective of the present study is to estimate the DR and the cumulative risk (CR) of CIN2 or more severe lesions (CIN2+) and to compare it with the probability of false-positive episodes in women < 50 or ⩾50 years of age, with at least two cytological screening tests, the first negative, as observed in six Italian organised population-based screening programmes.

### Risk factors and other epidemiologic considerations for cervical cancer screening: a narrative review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^abc8c6a7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Despite the success of cervical cancer screening programs, questions remain about the appropriate time to begin and end screening. This review explores epidemiologic and contextual data on cervical cancer screening to inform decisions about when screening should begin and end. Cervical cancer is rare among women younger than 20 years. Screening for cervical cancer in this age group is complicated by lower rates of detection and higher rates of false-positive results than in older women. Methods used to diagnose and treat cervical intraepithelial neoplasia have important potential adverse effects. High-risk human papillomavirus infections and abnormalities on cytologic and histologic examination have relatively high rates of regression. Accordingly, cervical cancer screening in women younger than 20 years may be harmful. The incidence of, and mortality rates from, cervical cancer and the proportion of U.S. women aged 65 years or older who have had a Papanicolaou smear within 3 years have decreased since 2000. Available evidence supports discontinuation of cervical cancer screening among women aged 65 years or older who have had adequate screening and are not otherwise at high risk. Further reductions in the burden of cervical cancer in older women are probably best achieved by focusing on screening those who have not been adequately screened.

### Cervical cancer screening for individuals at average risk: 2020 guideline update from the American cancer society [^a88010d9]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Patient preferences, acceptability, and adherence to screening — screening frequency and adherence: Although annual Pap testing has long not been recommended, adherence to longer intervals has been uneven due to established practice patterns and perceived reluctance to deviate from more frequent testing, yet screening more frequently than recommended will increase unnecessary burden and exposure to harms. Acceptance of longer intervals has shown some indication of increase, but concerns note that longer intervals may delay care beyond recommended time frames and lower adherence. Nonadherence as individuals approach the age for cessation is of particular importance and may reduce benefits, and failure to initiate screening near the recommended starting age may similarly reduce benefits.

### Screening for cervical cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^136e1609]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Women older than 65 years — stopping screening and adequacy of prior screening: The decision model supports the current practice of stopping screening at age 65 years in an adequately screened woman and projected that extending screening beyond age 65 years in women with an adequate screening history would not have significant benefit; although screening after 65 with an adequate screening history is not recommended, approximately 13% of 65-year-old women have not been adequately screened and this increases to 37.1% without a regular health care provider, so the decision to stop screening at 65 years should only be made after confirming prior adequate screening.

3.2 Patient‐facing platform for addressing common gynecologic oncology concerns

What are the recommendations for screening tests routine for cervical cancer?

ChatGPT
Pap smear (Pap Test): The cervical smear test is the most common screening test for cervical cancer. It involves collecting cells from the cervix and examining them under a microscope to detect any abnormal changes. Starting at the age of 21 years, most guidelines recommend having a cervical smear every 3 years for women with a cervix.
HPV testing: HPV is a common sexually transmitted infection that can lead to cervical cancer. HPV testing is often done in conjunction with a cervical smear for women aged 30 years and older. It detects the presence of high‐risk HPV types that may cause cervical cell changes. If both the cervical smear and HPV test results are normal, screening intervals can be extended to every 5 years.
Co‐testing: In some cases, both cervical smear and HPV testing (co‐testing) may be performed together for women aged 30–65 years. If both tests are negative, the screening interval can be extended.
HPV vaccination: Vaccination against certain high‐risk HPV types is recommended for both females and males between the ages of 9 and 26 years. The HPV vaccine is most effective when administered before the onset of sexual activity.
Screening cessation: In general, cervical cancer screening can be stopped at the age of 65–70 years if a woman has had regular screenings in the past and her recent results are consistently normal. However, individual circumstances may vary, so it is important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the appropriate screening schedule.

### Do women ≥ 50 years of age need as much screening as women [^ecad7478]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Informing women about the risk related to changes in their and their partners' sexual habits may allow spontaneous return to the usual screening protocols.

Such strategies agree with the IARC recommendations for implementation on cervical cancer screening and with the IARC Working Group statement that there is little benefit from screening old women who have always tested negative in an organised screening programme. In particular, for women over 50 years of age, the Working Group recommend a 5-year screening interval.

The results of our study support the opinion that the benefit arising from cytological screening is uncertain in older women. Ethical and practical considerations subsequent to screening intensity reduction must be taken into account. A possible consequence might be an increase in invasive lesion incidence, compared to a major resource saving. Estimates of unprevented cervical cancers are in the magnitude of about two cases per 100 000 person-years. It is thus desirable to evaluate if benefits arising from saved resource allocation to more cost-effective interventions would make acceptable to reduce or to stop screening in 50-year-old or older women with a negative documented screening history.

### The frequency of pap smear screening in the United States [^56122765]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

U.S. professional medical societies and the national health systems of all other industrialized nations recommend that most women need not undergo Papanicolaou (Pap) smear screening annually. There are no data, however, regarding the frequency at which women actually undergo screening.

Objective

To describe the frequency of cervical cancer screening in the United States.

Design

National Health Interview Survey, a cross-sectional population-based telephone survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics.

Participants

Representative sample of U.S. women age 21 and older who denied a history of cancer (N = 16,467).

Measurements

Pap smear screening frequency, categorized as no regular screening or screening at 1 of 3 discrete screening intervals (every year, every 2 years, or every 3 years) based on each woman's reported number of Pap smears in the previous 6 years.

Results

The vast majority (93%) of American women report having had at least one Pap smear in their lifetime. Among women with no history of abnormal smears, 55% undergo Pap smear screening annually, 17% report a 2-year screening interval, 16% report being screened every 3 years, and 11% are not being screened regularly. Even the very elderly report frequent screening-38% of women age 75 to 84 and 20% of women age 85 and older reported annual Pap smears. Overall, 20% of women reported having had at least one abnormal Pap smear. Among these women, rates of frequent Pap smear screening are considerably higher-80% undergo annual screening, with only a modest decline in screening frequency with increasing age.

Conclusions

The majority of American women report being screened for cervical cancer more frequently than recommended. Lengthening the screening interval would not only reduce the volume of specimens that cytotechnologists are required to read, but would also reduce the follow-up testing after abnormal smears.

### Choosing wisely® in preventive medicine: the American College of Preventive Medicine's top 5 list of recommendations [^3960d1c6]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Cervical cancer screening in older or post-hysterectomy women — Recommendation #5 states "Don't Perform Screening for Cervical Cancer in Low-Risk Women Aged 65 Years or Older and in Women Who Have Had a Total Hysterectomy for Benign Disease". For women aged over 65 years with adequate prior screening, "the benefit of Pap smears is little to none, but the harms are at least "small". The page adds that "The USPSTF makes a "D" recommendation against screening women aged over 65 years that are at low risk for cervical cancer and have had negative results from prior screenings". It further notes that "once a patient stops receiving screenings, in general they should not restart screenings", and that in women who have had a hysterectomy for benign disease without a history of cervical cancer or high-grade lesions, "cervical cancer screening provides no benefits to these patients and may subject them to potential risks from false-positive results, including physical (e.g., vaginal bleeding from biopsies) or psychological (e.g., anxiety) distress".

Patient expectations — cytology-based cervical cancer screening preferences indicate that in a nationally representative survey of women aged 40 years or older, women prefer annual screening and that few expect to stop having cytologic tests before age 80 years; many also prefer frequent testing even if it causes anxiety due to false-positive results or unnecessary procedures, and some perceive recommendations for less frequent screening as driven by insurers and government payers.

Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines Should Be Practical and Able To Be Easily and Effectively Implemented in Many Settings

Sarah Feldman MD MPH

I. Introduction: Benefits and Harms of a Simple System

The most successful cancer screening test ever developed was the annual Pap test to screen for cervical cancer. The advice to initiate Pap testing at the age of 18 years or with the onset of sexual activity and to evaluate and treat all abnormalities was easy to remember for patients and doctors, easy to implement at annual visits, and easy to combine with other health care needs. It was practical, and this led in part to its success. Because cervical cancer screening guidelines have lengthened cytology intervals from 1 to 3 years and added HPV co-testing for women older than 30 years with a screening interval of 5 years, clinician and patient behavior has been difficult to change. According to Watson et al.in a study using National Health Interview data of 10,596 women published in 2017, appropriate Pap testing has decreased, with only 21% to 35% of women older than 30 years getting co-testing, and only 81% of women aged 21 to 65 years receiving a Pap within 3 years. Thus, the development of guidelines that are practical and easy to implement is paramount to ensure that future cervical cancer screening is better, not worse, for women.

Successful screening guidelines must account for access to care, availability of recommended tests, knowledge and preferences of both patients and providers, and systems for tracking patients and ensuring appropriate management of abnormalities.

II. Primary HPV Screening Is the Eventual Goal

Ultimately, primary HPV screening should be the standard of care for cervical cancer screening both in the United States and worldwide. A recent large study by Castle et al. shows the high negative predictive value of successive rounds of negative HPV tests, increasing our ability to predict women who are at low risk for developing cervical cancer. Many studies, however, while demonstrating an increase in the detection of precancer, especially in the first few years of testing, also show an increase in the detection of cellular changes associated with transient HPV infection, as well as an increase in the number of colposcopies and excisional procedures, e.g. LEEP, performed to detect these abnormalities, which are both costly and stressful for patients.

### Navigating the cervical cancer screening guidelines for women aged older than 65 years [^618d3fe7]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

One of the most notable changes stemming from consensus guidance in 2012 is cessation of cervical cancer screening in low-risk women aged older than 65 years. Despite evidence provided for this recommendation, implementation in clinical practice can be challenging, with resistance from patients and providers. This NAMS Practice Pearl reviews data supporting this recommendation and provides clinicians with confidence as we counsel our patients.

### Recommendations on screening for cervical cancer [^404197af]. CMAJ (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for cervical cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, CTFPHC 2013 guidelines recommend to consider discontinuing screening in women ≥ 70 years of age who have undergone adequate screening (3 successive negative Pap test results in the last 10 years). Continue screening in all other women ≥ 70 years of age until 3 negative test results have been obtained.

### Risk of cervical abnormality after age 50 in women with previously negative smears [^c72a6754]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

In general the risk of pre-invasive disease in women aged over 50 years is much lower than in younger women and therefore women over the age of 50 years with a negative smear history (and particularly with at least four negative smear episodes) are the lowest identifiable risk group in our cohort. Nevertheless, our results, suggest that if screening were discontinued for women over 50 years with past negative smears, appreciable morbidity would be missed. Selectively stopping screening at age 50 years for just those with four serial negative smears would result in far less missed morbidity, but with lower cost savings because the number of subjects with four serial negatives was only one-eighth of the number with two or three serial negatives. It is possible that taking account of negative smears over a longer age-span than 40–49 years, or considering cessation of screening at age of 55 years, would identify a group with clearer cost benefit from cessation of screening, but the NHS screening programme data do not, yet, run for a long enough period to assess this. When longer follow-up becomes available, with the passage of time, we will investigate risk of disease in women with a negative history for the 15-year period between the ages of 35–49 years, and outcomes for ages older than 55 years.

### Saturday pap smear clinic: addressing barriers to cervical cancer screening [^124ea607]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Cervical cancer is the fourth most prevalent diagnosed cancer in females worldwide. The principal cause of cervical cancer is an infection with HPV. The incidence of cervical cancer in the USA has significantly decreased by 70% since 1955 due to preventative measures such as primary prevention by vaccination against cancer-causing Human papillomavirus (HPV) strains and secondary prevention through Papanicolaou tests, also known as Pap smears and HPV screening. The Pap smear allows for microscopic visualisation of harvested cervical cells; observation of atypical cells are indicative of infection induced inflammation. HPV screening refers to sensitive molecular tests using DNA to identify HPV type and distinguish oncogenic infection from no, or low-risk infection. While the sensitivity of individual Pap smears is low, around 70%–80%, routine examinations are effective at the early detection of precancerous cells. Cervical cancer screening recommendations vary internationally. For our project, routine Pap smears and HPV screening are indicated in the USA for women aged 21–65. Our institution follows guidelines based on the United States Preventive Services Task Force, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Cancer Society, and American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology recommendations (table 1). Early identification of cervical cancer through routine screening can significantly improve patient outcomes.

Table 1
Table adapted from institution guideline based on: US Preventive Services Task Force, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Cancer Society, American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology

Barriers to and the general reluctance of women to complete routine Pap smears are common. From a survey sent before the pilot study, lack of awareness, fear, embarrassment, constrained appointment availability and limited access to preferred provider type contributed to cervical cancer screening non-compliance. Local resources, including Planned Parenthood and primary care practices, generally operate during usual business hours. Weekend medical resources are available for acute and urgent care but not for routine medical examinations, including cervical cancer screening. Cervical cancer can be prevented if diagnosed early through routine cervical cancer screening exams. Ensuring barriers are eliminated that prevent women from getting routine examinations is a crucial effort to improve the health outcomes of females.

### Older women's willingness to discontinue Papanicolaou test screening [^c93f1cfe]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

We surveyed our patients to assess their willingness to discontinue Papanicolaou testing. Our findings differ from those of previous studies, with 72% of our eligible respondents voicing willingness to discontinue screening. There may be many reasons for this, including linking the recommendation with the name of the patient's own physician.

### Cervical cancer screening among women aged 18–30 years-United States, 2000–2010 [^f1ff27b4]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Screening women for cervical cancer can save lives. However, among young women, cervical cancer is relatively rare, and too-frequent screening can lead to high costs and adverse events associated with overtreatment. Before 2012, cervical cancer screening guidelines of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Cancer Society (ACS), and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) differed on age to start and how often to get screened for cervical cancer. In 2012, however, all three organizations recommended that 1) screening by Papanicolau (Pap) test should not be used for women aged < 21 years, regardless of initiation of sexual activity, and 2) a screening interval of 3 years should be maintained for women aged 21–30 years. ACS and ACOG explicitly recommend against yearly screening. To assess trends in Pap testing before the new guidelines were introduced, CDC analyzed 2000–2010 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for women aged 18–30 years. CDC found that, among women aged 18–21 years, the percentage reporting never having been screened increased from 26.3% in 2000 to 47.5% in 2010, and the proportion reporting having had a Pap test in the past 12 months decreased from 65.0% to 41.5%. Among those aged 22–30 years, the proportion reporting having had a Pap test within the preceding 12 months decreased from 78.1% to 67.0%. These findings showed that Pap testing practices for young women have been moving toward the latest guidelines. However, the data also showed a concerning trend: among women aged 22–30 years, who should be screened every 3 years, the proportion who reported never having had a Pap test increased from 6.6% to 9.0%. More effort is needed to promote acceptance of the latest evidence-based recommendations so that all women receive the maximal benefits of cervical cancer screening.

### Cervical cancer screening in average-risk women: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^95260bfe]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Talking points for clinicians discussing cervical cancer screening with average-risk women note that beginning screening too soon can lead to investigation of transient abnormalities and treatment of cervical lesions that may resolve without treatment, and that screening more often than every 3 y increases harms of false-positive test results and invasive procedures yet confers little benefit. Continued screening of low-risk women after age 65 y provides little or no benefit but can lead to invasive tests and procedures, and after hysterectomy with removal of the cervix, women are no longer at risk for cervical cancer yet may have invasive procedures for test abnormalities.

### Understanding women's hesitancy to undergo less frequent cervical cancer screening [^e4f0bfe2]. Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Inappropriate cervical cancer screening (e.g., screening too often) can result in unnecessary medical procedures, treatment, and psychological distress. To balance the benefits and harms, cervical cancer screening guidelines were recently modified in favor of less frequent screening (i.e., every 3 to 5 years). This study investigated women's acceptance of less frequent cervical cancer screening and their primary concerns about extending the screening interval beyond one year. A national sample of 376 U.S. women ages 21–65 completed an online survey in 2014. Predictors of willingness to get a Pap test every 3 to 5 years were identified using logistic regression. We also examined perceived consequences of less frequent screening. Over two thirds were willing to undergo less frequent screening if it was recommended by their healthcare provider. Nevertheless, nearly 20% expressed discomfort with less frequent screening and 45% were either in opposition or unsure whether they would be comfortable replacing Pap testing with primary HPV testing. Women whose most recent Pap test was (vs. was not) within the past year and women who ever (vs. never) had an abnormal Pap test were less willing to extend the screening interval. Additionally, women who typically saw an obstetrician/gynecologist or nurse practitioner for their Pap test (vs. a family physician) were less accepting of the guidelines. Hesitancy about the longer screening interval appears to stem from concern about developing cancer between screenings. Findings contribute to the growing body of research on cancer overscreening and may inform interventions for improving adherence to cancer screening guidelines.

Cervical cancer screening best practice advice — clinicians should stop screening average-risk women older than 65 years for cervical cancer if they have had 3 consecutive negative cytology results or 2 consecutive negative cytology plus human papillomavirus (HPV) test results within 10 years, with the most recent test performed within 5 years. Clinicians should not screen average-risk women of any age for cervical cancer if they have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix.

### Updated cervical cancer screening guidelines [^43abd40f]. ACOG (2021). High credibility.

USPSTF recommendations for routine cervical cancer screening — age- and history-based intervals and grades are as follows: Aged less than 21 years — No screening (USPSTF Recommendation Grade D). Aged 21–29 years — Cytology alone every 3 years (USPSTF Recommendation Grade A). Aged 30–65 years — Any one of the following: Cytology alone every 3 years; FDA-approved primary high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing alone every 5 years; Cotesting (hrHPV testing and cytology) every 5 years (USPSTF Recommendation Grade A). Aged greater than 65 years — No screening after adequate negative prior screening results (USPSTF Recommendation Grade D). Hysterectomy with removal of the cervix — No screening in individuals who do not have a history of high-grade cervical precancerous lesions or cervical cancer (USPSTF Recommendation Grade D).

### Three large scale surveys highlight the complexity of cervical cancer under-screening among women 45-65years of age in the United States [^b355fb27]. Preventive Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Professional guideline changes in cervical cancer screening techniques and intervals may have also contributed to the lack of understanding of timely screening. Similarly, the electronic medical record ordering systems for cervical cancer screening have also provided multiple techniques and intervals from which to choose leading to order confusion. These changes started in 2003 with the approval of HPV testing in combination with cytology (co-testing) to screen women 30 and older, in addition to the option of cytology alone (], n.d.). In 2004 the guidelines changed from annually to every two years with liquid based Pap tests starting no later than 21 years or three years after the woman begins having vaginal intercourse. At 30 years, if the woman has had three normal consecutive tests, screening may extend to every 2–3 years using liquid Pap tests or every 3 years with HPV-cytology co-testing. By 2012, guidelines evolved to every 3 years with cytology for 21–29-year olds and a preferred recommendation of every 5-year co-testing for women 30–65 years. By 2018 co-testing was no longer favored, and now the USPSTF recommends primary HPV testing every five years. The many changes in techniques and intervals could have led to misunderstandings on what screening was recommended and what screening was implemented.

4.1. Study limitations and strengths

As we have discussed above, the limitations and consequences therefrom include different years of survey implementation, responses that are self-reported, different sampling frames, different survey sample sizes and changing professional guidelines. Despite these limitations, the trends and impact of predictors are still evaluable, and valuable to future strategies for cervical cancer elimination. Strengths include the description of the results from three large-scale national surveys routinely used to guide US health policy, including the first analysis of cervical cancer screening data from HCPS, a Section 330 funding program serving the vulnerable population.

### Cervical cancer screening for individuals at average risk: 2020 guideline update from the American cancer society [^c5fb147a]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Clinical considerations for cessation and documentation in older individuals emphasize that assuring an adequate history of screening before cessation is likely to be one of the most effective strategies to reduce the relatively substantial disease burden from cervical cancer in older individuals, that the identification of inadequately screened individuals must be a priority of clinicians and health systems, and that if documentation of recent screening cannot be obtained, screening tests should be performed until the criteria are met for cessation.

### Screening history preceding a diagnosis of cervical cancer in women age 65 and older [^b126796f]. Gynecologic Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize the antecedent screening of women 65 years of age and older diagnosed with cervical cancer.

Methods

Screening histories of women 65 years of age and older who were diagnosed with cervical cancer between 2003 and 2008 were examined utilizing the organization's databases and the regional Cancer Registry. Stopping screening was recommended at age 65 for members who had either 3 consecutive negative Paps or a single negative Pap plus HPV test ("cotest").

Results

From 2003 through 2008 there were 56 Kaiser Permanente Northern California members 65 years of age and older diagnosed with cervical cancer. During the same time period there were 1,323,100 woman-years of membership in women age 65 and older. The risk of invasive cancer among women age 65 and older was 4.2/100,000/year in 2003–2008. 33 of 56 (59%) had one or more Pap smears prior to diagnosis. Of the 33, 14 women (25%) had 3 consecutive negative Pap smears prior to diagnosis. Three of 46,401 women with 1 or more negative cotests at age 65 and older were subsequently diagnosed with invasive cancer during 132,639 women-years of follow-up (2.3/100,000/year).

Conclusions

Most cervical cancers diagnosed at age 65 and older occur in women who have not met our criteria for stopping screening. A few cancers will continue to occur at age 65 and older despite multiple negative tests, as is true in other age groups. We currently have no evidence that these cancers would be prevented with continued screening at ages 65 and older.

### Cervical cancer screening among women ≥ 70 years of age in the United States – A referral problem or patient choice [^7d8fca72]. Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Clinical guidelines recommend that women with a history of adequate screening and not otherwise at high risk may discontinue cervical cancer screening after 65 years of age. However, screening remains common among US women over 65 years old. This study was conducted to examine whether overutilization was attributable to provider's recommendation or patient choice.

Method

This cross-sectional study used data from 1752 female participants (70+ years) from the 2013 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). We quantitatively assessed the proportions of provider-recommended and patient self-initiated Pap smears.

Results

Among female respondents, 40.8% had a Pap smear within the past 3 years, 19.4% had a Pap smear in the last year, and 39.7% reported receiving a recommendation for a Pap smear from their provider in the past year. Among women who received a recommendation to obtain a Pap smear, 39.8% did so within the past 12 months compared to 5.9% of women who did not receive a recommendation (adjusted odds ratio 10.5, 95% confidence interval 7.39–15.0). About 70% of women who visited an obstetrician/gynecologist and reported receiving a recommendation to have a Pap smear did so in the past year, while 32.3% of women who visited an obstetrician/gynecologist but did not receive a recommendation obtained one.

Conclusion

Pap smears were common among women ≥ 70 years of age. Health care providers may need additional education on current guidelines regarding indications for Pap smears in this age group to help reduce screening of patients who may not benefit.

### Screening for cervical cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^5682495b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2003 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on screening for cervical cancer.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed new evidence on the comparative test performance of liquid-based cytology and the benefits and harms of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing as a stand-alone test or in combination with cytology. In addition to the systematic evidence review, the USPSTF commissioned a decision analysis to help clarify the age at which to begin and end screening, the optimal interval for screening, and the relative benefits and harms of different strategies for screening (such as cytology and co-testing).

Recommendations

This recommendation statement applies to women who have a cervix, regardless of sexual history. This recommendation statement does not apply to women who have received a diagnosis of a high-grade precancerous cervical lesion or cervical cancer, women with in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol, or women who are immunocompromised (such as those who are HIV positive). The USPSTF recommends screening for cervical cancer in women aged 21 to 65 years with cytology (Papanicolaou smear) every 3 years or, for women aged 30 to 65 years who want to lengthen the screening interval, screening with a combination of cytology and HPV testing every 5 years. See the Clinical Considerations for discussion of cytology method, HPV testing, and screening interval (A recommendation). The USPSTF recommends against screening for cervical cancer in women younger than age 21 years (D recommendation). The USPSTF recommends against screening for cervical cancer in women older than age 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer. See the Clinical Considerations for discussion of adequacy of prior screening and risk factors (D recommendation). The USPSTF recommends against screening for cervical cancer in women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and who do not have a history of a high-grade precancerous lesion (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3) or cervical cancer (D recommendation). The USPSTF recommends against screening for cervical cancer with HPV testing, alone or in combination with cytology, in women younger than age 30 years (D recommendation).

### Risk of cervical abnormality after age 50 in women with previously negative smears [^e67f7361]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

There has been much discussion since the early 1990's about the benefit of continuing cervical screening in women over the age 50 years with a history of repeated negative cytology. It has been suggested that such women are at very low risk of having pre-invasive lesions and therefore of developing invasive cancer, and that ceasing screening in this group could alleviate anxiety and enable better allocation of resources.

Cervical screening aims to prevent the occurrence of invasive cancer by detecting pre-invasive lesions (CIN 1, 2 and 3). The prevalence of pre-invasive cervical lesions decreases with age and women screened over the age of 50 have a considerably lower risk of having abnormal cytology results. The risk of mild or worse dyskaryosis varies from around 10% for women in their early twenties to only around 1% for women over 50 years. The rate of progression of most lesions destined to become invasive cancer is generally considered to be slow, and one might therefore anticipate that a negative smear history before the age of 50 would considerably reduce the risk of positive cytology or histology in women aged 50–64 years (the upper age of invitation to screening in the UK), who have been regularly screened. In the 1990's it was suggested, based on evidence from the Tayside area of Scotland, that women over the age of 50 years with an adequate history of negative results on smear testing every 3 years may be safely discharged from further screening. There have been few studies to test this, however, and the only large study directly considering the question had relatively short screening histories.

We have therefore undertaken a large cohort study to investigate the risk of a positive primary smear result at the first routine recall episode after the age of 50 years in women with a negative smear history at ages 40–49 years compared with women with other histories, and how the number of negative smears relates to this risk.

### The next generation of cervical cancer screening: should guidelines focus on best practices for the future or current screening capacity? [^50645366]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Current guidance exist for cytology alone, HPV tests alone, and Pap and HPV co-testing. These guidelines allow for flexibility related to the resources available in different settings nationwide but also generate confusion because clinicians struggle to determine which test or combination of tests to use, how often to perform them, and how the results of different testing combinations should be interpreted. Adding to the challenge is the aging of vaccinated women into the screening population. Because HPV vaccination substantially reduces the risk of precancer, – fewer women with "positive" screening results will actually have precancer, changing the predictive value of a given screening test for vaccinated women.

The question addressed in this forum is how the next set of guidelines should shape US screening practices. Should guidelines be aspirational, looking ahead 5 to 10 years in the future and presenting the best case scenario in terms of equal access and correct implementation of the highest quality screening tools, or should guidelines be practical, focusing on the tools and resources available today, but with the understanding that frequent revisions will be needed as we look to the future?

### Cervical cancer screening for individuals at average risk: 2020 guideline update from the American cancer society [^b8950fa2]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Adequate screening and documentation before cessation — screening history thresholds and operational guidance are as follows: A majority of cases of invasive cervical cancer occur in individuals who have never been screened or have not been adequately screened. According to the 2018 National Health Interview Survey data, 90% of respondents aged 30 to 39 years reported being up to date with screening; this rate declines to 80% among women aged 50 to 65 years, and underscreening is concerning because individuals with a 10-year history of normal screening results may discontinue screening after age 65 years. The criterion for cessation is adequate negative prior screening, currently defined as 2 consecutive negative human papillomavirus (HPV) tests, or 2 consecutive negative cotests, or 3 consecutive negative cytology tests within the past 10 years, with the most recent primary HPV test, cotest, or cytology-alone test occurring within their recommended intervals. Documentation gaps are common: in a national administrative database, only 29% of the 110,961 potentially eligible women met cessation criteria based on available documentation; limiting to those continuously enrolled for ≥ 10 years increased this to 53%. Clinicians and health care systems should implement programs to identify and screen individuals with no or inadequate recent screening, and in the absence of accessible confirmation of recent negative results, clinicians should continue to offer screening to individuals without conditions limiting life expectancy until criteria for cessation are confirmed.

### Specialty differences in primary care physician reports of Papanicolaou test screening practices: a national survey, 2006 to 2007 [^197352bb]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Cervical cancer screening guidelines were substantially revised in 2002 and 2003. Little information is available about primary care physicians' current Papanicolaou (Pap) test screening practices, including initiation, frequency, and stopping.

Objective

To assess current Pap test screening practices in the United States.

Design

Cross-sectional survey.

Setting

Nationally representative sample of physicians during 2006 to 2007.

Participants

1212 primary care physicians.

Measurements

The survey included questions about physician and practice characteristics and recommendations for Pap screening presented as clinical vignettes describing women by age and by sexual and screening histories. A composite measure-guideline-consistent recommendations-was created by using responses to vignettes in which major guidelines were uniform.

Results

Most physicians reported providing Pap tests to their eligible patients (91.0% [95% CI, 89.0% to 92.6%]). Among Pap test providers (n = 1114), screening practices, including number of tests ordered or performed, use of patient reminder systems, and cytology method used, varied by physician specialty (P < 0.001). Although most Pap test providers reported that screening guidelines were very influential in their clinical practice, few had guideline-consistent recommendations for starting and stopping Pap screening across multiple vignettes (22.3% [CI, 19.9% to 25.0%]). Guideline-consistent recommendations varied by specialty (obstetrics/gynecology, 16.4%; internal medicine, 27.5%; and family or general practice, 21.1%). Compared with obstetricians/gynecologists, internal medicine specialists and family or general practice specialists were more likely to have guideline-consistent screening recommendations (odds ratio, 1.98 [CI, 1.22 to 3.23] and 1.45 [CI, 0.99 to 2.13], respectively) in multivariate analysis.

Limitation

Physician self-report may reflect idealized rather than actual practice.

Conclusion

Primary care physicians' recommendations for Pap test screening are not consistent with screening guidelines, reflecting overuse of screening. Implementation of effective interventions that focus on potentially modifiable physician and practice factors is needed to improve screening practice.

### The ASCCP cervical cancer screening task force endorsement and opinion on the American cancer society updated cervical cancer screening guidelines [^cdf06b6b]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2021). High credibility.

Cervical cancer screening — exit criteria and follow-up for older patients specify that guidelines require 3 consecutive negative cervical cytology results or 2 consecutive cotesting results 10 years before cessation of screening with the last testing within 5 years; the 2019 ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines recommend that patients with persistent minor abnormalities or prior treatment of high-grade precancerous lesions be followed for at least 25 years, even if this extends beyond 65 years of age, and under-screening remains common, with 13% of patients aged 65 years not properly screened and 37.1% in women without a regular primary care provider, with most invasive cervical cancers in patients older than 65 years occurring in those who did not meet exit criteria.

### Preferences for human papillomavirus testing with routine cervical cancer screening in diverse older women [^2d8c8cd5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is increasingly being used to determine the optimal cervical cancer screening interval in older women. Little is known about women's attitudes toward HPV testing or how these attitudes may influence medical discussions about cervical cancer screening.

Methods

Preferences for HPV and concomitant Papanicolaou (Pap) testing were assessed through in-person interviews with diverse women aged 50 to 80 years recruited from community and university-based practices.

Results

Eight hundred and sixty-five women (257 White, 87 African American, 149 Latina, and 372 Asian) were interviewed. Approximately 60% of participants wanted to be tested for HPV and another 15% would undergo testing if recommended by their physician. Among those wanting HPV testing, 94% would want more frequent than annual Pap tests if they had a positive HPV test and a normal Pap test. Two thirds of those under age 65 would be willing to switch to triennial Pap testing, and half of those aged 65 and older would be willing to discontinue Pap testing, if they had a negative HPV test and normal Pap test. Preferences for testing varied by ethnicity, age, place of birth, and cancer history.

Conclusions

The majority of older women were willing to use HPV testing to make decisions about frequency and duration of cervical cancer screening, but up to one third would want at least annual, ongoing screening regardless of HPV test results. Efforts should be made to ensure that HPV testing is used to reinforce appropriate utilization of screening tests.

### Cervical cancer screening in average-risk women: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^4a551bed]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Description

The purpose of this best practice advice article is to describe the indications for screening for cervical cancer in asymptomatic, average-risk women aged 21 years or older.

Methods

The evidence reviewed in this work is a distillation of relevant publications (including systematic reviews) used to support current guidelines.

Best Practice Advice 1

Clinicians should not screen average-risk women younger than 21 years for cervical cancer.

Best Practice Advice 2

Clinicians should start screening average-risk women for cervical cancer at age 21 years once every 3 years with cytology (cytologic tests without human papillomavirus [HPV] tests).

Best Practice Advice 3

Clinicians should not screen average-risk women for cervical cancer with cytology more often than once every 3 years.

Best Practice Advice 4

Clinicians may use a combination of cytology and HPV testing once every 5 years in average-risk women aged 30 years or older who prefer screening less often than every 3 years.

Best Practice Advice 5

Clinicians should not perform HPV testing in average-risk women younger than 30 years.

Best Practice Advice 6

Clinicians should stop screening average-risk women older than 65 years for cervical cancer if they have had 3 consecutive negative cytology results or 2 consecutive negative cytology plus HPV test results within 10 years, with the most recent test performed within 5 years.

Best Practice Advice 7

Clinicians should not screen average-risk women of any age for cervical cancer if they have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix.

HPV test: Recommended age: Starting at age 25 (some organizations recommend 30). Frequency: Every 5 years (if negative). What it detects: Presence of high‐risk HPV types linked to cervical cancer. Benefits: Highly sensitive and can detect precancerous changes before symptoms appear.
Pap test (Papanicolaou smear [cervical smear]): Recommended age: Starting at age 21 years (some organizations recommend 30). Frequency: Every 3 years (if negative), co‐testing with HPV every 5 years after age 30 years (some organizations recommend co‐testing starting at age 25). What it detects: Abnormal cervical cells that could potentially become cancerous. Benefits: Established and reliable test for detecting precancerous changes.
Additional considerations: Women with a history of abnormal cervical smear tests or HPV infection may require more frequent screening. Women who have received the HPV vaccine should still follow recommended screening guidelines. Consult your healthcare provider for personalized screening recommendations based on your individual history and risk factors.

### Incidence of cervical cancer after several negative smear results by age 50: prospective observational study [^483e15f3]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The debate on early cessation of cervical cancer screening for women with several consecutive negative smear results and no abnormalities by age 50 has been ongoing for about 15 years, with no clear conclusions in terms of a change to guideline for these women. Several authors have studied this issue by analysing the detection rates of preinvasive cervical lesions in these women. In general, they observed considerably lower detection rates than in similarly screened younger women. On the basis of this finding they argued that continued screening in this particular group of women is not as efficient as screening among younger women and could be stopped at the expense of only a limited increase in the incidence of cervical cancer among these older women. This could result in considerable savings for the screening programmes. In the Netherlands, for example, it would apply to about half of the women attending screening around age 50.

Because there is strong evidence that cervical intraepithelial neoplasia lesions have a higher probability to progress to invasive cancer at older ages, a lower detection rate after age 50 alone does not represent conclusive evidence for lower screening efficiency. Data on invasive cancer have since become available in a Dutch nationwide pathology registry with screening histories linked to diagnostic histological outcomes (including cancer) at the individual level. We measured the incidence of invasive cancer after several consecutive negative smear results in women around age 50 and in younger women. This bypasses the problems associated with using cervical intraepithelial neoplasia lesions and enables a more conclusive evaluation of whether there is more reason to relax screening in older than in younger women with similar negative screening histories.

### Cervical cancer screening in average-risk women: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^80fae576]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians best practice advice — cervical cancer screening in average-risk women specifies that clinicians should not screen average-risk women younger than 21 years for cervical cancer, should start screening at age 21 years once every 3 years with cytology (cytologic tests without HPV tests), and should not screen with cytology more often than once every 3 years. Clinicians may use a combination of cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing once every 5 years in average-risk women aged 30 years or older who prefer screening less often than every 3 years, and should not perform HPV testing in average-risk women younger than 30 years. Clinicians should stop screening average-risk women older than age 65 y for cervical cancer if they have had 3 consecutive negative cytology results or 2 consecutive negative cotesting results within 10 y, with the most recent test performed within 5 y, and should not screen average-risk women of any age for cervical cancer if they have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix.

### Cervical cancer screening for individuals at average risk: 2020 guideline update from the American cancer society [^c5aa7752]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Guideline development and evidence sources — The guideline development group chose to use 2 reports commissioned by the USPSTF for its 2018 update as sources of evidence: a systematic evidence review on cervical screening by the Kaiser Permanente Research Affiliates Evidence‑Based Practice Center and a decision analysis based on a mathematical disease‑simulation model from the Center for Health Decision Science of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health; the ACS staff also conducted continued surveillance and reviewed potentially relevant articles after the publication date of the evidence review report (August 2018). The systematic review's data analysis was restricted mostly to randomized controlled trials conducted in women aged 25 to 65 years. Historical ACS recommendations stated that cervical cancer screening should be initiated at age 21 years and that women aged ≥ 65 years who have a history of regular screening with negative results should discontinue screening.

### Do women ≥ 50 years of age need as much screening as women [^8852efd5]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

To assess the adequacy of a routine screening to identify cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or worse (CIN2+) in women over 50 years of age, a retrospective cohort was set in six Italian organised population-based screening programmes. In all, 287 330 women (1 714 550 person-years of observation, 1110 cases) screened at age 25–64, with at least two cytological screening tests, the first negative, were followed from their first negative smear until a biopsy proven CIN2+ lesion or their last negative smear. For women aged 25–49 and 50–64 years, crude and age-standardised detection rate (DR), cumulative risk (CR), adjusted hazard risk for number of previous negative screens, probability of false-positive CIN2+ after two or more smear tests were calculated. Detection rate is significantly lower over 50 years of age. Multivariable analysis shows a significant protective effect from four screening episodes (DR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.51–0.97); the effect of age ⩾50 is 0.29 (95% CI: 0.24–0.35). The CR of CIN2+ is at least eightfold higher in women < 50 (CR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.88–2.23) after one previous negative test than in women ⩾50 years with four screens (CR = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.00–0.46). Over 50 years of age, after four tests at least three false-positive cases are diagnosed for every true positive. Benefits arising from cytological screening is uncertain in well-screened older women.

### Do women ≥ 50 years of age need as much screening as women [^39ddf53b]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Detection rates are affected by the duration of sojourn time and by the proportion of lesions that regress. Moreover, the sensitivity of smear test for long-sojourn time lesions as CIN2 depends on the number of smear tests performed during the sojourn time; on the other hand, frequent testing increases the DR of those significant lesions. This last effect may explain the observed risk reduction when the number of screening episodes increases, particularly after four negative tests.

The results of the present study are in agreement with other studies showing a risk reduction with increasing age and the number of previous negative smear tests.

Few cases of preinvasive lesions were diagnosed ex novo in well-screened women aged over 50 years (two or more 3- to 5-yearly negative screens) or in women with three consecutive (at most 3-yearly) negative screens before 50 years age or in women with at least three negative smear tests screens between 41 and 49 years of age.

Considering invasive cervical cancer, a trend of decreasing risk with increasing number of smear tests is reported.

In Turin (Italy), invasive carcinoma incidence during 1992–1998 was reduced by 75% in women who attended one screening at least, as compared to nonattenders (3.0 vs 9.5/100 000 person-years), the latter showing the highest incidence.

The results of the present study, in accordance with other reports, may suggest that the adequacy of a routine screening test to identify early lesions in women over 50 years of age with at least four previous negative screens is questionable; possible alternative strategies may be explored. Women might be involved in the decision whether to stop screening or to undergo just another smear test in their life after evaluating the individual risk of a CIN2+ at further screening through algorithms based on age, screening history and living area-specific DRs. Comparing the future individual risk of being a case or a false positive may support and strengthen individual choices. The decision of stopping screening may also be supported by a negative result of HPV testing.

Cervical cancer screening frequency and initiation — To minimize harm, screening before age 21 years is not recommended, regardless of sexual history; annual screening is no longer recommended because too-frequent screening leads to higher rates of false-positive results with little effect on subsequent cervical cancer; the estimated average time for a high-grade precancerous lesion to progress to cervical cancer is 10 years.

### Risk of cervical abnormality after age 50 in women with previously negative smears [^2336a4fc]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

There is discussion over the benefit of continuing cervical screening in women over the age of 50 with a history of negative cytology. We aimed to determine the risk of abnormal cytology in such women. Screening history data from 1985 to 2003 were obtained for a cohort of 2 million women from the NHS cervical screening programme from four Health Authorities in England. The 57,651 women in the cohort who reached age 40 between 1 January 1985 and 31 December 1990 and had at least one routine or opportunistic smear between ages 50 and 54 were included in the analysis. Exposure groups (negative cytology history, negative but including inadequate smears, and positive history) were defined on the basis of screening histories from ages 40 to 49. Sixty-four percent (134/206) (95% CI: 57–71%) of the moderate dyskaryosis or worse lesions at ages over 50 were detected from women in the negative smear history group. After allowance for time since last negative smear, the relative risk for the first primary smear over the age of 50 having moderate dyskaryosis or worse decreased from 0.60 (95% CI: 0.41–0.84) for two negative smear episodes to 0.25 (95% CI: 0.10–0.56) for four negative smear episodes, compared with the positive history group. If screening were discontinued for all women over 50 with a negative history, the majority of cytological abnormalities now being detected at these ages that lead directly to referral to colposcopy would be missed.

Efficacy of screening in older individuals — the performance of cytology and HPV screening in individuals aged > 65 years, especially those not meeting cessation criteria before age 65, is incompletely understood and the potential benefit of cervical cancer screening is likely diminished with increasing age due to anatomic, hormonal, immunologic, and musculoskeletal changes, which may make examinations difficult or painful and limit access to the transformation zone for adequate sampling.

Cervical cancer screening guidelines have evolved significantly over the past ten years in the adolescent population. The objective of this article is to review the cervical screening guidelines in the adolescent population as well as examine the evidence and studies that support delaying screening until 21 years old. Delaying HPV and Papanicolaou testing until 21 years old is safe and will not increase cervical cancer rates in the adolescent population.

### Screening for cervical cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^e8fcaebd]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF cervical cancer screening — response to public comment: A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from September 12, 2017, through October 13, 2017. In response to these comments, the USPSTF now notes throughout the recommendation statement that women aged 30 to 65 years may choose to get screened every 3 years with cervical cytology alone, every 5 years with hrHPV testing alone, or every 5 years with cotesting. Some comments highlighted implementation issues due to a lack of tests approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for primary cervical cancer screening, and the USPSTF added language emphasizing factors that affect overall screening effectiveness, including the primary screening test, screening ages, screening interval, test characteristics, and follow-up protocols, including triage of screen-positive women.

### Cervical cancer screening intervals preferred by U.S. women [^14a560ad]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Many U.S. women continue to be screened annually for cervical cancer, despite current guidelines that recommend 3- or 5-year screening intervals depending on screening modality and patient age.

Methods

Data from 2012 and 2015 web-based surveys of U.S. adults were analyzed in 2017 to investigate U.S. women's cervical cancer screening preferences. The study was limited to women aged ≥ 18 years without a hysterectomy or cervical cancer diagnosis (2012 n = 1,380, 2015 n = 1,339).

Results

Women's preference for 3- or 5-year screening intervals doubled during the study period (2012: 31.2%, 2015: 64.2%, p < 0.001). The most preferred screening options in 2015 were co-testing every 3 years with the Pap and human papillomavirus tests (34.0%) and annual Pap testing (30.4%)-neither of which were recommended at that time or currently. Use of 3- and 5-year Pap testing intervals increased during the study period (2012: 6.9%, 2015: 12.9%, p < 0.001), whereas annual Pap testing declined (2012: 48.5%, 2015: 35.6%, p < 0.001). Among women who were regularly screened and preferred 3- or 5-year screening intervals, the minority reported screening practices that matched this preference (2012: 24.1%, 2015: 29.3%, p = 0.71).

Conclusions

Women's preference for longer cervical cancer screening intervals has increased rapidly and outpaced utilization. At the same time, many women continue to be screened annually. Expanding appropriate screening may require increasing women's and providers' comfort with screening recommendations.

### Cervical cancer screening for individuals at average risk: 2020 guideline update from the American cancer society [^8e6cc07d]. CA (2020). High credibility.

American Cancer Society 2020 cervical cancer screening — cessation criteria: The ACS recommends that individuals with a cervix who are older than age 65 years, who have no history of CIN2+ within the past 25 years, and who have documented adequate negative prior screening in the prior 10 years discontinue cervical cancer screening with any modality (qualified recommendation). Adequate negative prior screening is currently defined as 2 consecutive negative HPV (human papillomavirus) tests, or 2 consecutive negative cotests, or 3 consecutive negative cytology tests within the past 10 years, with the most recent test occurring within the recommended interval for the test used. These criteria do not apply to individuals who are currently under surveillance for abnormal screening results. Individuals aged > 65 years without conditions limiting life expectancy for whom sufficient documentation of prior screening is not available should be screened until cessation criteria are met, and cervical cancer screening may be discontinued in individuals of any age with limited life expectancy.

### Risk of cervical abnormality after age 50 in women with previously negative smears [^d1beaff5]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Methods

We assembled a population-based cohort of 2 million women from four health authorities (two areas invited 3 yearly and two other areas 5 yearly) in England with cervical screening histories covering the period 1 January 1985 to around March 2004 (the exact date dependent on the area of residence), using information obtained from the national computerised call-recall system. Women within this cohort with dates of birth between 1 January 1945 and 31 December 1950 and still resident and eligible in the same areas for invitation to screening at March 2004 have been included in the current analysis. These women reached age of 40 years between 1 January 1985 and 31 December 1990 (around the start of the national computerised call-recall system circa 1988) and we have details on the computerised system of 10 years of screening history between ages of 40 and 49 years and a minimum of 3 years follow-up after reaching age of 50 years.

For analysis, we divided the screening histories into 'episodes' starting with a routine or opportunistic ('primary') smear and ending with a ('closing') smear that returned the woman back to routine recall or cessation of screening (e.g. because of a hysterectomy). For most episodes the primary smear was negative with an action of return to routine recall, and therefore the primary smear was also the closing smear. We included in our analysis women in the cohort with a primary smear between the ages of 50 and 54 years; these are therefore routine or opportunistic smears and not repeat or follow-up tests. The cohort and our use of episodes is described in detail in an earlier paper.

We allocated women to three groups for analysis on the basis of their screening history between ages of 40 and 49 years. 'Negative' history was defined as at least two episodes, all of which were single smear episodes with a negative result and an action of return to routine recall. 'Inadequate' history was defined as one or more episodes that included an inadequate smear result, but no abnormal cytology results. 'Positive' history was defined as one or more episodes that included a smear with results of borderline abnormal cytology or worse. Women with smear histories consisting of only one negative episode were not included in the study.

### Health maintenance for postmenopausal women [^0116f2ca]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Menopause is the permanent cessation of menstruation resulting from the loss of ovarian and follicular activity. It usually occurs when women reach their early 50s. Vasomotor symptoms and vaginal dryness are frequently reported during menopause. Estrogen is the most effective treatment for management of hot flashes and night sweats. Local estrogen is preferred for vulvovaginal symptoms because of its excellent therapeutic response. Bone mineral density screening should be performed in all women older than 65 years, and should begin sooner in women with additional risk factors for osteoporotic fractures. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D should be encouraged for all postmenopausal women to reduce bone loss. Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in women. Postmenopausal women should be counseled regarding lifestyle modification, including smoking cessation and regular physical activity. All women should receive periodic measurement of blood pressure and lipids. Appropriate pharmacotherapy should be initiated when indicated. Women should receive breast cancer screening every one to two years beginning at age 40, as well as colorectal cancer screening beginning at age 50. Women younger than 65 years who are sexually active and have a cervix should receive routine cervical cancer screening with Papanicolaou smear. Recommended immunizations for menopausal women include an annual influenza vaccine, a tetanus and diphtheria toxoid booster every 10 years, and a one-time pneumococcal vaccine after age 65 years.

### Frequency of high-grade squamous cervical lesions among women over age 65 years living with HIV [^45820a40]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Current US cervical cancer screening guidelines recommend screening cessation at the age of 65 years provided women have adequate previous screening and no history of precancer. Women living with HIV are at higher risk of cervical cancer than women living without HIV. Furthermore, limited data exists to quantify the risk of cervical cancer among women who otherwise would qualify for screening cessation.

Objective

This study aimed to determine whether guidelines recommending women to discontinue cervical cancer screening at the age of 65 years are appropriate for women living with HIV.

Study Design

Semiannual Papanicolaou testing was performed as part of surveillance visits in the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Launched in October 1994, the Women's Interagency HIV Study is a federally funded US multisite cohort study that has enrolled 3678 women living with HIV and 1304 women living without HIV; we included data throughout September 2019 onward. Conventional Papanicolaou tests were collected at scheduled 6-month visits and read centrally according to the 1991 Bethesda System criteria. Results were analyzed among women at least 65 years of age. The primary endpoint was high-grade cytology, including high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions; atypical glandular cells; atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high-grade lesions; and malignant cytology. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare the continuous variables, and Chi-square tests or the Fisher exact tests were used to compare the categorical variables. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the cumulative incidence. Poisson regression was used to compare 2 incidence rates.

Results

Of 169 eligible women (121 women living with HIV and 48 women living without HIV) who contributed 678.4 person-years of observation after reaching the age of 65 years, 2.2% had high-grade cytologic abnormalities. However, no cancer was found. Furthermore, 20 women had previous precancer results, and 74 women had abnormal Papanicolaou test results in the previous decade. Among 50 women (38 women living with HIV and 12 women living without HIV) with a previous hysterectomy and no history of cervical precancer, the cumulative incidence rates of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions were 0.6 (95% confidence interval, 0.0–3.2) per 100 person-years for women living with HIV and 0.0 (95% confidence interval, 0.0–8.1) per 100 person-years for women living without HIV (P = 0.61). Only 48 women (27 women living with HIV and 21 women living without HIV) had cervices and met the current guidelines to discontinue screening; their risk of experiencing high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions was 2.2 (95% confidence interval, 0.6–5.5) per 100 person-years overall and did not vary by HIV status (2.3 [95% confidence interval, 0.5–6.8] per 100 person-years for women living with HIV and 1.8 [95% confidence interval, 0.0–9.8] per 100 person-years for women living without HIV; P = 0.81).

Conclusion

Most women living with HIV do not meet the criteria for cervical cancer screening cessation and will need to continue screening over the age of 65 years; however, women who meet the criteria for screening cessation have risks of high-grade squamous lesions similar to women living without HIV and may choose to discontinue.

### European guidelines for quality assurance in cervical cancer screening. second edition – summary document [^970438fd]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

fundamental points and principles

screening policy

The Council of the EU has recommended implementation of population-based cervical cancer screening programmes to the EU member states, with quality assurance at all levels and in accordance with European guidelines.
Screening recommended by the European Council and the European Guidelines is set up as a population-based public health programme, with identification and personal invitation of each woman in the eligible target population. In addition to invitation, the other steps in the screening process and the professional and organisational management of the screening service, including quality assurance, monitoring and evaluation, are well defined by programme policy, rules and regulations at the regional and national level.
Designing a cervical cancer screening programme includes defining the screening policy, i.e. choosing the screening test systems, determining the target age group and the screening interval between normal test results (3 or 5 years) and establishing follow-up and treatment strategies for screen-positive women, taking into account the variation in background risk in target populations and the natural history of the disease, which is characterised by a rather long detectable preclinical period and substantial regression rates of the precancerous lesions.
Cervical cytology is the currently recommended standard test for cervix screening, which should start in the age range 20–30, but preferentially not before age 25 or 30 years, depending on the burden of the disease in the population and the available resources. It is recommended to continue screening at 3- to 5-year intervals until the age of 60 or 65. Stopping screening in older women is probably appropriate among women who have had three or more consecutive previous (recent) normal cytology results.
Special attention should be paid to the problem of older women who have never attended screening as they exhibit increased risk for cervical cancer.
Opportunistic screening, which takes place in clinical settings and depends on the initiative of the individual woman or her doctor, should be discouraged. Such activities are often characterised by high coverage in selected parts of the population which are screened too frequently, coexisting with a low coverage in other population groups with less socioeconomic status, and heterogeneous quality, resulting in limited effectiveness and poor cost-effectiveness.

American College of Physicians best practice advice — HPV testing limits, cessation of screening, and post-hysterectomy guidance states: Clinicians should not perform HPV testing in average-risk women younger than 30 years; Clinicians should stop screening average-risk women older than 65 years for cervical cancer if they have had 3 consecutive negative cytology results or 2 consecutive negative cytology plus HPV test results within 10 years, with the most recent test performed within 5 years; and Clinicians should not screen average-risk women of any age for cervical cancer if they have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix.

### The ASCCP cervical cancer screening task force endorsement and opinion on the American cancer society updated cervical cancer screening guidelines [^22ee4c3d]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2021). High credibility.

Cervical cancer screening strategies — USPSTF (2018) and ACS (2020) specify age- and history-based intervals and modalities. For age < 21 years, both list no screening, and for ages 21–25 years, USPSTF lists cytology alone every 3 years while ACS lists no screening. For ages 25–29, USPSTF lists cytology alone every 3 years, and for ages 30–65, USPSTF lists cytology alone every 3 years, cotesting every 5 years, or primary HPV test every 5 years. For ages 25–29 and 30–65 in ACS (2020), preferred is primary HPV test every 5 years and acceptable options are cotesting every 5 years or cytology alone every 3 years. Screening cessation differs: USPSTF states no screening after adequate negative prior screening, defined as 2 consecutive negative primary HPV tests, 2 negative cotests, or 3 negative cytology tests within the last 10 years with the most recent in the past 3–5 years, while ACS states no screening is necessary in those without a history of CIN 2+ or a more severe diagnosis in the past 25 years or cervical cancer ever. After total hysterectomy, USPSTF states no screening is necessary without a history of high-grade cervical dysplasia or cervical cancer, while ACS uses the CIN 2+ criterion with the 25-year lookback; for prior HPV vaccination, both direct to follow age-specific recommendations.

### Cervical cancer screening: evidence behind the guidelines [^ca522b1c]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Cervical cancer screening involves a complex process of cytology, human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, colposcopy, and a multitude of algorithms for the identification of preinvasive disease and prevention of invasive disease. High-risk HPV is a prerequisite for the development of almost all types of cervical cancer; therefore, a test for high-risk HPV has become an integral part of new screening strategies. Major changes to screening guidelines in the last decade include initiation of screening at age 21 years, conservative management of young women with abnormal cytology, extended screening intervals for women age ≥ 30 years, and cessation of screening in low-risk women at age 65 years. This review will focus on the evidence that has led to the current evidence-based guidelines. Evidence regarding primary HPV testing as well as postvaccine-based screening strategies will also be reviewed.

### Cancer screening test use-United States, 2013 [^327d11fd]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

For this report, screening histories were examined only for persons in age groups recommended for routine screening. However, nearly one fourth of persons aged 51–65 years and 30% of those aged 65–75 years reported no recent cervical cancer and CRC screening, respectively, thus some might reach upper age limits for routine screening without adequate prior screening. Although USPSTF does not recommend routine screening for cervical cancer among average-risk women aged > 65 years or for CRC among adults aged 76–85 years, †† screening might be indicated for some adults in these older groups who were not screened adequately when they were in a younger age group for which routine screening was recommended.

The findings in this report are subject to at least seven limitations. First, NHIS data are self-reported and not verified by medical records. Second, the response rate was 61%, and nonresponse bias is possible despite adjustments for nonresponse. Third, although age-adjusted percentages for screening are presented that are consistent with Healthy People 2020 targets overall, percentages for subgroups are not age-adjusted. Fourth, Pap test data for 2003 were excluded because hysterectomy status was unknown. Fifth, screening guidelines and NHIS screening questions have changed over time. Sixth, confidence intervals were wide for some subgroups, indicating estimate imprecision. Finally, diagnostic tests rather than screening tests might have been reported by some respondents, possibly leading to overestimates of screening.

Increased efforts are needed to reach Healthy People 2020 cancer screening targets and reduce disparities. More intensive or focused efforts might be required to overcome persistent barriers among specific population subgroups. Making available all recommended CRC screening options might increase alignment of tests with individual needs and preferences, and facilitate screening completion. Evidence-based interventions can increase screening use. Information about recommended interventions is available for communities and health systems from The Community Guide. §§ Cancer Control PLANET provides resources for designing and implementing evidence-based programs. Such resources can help communities identify and implement effective interventions appropriate for their needs to increase use of these important services.

What is already known on this topic?

Screening is effective for detecting breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers early when the cancers can be more easily treated and deaths averted. Healthy People 2020 established targets for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening in the United States. Disparities in screening use related to several demographic and health care access factors have been observed.

Abnormal cervical screening — background and scope motivating the 2006 update state that guidelines were developed to help clinicians manage approximately 4.8 million women diagnosed annually with cytological abnormalities in the United States, with new data on human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for screening in women 30 years and older and interim guidance proposed in 2004. The revision culminated in the 2006 Consensus Conference at the National Institutes of Health in September 2006, and this report provides the recommendations developed for managing women with cytological abnormalities.

### Patient information: cervical cancer screening… [^78928159]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Cervical precancer involves cellular changes in the cervix caused by HPV infection that can lead to cervical cancer if not treated. Approximately 100 000 people in the US are diagnosed and treated for cervical precancer each year. In the US, cervical cancer is diagnosed in about 14 000 people annually, and more than 4000 individuals die from cervical cancer each year. Most people who develop cervical cancer have not been screened in more than 5 years. Some had an abnormal screening test and did not follow up. Who Should Be Screened. Cervical cancer screening is recommended at least every 5 years for all individuals with a cervix aged 21 to 65 years. Individuals with a higher-than-average risk of cervical precancer should be screened more frequently.

Screening for cervical cancer can be stopped at age 65 years in individuals with At least 3 consecutive negative Pap tests or 2 consecutive negative HPV tests in the past 10 years, with the most recent in the previous 5 years No abnormal test results during the previous 10 years No history of cervical cancer. No history of cervical precancer during the previous 25 years No immunosuppression What Happens If a Cervical Screening Test Is Positive. To determine the risk of precancer, individuals with a positive cervicovaginal HPV result should have additional testing, which is usually done with a Pap smear. If abnormal cells are identified on the Pap smear, patients typically undergo colposcopy and may have a biopsy to see if precancer is present. Precancer is usually treated with a minor surgical procedure to remove abnormal cells. Treatment of precancer prevents cancer more than 90% of the time.

If cervical cancer is diagnosed, possible treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Cervical Cancer Prevention Vaccination against HPV is likely to prevent more than 90% of cervical precancers and cancers. Guidelines recommend that all children aged 9 to 12 years receive 2 doses of HPV vaccine given 6 to 12 months apart. HPV vaccination is also recommended for individuals aged 13 to 26 years who were not previously vaccinated, with 3 doses of HPV vaccine given when vaccination begins at age 15 years or older.

3) Update to interval for repeating unsatisfactory cytology: The recommendation statement has been updated to reflect evidence that waiting 2 months before repeating the cytology test is not necessary.

Guideline: For patients with an unsatisfactory cytology result and no, unknown, or a negative HPV test result, repeat age-based screening (cytology, cotest, or primary HPV test) as soon as convenient and no later than 4 months is recommended (BIII).

Rationale: The 2- to 4-month waiting period was initially proposed due to early studies indicating differences in cytology results repeated over a short time interval. The recommendation was carried forward through several guideline iterations, but rereview of evidence supports revision of the 2-month waiting period. A seminal article in 2005 specifically addressed this question and found the concern of reduced cellularity with short interval repeat not to hold true. In this study, the cytology interval ranged from 8 to 30 days in 763 women, 31 to 60 days in 2,317 women, 61 to 90 days in 1,090 women, 91 to 120 days in 491 women, and 121 to 184 days in 394 women. They found that repeat cytologic interpretations of unsatisfactory findings, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) did not vary among the Pap interval groups. Most importantly, the approximate cellularity of the samples was slightly better in the interval group of 8 to 30 days (P trend = 0.04). In addition, higher rates of unsatisfactory results have been documented in patients with cancer compared with those with CIN3 or lower grade results. Waiting to repeat an unsatisfactory cytology in the presence of cancer could lead to harm, specifically if other recommended workup for symptomatic patients is not performed. For this reason, the 2019 recommendations were updated.

### Estimated cancer risk in females who meet the criteria to exit cervical cancer screening [^f0ecd75d]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

In 2012, the American Cancer Society, American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, American Society for Clinical Pathology, and US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines were harmonized with a recommendation that females who have been adequately screened for cervical cancer can exit screening at age 65 years. Adequate screening is defined as either 3 consecutive negative Papanicolaou test results (ie, cytology) or 2 consecutive negative concurrent human papillomavirus (HPV) and Papanicolaou test results (ie, cotests) since age 55 years among females, with the most recent test administered within the past 5 years. Although recent updates to the guidelines have occurred, recommendations regarding the criteria and age to end screening have remained unchanged since 2012. As noted by the USPSTF in its recommendation statement, however, the epidemiologic evidence to support a definitive age to end screening in older females is lacking.

While modeling has been used to estimate the risk of cancer in females who have been screened with cytology or HPV-based tests, to our knowledge, the risk in the subgroup of females who have met the cotesting criteria to exit screening in the US has not been estimated. Until recently, there were limited empirical data to validate model-estimated risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3), a surrogate outcome for cancer risk, and of cancer in well-screened populations. A study by Landy et alcalculated the 3- and 5-year risks of cervical precancer (defined as CIN3 or adenocarcinoma in situ) based on an analysis of over 346 000 females aged 55 to 64 years who attended screening at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). For females aged 60 to 64 years at their second consecutive negative cotest result, the 3- and 5-year risks of CIN3 were 0.015% (95% CI, 0%-0.031%) and 0.058% (95% CI, 0.006%-0.109%), respectively. No females in this cohort were diagnosed with cervical cancer during follow-up.

### Cervical cancer screening in menopause: when is it safe to exit? [^ce1c959b]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Importance and Objective

Despite a decreasing incidence of cervical cancer in North America overall, disparities in screening and cervical cancer rates persist, especially in the postmenopausal age group.

Methods

We reviewed the literature regarding cervical cancer screening considerations for postmenopausal persons, with a focus on cervical cancer in postmenopausal persons, existing guidelines, screening methods, and gaps in care.

Discussion and Conclusion

Postmenopausal persons are an important population at risk because age 65 years in the United States and up to 70 years in some parts of Canada is a milestone for screening cessation if the criteria are met. Unfortunately, inadequate screening is common, with most women 65 years or older discontinuing (exiting) screening despite not meeting the criteria to do so. Screening cessation recommendations are nuanced, and if not all criteria are met, screening should be continued until they are. Cervical cancer screening should be stopped at the recommended age if adequate screening has occurred or at any age if life expectancy is limited or the patient has had a hysterectomy in the absence of high-grade preinvasive cervical lesions or cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus infection, which is causally linked to almost all cervical cancer cases, can persist or reactivate from a prior infection or can be newly acquired from sexual contact. With more persons aging with a cervix in place, the potential for cervical cancer has increased, and higher cancer rates may be observed if recommended screening is not adhered to. We propose an algorithm based on current cervical cancer screening guidelines to aid providers in identifying whether exit criteria have been met. Until adequate screening has been confirmed, cervical cancer screening should continue.

### Cervical cancer screening for individuals at average risk: 2020 guideline update from the American cancer society [^bba29cd5]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Cervical cancer screening — limitations of evidence for primary HPV testing notes that the recommendation is based on randomized controlled trial (RCT) data limited to one or two rounds of screening with screening intervals varying from 3 to 5 years, and reporting of harms was not consistent across studies. These RCTs were generally conducted in organized screening settings, suggesting higher adherence than in the U.S. setting; continued accumulation of data over several rounds will provide greater confidence, but given the wide screening interval, serial testing data will require a lengthy observation period. In the U.S. opportunistic setting, the higher sensitivity of primary HPV testing and increased detection of CIN3+ may be especially beneficial to individuals who do not undergo regular screening. Disparities are noted with higher disease rates among Black and Hispanic women and women of lower socioeconomic status, populations not optimally represented in the RCTs, and although screening rates are not expected to perform differently in these individuals, this limitation is acknowledged. Projections from modeling studies were considered, limitations of the 2018 USPSTF model used to provide supplemental evidence have been documented previously, and questions remain regarding cessation age/criteria and the effectiveness of continued screening in well screened older women, including uncertainty about persistent HPV infection, reactivation, and new infections at older ages.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for cervical cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, ACP 2015 guidelines recommend to discontinue screening for cervical cancer in average-risk women aged > 65 years if they have had 3 consecutive negative cytology results or 2 consecutive negative cytology plus HPV test results within 10 years, with the most recent test performed within 5 years.

### Benefit of cervical screening at different ages: evidence from the UK audit of screening histories [^1d7170e3]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Another difficulty with identifying the last screening test is that once a woman has been treated for a cervical lesion, she could be put on indefinite annual follow-up. Our solution of censoring screening histories at the first abnormal smear is not ideal and it potentially introduces a small bias in favour of screening. Further, the fact that the RRs (in Table 4) are greater in the first time period than the second suggests that the 6-month exclusion is not quite sufficient and that these RRs should not be overinterpreted. Despite these caveats, we believe that this approach does provide reasonable estimates of the efficacy of 3- and 5-yearly (but not annual) screening (Table 5).

In younger women, the risk of disease in those whose last smear was more than 5.5 years ago was greater than in those who had no smears (Table 3 and 4). This suggests that those who opt out of screening altogether are at a lower underlying risk of cervical cancer than those who are screened occasionally. Opportunistic screening of women seeking contraceptive advice and those attending STD clinics could account for such a trend. What then is the appropriate baseline for estimating the RRs? We have used those with no smears, but use of those with no recent smear would have made the estimated effect of screening considerably greater in young women. The RR in women aged 20–39 years, whose most recent operationally negative smear was 3.5–4.5 years ago, was 1.06 relative to those with no such smear (Table 3). However, relative to those whose most recent negative smear was more than 6.5 years ago, it is 0.45 (= 1.06/2.37). In our opinion, such adjusted RRs are inappropriate: (ignoring the effect of screening) it is more likely that those who were last screened many years ago form a high-risk subgroup than that those who are never screened are at low risk. But this needs to be tested by a larger, more detailed study in young women in which risk factors for the acquisition and persistence of HPV infection are collected along with screening histories.

Implementation — participation in regular screening has a far greater effect on cervical cancer morbidity and mortality than which of the 3 recommended screening strategies is chosen for women ages 30 to 65 years, and implementation should therefore focus on ensuring that women receive adequate screening, regardless of which strategy is used.

The Pap test is the foundation of cervical cancer screening in North America and most industrialized countries. It has been widely used in the United States since the 1950s. But are our current screening guidelines still justified? In this article, the author reviews the current recommendations for cervical cancer screening by the American Cancer Society (ACS) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the evidence supporting them, reviews the relative efficacy of liquid-based cytology versus the conventional Pap smear, and discusses the role of HPV DNA testing in primary screening.

2006 consensus guidelines — General comments — For certain clinical situations there is limited high-quality evidence, and in these cases the guidelines have been based on consensus expert opinion. Acceptable management strategies reflect an acceptable level of risk of failing to detect high-grade neoplasia or cancer, and it is unreasonable to expect this risk can be reduced to zero; attempts to achieve zero risk could result in greater harm than good, including overtreatment. The guidelines should never substitute for clinical judgment, and clinical judgment should always be used when applying a guideline to an individual patient because it is impossible to develop guidelines that apply to all clinical situations.

### Pap smears | AAFP… [^e10664fb]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Don't perform Pap smears on women under the age of 21 or women who have had a hysterectomy for non-cancer disease. Sources: US Preventive Services Task Force, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. In a 2012 report, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force reviewed research published since 2003 that evaluated liquid-based cytology and human papillomavirus testing. The USPSTF also commissioned researchers to develop a computer model to calculate the frequency of cervical cancer screening and the ages at which to begin and end this screening. The USPSTF issued the following recommendation statements: The excerpt below is from the USPTF summary statement: "Screening with cervical cytology or HPV testing can lead to physical and emotional harms. Abnormal test results can lead to more frequent testing and invasive diagnostic procedures, such as colposcopy and cervical biopsy.

Evidence from randomized, controlled trials and observational studies indicates that harms from these diagnostic procedures include vaginal bleeding, pain, infection, and failure to diagnose. Abnormal screening test results are also associated with increased anxiety and distress. The harms of treatment also could include risks from the treatment procedure which are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm delivery, that can lead to low birth weight in infants and perinatal death. Evidence is convincing that many precancerous cervical lesions will regress and that other lesions are so slow-growing that they will not become clinically important over a woman's lifetime; identification and treatment of these lesions constitute overdiagnosis.

It is difficult to estimate the precise magnitude of overdiagnosis associated with any screening or treatment strategy, but it is of concern because it confers no benefit and can lead to unnecessary surveillance, diagnostic tests, and treatments with the associated harms.

### Cancer screening in refugees and immigrants: a global perspective [^bb4ec9e8]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

Women over age 65 who have never undergone cervical cancer screening have the highest mortality from cervical cancer and benefit most from screening. The USPSTF recommends cervical cancer screening cease at age 65 in women who have undergone adequate prior screening with negative results. However, this does not apply to most immigrant females because the number of immigrant women older than 65 who have never been screened is nearly triple that of U.S.-born women in the same age category (17.1% versus 6%). Cervical cancer screening of immigrant women over age 65 is strongly indicated unless they have documented adequate screening for one decade prior to cessation.

In the United States, initiation of Pap screening is recommended at age 21 regardless of sexual history. However, women who have undergone type III female genital cutting (FGC; i.e. infibulation) require special consideration. Rates of infibulation vary greatly among immigrant women with some groups (e.g. Somali women) experiencing prevalence of 98%. Infibulation does not protect against cervical cancer, and sexual activity in this group of women confers risk of HPV infection and cervical cancer as it does in women without infibulation. In one study of East African women, the prevalence of severe cervical dysplasia (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion positive) was 2.6%, irrespective of FGC history. Thus, in women with infibulation who have been sexually active, Pap testing should be performed according to the usual USPSTF schedule.

In women with infibulation seen before their sexual debut, decisions related to attempting HPV testing alone should be made on an individual basis within a clinician-provider relationship grounded in excellent communication. For example, in a 30-year-old woman with infibulation and a history of nonpenetrative sexual activity (but before her sexual debut), attempts at testing may be appropriate given her potential risk of HPV infection and thus cervical cancer. On the other hand, in a 30-year-old woman with infibulation who has never experienced any form of sexual activity, Pap screening is generally anatomically infeasible, fails to provide any health benefit, may be traumatic, and thus is not recommended.

### Incidence of cervical cancer after several negative smear results by age 50: prospective observational study [^8cec5bd4]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

From the UK data on the timing of screening smears before the (pseudo-) diagnosis of cervical cancer in cases and controls, Sasieni et al showed that the protection a negative smear offers to younger women (age 20–39) is lower than among women aged 40 or older. As a consequence, they advocated shorter screening intervals for younger than for older women. The differences in our results are consistent with two important differences between studies. Firstly, in the UK data older women had probably accumulated more screening tests before the analysed negative smear than younger women. A lower number of earlier smears tends to increase the subsequent incidence of cervical cancer. In our analysis, women had similar screening histories (three consecutive negative results before the beginning of follow-up). Secondly, the increase in the risk for cervical cancer among younger British cohorts might have played a role. No such increase has been observed in the Netherlands.

Conclusions

By being able to use invasive cancer as the relevant end point, our analysis gives a more evidence based answer to the ongoing discussion on continued screening in women with several negative smear results by age 50. It showed that it would not be consistent to stop screening these women while not also relaxing the screening policy for younger women with similar screening histories. In this respect, our conclusion lends support to the current cervical cancer screening guidelines in England and other developed countries, which do not discriminate women by age up to 60–65.

Whether individual tailoring of recommendations for further screening by using the information on individual screening histories would be an efficient and feasible alternative to the current fixed schedule in any age group remains to be explored.

### Characteristics associated with low-value cancer screening among office-based physician visits by older adults in the USA [^b8826184]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

After a certain age, cancer screening may expose older adults to unnecessary harms with limited benefits and represent inefficient use of health care resources.

Objective

To estimate the frequency of cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer screening among adults older than US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) age thresholds at which screening is no longer considered routine and to identify physician and patient factors associated with low-value cancer screening.

Design

Observational study using pooled cross-sectional data (2011–2016) from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, a nationally representative probability sample of US office-based physician visits.

Participants

Analyses for cervical and breast cancer screening were limited to visits by women over age 65 (N = 37,818) and ages 75 and over (N = 19,451), respectively. Analyses for colorectal cancer screening were limited to visits by patients over age 75 (N = 31,543).

Main Measures

Cancer screening procedures were coded as low value using USPSTF age thresholds.

Key Results

Between 2011 and 2016, an estimated 509, 507, and 273 thousand potentially low-value Pap smears, mammograms, and colonoscopies/sigmoidoscopies, respectively, were ordered annually. Low-valuecervical cancer screening was less likely to occur for visits with older (vs. younger) patients. Compared to visits by non-HispanicWhite women, low-valuecervical and breast cancer screening was less likely to occur for visits by women whose race/ethnicitywas something other than non-HispanicWhite, non-HispanicBlack, or Hispanic. Obstetrician/gynecologistswere more likely to order low-valuePap smears and mammograms compared to family/generalpractice physicians.

Conclusions

Thousands of cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer screenings at ages beyond routine guideline thresholds occur each year in the USA. Further research is needed to understand whether this pattern represents clinical inertia and resistance to de-adoption of previous screening practices, or whether physicians and/or patients perceive a higher value in these tests than that endorsed by experts writing evidence-based guidelines.

### Cervical cancer screening for individuals at average risk: 2020 guideline update from the American cancer society [^385ba1e9]. CA (2020). Medium credibility.

The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that individuals with a cervix initiate cervical cancer screening at age 25 years and undergo primary human papillomavirus (HPV) testing every 5 years through age 65 years (preferred); if primary HPV testing is not available, then individuals aged 25 to 65 years should be screened with cotesting (HPV testing in combination with cytology) every 5 years or cytology alone every 3 years (acceptable) (strong recommendation). The ACS recommends that individuals aged > 65 years who have no history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or more severe disease within the past 25 years, and who have documented adequate negative prior screening in the prior 10 years, discontinue all cervical cancer screening (qualified recommendation). These new screening recommendations differ in 4 important respects compared with the 2012 recommendations: 1) The preferred screening strategy is primary HPV testing every 5 years, with cotesting and cytology alone acceptable where access to US Food and Drug Administration-approved primary HPV testing is not yet available; 2) the recommended age to start screening is 25 years rather than 21 years; 3) primary HPV testing, as well as cotesting or cytology alone when primary testing is not available, is recommended starting at age 25 years rather than age 30 years; and 4) the guideline is transitional, ie, options for screening with cotesting or cytology alone are provided but should be phased out once full access to primary HPV testing for cervical cancer screening is available without barriers. Evidence related to other relevant issues was reviewed, and no changes were made to recommendations for screening intervals, age or criteria for screening cessation, screening based on vaccination status, or screening after hysterectomy. Follow-up for individuals who screen positive for HPV and/or cytology should be in accordance with the 2019 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors.

K.5 Managing Patients Older Than 65 Years With a History of Prior Abnormalities

Guideline: If patients over age 65 years undergo HPV testing, cotesting, or cytology, management according to guidelines for patients aged 25 to 65 years is recommended (CII). If surveillance testing is recommended for either a history of abnormal screening results or treatment for precancer, discontinuing surveillance is unacceptable if the patient is in reasonably good health and testing is feasible (DII). Discontinuation of surveillance is recommended for patients with a limited life expectancy (EIII).

Rationale: Screening for patients older than 65 years should follow national guidelines. However, approximately 20% of cervical cancers occur in patients older than 65 years. To mitigate cancer risk in patients older than age 65 years, previous consensus management guidelines included continued testing in patients with abnormal results as well as those who do not meet exit criteria. Although the sensitivity of cytology, HPV testing, and colposcopy seem to be higher in premenopausal than postmenopausal patients, evidence indicates that screening in patients older than 65 years is associated with a lower risk of the subsequent development of cervical cancer. Because cessation of routine screening is recommended in adequately screened patients at the age of 65 years, data on the prognostic value of specific screening test results in older patients are limited. However, as cancer rates remain appreciable beyond the age of 65 years, and cancer diagnostic procedures such as mammography, breast biopsy, and colonoscopy are recommended beyond the age of 65 years, – the consensus decision was to use the guidelines for patients aged 25 to 65 years in evaluating older individuals with abnormal results but without limited life expectancy. Patients with previous CIN 3+ seem to have an elevated lifetime risk of developing cervical or vaginal cancer and thus may require surveillance testing beyond the age of 65 years. However, patient comfort and the limitations of positioning and examining older patients should enter into the shared decision-making conversation about when to discontinue screening. Vaginal estrogen use for a limited time (3 weeks) can be considered to obtain adequate sampling.

### Updated cervical cancer screening guidelines [^f6542441]. ACOG (2021). High credibility.

Updated cervical cancer screening guidelines (ACOG/ASCCP/SGO) emphasize that cervical cytology, primary high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing, and co-testing are all effective in detecting cervical precancerous lesions and cancer, and that the specific strategy selected is less important than consistent adherence to routine screening guidelines. Given these concerns, ACOG, ASCCP, and SGO continue to recommend cervical cancer screening initiation at age 21 years. Human papillomavirus vaccination is another important prevention strategy, and obstetrician–gynecologists and other health care professionals should continue to strongly recommend HPV vaccination to eligible patients and stress the benefits and safety of the HPV vaccine. The text notes that inadequate cervical cancer screening remains a significant problem in the United States with persistent health inequities, and states that cervical cancer prevention, screening, and treatment are critical components of comprehensive reproductive health care.

An update to the American Cancer Society (ACS) guideline regarding screening for the early detection of cervical precancerous lesions and cancer is presented. The guidelines are based on a systematic evidence review, contributions from 6 working groups, and a recent symposium cosponsored by the ACS, the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, and the American Society for Clinical Pathology, which was attended by 25 organizations. The new screening recommendations address age-appropriate screening strategies, including the use of cytology and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, follow-up (eg, the management of screen positives and screening intervals for screen negatives) of women after screening, the age at which to exit screening, future considerations regarding HPV testing alone as a primary screening approach, and screening strategies for women vaccinated against HPV16 and HPV18 infections.

### Saturday pap smear clinic: addressing barriers to cervical cancer screening [^dea53299]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Background

The incidence of cervical cancer has decreased by 70% since the 1950s. Preventative measures include vaccination against HPV strains and Papanicolaou tests. Early identification of cervical cancer through routine screening can significantly improve patient outcomes.

Materials and methods

At our academic institution, Community Internal Medicine (CIM) Clinic, 63% of female patients aged 21–65 were compliant with cervical cancer screening. The opening of the 'Saturday Pap Smear Clinic' sought to address barriers by offering non-traditional appointment times on Saturday mornings with an all female staff. Our aim was to increase the cervical cancer screening rate by 1% within 12 weeks. Our team compared CIM (intervention) and family medicine (FM) (control) compliance rates from September 2021 to January 2022. Messages were sent to the patient indicating non-compliance and offering options to complete screening.

Results

At the start of this study, 5239 CIM patients were cervical cancer screening non-compliant. Postintervention, cervical screening rates among non-compliant women within CIM improved by 1.2%. The intervention cohort, CIM patients, had a significant improvement in compliance compared with the control group, FM patients. White women between the ages of 50 and 65 comprised the majority of patients who used the 'Saturday Pap Smear Clinic'.

Conclusions

The availability of Saturday appointments for cervical cancer screening completion can enhance cervical cancer screening compliance among eligible women. Eliminating barriers for women can improve health outcomes.

Results from a population-based study conducted in Denmark, however, suggest that it may be worthwhile for some individuals between ages 65 and 69 to get tested for HPV: those who haven't had cervical cancer screening for at least 5 years. In the new study, about 62% of women who were invited to undergo this "catch-up" testing for HPV had a test within the next year. In a comparison group of women not invited for catch-up testing, only about 2% had either a Pap test or an HPV test over the next year. Women who were furthest behind on regular screenings — that is, had one or no screenings since age 50 — had nearly twice the rate of CIN2+ lesions as women who had been screened two or more times since age 50, the researchers found. The study findings were published July 6 in PLOS Medicine.

The findings support recommendations in some countries, such as the United States, where a history of negative screening results is recommended for stopping screening at age 65, after which the risk of a new HPV infection developing into cervical cancer is very low, said Nicolas Wentzensen, M. D. Ph. D., of NCI's Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, who was not involved in the study. HPV tests are very good at detecting infection with the virus, but because these tests have only been available for the past 10 or so years, most women over age 65 have never had one. Instead, most older women have had Pap tests for routine cervical cancer screening. However, Pap tests are less effective in older women compared to younger women because physiological changes after menopause make it more difficult for doctors to collect samples from the part of the cervix where cell changes typically start. Dr.

Tranberg and her colleagues wondered whether giving women over age 65, particularly those who have fallen behind on screening, a catch-up HPV test could help bridge this gap in cervical cancer prevention. Those who had rarely or never been screened in their 50s and early 60s were more than twice as likely to have CIN2+ lesions as those who had been screened at least twice during that same time. Overall, more women in the catch-up testing group chose to get a cervical sample collected by a clinician than to do self-sampling. But those who were insufficiently screened were much more likely to choose self-collection than those who were routinely screened.

### Delayed diagnoses of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer after negative evaluation for atypical glandular cell pap smear: does age matter? [^d3cb2455]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

At initial evaluation, 1 in 6 women with atypical glandular cells (AGCs) on Pap smear has cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or cancer. Years later, a greater-than-expected incidence of "significant delayed diagnoses" has been reported in women who had negative initial evaluation results. This study aimed to test the premise that AGC represents a lesser future risk for CIN 2/CIN 3/carcinoma in situ (CIS) and cancer after negative evaluation results in a population diagnosed at a young age (< 35 years).

Materials and Methods

Cohort study consists of 43,000 community health center patients who had 83,542 Pap smears (1997–2010); 213 were diagnosed with AGC, and 117 met inclusion criteria. Completed evaluation was consistent with American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology guidelines without finding CIN 2/CIN 3/CIS or cancer. Follow-up lasted for longer than 1 year. Categorical data were evaluated with χ.

Results

During the follow-up period that averaged for 85.3 months, the cohort had 4.5 mean Pap smears and reported 46 cytological diagnoses of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 3 diagnoses of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and 10 repeated diagnoses of AGCs. Two CIN 2/CIN 3/CIS lesions, 1 cervical cancer, and 1 endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia were confirmed on biopsy. Average age of patients at index Pap smear was 34.2 years (range = 15–64 years). Compared with a published report where the average age at index Pap smear was 41.5 years, our cohort developed a total of 4.3% significant delayed diagnoses versus 10.8% (significant difference, p = .046).

Conclusions

During a 7-year follow-up, this cohort of 117 women with AGC and negative initial evaluation findings developed fewer significant delayed diagnoses than expected when compared with an older reported group and had no new extragynecological cancers. Age seems to be a risk factor for delayed diagnoses in patients with AGC.

### Cervical cancer screening and incidence by age: unmet needs near and after the stopping age for screening… [^b621d989]. stacks.cdc.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract Introduction — Leading professional organizations recommend cervical cancer screening for average-risk women aged 21–65 years. For average-risk women aged > 65 years, routine screening may be discontinued if "adequate" screening with negative results is documented. Screening is recommended after age 65 years for women who do not meet adequate prior screening criteria or. Pap test or that their most recent Pap test was > 5 years ago. Results — The incidence rate for cervical cancer among older women, corrected for hysterectomy status, did not decline until age ≥ 85 years. The proportion not recently screened increased with age, from 12. 1% for women aged 41–45 years to
18. 4% for women aged 61–65 years.

Professional organizations recommend that routine cervical cancer screening be discontinued for average-risk women aged > 65 years after three consecutive negative cytology results or two consecutive negative co-test results within the previous 10 years, with the most recent test performed within the past 5 years. 4–6 Substantially lower risk of. DISCUSSION Before reaching age 65 years, many women are not up to date with routine cervical cancer screening, and a substantial number approach the "stopping" age without an adequate screening history. Based on the 2015 NHIS data, about 845, 000 American women aged 61–. 65 years were not recently screened. For these women, catch-up screening may be needed after age 65 years to achieve an adequate negative screening history. Many women aged 66–70 years also may still need to be screened, especially those never screened. A recommended upper age limit for routine screening may lead women and providers to.

among older women at special risk was not examined. CONCLUSIONS Premature discontinuation of routine screening among women in the years before age 65 years could contribute to preventable cases of invasive cervical cancer and deaths. Catch-up screening may be needed for underscreened women after age 65 years, taking into account. previous negative tests before screening is discontinued, not just chronologic age. Age itself may need to be reconsidered, given high cervical cancer incidence rates after age 65 years, increases in life expectancy, and different human papillomavirus exposures by birth cohort. 16 Acknowledgments The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official.

American Cancer Society (ACS) 2012 cervical cancer screening — average risk — recommended Cytology alone every 3 y starting at age 21 y and Cytology alone every 3 y until age 29 y; for ages 30–65, Aged 30–65 y, switch to cotesting (preferred), cytology alone every 3 y (acceptable), and Screening by primary HPV testing alone not recommended for most clinical settings. For aged > 65 y, No screening after adequate negative prior screening. After hysterectomy, No screening after hysterectomy (with removal of the cervix) for reasons not related to cervical cancer and no history of cervical cancer or serious precancer. For HPV vaccinated, Follow age-specific screening recommendations.

### Screening and management of women and girls with human papillomavirus infection [^cad1f35b]. Gynecologic Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

In the US, reductions in cervical cancer-related mortality over the past five decades can be attributed to the implementation of screening programs. US-based guidelines recommend that screening should be initiated approximately 3 years after initiation of sexual intercourse, but no later than age 21 years and be continued at least until age 65 or 70. Annual screening is recommended by the American Cancer Society and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, although in women aged ≥ 30 years with ≥ 3 negative Pap tests, screening may be conducted every 2 to 3 years. Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and most US guidelines say that it is reasonable to consider HPV testing, in combination with triennial cytology screening. Pharmacoeconomic analyses indicate that combined cytology and HPV testing every three years in women aged ≥ 30 years is comparable in sensitivity to annual liquid-based cytology for the detection of cervical cancer precursors and is more cost-effective. Both surgical and nonsurgical therapies are commonly employed in patients with HPV lesions although papilloma recurrence is not uncommon. Treatment should be individualized based on the extent of disease and the needs of the patient. Current treatment of cervical cancer reflects the stage of the disease and should take into account patient- and tumor-related factors to ensure optimal patient outcomes.

### Cervical cancer screening for individuals at average risk: 2020 guideline update from the American cancer society [^d226d771]. CA (2020). High credibility.

American Cancer Society 2020 cervical cancer screening recommendations — applying to all asymptomatic individuals with a cervix and excluding those at increased risk due to solid organ or stem cell transplantation, human immunodeficiency virus infection or immunosuppression from other causes, or in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol — recommend initiating screening at age 25 y and undergoing primary human papillomavirus (HPV) testing every 5 y through age 65 y (preferred); if primary HPV testing is not available, individuals aged 25–65 y should be screened with cotesting every 5 y or cytology alone every 3 y (acceptable) (strong recommendation). The ACS recommends that individuals who are older than age 65 y discontinue cervical cancer screening with any modality when there is no history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or a more severe diagnosis within the past 25 y and there is documented adequate negative prior screening in the 10 y period before age 65 y (qualified recommendation), defining adequate negative prior screening as 2 consecutive negative HPV tests, 2 consecutive negative cotests, or 3 consecutive negative cytology tests within the past 10 y with the most recent test occurring within the recommended interval; individuals older than age 65 y without sufficient documentation should be screened until the criteria for screening cessation are met. The guideline notes that cotesting or cytology testing alone are acceptable because access to primary HPV testing may be limited, that as the United States makes the transition to primary HPV testing the use of cotesting or cytology alone for cervical cancer screening will be eliminated from future guidelines, and that cervical cancer screening may be discontinued in individuals of any age with limited life expectancy.

### Cervical cancer screening for individuals at average risk: 2020 guideline update from the American cancer society [^e7bf5b0e]. CA (2020). High credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) cervical cancer screening update — In average-risk individuals with a cervix, we recommend that cervical cancer screening should begin in average-risk individuals with a cervix at age 25 years and cease at age 65 years and that the preferred strategy for regular screening is primary HPV testing every 5 years. We emphasize that the United States is in a transition period from cytology testing to HPV testing, and, in the near term, cytology testing, either alone or as part of cotesting, will continue to have a role as practice patterns evolve and access to primary HPV testing can be assured.
