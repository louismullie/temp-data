## Question

workup for penis rash

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the workup for a penis rash. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial history and risk stratification. Then, I should verify the focused physical examination and morphology. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis by morphology and prioritize infectious versus noninfectious etiologies. After that, I need to outline targeted diagnostic testing, including when to biopsy. Finally, I will synthesize management principles, follow-up, and special scenarios like trauma, malignancy, and pediatric considerations, making sure each step is supported by guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the core elements of history that meaningfully narrow the differential: onset and duration, evolution, symptoms such as pain, pruritus, discharge, bleeding, and systemic features like fever or malaise, plus sexual exposure risks, number of partners, condom use, partner symptoms, travel, new medications, hygiene, circumcision status, and comorbidities including diabetes, immunosuppression, and HIV risk, because these factors shift pretest probabilities toward infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic causes and guide testing and presumptive treatment decisions [^188ddfdc] [^18ed7045] [^cb2d6591].

> Wait, let me verify the focused physical examination priorities: inspect the rash morphology and distribution on glans, corona, shaft, prepuce, and scrotum. Palpate for induration, fluctuance, or tenderness. Document size, number, configuration, and relationship to mucosa, urethra, and corpora. Examine extragenital skin, nails, scalp, and oral mucosa for clues to systemic dermatoses. And assess inguinal nodes for lymphadenopathy, since these findings distinguish papulosquamous, vesiculobullous, ulcerative, nodular, or plaque-like lesions and inform urgency and testing strategy [^260ac130] [^c3e93f11] [^ca593845].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should categorize by morphology to structure the differential: vesiculobullous lesions suggest HSV, VZV, or mpox. Ulcerative lesions raise concern for primary syphilis, chancroid, or HSV. Papulosquamous plaques point to psoriasis, lichen planus, lichen sclerosus, or tinea. Nodular or exophytic growths warrant consideration of warts, molluscum, or neoplasia. And fixed, violaceous plaques may reflect fixed drug eruption or inflammatory dermatoses, with morphology guiding immediate tests and empiric therapy thresholds [^188ddfdc] [^f881914a] [^c3e93f11].

> I will now examine infectious etiologies that commonly present on the penis and require prompt recognition: HSV typically shows grouped painful vesicles that ulcerate. Syphilis presents as a painless, indurated chancre in primary disease and a diffuse maculopapular rash including palms and soles in secondary disease. Mpox often shows monomorphic vesiculopustules with anogenital predilection and may feature penile edema. Scabies produces intensely pruritic papules or nodules on the genitalia and burrows elsewhere. And chancroid causes painful, undermined ulcers with inguinal buboes, with epidemiology and travel informing pretest probability [^188ddfdc] [^18ed7045] [^4a1c92c7] [^c963d8bc] [^36ebfd37].

> Next, I should review noninfectious mimics and chronic inflammatory conditions: psoriasis and lichen planus can involve the glans and prepuce and may mimic neoplasia. Lichen sclerosus presents as hypopigmented, atrophic, sclerotic skin and carries malignant potential. Fixed drug eruption recurs at the same site with the same agent. And neoplastic lesions such as CIS or SCC present as persistent plaques, ulcers, or masses and mandate biopsy when suspected, particularly in older men or those with risk factors [^c3e93f11] [^55bc4c68] [^387ef1c7] [^c633e202].

> Let me think about targeted diagnostic testing aligned to morphology and risk: for vesiculobullous or ulcerative lesions, obtain HSV PCR from lesion base and syphilis serology with treponemal and non-treponemal assays, and consider mpox PCR in the right epidemiologic context. For papulosquamous or atypical plaques, perform KOH prep for tinea and consider biopsy if diagnosis is uncertain or neoplasia is suspected. For suspected scabies, look for burrows and treat empirically if classic. And in MSM or high-incidence settings, presumptively treat syphilis at the initial visit while awaiting results, given transmission risk and public health implications [^188ddfdc] [^cb2d6591] [^f881914a] [^c963d8bc] [^36ebfd37].

> But wait, what if the lesion is suspicious for malignancy or fails to respond to appropriate therapy? I should confirm that any indurated, ulcerated, pigmented, bleeding, or persistent lesion warrants a punch or excisional biopsy to establish histology, with attention to HPV status and p16 immunohistochemistry, and document size, morphology, and relationship to adjacent structures to guide staging and management decisions [^c633e202] [^fc2e9446] [^e972b6f4].

> I need to ensure I address trauma and emergencies: penile fracture presents with acute pain, swelling, ecchymosis, and a snapping sensation with immediate detumescence. Diagnosis is clinical, with ultrasound or MRI reserved for equivocal cases, and urethral injury should be assessed when blood is present at the meatus or voiding is impaired. Prompt urologic consultation is essential to preserve function and prevent complications [^2172d275] [^50c5d416] [^42b88968].

> Let me reconsider pediatric and special populations: in children, scabies and viral exanthems are common, but vasculitides such as HSP and Kawasaki disease can present with scrotal or penile edema and rash, so I should integrate systemic signs, labs, and echocardiography when indicated. In immunocompromised patients, atypical or severe presentations are more likely, so I should broaden the differential and lower thresholds for biopsy and specialist referral [^c963d8bc] [^1dd6492c] [^945410f4].

> Next, I should review management principles by etiology: for HSV, provide antivirals and counseling. For primary syphilis, treat with benzathine penicillin and ensure partner notification. For mpox, provide supportive care and infection control guidance. For scabies, use topical permethrin and treat close contacts. For inflammatory dermatoses, use low-potency topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors and avoid prolonged high-potency steroids on genital skin. And for suspected neoplasia, arrange urologic referral for definitive oncologic management [^188ddfdc] [^cb2d6591] [^c3e93f11] [^c633e202].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up and safety netting: reassess in 48 to 72 hours for response to empiric therapy, repeat syphilis serology if initially negative but suspicion remains high, and ensure STI screening and HIV testing are completed with appropriate linkage to care. Educate on red flags such as rapidly progressive swelling, necrosis, systemic toxicity, or failure to improve, which require urgent reassessment and escalation [^188ddfdc] [^edbfdb6d].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, morphology-driven approach anchored in history and risk, with targeted testing and judicious empiric therapy when indicated, while maintaining a low threshold to biopsy when neoplasia is suspected or the diagnosis remains unclear. This strategy balances timeliness, accuracy, and stewardship while addressing patient-specific factors and public health imperatives [^260ac130] [^188ddfdc] [^c633e202].

---

A penile rash workup should be **morphology-driven** and start with a focused history and exam to identify red flags (ulceration, induration, rapid progression, systemic symptoms) [^188ddfdc]. Initial tests include **syphilis serology, HSV PCR or culture, and HIV testing** when risk is present; add KOH prep, bacterial cultures, or scabies scraping if clinically indicated [^188ddfdc] [^cbba40f8] [^edbfdb6d]. If lesions are atypical, persistent, or suspicious for neoplasia, perform a **punch biopsy** [^c3e93f11] [^c633e202]. Reserve imaging (ultrasound, MRI) for suspected abscess, deep infection, or malignancy [^2a8ac610] [^72f33dd2]. Management is guided by results: treat STIs per guidelines, use topical corticosteroids for inflammatory dermatoses, and refer to urology or dermatology for suspected cancer or refractory cases [^188ddfdc] [^5b136671] [^c633e202].

## Clinical history and risk assessment

A thorough clinical history is essential to guide the differential diagnosis and testing strategy. Key elements include:

- **Onset and duration**: Acute vs chronic; progressive vs stable.
- **Morphology**: Papules, vesicles, ulcers, plaques, nodules, or pustules.
- **Symptoms**: Pruritus, pain, discharge, bleeding, odor, systemic symptoms (fever, malaise, weight loss).
- **Sexual history**: New partners, unprotected sex, partner symptoms, MSM, sex work.
- **Medical history**: Diabetes, immunosuppression, HIV, chronic skin conditions, recent medications, allergies.
- **Hygiene and trauma**: Circumcision status, hygiene practices, recent trauma or friction.

---

## Physical examination

A focused genital examination should document:

- **Lesion characteristics**: Size, shape, color, surface, borders, distribution, number.
- **Morphology**: Papular, vesicular, ulcerative, plaque-like, nodular, pustular.
- **Associated findings**: Phimosis, balanitis, discharge, inguinal lymphadenopathy, extragenital lesions.
- **Red flags**: Ulceration, induration, rapid progression, necrosis, systemic symptoms.

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of penile rash is broad and includes infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, and traumatic etiologies:

| **Category** | **Common etiologies** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Syphilis <br/> - HSV <br/> - HPV (warts) <br/> - Scabies <br/> - Candidiasis <br/> - Bacterial infections (e.g. cellulitis, chancroid) [^188ddfdc] [^c963d8bc] [^0bdaa55a] |
| Inflammatory | - Psoriasis <br/> - Lichen planus <br/> - Lichen sclerosus <br/> - Eczema <br/> - Fixed drug eruption [^c3e93f11] [^387ef1c7] |
| Neoplastic | - Carcinoma in situ <br/> - Squamous cell carcinoma <br/> - Melanoma [^c3e93f11] [^c633e202] |
| Traumatic | - Friction dermatitis <br/> - Penile fracture <br/> - Zoster [^2172d275] [^68347ad2] |

---

## Initial diagnostic tests

Based on clinical suspicion, order the following initial tests:

- **Syphilis serology**: Non-treponemal (RPR or VDRL) and treponemal (TPPA or FTA-ABS) tests [^cb2d6591].
- **HSV testing**: PCR or viral culture from lesion base; type-specific serology if PCR/culture negative but suspicion remains [^cbba40f8].
- **HIV testing**: Recommended in all patients with STI risk or atypical presentations [^edbfdb6d].
- **Bacterial cultures**: If purulent discharge or suspected bacterial infection [^notfound].
- **KOH preparation**: For suspected candidiasis or tinea [^notfound].
- **Scabies scraping**: If pruritic papules or nodules are present [^notfound].

---

## Indications for biopsy

Biopsy is indicated when:

- **Diagnosis is uncertain**: Atypical lesions or failure to respond to empiric therapy [^c3e93f11].
- **Suspicion of neoplasia**: Persistent, indurated, ulcerated, or pigmented lesions [^c3e93f11].
- **Refractory or recurrent lesions**: Especially in immunocompromised patients [^731fb2a3].

Biopsy technique is typically a **punch biopsy** for suspected inflammatory or neoplastic lesions; excisional biopsy is reserved for small, well-circumscribed lesions suspicious for malignancy [^c3e93f11] [^c633e202].

---

## Advanced diagnostic testing

Advanced testing is reserved for specific clinical scenarios:

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound or MRI for suspected abscess, deep infection, or malignancy; CT for metastatic evaluation in penile cancer [^2a8ac610] [^72f33dd2].
- **HPV testing**: Consider in warts or suspected HPV-related neoplasia [^fc2e9446].
- **Specialized tests**: Direct fluorescent antibody for HSV, darkfield microscopy for syphilis, PCR for mpox in outbreaks [^cb2d6591] [^f881914a].

---

## Management and follow-up

Management depends on the underlying diagnosis:

- **Infectious etiologies**: Treat per CDC STI guidelines (e.g. benzathine penicillin for syphilis, acyclovir for HSV, topical/podophyllotoxin for warts) [^188ddfdc].
- **Inflammatory dermatoses**: Topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or antifungals as indicated [^5b136671].
- **Neoplastic lesions**: Surgical excision, Mohs surgery, or oncologic management [^c633e202].
- **Follow-up**: Re-evaluate in 1–2 weeks; ensure partner treatment and public health reporting for STIs [^cb2d6591].

There are a number of dermatoses that manifest in the genital region. Urologists are often the first point of contact for patients with such disorders. These can be isolated genital conditions or manifestations of a more widespread cutaneous disease. Though similar appearing, there are often key clinical findings that aid in in diagnosis. In general, genital dermatoses can be classified as physiologic variants, inflammatory, neoplastic, or infectious in etiology. This article provides a broad overview for urologists in addressing both common and rarer penile and scrotal dermatoses. Emphasis is placed on characteristic clinical findings to aid in diagnosis. Recommendations for diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and appropriate follow-up are discussed.

What symptoms should alert me to this diagnosis?

While syphilis causes protean symptoms (box 1), the diagnosis should be considered in any sexually active patient with genital lesions or with rashes.

Box 1
Symptoms of syphilis by stage of infection (see fig 1)

Primary syphilis — Patients with primary syphilis (fig 1) have a chancre at the site of inoculation — classically a solitary, painless, indurated, non-exudative ulcer (fig 2). While often on the glans, corona, labia, fourchette, or perineum, it may occur in the mouth (fig 3), rectum, or vagina. Chancres can be inconspicuous (fig 4) and resolve in 3–10 weeks, possibly explaining why 60% of patients do not recall this lesion. Chancres may be multiple, painful, or atypical due to coinfection with other bacteria or herpesvirus. Depending on inoculum size, chancres appear 10–90 days after exposure (mean 21 days). Localised painless adenopathy may occur.

Secondary syphilis — Secondary syphilis is a manifestation of bacterial dissemination and classically presents as a diffuse, symmetric, copper, maculopapular, possibly pruritic rash of any morphology except vesicular (fig 5). A rash on the palms or soles is common (11–70%, fig 6). Mucus lesions (fig 7), patchy alopecia, fever, headaches, and generalised painless adenopathy may also occur. Early neurosyphilis develops in 25–60% of people (box 1). Secondary symptoms appear 2–24 weeks after infection, concurrently with or up to eight weeks after chancres, and disappear spontaneously after several weeks with or without marking.

2, 5 Pruritus and psychosocial distress are common. Exacerbating factors include stress, excessive alcohol and tobacco use, acute infections, and some medication use. 8 Extragenital psoriasis occurs on the extensor surfaces of elbows and knees, scalp, lumbosacral region, umbilicus, and nails. Psoriatic arthritis occurs in up to 25 percent of patients. Psoriasis is usually clinically apparent in the presence of nail pitting or confirmatory lesions elsewhere on the body. 3 Punch or shave biopsy is indicated if lesions are atypical. Treatment depends on whether the disease is localized or disseminated. 3, 5, 7, 9 First-line localized treatment includes mild to midstrength topical corticosteroids. 3, 6, 8, 9 Once-daily application of corticosteroids is sufficient because genital skin is permeable, and corticosteroid receptors remain saturated for almost 24 hours.

As a general rule, no more than 50 g of ultrapotent or 100 mg of potent topical corticosteroids should be applied over a long-term period 9 because continuous use may cause skin atrophy. Lesions may reappear when corticosteroid use is discontinued. 10 To avoid overdose, daily ultrapotent topical corticosteroid use should be limited to two weeks, followed by weekend dosing. 10 If long-term therapy is required, tacrolimus or pimecrolimus may be appropriate, without the risk of atrophy. 11 Vitamin D 3 analogues are a first-line option for localized disease, and are usually applied once or twice daily. Patients with refractory disease should be referred to a dermatologist. 31, 33 Patients rarely experience pruritus. 32, 33 The course of lichen nitidus is variable and can resolve spontaneously. 31 When treatment is indicated for cosmesis, options include corticosteroids, vitamin A analogues, cyclosporine, itraconazole, and phototherapy.

33 Laser ablation should be avoided because of the potential for scarring.
31. The response to treatment of lichen planus is variable. 37, 38 Daily potent topical corticosteroids are usually effective but carry a risk of atrophy; however, weekend dosing of ultrapotent topical corticosteroids may be effective. For isolated lichen planus of the prepuce, circumcision is indicated when medical management fails. 39.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for penile cancer - NCCN, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, NCCN 2013 guidelines recommend to obtain the following cross-sectional imaging of chest/abdomen/pelvis (when appropriate, imaging should be done with contrast unless contraindicated) in the initial workup:

- abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI

- CXR or CT

- CT/MRI of pelvis for nodal evaluation if difficult to clinically assess.

### Scrotal and penile edema in a patient with incomplete Kawasaki disease: a case report and brief literature review [^a3d3f9e2]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Case description

A 2-year-old, unvaccinated, previously healthy African American male presented with 4 days of fever and rash. He was initially seen at the ER on day 2 of illness for intermittent fevers with T max 38.9 °C and a papular rash that started on his torso and back before spreading into his diaper region. The patient tested negative for strep throat and was discharged home with a diagnosis of viral exanthem. On day 4 of illness, the patient returned to the ER with persistent fevers, worsening skin rash, and swelling of his penis and scrotum. He was normotensive, febrile (T 38.7 °C), tachycardic (180 bpm) and tachypneic (44 respiratory rate) with oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Lab work was significant for elevated C-reactive protein (146 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (70 mm/hr), hyponatremia (133 mMol/L), direct hyperbilirubinemia (total 4.25 mg/dL, direct 1.51 mg/dL), and elevated liver enzymes (AST 95 units/liter, ALT 228 units/liter). CBC was unremarkable and his urinalysis showed sterile pyuria. EBV and hepatitis panels were negative, RVP was sent and a blood and urine culture was drawn. Abdominal ultrasound was negative for hepatic abnormalities and showed a distended gallbladder but without stones or sludge. Due to early concern for staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and sepsis, the patient was started on IV antibiotics (ceftriaxone and clindamycin) and IV fluids and was admitted to the infectious disease service for additional workup and management.

### The generalized rash: part I. differential diagnosis [^36efc081]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Physicians often have difficulty diagnosing a generalized rash because many different conditions produce similar rashes, and a single condition can result in different rashes with varied appearances. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is critically important to make treatment decisions, especially when mortality or significant morbidity can occur without prompt intervention. When a specific diagnosis is not immediately apparent, it is important to generate an inclusive differential diagnosis to guide diagnostic strategy and initial treatment. In part I of this two-part article, tables listing common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rash are presented to help generate an inclusive differential diagnosis. The tables describe the key clinical features and recommended tests to help accurately diagnose generalized rashes. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the primary care physician must decide whether to observe and treat empirically, perform further diagnostic testing, or refer the patient to a dermatologist. This decision depends on the likelihood of a serious disorder and the patient's response to treatment.

### Laboratory testing for the monkeypox virus: interim guidance [^96afaa25]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2022). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for mpox, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, WHO 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that it can be challenging to differentiate mpox solely based on the clinical presentation, particularly in cases with an atypical presentation, due to the range of conditions causing skin rashes and because clinical presentation may more often be atypical during this outbreak.

Diagnosis of mpox — A high index of suspicion is warranted for mpox. Clinical presentation with symptoms such as a characteristic rash is strongly suggestive of mpox; however, diagnosis of mpox based solely on clinical presentation can be challenging because illness can be atypical with isolated proctitis or rectal bleeding or a small number of lesions, lesions can mimic herpes zoster, herpes simplex, syphilis, and molluscum contagiosum, and due to the high frequency of coinfection with STIs during the multinational 2022 clade II mpox outbreak, a broad differential diagnosis is encouraged.

### Persistent annular dermatosis: unraveling the cause of a 2-year rash [^6717fc6d]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case description

A 34-year-old male presents for initial evaluation of a rash all over his body that first began approximately 2 years ago. After about 1 year, the rash resolved with prednisone, but new lesions appeared around 9 months ago. The lesions are asymptomatic. He also notes lesions on his penis and denies oral involvement. Examination showed diffuse violaceous annular plaques extending from the right ventral wrist to the upper arm. Similar lesions were seen on the glans penis. Punch biopsy results are shown in Fig 1. Treatment with clobetasol, hydrocortisone, and tacrolimus led to resolution of the rash. Histology of the lesion taken from biopsy of the forearm can be seen in Fig. 2.

Best of five questions

Question 1

A 23-year-old man presented with an 8-week history of bloody diarrhoea, severe anorectal pain and low-grade pyrexia. On further questioning he also complained of malaise, myalgia and arthralgia. He admitted to unprotected receptive anal sexual intercourse with two male partners in the preceding 6 months. Perianal and rectal examination revealed two fluctuant, tender areas of induration adjacent to the anal verge suggestive of abscesses. An urgent flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed inflamed, friable rectal mucosa with several large ulcers and spontaneous bleeding. Rectal swabs sent for NAAT and genotyping revealed the presence of C trachomatis genotype L1.

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment regimen:
A — Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 7 days
B — Erythromycin 250 mg four times a day for 21 days
C — Olfloxacin 400 mg a day for 7 days
D — Erythromycin 500 mg twice a day for 7 days
E — Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 21 days

Question 2

A 32-year-old man presents with a 6-week history of diarrhoea, anorectal pain and maculopapular rash affecting the trunk, hands and feet. Two years previously he had been investigated for possible Crohn's disease after presenting with several perianal and anal verge ulcers. These had resolved spontaneously and no formal diagnosis had been made. On further questioning he admitted to a 4-week history of perianal swelling and several oral ulcers with a snail track distribution on inspection. Perianal inspection is demonstrated in figure 3.

Figure 3

B — T pallidum
C — N gonorrhoea
D — C trachomatis
E — Human papilloma virus

Question 3

A 40-year-old male patient of Turkish origin presented to ophthalmology as an emergency with acute painless reduced visual acuity in both eyes. Further questioning revealed a several year history of intermittent diarrhoea, recurrent oral and penile ulceration, with orogenital scarring evident on examination. He also complained of painful red nodules on the extensor aspects of both forearms. One year previously he had been diagnosed with anterior uveitis requiring prolonged steroid use. Slit lamp retinal examination revealed multiple intraretinal haemorrhages, soft exudates and macular oedema in both eyes.

What is the most likely diagnosis:
A — Crohn's disease
B — Sarcoidosis
C — Behçet's syndrome
D — Tuberculosis
E — Multiple sclerosis

### Penile emergencies [^76ebdee0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The penis is an organ of enormous importance and is vital for both excretory and reproductive function. The anatomy of the penis itself can lead to many of its emergent conditions and a thorough understanding of the anatomy and physiology is central to recognition of these conditions. Physicians should have a high clinical suspicion for penile emergencies and perform a thorough physical examination to make a proper diagnosis. Prompt diagnosis and proper management are essential for minimizing dysfunction of this vital organ.

### Genital herpes: rapid evidence review [^a0fcdb03]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for genital herpes, more specifically with respect to laboratory testing, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining type-specific serologic testing for HSV-2 in patients having partners with genital herpes, presenting for STI evaluation, or having > 10 lifetime sex partners.

### Asymptomatic penile rash… [^f1c47b77]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

A 19-year-old black man presented with a history of "white spots" that had been on his penis for "a while". Other than their presence, the lesions were entirely asymptomatic — specifically, there was no pain, pruritus, or purulence. He had no ongoing health problems, was on no medications, and had no family history of skin disease. He was heterosexual and admitted to having unprotected sex. His partner insisted that he have the lesions examined. There were no other relevant skin findings. 1 Race does not appear to be a factor, but pearly penile papules are reported to be more common in uncircumcised men. 2 Although lesions are asymptomatic, because of their location, some men are concerned that they represent a sexually transmitted disease and seek medical treatment. 2 The lesions are not infectious or transmitted sexually, and there is no association between pearly penile papules and human papillomavirus infection.
3.

Pearly penile papules may cause embarrassment and psychological and social difficulties for sexually active persons. Reassurance about the benign, noninfectious nature and prognosis of pearly penile papules should be adequate. However, partners may not believe that the lesions are normal and may be skeptical that they are not transmitted sexually. 4 Although no treatment is required, patients may wish to have the lesions removed. Evidence is limited, but successful treatment has been reported with the carbon dioxide laser and with liquid nitrogen cryotherapy. 2, 4. The papules of Fox-Fordyce disease are generally pruritic; have a pinpoint, dome-shaped appearance; and may be yellow, flesh colored, or hyperpigmented. These lesions are associated with apocrine gland secretion and are more likely to occur in the axilla and pubic areas where skin friction, heat, and humidity can induce heavy sweating. They may appear on the penile shaft but rarely are found on the glans penis.

5, 6 Condyloma acuminata tend not to be uniform in shape, size, and arrangement and may appear flat, raised, large or small, or in cauliflower-like clusters. These lesions are caused by human papilloma-virus; they may disappear and reappear over time and have no known definitive cure. In men, they most commonly appear on the scrotum and penis but also can occur in the urethra, perianal area, and rectum.

However, information is still lacking about the association between treatment and tumor condition, evidence of which could lead us to define an appropriate guideline. Due to the limitations of a literature review, controllable factors were often undetermined. Thus, we recommend that future studies always include a unified scale for multiple factors including tumor condition and functional outcome. This mission will require long discussions and consensus of many experts. Despite this limitation, we believe that our findings are meaningful since this is the first review of diagnostic and treatment trends of PVC, a rare condition.

### Genital ulcers: differential diagnosis and management [^188ddfdc]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Genital ulcers may be located on the vagina, penis, and anorectal or perineal areas and may be infectious or noninfectious. Herpes simplex virus is the most common cause of genital ulcers in the United States. A diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection is made through physical examination and observation of genital lesions. The 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted disease guidelines provide strategies for the management of patients with genital ulcer disease. Specific testing includes a polymerase chain reaction test for herpes simplex virus; syphilis serology and darkfield microscopy or a direct fluorescent antibody test for Treponema pallidum; and/or culture for Haemophilus ducreyi in settings where chancroid is highly prevalent. Rarely, cases of Epstein-Barr virus may present with genital ulcers. Syphilis and chancroid cause genital ulcers and are mandatory reportable diseases to the local health department. In some cases, no pathogen is identified. It is important to consider noninfectious etiologies such as sexual trauma, psoriasis, Behçet syndrome, and fixed drug eruptions. Genital ulcers are symptomatic by definition, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for syphilis infection for those at risk, early screening for syphilis infection in all pregnant women, and against routine serologic screening for genital herpes simplex virus infection in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including those who are pregnant.

### Clinical outcomes in a specialist male genital skin clinic: prospective follow-up of 600 patients [^1228490a]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

It is important to assess outcomes for medical interventions in order to focus scarce resources on outcomes with a known positive benefit. An open, observational study was performed to assess the clinical outcomes of 600 male patients with a genital skin problem attending a specialist secondary care dermatology facility. Patients were mainly referred by general practitioners and genitourinary medicine physicians. Outcome was measured at 3 and 6 months, and was determined by clinical examination and assessment of patient symptoms. The mean age of the group was 45.3 years. The commonest diagnoses were lichen sclerosus (30.5%), balanitis (17.3%), eczema (12.8%), lichen planus (7.3%), psoriasis (7.2%) and benign lesions (5.5%). The commonest presenting symptoms were genital rash (43%), genital soreness, pain or burning (17.5%), and penile lesions (15.7%). Lichen sclerosus and all forms of balanitis were more common in uncircumcised patients, whereas lichen planus was more common in circumcised males. Short-term outcome was excellent, with 11.5% of patients being reassured and discharged on their first visit, and after 6 months 58% of all patients were clear and 12% had improved. Only 4.5% reported no improvement in symptoms. Diagnostic biopsy demonstrated malignant or premalignant lesions in nearly a fifth of those having a procedure. Close working with urological and genitourinary medicine colleagues is important to manage the various aspects of male health.

### Scrotal and penile edema in a patient with incomplete Kawasaki disease: a case report and brief literature review [^1dd6492c]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

KD is an acute self-limiting vasculitis with unknown etiology. While it is easy to diagnose if all clinical criteria are present, in the absence of such features, many patients may end up getting misdiagnosed with sepsis and treated unnecessarily with antibiotics. A delay in diagnosis could also lead to increased risk of coronary aneurysms and other complications. Our patient presented with persistent fevers, skin rash, unilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and bilateral conjunctivitis supporting a diagnosis of underlying vasculitis. An atypical finding in this case was that he also had scrotal and penile edema.

KD has been reported to be associated with an array of genitourinary findings. Some reports have documented scrotal edema that spared the penis in patients with KD. Our literature search did not reveal any previously reported cases of penile edema in KD. Urogenital manifestations of other vasculitides were reviewed to identify similarities with this case. In children, Henoch-Schoenlein purpura (HSP), a small vessel vasculitis, has been associated with scrotal edema, epididymitis, orchitis, and spermatic cord thrombosis and in rare cases, has also been associated with penile edema, erythema, and penile pain. Although not classically seen in vasculitides, clinicians should still keep KD and HSP in the differential when considering patients with scrotal and penile edema.

Diagnosis of KD is challenging especially when a patient presents with atypical or nuanced features. Considering our patient's atypical presentation of penile edema, infectious work-up was done and was negative. This signified that his edema most likely stemmed from his vasculitis. From what we have seen in the literature, a possible mechanism for this is that the strong inflammatory response from KD produces radical oxygen and nitrogen species that damage the endothelial lining and in a highly vascular structure like the penis, this can cause edema due to the unregulated release of fluid into surrounding tissues. This leakage is likely compounded by the systemic release of inflammatory cytokines that occurs during KD. This is only a proposed mechanism and further research should be done to fully elucidate why this might occur in some patients versus others.

Scabies — clinical presentation features include a generalized or regional pruritic papular rash with erythema, abundant excoriations, and secondarily infected pustules, typically in a regionally symmetric pattern. Commonly involved sites include the volar wrists and finger web spaces, with the left and right sides usually involved in a nearly identical fashion; boys and men often develop nodular lesions on the scrotum and penis. When considering scabies in any male older than 2 years, a genital examination can be extremely helpful, and scabies burrows are short, delicate, linear lesions that involve the most superficial part of the epidermis; burrows are pathognomonic but challenging to detect.

### Urological evidence of tick bites in children [^95072942]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Ticks pose a serious threat to individuals of all ages owing to numerous physical illnesses including chills, aches, and a rash. Tick-borne illnesses range from a mild fever that may be treated at home to a severe disease necessitating hospitalization. Children are at an increased risk of tick bites owing to to their exposure to tick-infested areas during the summer. We report 2 cases of boys aged 3 and 8 years who sustained tick bites to the hemiscrotum and penis. Overnight hospitalization and a course of antibiotics were mandatory. In the first case, the child experienced significant scrotal cellulitis with erythema and edema extending to the suprapubic area with induration of the right anterior scrotum at the site of the tick bite. A scrotal ultrasound demonstrated swelling of the scrotal wall. In the second case, considerable swelling and induration of the distal penis and glans, pruritis of the left groin and penis, and an erythematous rash over the entire anterior pelvis were observed. A high index of suspicion is warranted because a tick bite may present as penile edema. Pediatric emergency physicians should be aware of the risks associated with tick bites and accurately diagnose and initiate treatment to prevent morbidity and mortality.

### An atypical presentation of monkeypox associated with scrotal and penile shaft edema [^edd78aa6]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since May 2022, a new global outbreak occurred in cases of human-to human transmission of monkeypox (MPX), an orthopoxvirus., While the mode of transmission in the current outbreak is poorly understood, many cases have occurred following direct physical contact in men who have sex with men., It typically presents as the simultaneous development of discrete or multiple vesiculopustules with a monomorphic morphology and eventual crusting and may also be preceded by a prodrome of fever and lymphadenopathy.,

Compared to previous endemic outbreaks, the current MPX outbreak has been characterized by a wider array of cutaneous and extracutaneous manifestations including lesions possibly in various stages of development and with a majority of cases presenting with anogenital lesions at the site of inoculation., Other novel features include proctitis, dysphagia, penile edema, and secondary bacterial cellulitis. In this report, we discuss a unique case of MPX with only a single characteristic lesion and an atypical, and dramatic presentation of acute-onset scrotal and penile edema. Dermatologists should be aware of atypical MPX presentations in at-risk populations to optimize diagnostic accuracy and prevent over-treatment of clinical mimickers.

A term, appropriate-for-gestational-age, male infant born via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery presented at birth with a full-body erythematous, vesiculobullous rash. He was well-appearing with normal vital signs and hypoglycemia that quickly resolved. His father had a history of herpes labialis. His mother had an episode of herpes zoster during pregnancy and a prolonged rupture of membranes that was adequately treated. The patient underwent a sepsis workup, including 2 attempted but unsuccessful lumbar punctures, and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and acyclovir, given concerns about bacterial or viral infection. The rash evolved over the course of several days. Subsequent workup, with particular attention to his history and presentation, led to his diagnosis.

### Noninfectious penile lesions [^c3e93f11]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Family physicians commonly diagnose and manage penile cutaneous lesions. Noninfectious lesions may be classified as inflammatory and papulosquamous (e.g., psoriasis, lichen sclerosus, angiokeratomas, lichen nitidus, lichen planus), or as neoplastic (e.g., carcinoma in situ, invasive squamous cell carcinoma). The clinical presentation and appearance of the lesions guide the diagnosis. Psoriasis presents as red or salmon-colored plaques with overlying scales, often with systemic lesions. Lichen sclerosus presents as a phimotic, hypopigmented prepuce or glans penis with a cellophane-like texture. Angiokeratomas are typically asymptomatic, well-circumscribed, red or blue papules, whereas lichen nitidus usually produces asymptomatic pinhead-sized, hypopigmented papules. The lesions of lichen planus are pruritic, violaceous, polygonal papules that are typically systemic. Carcinoma in situ should be suspected if the patient has velvety red or keratotic plaques of the glans penis or prepuce, whereas invasive squamous cell carcinoma presents as a painless lump, ulcer, or fungating irregular mass. Some benign lesions, such as psoriasis and lichen planus, can mimic carcinoma in situ or squamous cell carcinoma. Biopsy is indicated if the diagnosis is in doubt or neoplasm cannot be excluded. The management of benign penile lesions usually involves observation or topical corticosteroids; however, neoplastic lesions generally require surgery.

### A healthy infant with an ulcerated genital lesion: diagnostic and therapeutic considerations [^4c71de4d]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

We present the case of a 1-year-old healthy boy who was taking oral antibiotics for an otitis media and then developed an erythematous penile lesion that rapidly became ulcerated. He was admitted to the hospital for further diagnostic studies and intravenous therapy, and his wound culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, consistent with the diagnosis of ecthyma gangrenosum. Serial blood counts also demonstrated a progressive neutropenia, and an immunodeficiency evaluation resulted in the diagnosis of autoimmune neutropenia of childhood. This case illustrates the importance of culturing wounds and the need for clinicians to recognize the characteristic features of ecthyma gangrenosum, to initiate appropriate antipseudomonal antibiotic therapy empirically, and to evaluate for a possible immunodeficiency, even in the apparently healthy child.

### Clinical features and novel presentations of human monkeypox in a central london centre during the 2022 outbreak: descriptive case series [^4a1c92c7]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

We describe the clinical characteristics of the first 197 patients with monkeypox infection diagnosed or managed within a south London HCID centre and associated sexual health and HIV services during the 2022 outbreak in London. We identified important differences in clinical manifestations between the current outbreak and previous outbreaks in endemic regions, which colleagues in the wider healthcare setting, including primary care and clinics specialising in genitourinary medicine; ear, nose, and throat conditions; and infectious diseases should be aware of to facilitate early diagnosis of monkeypox infection (table 5).

Table 5
Summary of signs and symptoms of monkeypox infection in a London 2022 cohort compared with previous reports from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2007–11 and Nigeria in 2017–18

NA = not available.

Principal findings

The characteristics of the cohort we describe differ from those of populations affected in previous outbreaks in endemic regions. In previous outbreaks where a higher proportion of the population had been vaccinated against smallpox, most infections occurred in young children. More recently, outbreaks of the West African and Congo Basin clades have affected both adults and children, with male patients being disproportionately represented in some reports in West and Central Africa. In contrast with previous reports, the current cohort comprised men only, and most (99.5%) identified as gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men. Only one participant had recently travelled to an endemic region; this study therefore further corroborates ongoing autochthonous transmission within the UK.

This cohort identifies relatively common symptoms currently excluded from public health messaging and diagnostic criteria. Fourteen per cent of this cohort did not meet the current UK Health Security Agency definition for a probable case. Although not widely described in literature, penile swelling and rectal pain were common presentations in this cohort and the most frequent indications for hospital admission. Severity of symptoms did not, however, always correlate with a high lesion burden or typical patterns of cutaneous manifestations. Five participants presented with abscesses. These patients had a low lesion burden or atypical rashes and therefore monkeypox infection was not suspected during initial review on surgical wards.

Red patches and plaques of the vulva may be manifestations of neoplasms, infections, or inflammatory skin diseases. These diseases can mimic one another clinically; features that generally allow the diseases to be identified on most cutaneous surfaces can be altered in the moist, occluded vulvar environment, making clinical diagnosis difficult. A detailed history and thorough physical examination can point to the likely diagnosis, but biopsy and culture may be needed for diagnosis especially in refractory disease. It is not uncommon for several of these processes to be present concomitantly or complicating other vulvar diseases.

Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a systemic vasculitis syndrome characterized by palpable purpura, glomerulonephritis, arthralgias, and gastrointestinal signs and symptoms. This syndrome typically presents in children between the ages of 4 and 7 years. Renal involvement can be progressive, irreversible, and fatal. Although skin lesions are frequently found on the scrotum and have been described on the penile shaft, no cases of glandular involvement have been previously reported. We describe the presentation of a 4-year-old boy with extensive involvement of painless purpuric lesions on his penile shaft, scrotum, and glans penis.

### Penile cancer: clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1ee15d94]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2013). Medium credibility.

NCCN penile cancer — management overview states that squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the penis mandates prompt medical/surgical intervention and patient adherence to therapy; the initial step is a thorough history and physical examination followed by a biopsy of the primary lesion to establish a pathologic diagnosis, and accurate clinical staging allows a comprehensive treatment approach to be devised, optimizing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing treatment-related morbidity. Prognostic factors help predict if lymph node metastases are suspected in the absence of any palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy, and when clinically indicated an ILND has curative potential, particularly when performed early, with contemporary surgical series demonstrating reduced morbidity. For recurrent or metastatic disease, the Panel recommends participation in well-designed clinical trials when applicable and available, and best supportive care remains an option for advanced cases or cases refractory to systemic therapy, RT, or chemoradiotherapy.

2. Male genital lesions

Discrete papules or larger nodules found on the penis (shaft, corona, glans, prepuce) and/or scrotum are highly specific for scabies. 34 Their surface may be smooth or rough depending on how vigorously the patient has been scratching, but are not scaly. Typically, several lesions are present at one time in an affected individual (Figure 3 g). 74, 75 These lesions are often very itchy, but in some individuals they may not be itchy at all. Genital lesions are reported to occur in up to 10–30% of male patients with scabies, but they may be more frequent in adult male individuals in temperate climates. 58, 76

3. Typical lesions

The clinical signs of common scabies vary widely in terms of the appearance of individual lesions; appearance of grouped or clustered lesions; and severity and degree of secondary changes such as excoriation, impetiginization, eczematization and lichenification (thickening of skin due to scratching and rubbing). In the absence of the highly specific signs of burrows or male genital lesions, the decision whether or not other observed skin lesions are typical for scabies is a critical determination in diagnosing clinical scabies or suspected scabies. For lesions to be considered typical, examiners must consider both morphology and number.

In morphology, typical scabies lesions are small, elevated and easily palpated. The most common lesions are solid and 2–3 mm in diameter (papules). 77 Larger, nodular lesions, usually 5–10 mm and occasionally > 10 mm, are more likely to be seen in certain body areas (groin and genitalia, buttocks, axillae, breasts of women and torsos of infants) 78, 79 and may persist for several months, even after mites are successfully eradicated. The colour is usually erythematous (pink to red) but may be hyperpigmented in darker‐skinned individuals.

HIV Infection

Detection, Counseling, and Referral

Infection with HIV causes an acute but brief and nonspecific influenza-like retroviral syndrome that can include fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, arthritis, or skin rash. Most persons experience at least one symptom; however, some might be asymptomatic or have no recognition of illness. Acute infection transitions to a multiyear, chronic illness that progressively depletes CD4 + T lymphocytes crucial for maintenance of effective immune function. Ultimately, persons with untreated HIV infection experience symptomatic, life-threatening immunodeficiency (i.e. AIDS).

Effective ART that suppresses HIV replication to undetectable levels reduces morbidity, provides a near-normal lifespan, and prevents sexual transmission of HIV to others (.). Early diagnosis of HIV and rapid linkage to care are essential for achieving these goals. Guidelines from both the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the International AIDS Society–USA Panel recommend that all persons with HIV infection be offered effective ART as soon as possible, both to reduce morbidity and mortality and to prevent HIV transmission.

STD specialty or sexual health clinics are a vital partner in reducing HIV infections in the United States. These clinics provide safety net services to vulnerable populations in need of HIV prevention services who are not served by the health care system and HIV partner service organizations. Diagnosis of an STI is a biomarker for HIV acquisition, especially among persons with primary or secondary syphilis or, among MSM, rectal gonorrhea or chlamydia. STD clinics perform only approximately 20% of all federally funded HIV tests nationally but identify approximately 30% of all new infections. Among testing venues, STD clinics are high performing in terms of linkage to HIV care within 90 days of diagnosis; during 2013–2017, the percentage of persons with a new diagnosis in an STD clinic and linked to care within 90 days increased from 55% to > 90%.

### Syphilis in dermatology: recognition and management [^cb2d6591]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

The incidence of syphilis has been increasing in the USA since 2000. Notably, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic negatively impacted the public health efforts to contain the spread of sexually transmitted diseases including syphilis and congenital syphilis. Clinical manifestations of syphilis are predominantly mucocutaneous lesions, thus dermatologists are primed to recognize the myriad presentations of this disease. Primary syphilis is classically characterized by a painless transient chancre most often located in the genital area. Secondary syphilis typically manifests clinically as systemic symptoms in addition to a mucocutaneous eruption of which a variety of forms exist. Although less common in the era of effective penicillin treatment, late clinical manifestations of syphilis are described as well. In addition to recognition of syphilis on physical examination, several diagnostic tools may be used to confirm infection. Treponema pallidum spirochetes may be detected directly using histopathologic staining, darkfield microscopy, direct fluorescent antibody, and polymerase chain reaction assays. A table detailing the histopathologic features of syphilis is included in this article. Serologic testing, non-treponemal and treponemal tests, is the preferred method for screening and diagnosing syphilis infections. Two serologic testing algorithms exist to aid clinicians in diagnosing positive syphilis infection. Determining the correct stage of syphilis infection combines results of serologic tests, patient history, and physical examination findings. Using the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definitions and treatment guidelines, a management algorithm is proposed here. Penicillin remains the pharmacological treatment of choice although specific clinical situations allow for alternative therapies. Syphilis is a reportable disease in every state and should be reported by stage according to individual state requirements. Screening recommendations are largely based upon risks encountered through sexual exposures. Likewise, sexual partner management includes evaluating and treating persons exposed to someone diagnosed with an infective stage of syphilis. Close clinical follow-up and repeat testing are recommended to ensure appropriate response to treatment. This guide will discuss the current epidemiology of syphilis and focus on practice aspects of diagnosis and management, including public health reporting.

This review will present an algorithmic approach to rashes, focusing on life-threatening causes of rash in each category.

Discussion

Rash is common, with a wide range of etiologies. The differential is broad, consisting of many conditions that are self-resolving. However, several conditions associated with rash are life threatening. Several keys can be utilized to rapidly diagnose and manage these deadly rashes. Thorough history and physical examination, followed by consideration of red flags, are essential. This review focuses on four broad categories based on visual and tactile characteristic patterns of rashes: petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. Rashes in each morphologic group will be further categorized based on clinical features such as the presence or absence of fever and distribution of skin lesions.

Conclusions

Rashes can be divided into petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. After this differentiation, the presence of fever and systemic signs of illness should be assessed. Through the breakdown of rashes into these classes, emergency providers can ensure deadly conditions are considered.

### Cellulitis of the penis: a case report [^0bdaa55a]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis of the penis is an uncommon clinical condition, most often seen in young men, and presents with local and systemic signs that progress rapidly in the absence of treatment. It needs to be differentiated from sexually transmitted infections and dermatological conditions. The present report concerns a case of penile cellulitis in a young, heterosexual man, following sexual intercourse. The clinical presentation, aetiology and management are discussed. Penile swelling in any age group should be viewed with high index of suspicion and sexually transmitted infections should be excluded in young men. Group B haemolytic streptococci are the usual causative organisms, although less virulent organisms should be considered in patients who are immunocompromised. Administration of appropriate antibiotics resolves the local and systemic symptoms and avoids complications.

Molluscum contagiosum may present in a variety of clinical and pathologic guises. We present the clinicopathologic features of an unusual case that initially was misinterpreted as bowenoid papulosis. The relevant histologic attributes of this case include the presence of a violaceous hyperplastic squamous epithelium adjacent to the infected keratinocytes. The presence of this violaceous cytoplasmic staining should prompt a search for molluscum in the appropriate clinical context.

QUESTION

A 45-year-old African American man with history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presented to the office complaining of a rash in his right groin for the past 7 weeks. He had a history of nonadherence to his combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), and at a previous visit, his HIV-1 load was noted to be > 10 000 000 copies/mL. After that visit, the patient became adherent with his cART regimen. He presented to his primary care physician's office 3 weeks later, reporting a lesion in his right groin, and was treated with doxycycline for possible skin and soft-tissue infection. Blood work performed 2 weeks later showed an HIV-1 viral load of 1604 copies/mL. The patient was seen in the infectious disease clinic and reported that the rash had only gotten worse. He described it as "itchy but not painful." He denied fevers, chills, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

At physical examination, the patient appeared well developed and well nourished. No oropharyngeal thrush was seen at oral examination. Findings of neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examination were also unremarkable. Skin examination revealed multiple exophytic masses in the right inguinal and perineal areas, the largest measuring about 3 cm in diameter, and areas of hypopigmentation (Figure 1). There was no associated erythema or tenderness to palpation. The CD4 + cell count was 59/μL, and the HIV load, 733 copies/mL. The patient was referred to dermatology for biopsy. What is your diagnosis?

### Visual clues-dermatological manifestations of sexually transmitted infections in men [^cadc77a1]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2025). High credibility.

Considering the increasing prevalence of sexually transmitted infections, accurate diagnosis and management based on the diverse dermatological presentations of sexually transmitted infections are crucial. A strong visual diagnostic skill set guides clinicians towards prompt recognition, directs appropriate diagnostic testing and enables timely initiation of treatment. This procedure in turn helps to interrupt infection transmission and mitigate long-term complications. Thus, incorporating visual learning and a dermatological perspective into urology training is essential, empowering urologists to make a difference in improving sexual health outcomes and supporting public health efforts.

### Noninfectious penile lesions [^55bc4c68]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Noninfectious penile lesions are classified by clinical presentation as papulosquamous (e.g., psoriasis), inflammatory (e.g., lichen sclerosus, lichen nitidus, lichen planus), vascular (e.g., angiokeratomas), or neoplastic (e.g., carcinoma in situ, invasive squamous cell carcinoma). Psoriasis presents as red or salmon-colored plaques with overlying silvery scales, often with extragenital cutaneous lesions. Lichen sclerosus presents as a phimotic, hypopigmented prepuce or glans penis with a cellophane-like texture. Lichen nitidus usually produces asymptomatic pinhead-sized, hypopigmented papules. The lesions of lichen planus are pruritic, violaceous, polygonal papules that are typically systemic. Angiokeratomas are typically asymptomatic, well-circumscribed, red or blue papules, often with annular or figurate configurations. Carcinoma in situ should be suspected if there are velvety red or keratotic plaques on the glans penis or prepuce, whereas invasive squamous cell carcinoma presents as a painless lump, ulcer, or fungating mass. Some benign lesions, such as psoriasis and lichen planus, may mimic carcinoma in situ or invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Biopsy is indicated if the diagnosis is in doubt or neoplasm cannot be excluded. The management of benign noninfectious penile lesions usually involves observation, topical corticosteroids, or topical calcineurin inhibitors. Neoplastic lesions generally warrant organ-sparing surgery.

### Reactive arthritis following COVID-19 vaccination with BNT162b2 [^dd67910d]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 49-year-old previously healthy man presented with progressively worsening skin lesions and arthritis. Roughly 1 week after receiving the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, he developed a painful rash and swelling of the right foot, with progression of the rash to the left foot and penis. He did not have any preceding genitourinary or gastrointestinal symptoms. His primary care provider diagnosed a bacterial infection and prescribed a 2-week course of doxycycline 100 mg twice daily. He then received a 10-day course of prednisone 20 mg daily for joint pains. Over the next 2 weeks, he developed worsening arthritis of the shoulders, hands, and feet. At this time, he received prescriptions for gabapentin 600 mg and nifedipine 30 mg once daily for a presumed diagnosis of chilblains. The patient's cutaneous and systemic symptoms persisted, and he experienced an unintentional weight loss of approximately 20 pounds.

The patient presented to our emergency department approximately 2 months after the onset of his rash. Physical examination revealed pink papulopustules and keratoderma on the plantar aspects of the feet (Fig 1, A and B), extensive onycholysis, nail thickening, and subungual debris of the toenails (Fig 1, C); tender edema of the right foot and joints of the right hand (Fig 1, D and E), and a scaly erythematous plaque on the penis (Fig 1, F). Laboratory workup showed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and an elevated level of C-reactive protein. Blood and urine cultures were negative. HLA-B27 testing by flow cytometry was indeterminate. Further HLA-B27 genotyping was not performed; a definitive result was therefore not obtained. Additionally, the patient tested negative for syphilis, HIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.

### Management of genitourinary injuries [^50c5d416]. ACS (2025). High credibility.

Penile fracture — assessment and diagnosis guidance includes clinical and imaging steps: Evaluate patients for penile fracture when presenting with penile ecchymosis, edema, and pain following penile sexual trauma associated with rapid erection detumescence. The diagnosis of penile fracture may be made by history and physical examination alone. For patients presenting with indeterminate history and physical exam, penile ultrasound or MRI may be used to evaluate for penile fracture. Both imaging options have excellent sensitivity, so consider them in equivocal or more complex cases. The imaging selected is based on the clinician's index of suspicion, access, and the facility's imaging capabilities. Perform a RUG or a cystoscopy when penile fracture injury is present with any of the following findings: concomitant blood at the meatus, gross hematuria, and difficulty with urination (e.g., weak urinary stream or acute urinary retention).

### Scrotal and penile edema in a patient with incomplete Kawasaki disease: a case report and brief literature review [^945410f4]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

On physical examination, the patient had bilateral conjunctivitis with limbic sparing, shotty unilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, and a flesh-colored papular rash on the chest, back, and posterior right leg. The patient's penis and scrotum were swollen, erythematous, and tender to touch. Scrotal ultrasound showed scrotal wall edema and hyperemia (Fig. 1). Urology was consulted and also noted that the patient's penis was edematous with most of the edema present along the preputial cuff and recommended using a barrier ointment and doing serial exams. Echocardiogram came back negative for coronary artery aneurysm. On day 2 of admission, his respiratory viral panel came back positive for rhino/enterovirus and his blood and urine cultures came back negative. His scrotal edema was also observed to have resolved and his penile swelling had improved, but did not resolve. He continued to be febrile, his blood albumin level decreased to 3.0 g/dL, and he became anemic for his age (Hb 10.4 gm/dL). He was diagnosed with incomplete KD due to the presence of 3 clinical criteria and 4 supplemental lab criteria. His antibiotics were stopped and he was started on IVIG (2 g/kg over 12 h) and moderate dose aspirin (30 mg/kg divided q6H). Over the next few days, the patient's rash and conjunctivitis improved. He defervesced on day 4 of admission, and his penile swelling continued to improve. On day 5 of admission, he was transitioned to low dose aspirin (81 mg daily) and discharged home.

Follow up approximately 2 weeks after discharge revealed that the patient had made a complete recovery. His repeat echocardiogram was negative for coronary artery dilation and his physical exam was negative for periungual desquamation. He was continued on aspirin until his next echocardiogram. Follow up at 2 months showed a normal echocardiogram and his physical exam remained negative for periungual desquamation.

### Male genital dermatoses in old age [^ffd72323]. Age and Ageing (2008). Low credibility.

This review aims to highlight the clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of the most common dermatoses of the male genitals in old age. Diseases of the male genitalia range from infectious problems to inflammatory and neoplastic dermatoses. These can affect sexual and urinary functions. The importance of the former in older men should not be underestimated. Pre-malignant and malignant penile lesions are discussed. Although rare, penis cancer is preventable and curable if diagnosed early.

### Penile cancer: clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^c78de06c]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2013). Medium credibility.

Penile cancer (NCCN Guidelines) management summary: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the penis is a disease that mandates prompt medical/surgical intervention and patient adherence to therapy to obtain the most favorable outcomes. A thorough history and physical examination is the initial step, followed by a biopsy of the primary lesion to establish a pathologic diagnosis. Accurate clinical staging allows for a comprehensive treatment approach, optimizing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing treatment-related morbidity. Prognostic factors help predict if lymph node metastases are suspected in the absence of any palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy. When clinically indicated, an inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) has curative potential, particularly when performed early, with contemporary surgical series demonstrating its reduced morbidity. However, recurrent or metastatic disease still represents a major clinical challenge; the Panel recommends participation in well-designed clinical trials when applicable and available. Best supportive care remains an option for advanced cases or cases refractory to systemic therapy, radiation therapy (RT), or chemoradiotherapy.

### Monkeypox presenting as a hand consult in the emergency department: two case reports [^a64fd357]. Hand (2023). Medium credibility.

Patient B

Presentation

Patient B is a 29-year-old man with a medical history of HIV of 11 years, with poor medication compliance for the past 6 months, who presented to the ED with a 2-week history of purulent penile discharge and a gradually worsening ulcer over the dorsum of his long finger metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ; Figure 3). He also reported a truncal rash that started 3 weeks ago. He works as a dishwasher and has been repeatedly picking at the ulcer over this time. In the past week, the area surrounding the wound became swollen, erythematous, and painful. A number of vesicles appeared on the dorsum of the hand as well. Physical examination showed swelling and erythema surrounding the long finger MCPJ. There was an ulcer with hypertrophic scarring over the MCPJ dorsum, with mild tenderness to palpation. There was no pain with movement. He had normal strength and sensation throughout. Review of systems was largely negative except for his penile discharge and hand pain.

Figure 3.
Bilateral hands of patient B upon presentation.

Diagnosis

Hand x-ray showed some soft tissue swelling with no signs of osteomyelitis. Labs demonstrated a CD4 count of 319, viral load 156 000. An excision of the lesion was performed at bedside and sent for pathology, stain, and cultures. Urethral swab resulted positive for gonorrhea, but negative for Chlamydia trachomatis. Blood cultures were negative. After the patient developed vesicular lesions on the face and arms, swabs of vesicular fluid were sent for PCR NAAT testing, and a diagnosis of mpox was confirmed.

Treatment

Upon presentation, the patient was immediately restarted on his antiretroviral medications (bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide) and ceftriaxone for suspected disseminated gonorrhea. As discussed, the patient's gonorrhea was not disseminated, and thus 1 dose was adequate to successfully treat this. Vancomycin was added to cover possible superimposed bacterial infection of his unroofed ulcers. This was discontinued after cultures of the lesion were negative on gram stain and culture. He continued his antiretroviral therapy and treated his hand pruritis and swelling with elevation and warm soapy soaks 6 times daily.

Disease course/outcome

After treatment of his HIV, the patient's vesicular lesions improved on hospital day 4, and the patient was discharged home to quarantine. Follow-up visit 23 days after initial presentation confirmed the resolution of all skin changes and no permanent defects. The patient returned to work without complaints.

Management of primary lesions — diagnosis focuses on comprehensive assessment, stating, "Evaluation of the primary lesion, regional lymph nodes, and distant metastasis will dictate the appropriate and adequate management of SCC of the penis, beginning with the first evaluation at presentation and then throughout follow-up." The page emphasizes, "Vital to the initial management is a good physical examination of the penile lesion(s) that remarks on the diameter of the lesion(s) or suspicious areas; location(s) on the penis; number of lesions; morphology of the lesion(s); whether the lesion(s) are papillary, nodular, ulcerous, or flat; and the relationship with other structures including submucosal, urethra, corpora spongiosa, and/or corpora cavernosa."

Initial evaluation and imaging — penile cancer: Histologic diagnosis with a punch, excisional, or incisional biopsy is paramount to determine the treatment algorithm based on a pathologic diagnosis, and HPV and HIV status should also be assessed due to prognostic significance and potential implications for decision-making. MRI or ultrasound can be used to evaluate the depth of tumor invasion, and imaging may also be considered for evaluation of ILNs that are difficult to assess.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^36ebfd37]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Because early syphilis treatment decreases transmission possibility, public health standards require health care providers to presumptively treat any patient with a suspected case of infectious syphilis at the initial visit, even before test results are available. Presumptive treatment of a patient with a suspected first episode of genital herpes also is recommended because HSV treatment benefits depend on prompt therapy initiation. The clinician should choose the presumptive treatment on the basis of the clinical presentation (i.e. HSV lesions begin as vesicles and primary syphilis as a papule) and epidemiologic circumstances (e.g. high incidence of disease among populations and communities and travel history). For example, syphilis is so common among MSM that any male who has sex with men presenting with a genital ulcer should be presumptively treated for syphilis at the initial visit after syphilis and HSV tests are performed. After a complete diagnostic evaluation, > 25% of patients who have genital ulcers might not have a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis.

Chancroid

Chancroid prevalence has declined in the United States. When infection does occur, it is usually associated with sporadic outbreaks. Worldwide, chancroid appears to have decreased as well, although infection might still occur in certain Africa regions and the Caribbean. Chancroid is a risk factor in HIV transmission and acquisition.

### Oral ulcers as a presentation of secondary syphilis [^7f0664bc]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The incidence of syphilis is increasing, and it typically presents in patients with known risk factors, often to genitourinary physicians. Patients presenting to a dermatologist or ophthalmologist will more likely have secondary syphilis, with the potential for having the associated complications. Early recognition is therefore vital to limit both the disease and risk of further contact spread. In this review, we include two case histories demonstrating the value of recognizing oral signs. Additionally, we review the currently accepted diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations.

### Fixed drug eruption-induced balanoposthitis: a case report [^387ef1c7]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Fixed Drug Eruptions (FDE) represent a distinctive type of adverse drug reaction, typically characterized by recurring, sharply demarcated skin lesions occurring at identical sites with each administration of the causative drug. A less frequent, albeit significant manifestation of FDE, is balanoposthitis, an inflammatory condition affecting the glans penis and prepuce. This rare case report explores the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and therapeutic management of FDE-induced balanoposthitis in a 34-year-old male patient who developed this condition following azithromycin administration to treat a pulmonary infection. The patient's distinctive symptoms, coupled with a medical history of similar antibiotic-induced reactions, pointed strongly towards an FDE diagnosis. Management entailed immediate discontinuation of the offending drug and initiation of symptomatic treatment, culminating in a positive therapeutic outcome. This case illuminates the potential of commonly prescribed medications, such as antibiotics, to incite balanoposthitis via FDE. It underscores the critical need for healthcare professionals to include FDE in their differential diagnosis for balanoposthitis, especially when patient exposure to high-risk medications is evident. Furthermore, the report emphasizes the pressing requirement for additional research to elucidate the pathogenesis of FDE-induced balanoposthitis and to devise effective therapeutic and preventive measures.

### A case of nonuremic calciphylaxis of the penis responding to sodium thiosulfate therapy [^e6ce1229]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

The vast majority of penile calciphylaxis cases have overwhelmingly been reported in the setting of end-stage renal disease. This case highlights the importance of keeping calciphylaxis on differential diagnosis even in the absence of severe renal compromise and other common presenting features. Additionally, documentation of the patient's presentation and favorable clinical course reinforces both the diagnostic utility of radiographic imaging in the absence of positive histopathologic findings and the use of STS as a therapeutic approach for NUC. More research and clinical trials are required to determine optimal imaging protocols in diagnostic work-up.

### Using the evidence base on genital herpes: optimising the use of diagnostic tests and information provision [^2fdcc64b]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2002). Low credibility.

There have been several important advances in the range of available diagnostic tests for genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in recent years; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is emerging in routine clinical use and the potential role of type specific serological tests is currently under debate. Several large trials of prophylactic vaccines, subsequently proved to be ineffective, have expanded knowledge of the transmission and epidemiology of HSV infection. This article discusses optimal application of recent research evidence to clinical care, structured around the key issues for patients and their partners. These include acquisition and transmission of genital HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection, the natural history of genital herpes, and the role of partner notification.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^731fb2a3]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Anogenital warts — diagnostic considerations: Diagnosis of anogenital warts is usually made by visual inspection but can be confirmed by biopsy, which is indicated if lesions are atypical (for example, pigmented, indurated, affixed to underlying tissue, bleeding, or ulcerated lesions). Biopsy might also be indicated if the patient is immunocompromised (including those with HIV infection), if the diagnosis is uncertain, if lesions do not respond to standard therapy, or if disease worsens during therapy. HPV testing is not recommended for anogenital wart diagnosis because test results are not confirmatory and do not guide genital wart management; some anogenital lesions can resemble anogenital warts (condyloma acuminata) but do not respond to anogenital wart treatment, and condyloma lata, a manifestation of secondary syphilis, can be diagnosed by serologic tests or through direct detection from serous fluid from the lesions.

### Red scrotum syndrome: an update on clinicopathologic features, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^bfceb492]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The genital skin may be affected by a variety of dermatoses, be it inflammatory, infectious, malignant, idiopathic, or others. The red scrotum syndrome is characterized by persistent erythema of the scrotum associated with a burning sensation, hyperalgesia, and itching. Its cause is unknown, but proposed mechanisms include rebound vasodilation after prolonged topical corticosteroid use and localized erythromelalgia. The condition is chronic, and treatment is often difficult. Here we review the etiology, the physical and histopathologic findings, and the management of this condition. We also describe related conditions such as red scalp syndrome, red ear syndrome, and red vulva syndrome. Finally, we summarize the different cases reported in the literature and discuss the features that help in the differentiation of red scrotum syndrome from its mimickers.

### Clinical and penile dermoscopy evaluation of a reticulated pattern on the penile glans [^cf559653]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old man visited our clinic for evaluation of a mildly pruritic lesion on the glans. He complained of a recurrent red patch, which had been slowly enlarging over the previous three months. Clinical examination revealed a slightly raised plaque with a reticulated lacy net pattern and white threads on the glans. There was no evidence of skin, nail or other mucosal involvement on physical examination. Laboratory tests, including hepatitis and syphilis serologies, were normal or negative. Penile dermoscopy revealed white reticular and circular lines [Wickham striae] on a red background. Penile dermoscopy should be included as a part of the clinical inspection of genital diseases to support diagnosis, as well as to ideally avoid unnecessary invasive investigation.

### Infant with a rapidly progressing rash [^b5c8a91e]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

An infant presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of rapidly progressing erythematous macules and distal oedema. The rash was striking in appearance, covering most of the body, which raised concern for pressing infectious (eg, meningococcaemia) and other serious aetiologies. Nevertheless, the infant remained playful and was overall stable and posed a diagnostic and management dilemma. After an extensive workup and multispecialty consultations, the patient was eventually diagnosed with acute haemorrhagic oedema of infancy, a benign leucocytoclastic vasculitis. The patient received no treatment and resolution of the rash occurred within 7 days of onset. Recognition of this condition and its benign nature can spare patients from an extensive workup and reduce anxiety for both family members and healthcare providers.

### Penile cancer: clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^4b3bd189]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2013). Medium credibility.

Penile cancer initial evaluation — histologic diagnosis with a punch, excisional, or incisional biopsy is paramount in determining the treatment algorithm based on a pathologic diagnosis. HPV and HIV status should also be assessed, as HPV or HIV positivity has prognostic significance, could prompt screening for sexual partners, and may be considered in treatment decision-making. MRI or ultrasound can be used to evaluate the depth of tumor invasion. Imaging may also be considered for evaluation of ILNs that are difficult to assess.

### Sacral zoster with a primary complaint of difficulty voiding [^a7ce5814]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Although a more complete workup by the urgent care physician might have helped avoid the adverse drug reaction, the patient's subsequent emergency department visit also did not bring him closer to a definitive diagnosis. It was only after later eruption of the unilateral vesicular rash that the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms became clear. These findings suggest that in the setting of acute urinary retention without any other clear diagnostic signs, sacral zoster may be an important consideration, even in the absence of the classic shingles rash.

### Penile cancer: clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^7b2b3921]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for penile cancer - NCCN, more specifically with respect to histopathology, NCCN 2013 guidelines recommend to recognize the following regarding invasive carcinoma:

- **HPV-associated SCC**: Subtypes include basaloid, warty, clear cell, lymphoepithelioma-like, and mixed

- **HPV-independent SCC**: Subtypes include SCC usual type (includes pseudohyperplastic and pseudoglandular), verrucous carcinoma (includes carcinoma cuniculatum), papillary, sarcomatoid, and mixed

- SCC not otherwise specified (NOS) (invasive keratinizing carcinoma without special features, for which evaluation of p16 is not available)

- **Other epithelial tumors**: Adenosquamous carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, Paget disease, extramammary.
