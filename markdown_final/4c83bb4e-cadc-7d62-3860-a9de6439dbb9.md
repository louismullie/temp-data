## Question

Neurally mediated syncope

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about neurally mediated syncope. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining neurally mediated syncope and its subtypes. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology, including the Bezold-Jarisch reflex and cerebral autoregulation. Next, I will review epidemiology and clinical features. After that, I need to check the diagnostic approach, including history, ECG, orthostatics, tilt testing, and when to use ILR. Then, I will examine mechanism-based treatment, including nonpharmacologic, pharmacologic, and pacing strategies. I should also consider special populations and emerging therapies. Finally, I will appraise the evidence quality and synthesize practical recommendations with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't misstate the entity. Neurally mediated syncope, also called reflex syncope, is a transient loss of consciousness due to a reflex that causes vasodilation, bradycardia, or both, leading to hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion; subtypes include vasovagal, carotid sinus, and situational syncope, with vasovagal being the most common form [^027c8cae] [^6f556484].

> I need to verify the pathophysiology next. The classic mechanism is the Bezold-Jarisch reflex, recently mapped to neuropeptide Y receptor Y2–expressing vagal sensory neurons connecting the ventricular wall to the area postrema; optogenetic activation reproduces hypotension, bradycardia, suppressed respiration, and loss of consciousness, confirming a causal role in syncope physiology [^13fc21f6]. Hold on, I should also consider cerebral hemodynamics: cerebral autoregulation can paradoxically increase cerebrovascular resistance during hypocapnia, worsening cerebral hypoperfusion despite falling blood pressure, which helps explain why hyperventilation and hypocapnia can precipitate syncope in susceptible individuals [^7e7ff100] [^e6005d73].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and clinical features to anchor pretest probability. Vasovagal syncope is the most common cause of syncope across ages, with lifetime prevalence exceeding one third in some cohorts, and it accounts for roughly three quarters of pediatric syncope; it typically presents with a prodrome of nausea, diaphoresis, warmth, pallor, and visual dimming, followed by rapid recovery with fatigue, and is often triggered by prolonged standing, pain, fear, or emotional stress [^c7a4c7d7] [^e00343cf] [^027c8cae]. Wait, let me verify the pediatric angle: yes, neurally mediated syncope dominates pediatric presentations, with peaks in toddlers for breath-holding spells and in adolescents for vasovagal events, which aligns with guideline summaries [^e00343cf] [^b5a68c94].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach, starting with history and examination. A careful history, including triggers, prodrome, posture, and recovery, plus a focused exam with orthostatic vitals and a 12-lead ECG, diagnoses a substantial proportion of cases and stratifies risk; the absence of heart disease makes cardiac syncope unlikely, whereas supine syncope or exertional events raise concern for cardiac etiologies [^79701765] [^3cf90922]. Hold on, I should verify the role of orthostatics: guidelines emphasize measuring supine, immediate standing, and 3-minute upright blood pressure and heart rate to screen for orthostatic hypotension and autonomic failure, which can mimic or coexist with reflex syncope [^79701765].

> Next, I should review tilt testing, but I need to be cautious about its limitations. Tilt testing can reproduce vasovagal physiology and help when the diagnosis is uncertain, yet passive drug-free tilt has limited sensitivity and specificity that vary with duration and protocol; estimated specificity is about 88–94% at 30–60 minutes, while imputed sensitivity ranges roughly 27–74% depending on prevalence assumptions, so a negative test does not exclude neurally mediated syncope and a positive test must be interpreted in clinical context [^3b42c111]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied tilt testing is mandatory; it is not, and guidelines advise reserving tilt testing for cases where the diagnosis remains unclear after the initial evaluation [^79701765].

> I should confirm when to escalate to prolonged monitoring. In unexplained syncope, particularly with infrequent events or when distinguishing seizure from syncope, an implantable loop recorder can document spontaneous rhythm during symptoms and change management; ILR is especially useful when the mechanism is uncertain or when a bradyarrhythmic phenotype would alter therapy, and is endorsed by contemporary guidelines for selected patients [^ce902cd5] [^79701765]. Let me reconsider the yield: yes, ILR frequently clarifies diagnosis in unexplained syncope cohorts, including in patients with bundle branch block where paroxysmal AV block may be the culprit despite negative electrophysiology [^ce902cd5].

> Now, I need to ensure the treatment framework is mechanism-specific rather than one-size-fits-all. The cornerstone is education, trigger avoidance, and liberal salt and fluid intake, with physical counter-maneuvers such as leg crossing, squatting, and lower-body muscle tensing at prodrome; these measures reduce recurrences and are first-line in vasovagal syncope [^79701765] [^9c66a926]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric guidance: yes, reassurance, hydration, salt as appropriate, and counter-maneuvers are recommended, with midodrine considered if lifestyle fails, and beta-blockers are not beneficial in pediatric vasovagal syncope [^2781bbb3] [^51140dfd].

> Let me examine pharmacologic options and their evidence base. Midodrine, an alpha-1 agonist, has the most consistent signal across small randomized and observational studies, reducing tilt-positive responses and recurrences in adults and children; guidelines give it a Class IIa recommendation in selected patients not responding to conservative therapy, including pediatrics [^ba6d791a] [^054af738] [^51140dfd]. Fludrocortisone has limited and conflicting evidence; a pediatric RCT suggested benefit, but adult data are sparse, so it is considered uncertain and reserved for select cases, particularly in hypotensive phenotypes [^3a98de67] [^2781bbb3]. I should double-check beta-blockers: multiple randomized trials, including a double-blind study of atenolol, show no benefit in vasovagal syncope, and guidelines advise against their routine use [^720e6b12] [^3a98de67].

> But wait, what if the phenotype is bradycardic rather than hypotensive. In patients with documented asystolic neurally mediated syncope, particularly with prolonged pauses, dual-chamber pacing with rate-drop response reduces recurrence; ISSUE-3 showed a 57% relative risk reduction in recurrence with pacing versus sensing-only, though absolute recurrence remained 25% at 2 years, so patient selection is critical [^28268378]. I should confirm guideline stance: pacing is reasonable in older adults with frequent, severe, cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope or carotid sinus syndrome, but not for vasodepressor-predominant phenotypes, and evidence quality varies with unblinded studies showing benefit while blinded trials are neutral [^79701765] [^f2738cc9].

> Next, I should review special populations and edge cases. In pediatrics, breath-holding spells with prolonged asystole may respond to pacing, with observational series showing high rates of symptom control; this is a niche indication and requires careful documentation of asystole before committing to device therapy [^7ea1d0fa] [^fb0acf09]. In older adults, carotid sinus syndrome is more prevalent and pacing is effective when cardioinhibitory features are present; likewise, unexplained falls in the elderly may reflect hypotensive or bradycardic syncope, and a multidisciplinary approach including tilt testing can unmask autonomic contributors when history is limited by amnesia [^3b314252] [^e39b55cc]. In pregnancy, vasovagal syncope remains common and management emphasizes conservative measures and avoidance of hypotensive medications; pacing is rarely indicated and only for documented severe bradyarrhythmias after specialist review [^7d9b20a0].

> I will now examine emerging therapies, but I should be cautious. Cardioneuromodulation targeting the anterior right ganglionated plexus has shown promising reductions in syncope burden in small, single-center cohorts, with durable physiologic changes at 12 months; however, these data are nonrandomized and industry-supported, so larger multicenter trials are needed before routine adoption [^b91fc76f] [^f773c25b]. Let me verify the mechanism: the approach aims to modulate excessive vagal tone implicated in cardioinhibitory syncope, which aligns with the BJR physiology, but confirmation in blinded or randomized studies is still pending [^b91fc76f].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence and acknowledge limitations. Many pharmacologic trials in vasovagal syncope are small, heterogeneous, and unblinded, and meta-analytic data suggest that lack of blinding inflates apparent treatment effects; this is why guidelines remain conservative and prioritize nonpharmacologic therapy and mechanism-specific interventions [^a7debb50] [^21315274]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: even pacing evidence is mixed, with benefit most convincing in documented asystolic patients and less certain in mixed phenotypes, reinforcing the need for careful phenotyping before invasive therapy [^28268378] [^f2738cc9].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations while keeping these caveats in mind. For most patients with vasovagal syncope, education, salt and fluid expansion, and counter-maneuvers are first-line; if recurrences persist, consider midodrine in hypotensive phenotypes, and reserve pacing for documented asystolic cardioinhibitory cases after ILR confirmation; throughout, avoid beta-blockers and tailor therapy to the dominant mechanism rather than the label alone [^79701765] [^054af738] [^28268378]. I need to ensure safety netting: patients with red flags such as exertional syncope, supine events, structural heart disease, or abnormal ECG require cardiac evaluation for alternative etiologies before attributing symptoms to a reflex mechanism [^79701765] [^3cf90922].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and prognosis. Vasovagal syncope is generally benign but recurrent, with about 25–35% one-year recurrence in unselected cohorts; many patients stop fainting after evaluation and reassurance alone, though those with frequent prior episodes have higher recurrence risk, which justifies anticipatory guidance and individualized escalation if disability persists [^6e655914]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with primary care guidance: yes, structured follow-up to track frequency, triggers, and response to therapy is recommended, with re-evaluation if the pattern changes or new red flags emerge [^79701765].

Neurally mediated syncope (NMS) is a **reflex-driven transient loss of consciousness** due to abrupt vasodilation and/or bradycardia from autonomic dysregulation, most often vasovagal in origin [^027c8cae]. Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, supported by history, exam, and ECG; tilt testing is reserved for uncertain cases or when mechanism-specific therapy is planned [^79701765] [^3b42c111]. First-line management is **education, hydration, salt loading, and counter-pressure maneuvers** [^79701765]; midodrine or fludrocortisone are second-line for recurrent cases, and pacing is reserved for documented cardioinhibitory asystole [^28268378]. Prognosis is generally benign, but recurrence is common and can cause injury, so individualized risk stratification and follow-up are essential [^6e655914].

---

## Pathophysiology

NMS arises from a **paradoxical autonomic reflex** triggered by venous pooling or reduced preload, activating mechanoreceptors and vagal afferents that cause vasodilation and/or bradycardia, culminating in cerebral hypoperfusion and syncope [^13fc21f6]. The **Bezold-Jarisch reflex** — recently mapped to neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 vagal sensory neurons — coordinates hypotension, bradycardia, and respiratory suppression, recapitulating human syncope in animal models [^13fc21f6]. Cerebral autoregulation may be impaired, with paradoxical cerebrovascular constriction worsening hypoperfusion despite falling blood pressure [^7e7ff100].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include:

- **Prodrome**: nausea, diaphoresis, pallor, warmth, visual dimming, dizziness [^027c8cae].
- **Trigger**: prolonged standing, pain, fear, emotional stress, warm environments, or medical procedures [^027c8cae].
- **Posture**: occurs upright; supine syncope suggests cardiac etiology [^3cf90922].
- **Recovery**: rapid, complete, with fatigue but no confusion [^a49d5be2].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Initial evaluation

- **History and physical examination**: identify triggers, prodrome, heart disease, and orthostatic vitals [^79701765].
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: screen for arrhythmias, conduction disease, or structural clues [^42004b1a].
- **Orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate**: assess for orthostatic hypotension or POTS [^79701765].

---

### Advanced testing (if diagnosis uncertain)

- **Tilt-table testing**: reproduces vasovagal physiology; sensitivity improves with longer passive tilt (up to 60 minutes) but remains imperfect [^3b42c111].
- **Implantable loop recorder (ILR)**: documents spontaneous asystole in recurrent, unexplained syncope to guide pacing decisions [^ce902cd5].
- **Autonomic function testing**: evaluates baroreflex and autonomic failure when suspected [^109b15bd].

---

## Management strategies

### Non-pharmacological therapy (first-line)

- **Education**: explain benign nature, triggers, and prodrome recognition [^79701765].
- **Hydration and salt intake**: expand plasma volume; reasonable in selected patients [^2781bbb3].
- **Counter-pressure maneuvers**: leg crossing, lower-body muscle tensing, squatting at prodrome reduce recurrences [^9c66a926].
- **Tilt training**: prolonged standing practice; limited by adherence [^9c66a926].

---

### Pharmacological therapy (second-line for recurrent cases)

| **Medication** | **Mechanism** | **Evidence** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Midodrine | Alpha-1 agonist; vasoconstrictor | RCTs show reduced recurrence | Reasonable in adults and children not responding to lifestyle measures [^ba6d791a] [^054af738] |
| Fludrocortisone | Mineralocorticoid; volume expansion | Limited, mixed data | Consider in recurrent cases; uncertain in pediatrics [^3a98de67] [^2781bbb3] |
| Beta-blockers | Reduce sympathetic surge | No benefit in RCTs | Not recommended [^720e6b12] [^3a98de67] |

---

### Interventional therapy (reserved for select cases)

Dual-chamber pacing is indicated for documented **asystolic cardioinhibitory NMS** (e.g. ISSUE-3), reducing recurrence by about 50% [^28268378]. Cardioneuromodulation (ganglionated plexus ablation) is an emerging, minimally invasive option for refractory cases, with early data showing reduced syncope burden, but **evidence remains limited** [^b91fc76f].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

NMS is **generally benign**, but recurrence is common (25–35% at 1 year) and injury risk increases with frequency and severity [^6e655914]. Most patients improve with education and lifestyle measures; persistent cases warrant mechanism-specific therapy and follow-up [^79701765].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatrics**: NMS is the most common cause; midodrine is reasonable if lifestyle fails; pacing for severe cardioinhibitory breath-holding spells [^e00343cf] [^054af738] [^7ea1d0fa].
- **Elderly**: higher prevalence of orthostatic and carotid sinus syncope; tilt testing and multidisciplinary evaluation help distinguish mechanisms [^e39b55cc].
- **Pregnancy**: vasovagal syncope is common; conservative measures are preferred [^7d9b20a0].

---

Neurally mediated syncope is a **common, benign reflex syncope** with a clear pathophysiology and effective, mechanism-targeted management. A **clinical-first approach** with education, hydration, salt loading, and counter-pressure maneuvers suffices for most; midodrine or pacing are reserved for refractory or cardioinhibitory cases, and recurrence risk guides follow-up intensity [^79701765].

### Adenosine test in the diagnosis of unexplained syncope: marker of conducting tissue disease or neurally mediated syncope? [^d76ac0bc]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Adenosine test (supine administration of a 20 mg intravenous bolus with electrocardiographic and blood pressure monitoring) has been endorsed by the European Society of Cardiology guidelines on syncope management as an 'experimental' test in the diagnosis of unexplained syncope. The test is quick and cheap, but there is no consensus as to what condition, if any, the adenosine test is exposing, with conducting tissue disease and neurally mediated syncope proposed by various authors. In this article, we review the possible mechanisms underlying a positive adenosine test, its safety, and a comprehensive examination of the literature supporting each of the putative causal diagnoses.

### The evaluation and management of pediatric syncope [^b5a07fc2]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common problem in children and adolescents. It is typically caused by benign neurally mediated hypotension, but other, more concerning, etiologies of syncope must be considered. In most instances, the underlying cause of syncope in the pediatric patient can be determined by obtaining a thorough history and physical examination. Attention to the cardiac, neurological, and psychological history and examination can rule out more rare causes of loss of consciousness. Most individuals with neurally mediated hypotension can be treated with lifestyle measures including aggressive hydration, dietary salt, and an exercise program. In instances where lifestyle modification fails, medications may offer symptomatic improvement.

### The second prevention of syncope trial (POST II) – a randomized clinical trial of fludrocortisone for the prevention of neurally mediated syncope: rationale and study design [^dacedaf6]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Neurally mediated syncope is a common and frequently distressing problem. It is associated with a poor quality of life, which improves when the frequency of syncope is reduced. Few therapies for neurally mediated syncope have been proven effective. Fludrocortisone is commonly used to prevent recurrences of syncope but with little evidence to support its use. A placebo-controlled clinical trial of fludrocortisone for the prevention of neurally mediated syncope is needed.

Structure Of Study

POST II is a multicenter, international, randomized, placebo-controlled study of fludrocortisone in the prevention of neurally mediated syncope. The primary end point is the time to first recurrence of syncope. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive fludrocortisone 0.05 to 0.2 mg or matching placebo and followed for 1 year. Secondary end points include syncope frequency, presyncope, and quality of life. Primary analysis will be performed with an intention-to-treat approach, with a secondary on-treatment analysis.

Power Calculations

Assuming a 40% risk of syncope in the control arm, a relative reduction of 40% by fludrocortisone, and a dropout rate of 20%, the enrollment of 310 patients will give an 80% power of reaching a positive conclusion about fludrocortisone therapy, with P = 0.05.

Registration

POST II is registered with both (ISRCTN 51802652) and (NCT00118482).

Implications

This study will be the first adequately powered trial to determine whether fludrocortisone is effective in preventing neurally mediated syncope. If it is effective, then fludrocortisone may become the first-line medical therapy for this condition.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^6f556484]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Reflex syncope (neurally mediated syncope) — definition and subtypes — is described as a heterogeneous reflex response to triggers causing vasodilatation and/or bradycardia with a fall in arterial blood pressure (BP) and cerebral perfusion; it is classified by efferent pathway (sympathetic or parasympathetic) into vasodepressor, cardioinhibitory, or mixed types, and may also be classified by trigger (afferent pathway). Clinical forms include vasovagal syncope (VVS) mediated by emotion or orthostatic stress with typical autonomic prodromes, situational syncope tied to specific circumstances, carotid sinus syncope that in its common form is diagnosed by carotid sinus massage (CSM), and an 'atypical form' where triggers are uncertain or absent.

Initial evaluation features suggesting diagnosis — grouped categories and examples: Clinical features that can suggest a diagnosis on initial evaluation are grouped as neurally mediated syncope, syncope due to orthostatic hypotension (OH), and cardiovascular syncope, with examples including absence of heart disease; after sudden unexpected unpleasant sight, sound, smell or pain; after standing up; presence of definite structural heart disease; abnormal ECG; and sudden onset palpitation immediately followed by syncope.

### A guide to disorders causing transient loss of consciousness: focus on syncope [^1d50c5aa]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Episodes of transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) events pose diagnostic difficulties, as the causes are diverse, carry vastly different risks, and span various specialties. An inconsistent terminology contributes to the confusion. Here, we present a classification scheme for TLOC, based on ongoing multidisciplinary efforts including those of the Task Force on Syncope of the European Society of Cardiology. We also discuss the pathophysiology of TLOC and the key clinical features that aid diagnosis. TLOC is defined as an apparent loss of consciousness with an abrupt onset, a short duration, and a spontaneous and complete recovery. Syncope is defined as TLOC due to cerebral hypoperfusion, and is divided into reflex syncope (synonymous with neurally mediated syncope), syncope due to orthostatic hypotension, and cardiac syncope (arrhythmic or associated with structural cardiac disease). The other major groups of TLOC are generalized epileptic seizures, functional TLOC (psychogenic TLOC mimicking either epilepsy or syncope), and a further group of miscellaneous disorders. The management of patients who experience TLOC requires the recognition of the defining features of each of the major groups, and cooperation between different clinical specialties.

### Evaluation of syncope [^791f7f37]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Syncope is a transient and abrupt loss of consciousness with complete return to preexisting neurologic function. It is classified as neurally mediated (i.e., carotid sinus hypersensitivity, situational, or vasovagal), cardiac, orthostatic, or neurogenic. Older adults are more likely to have orthostatic, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, or cardiac syncope, whereas younger adults are more likely to have vasovagal syncope. Common nonsyncopal syndromes with similar presentations include seizures, metabolic and psychogenic disorders, and acute intoxication. Patients presenting with syncope (other than neurally mediated and orthostatic syncope) are at increased risk of death from any cause. Useful clinical rules to assess the short-term risk of death and the need for immediate hospitalization include the San Francisco Syncope Rule and the Risk Stratification of Syncope in the Emergency Department rule. Guidelines suggest an algorithmic approach to the evaluation of syncope that begins with the history and physical examination. All patients presenting with syncope require electrocardiography, orthostatic vital signs, and QT interval monitoring. Patients with cardiovascular disease, abnormal electrocardiography, or family history of sudden death, and those presenting with unexplained syncope should be hospitalized for further diagnostic evaluation. Patients with neurally mediated or orthostatic syncope usually require no additional testing. In cases of unexplained syncope, further testing such as echocardiography, grade exercise testing, electrocardiographic monitoring, and electrophysiologic studies may be required. Although a subset of patients will have unexplained syncope despite undergoing a comprehensive evaluation, those with multiple episodes compared with an isolated event are more likely to have a serious underlying disorder.

Syncope — history and physical examination — A detailed history and physical examination should be performed in patients with syncope. The physical examination should include determination of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate changes in lying and sitting positions, on immediate standing, and after 3 minutes of upright posture, and a basic neurological examination should be performed. Cardiac syncope carries a significantly worse prognosis than does neurally mediated syncope.

### Cerebral autoregulation and syncope [^7e7ff100]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Whatever the pathogenesis of syncope is, the ultimate common cause leading to loss of consciousness is insufficient cerebral perfusion with a critical reduction of blood flow to the reticular activating system. Brain circulation has an autoregulation system that keeps cerebral blood flow constant over a wide range of systemic blood pressures. Normally, if blood pressure decreases, autoregulation reacts with a reduction in cerebral vascular resistance, in an attempt to prevent cerebral hypoperfusion. However, in some cases, particularly in neurally mediated syncope, it can also be harmful, being actively implicated in a paradox reflex that induces an increase in cerebrovascular resistance and contributes to the critical reduction of cerebral blood flow. This review outlines the anatomic structures involved in cerebral autoregulation, its mechanisms, in normal and pathologic conditions, and the noninvasive neuroimaging techniques used in the study of cerebral circulation and autoregulation. An emphasis is placed on the description of autoregulation pathophysiology in orthostatic and neurally mediated syncope.

### New insights in diagnostics and therapies in syncope: a novel approach to non-cardiac syncope [^192cb1d8]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

This article aims to give advice on how to identify and manage patients with syncope who are at risk of severe outcomes, that is, at risk of trauma, potentially life-threatening episodes or frequent recurrences reducing quality of life. The first step of syncope diagnostic assessment is to identify patients with cardiac syncope, and once established, these patients must receive the adequate mechanism-specific treatment. If cardiac syncope is unlikely, reflex (neurally mediated) syncope and orthostatic hypotension are the most frequent causes of transient loss of consciousness. For these presentations, efficacy of therapy is largely determined by the mechanism of syncope rather than its aetiology or clinical features. The identified mechanism of syncope should be carefully assessed and assigned either to hypotensive or bradycardic phenotype, which will determine the choice of therapy (counteracting hypotension or counteracting bradycardia). The results of recent trials indicate that 'mechanism-specific therapy' is highly effective in preventing recurrences. Established mechanism-specific treatment strategies include withdrawal of hypotensive drugs, applying fludrocortisone and midodrine for the hypotensive phenotype and cardiac pacing in the bradycardic phenotype.

### Syncope: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^7396cc1d]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Syncope is an abrupt and transient loss of consciousness caused by cerebral hypoperfusion. It accounts for 1% to 1.5% of emergency department visits, resulting in high hospital admission rates and significant medical costs. Syncope is classified as neurally mediated, cardiac, and orthostatic hypotension. Neurally mediated syncope is the most common type and has a benign course, whereas cardiac syncope is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with presyncope have similar prognoses to those with syncope and should undergo a similar evaluation. A standardized approach to syncope evaluation reduces hospital admissions and medical costs, and increases diagnostic accuracy. The initial assessment for all patients presenting with syncope includes a detailed history, physical examination, and electrocardiography. The initial evaluation may diagnose up to 50% of patients and allows immediate short-term risk stratification. Laboratory testing and neuroimaging have a low diagnostic yield and should be ordered only if clinically indicated. Several comparable clinical decision rules can be used to assess the short-term risk of death and the need for hospital admission. Low-risk patients with a single episode of syncope can often be reassured with no further investigation. High-risk patients with cardiovascular or structural heart disease, history concerning for arrhythmia, abnormal electrocardiographic findings, or severe comorbidities should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. In cases of unexplained syncope, provocative testing and prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring strategies can be diagnostic. The treatment of neurally mediated and orthostatic hypotension syncope is largely supportive, although severe cases may require pharmacotherapy. Cardiac syncope may require cardiac device placement or ablation.

### Medical therapy and physical maneuvers in the treatment of the vasovagal syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^f7092669]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with vasovagal syncope and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension can both present with pre-syncope and syncope resulting from systemic hypotension. While not directly responsible for increased mortality, both of these conditions can have a tremendous deleterious impact on the daily lives of patients. This negative impact can take the form of both physical symptoms and injury, but also a psychological impact from living in fear of the next syncopal episode. Despite these similarities, these are different disorders with fixed damage to the autonomic nerves in neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, as opposed to a transient reflex hypotension in "neurally mediated" vasovagal syncope. The treatment approaches for both disorders are parallel. The first step is to educate the patient about the pathophysiology and prognosis of their disorder. Next, offending medications should be withdrawn when possible. Non-pharmacological therapies and maneuvers can be used, both in an effort to prevent the symptoms and to prevent syncope at the onset of presyncope. This is all that is required in many patients with vasovagal syncope. If needed, pharmacological options are also available for both vasovagal syncope and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, many of which are focused on blood volume expansion, increasing cardiac venous return, or pressor agents to increase vascular tone. There is a paucity of high-quality clinical trial data to support the use of these pharmacological agents. We aim to review the literature on these different therapy choices and to give recommendations on tailored approaches to the treatment of these conditions.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^3a98de67]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

ESC Guidelines — other pharmacological options for reflex syncope have limited support: fludrocortisone was effective in a small randomized double-blind trial in children, with no trial evidence in adults; β-blockers' mechanistic rationale has not been supported by clinical trials, a rationale in other neurally mediated forms is lacking, and they may enhance bradycardia in carotid sinus syndrome; paroxetine was effective in one placebo-controlled trial from a single institution but has not been confirmed, may reduce anxiety that precipitates events, and requires caution in patients without severe psychiatric disease.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^c56ba33f]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Syncope classification (Table 4) organizes causes into three principal groups: reflex (neurally-mediated) syncope including vasovagal forms mediated by emotional distress or by orthostatic stress, situational triggers such as cough, sneeze, gastrointestinal stimulation (swallow, defecation, visceral pain), micturition (post-micturition), post-exercise, post-prandial, others (e.g., laugh, brass instrument playing, weightlifting), plus carotid sinus syncope and atypical forms; syncope due to orthostatic hypotension from primary autonomic failure, secondary autonomic failure, drug-induced orthostatic hypotension, or volume depletion; and cardiac syncope (cardiovascular) due to arrhythmias — bradycardia from sinus node dysfunction, atrioventricular conduction disease or implanted device malfunction, tachycardia that is supraventricular or ventricular — drug induced bradycardia and tachyarrhythmias, and structural disease including cardiac valvular disease and other causes such as pulmonary embolus, acute aortic dissection, and pulmonary hypertension.

### Syncope… [^b5a68c94]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points Most cases of pediatric syncope occur in adolescence and are benign, either neurally mediated syncope or orthostatic hypotension. In early childhood syncopal episodes typically result from breath-holding spells, either cyanotic or pallid. A detailed history is most crucial in distinguishing benign syncope from less common but more serious episodes, particularly cardiac- induced syncope or seizures. All patients with syncope need close follow-up to monitor for frequency of episodes and response to any therapeutic interventions.

### Midodrine in neurally mediated syncope: a double-blind, randomized, crossover study [^ba6d791a]. Annals of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Neurally mediated syncope is the most frequent cause of syncope in patients without structural heart disease. Its most common trigger is a reduction in venous return to the heart due to excessive venous pooling in the legs. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial to investigate the efficacy of midodrine, a selective alpha-1 adrenergic agonist that decreases venous capacitance, in preventing neurally mediated syncope triggered by passive head-up tilt. Twelve patients with history of recurrent neurally mediated syncope, which was reproduced during head-up tilt, were randomized to receive a nonpressor dose of midodrine (5mg) or placebo on day 1 and the opposite on day 3. One hour after drug or placebo administration, patients underwent 60-degree head-up tilt lasting 40 minutes (unless hypotension or bradycardia developed first). In the supine position, midodrine produced no significant change in blood pressure or heart rate. The responses to head-up tilt were significantly different on the midodrine and the placebo day: on the placebo day, 67% (8/12) of the subjects suffered neurally mediated syncope, whereas only 17% (2/12) of the subjects developed neurally mediated syncope on the midodrine day (p < 0.02). These results indicate that midodrine significantly improves orthostatic tolerance during head-up tilt in patients with recurrent neurally mediated syncope.

### The effects of exercise training on arterial baroreflex sensitivity in neurally mediated syncope patients [^49e1f253]. European Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

The clinical effects of different modalities of treatment for neurally mediated syncope have been studied for years; however, their influences on its pathophysiological mechanisms still have not been determined. This research aimed to observe the effects of physical training, tilt training, and pharmacological therapy on the arterial baroreflex sensitivity and muscle sympathetic nerve activity in neurally mediated syncope patients.

Methods and Results

Seventy patients with recurrent neurally mediated syncope were included in this study. Patients were divided into the following four groups, depending on the treatment proposed: (i) physical training, (ii) tilt training, (iii) pharmacological therapy, and (iv) control group. All patients underwent an autonomic evaluation with microneurography, when the vagal and sympathetic arterial baroreflex gain were tested, using graded infusions of phenylephrine or sodium nitroprusside, before and 4 months after the interventions. The vagal and sympathetic arterial baroreflex gain significantly increased after a 4-month protocol of physical training. Tilt training, pharmacological therapy, and the control group had no significant change in the arterial baroreceptor responses.

Conclusion

Physical training improves arterial baroreflex sensitivity in neurally mediated syncope patients and could be applied as a non-pharmacological therapeutic alternative for these patients.

### Heart rate variability in patients presenting with neurally mediated syncope in an emergency department [^d236174c]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Neurally mediated syncope (NMS) is a disorder of autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation. Orthostatic stress is one of the most common causative factors seen in clinical practice. Analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive method that is used to assess ANS regulation. In this study, we investigated the pathophysiology of NMS using HRV in our emergency department.

Methods

The subjects were 19 patients (age 25.8 ± 6.2 years old) who presented with NMS and 20 healthy individuals (age 26.6 ± 2.7 years old) who served as controls. HRV was measured in supine, sitting and standing positions. Heart rate (HR), low frequency (LF 0.04–0.15 Hz), high frequency (HF > 0.15 Hz), and coefficient of variation of the R-R interval (CVRR) were determined.

Results

LF and HF in the supine position were significantly lower in the patients with NMS (p < 0.05). HR was higher in all positions in patients with NMS than in healthy individuals (p < 0.05). CVRR in the supine position was lower in the patients with NMS (p < 0.001), and it was significantly lower in patients who were positive in an orthostatic test (p = 0.0017). Area under the curve was calculated to be 0.824, and at the cutoff value of 4.997 of CVRR in supine, the sensitivity and the specificity were 78.9% and 85.0%.

Conclusion

The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems were both suppressed in patients with NMS. In post-syncope, parasympathetic withdrawal, rather than sympathetic reactivation, was responsible for the increased HR after syncope. CVRR may serve as a new clinical biomarker in the emergency department.

### Syncope: what is the trigger? [^389bf03e]. Heart (2003). Low credibility.

Although a syncopal attack is frequently preceded by prodromal symptoms, sometimes the onset can be so abrupt that there is no warning at all. The switch in autonomic responses responsible for such an attack is quite rapid and dramatic, but the trigger for this remains one of the unresolved mysteries in cardiovascular physiology.

### Vagally mediated atrioventricular block: pathophysiology and diagnosis [^4eb6e687]. Heart (2013). Low credibility.

Vagally mediated atrioventricular (AV) block is defined as a paroxysmal AV block, localised within the AV node, associated with slowing of the sinus rate. All types of second-degree AV block, including pseudo-Mobitz II block, and complete AV block, may be present. Most of the patients have normal AV conduction. Differential diagnosis with intrinsic AV block is based on the behaviour of the sinus rate. Vagally mediated AV block is benign; it can be recorded as an asymptomatic or symptomatic event (syncope/presyncope). Syncope due to this form of AV block should be diagnosed and managed as neurally mediated syncope. When this block is fortuitously recorded in asymptomatic patients, pacemaker implantation is not indicated.

### Randomized clinical trials of neurally mediated syncope [^a8eb6c85]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2003). Low credibility.

Evidence for therapy of neurally mediated syncope is generally weak. Many drugs have been used for the treatment of vasovagal syncope (beta-blockers, disopyramide, scopolamine, clonidine, theophylline, fludrocortisone, ephedrine, dihydroergotamine, etilefrine, midodrine, clonidine, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, enalapril). In general, although the results have been satisfactory in uncontrolled trials or short-term controlled trials, the majority of long-term placebo-controlled prospective trials have not been able to show a benefit of the active drug over placebo. Only two well-designed double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials have been performed-one for etilefrine and the other for atenolol-and both were unable to show a superiority of the active drug versus placebo. Four randomized clinical trials of pacing therapy-three positive and one negative-have been performed in patients affected by vasovagal syncope. The relationship between carotid sinus hypersensitivity and spontaneous, otherwise unexplained, syncope has been demonstrated. Cardiac pacing appears to be beneficial in carotid sinus syndrome; its efficacy has been demonstrated by two randomized controlled trials and confirmed by several pre-post comparative studies, one controlled trial, and one prospective observational study. There is evidence and general agreement that cardiac pacing is useful in patients with cardioinhibitory or mixed carotid sinus syndrome. Usefulness of the treatment is less well established and divergence of opinion exists with regard to cardiac pacing in patients with cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope. The evidence fails to support the efficacy of beta-blocking drugs. As yet there are insufficient data to support the use of any other pharmacologic therapy for vasovagal syncope.

### An increased endothelial-independent vasodilation is the hallmark of the neurally mediated syncope [^025b4eee]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The neurally mediated syncope (NMS) is sustained by complex cardiac and vascular reflexes, acting on and amplified by central autonomic loops, resulting in bradycardia and hypotension.

Hypothesis

Our aim was to assess whether the pathophysiology of NMS is also related to an abnormal peripheral vasoreactivity.

Methods

We evaluated by ultrasound the flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) and the nitrate-mediated dilation (NMD) in 17 patients with NMS, induced by drug-free tilt test in 6 subjects and by nitrate-potentiated tilt test in the other 11 cases; the syncope was classified as vasodepressive (VD) in 8 cases, cardioinhibitory (CI) in 7, and mixed in 2.

Results

The FMD was not different from controls (10.2 ± 4.5 vs 11.4 ± 3.9, P = ns), with normal recovery times; the NMD was greater in fainting subjects than in controls (26.7 ± 7.3 vs 19.0 ± 3.6, P < 0.05), with higher values in VD than in CI syncope (31.1 ± 7.0 vs 23.1 ± 5.0, P = ns); compared to controls, subjects with NMS showed normal recovery times after FMD but longer recovery times after nitrate administration (13.0 ± 5.6 vs 6.3 ± 0.7 minutes, P < 0.05).

Conclusions

The evaluation of endothelial function supports evidence that NMS is characterized by a marked and sustained endothelial-independent vasodilation, in the presence of a normal FMD; vascular hyperreactivity in response to nitrate administration is particularly overt in vasodepressive syncope and can explain the high rate of responses to nitrate administration during tilt test.

### Autonomic function testing: an important diagnostic test for patients with syncope [^109b15bd]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common problem with a large differential diagnosis. The initial history and physical examination often provide initial clues; however, some cases warrant further testing to determine the underlying cause. Autonomic function testing is a safe way to evaluate patients with syncope further, and to assess their parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. Autonomic testing can help to diagnose several conditions, including orthostatic hypotension, delayed orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome and neutrally mediated syncope. Thus, when the cause of syncope is unclear, autonomic testing can help to assess the autonomic nervous system, stratify the risk of future episodes and to guide treatment decisions.

### Neurohormones in vasovagal syncope: are they important? [^0260077d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The quests to discover the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to VVS and identify biomarkers capable of predicting syncope continue. Torabi et al have opened our eyes to the potential complexities and dynamic relationships between several neurohormones and VVS. While the roles of epinephrine and vasopressin as possible triggers of VVS are apparent, the mechanisms by which other neuropeptides such as adrenomedullin and endothelin‐1 influence orthostasis remain unclear. Studies to date, including the one by Torabi et al, have focused on correlating hemodynamics with measurements of neurohormones in blood. Most, if not all, of the neurohormones under consideration (eg, epinephrine, vasopressin, and endothelin) exert multiple actions on multiple target tissues, often binding to receptor subtypes with opposing effects on heart, vasculature, and nervous system. Future studies investigating effects of selective neurohormone receptor antagonists on orthostasis are encouraged.

### Regional implementation of a pediatric cardiology syncope algorithm using standardized clinical assessment and management plans (SCAMPS) methodology [^617fb673]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Using SCAMP methodology, we have demonstrated that typical neurally mediated syncope represents the vast majority of children referred to pediatric cardiologists for syncope. Cardiac etiology is rare, and in this study one patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was identified using the suggested evaluation plan. Syncope can be evaluated in the ambulatory setting pragmatically and effectively using minimal resources and in the vast majority in a single initial visit.

This experience confirms and solidifies many of the traditional historical details that define typical neurally mediated syncope. Subjective and physician‐assigned Syncope Severity Scores appear to provide a rapid way to stratify patients likely to require additional care. The relatively high frequency of potentially concerning family history, mild abnormalities on ECG, and incidental findings on echocardiography and ambulatory monitoring serve as a cautionary note regarding the need to place both the decision to obtain a test, and its interpretation in context.

Finally, our findings demonstrate that orthostatic vital signs add little if anything to the initial evaluation. Those should be reserved for more symptomatic patients in whom a streamlined workflow with a single baseline blood pressure followed by use of supine and 3‐minute standing HR measurements is appropriate. Using that technique, a standing HR < 120 bpm and a change from supine to standing of < 40 bpm is within the 93rd percentile, and < 115 bpm and HR change of < 35 bpm is within the 90th percentile. Those ranges provide data‐driven and easy‐to‐remember thresholds for those in whom orthostatic intolerance is the more likely contributor to daily symptoms.

Evolving and explicit clinical pathways such as SCAMPS can be implemented regionally across a wide range of clinical practice settings, and this approach can overcome a number of barriers often limiting traditional clinical guideline implementation and prospective randomized controlled trials. They represent a way to relatively rapidly gain and disseminate experience among providers and centers.

Reflex and other etiologies of syncope — definitions and key features — are outlined as: Reflex (neurally mediated) syncope is "syncope due to a reflex that causes vasodilation, bradycardia, or both"; vasovagal syncope (VVS) is "the most common form of reflex syncope" and "may occur with upright posture… or with exposure to emotional stress, pain, or medical settings", is "characterized by diaphoresis, warmth, nausea, and pallor", is "associated with vasodepressor hypotension and/or inappropriate bradycardia", and is "often followed by fatigue", with diagnosis primarily by history, exam, and eyewitness observation; carotid sinus syndrome is "reflex syncope associated with carotid sinus hypersensitivity", with hypersensitivity present when "a pause ≥ 3 s and/or a decrease of systolic pressure ≥ 50 mm Hg occurs upon stimulation of the carotid sinus"; situational syncope is "reflex syncope associated with a specific action, such as coughing, laughing, swallowing, micturition, or defecation"; cardiac (cardiovascular) syncope is "caused by bradycardia, tachycardia, or hypotension due to low cardiac index, blood flow obstruction, vasodilation, or acute vascular dissection"; noncardiac syncope is "due to noncardiac causes, which include reflex syncope, OH, volume depletion, dehydration, and blood loss".

Pediatric syncope — epidemiology and distinguishing entities: By 18 years of age, it is estimated that 30% to 50% of children experience at least 1 fainting episode, and syncope accounts for 3% of all pediatric ED visits; the incidence is higher in females and peaks between 15 to 19 years of age. Neurally mediated syncope accounts for 75% of pediatric syncope, followed by psychogenic or unexplained syncope in 8% to 15% of cases. Breath‑holding spells are unique to pediatrics: cyanotic breath‑holding spells typically occur from age 6 months to age 5 years, whereas pallid breath‑holding spells are seen in the first 1 to 2 years of age, may be an early form of VVS, and the latter episodes are associated with significant bradycardia and prolonged asystole. Pediatric cardiac syncope may result from obstruction to blood flow, myocardial dysfunction, congenital coronary anomaly, post–Kawasaki disease, or primary arrhythmic etiologies including LQTS, CPVT, Brugada syndrome, ARVC, or Wolff‑Parkinson‑White syndrome; a detailed history and physical examination can guide practitioners in differentiating life‑threatening from more benign neurally mediated syncope, and a detailed family history focused on premature SCD in first‑ and second‑degree relatives is helpful. Interventions recommended for adults with similar conditions presenting with syncope can be applied in children.

### Overview of the contribution of recent clinical trials to advancement of syncope management [^cea14d65]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

In this communication we review those trials that have contributed in recent years to improving our knowledge on the management (diagnosis and treatment) of syncope. In this regard, most recent trials focus on vasovagal syncope (VVS) and consequently these will be the focus of this manuscript. In essence, from a diagnostic perspective the ISSUE studies demonstrate the value of insertable loop recorders (ILR), while in terms of treatment, in the case of VVS current data strongly support use of non-pharmacologic treatment as a primary approach. There is no clear evidence supporting pharmacologic treatment with the possible exception of midodrine. Further, the most recent ISSUE trials suggest that in older very symptomatic patients with VVS in whom an asystole has been documented during spontaneous episode or possibly after ATP administration, implantation of a permanent pacemaker (PPM) can be effective. Which pacing or programming mode will be the more beneficial has not been completely clarified. Management of other forms of neurally-mediated syncope (e.g., carotid sinus syndrome) or other causes of syncope has not been addressed by clinical trials. In those cases, direction is provided by older evidence, the vast majority of which is based on observational reports or small non-randomized patient series.

### Mechanism of syncope: role of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and cardiovascular autonomic function assessment [^7e5743a9]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Different types of transient loss of consciousness events are defined based on their pathophysiological features. The qualifying criterion for syncope is cerebral hypoperfusion that differentiates syncope from non-syncopal forms such as epileptic seizure or psychogenic pseudo syncope. In patients with a diagnosis of syncope, once a cardiac cause (such as primary intrinsic cardiac arrhythmias or structural flow obstruction) can be ruled out, autonomic neural mechanisms are involved in the genesis of non-cardiac forms. Autonomic (non-cardiac) syncope encompasses both reflex (neurally mediated) syncope and syncope due to orthostatic hypotension as described in the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines. Identifying the haemodynamic mechanism of autonomic syncope is the essential pre-requisite for a personalized treatment approach aiming at effectively preventing recurrences. The possible haemodynamic mechanisms underlying autonomic syncope include primary hypotension and asystole/bradycardia of extrinsic cause, corresponding to two different haemodynamic phenotypes, i.e. the hypotensive and bradycardic phenotypes. The choice of therapy — aiming at counteracting hypotension or bradycardia — depends on the detected syncope phenotype identified during the diagnostic work-up.

Autonomic syncope is a common event in the general population and a frequent reason for seeking medical attention, with a consequent impact on high healthcare costs. Moreover, in a significant proportion of patients, syncope might be disabling due to recurrent episodes and/or severe injuries, which may determine activity restriction and poor quality of life. In clinical practice, the diagnostic approach to syncope is very heterogeneous, with highly variable adherence to international guideline recommendations. The absence of a systematic approach incurs higher health and social care costs, unnecessary hospitalizations, and diagnostic procedures, while achieving low diagnostic rates and high rates of symptom recurrence. One of the barriers to widespread adherence to guideline protocols is the availability of many diagnostic tests, some of which are time-consuming, expensive, and not fully covered by public healthcare plans.

The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic efficacy of a two-step assessment that consisted of 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and tilt-table short cardiovascular autonomic function assessment (SCAFA), a set of tests performed in a tilt test laboratory under beat-to-beat haemodynamic monitoring. The study hypothesis was that these two investigations, performed in sequence after the initial evaluation, offer a brief, easy-to-perform, and low-cost diagnostic work-up allowing for the identification of the haemodynamic mechanism of loss of consciousness in most of the patients with autonomic syncope.

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) overview — pathophysiology, clinical features, and treatment context are summarized as follows: VVS is the most common cause of syncope and a frequent reason for emergency department (ED) visits; it results from a reflex causing hypotension and bradycardia, is typically associated with a prodrome, and is generally benign with frequent remissions. Medical treatment is usually not required unless conservative measures are unsatisfactory, although effective treatment may be needed because events may cause injury and impaired quality of life; evidence-based therapeutic options are limited, and preliminary data for cardiac ganglia plexi ablation are encouraging but insufficient for recommendations, with an algorithm referenced for treatment of VVS.

### Low iron storage in children and adolescents with neurally mediated syncope [^9a191f52]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether neurally mediated syncope (NMS) is associated with low iron storage or serum ferritin (SF).

Study Design

206 children evaluated between 2000 and 2004 for probable syncope at a tertiary care Pediatric Neurology Clinic were included in a retrospective study. Serum ferritin (SF), iron, total iron binding capacity, and hemoglobin were measured prospectively after initial history taking and physical examination, along with other diagnostic testing. We defined iron deficiency (ID) as SF < 12 microg/L, and low iron storage as SF ≤ 25 microg/L.

Results

Among 106 included patients with syncope, 71 had NMS and 35 had other causes of syncope. Patients with NMS, when compared with those with other causes of syncope, had a higher prevalence of low iron storage (57% vs 17%, P < .001) and lower mean values of SF (27 vs 46 microg/L, P < .001), transferrin saturation (23 vs 31%, P < .01), and hemoglobin (13.3 vs 14 g/dL, P < .05). Only patients with NMS had ID (15%), anemia (11%), or ID with anemia (7%).

Conclusions

Low iron storage or serum ferritin is associated with NMS and is a potentially pathophysiologic factor in NMS.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Syncope — the trainee must acquire the medical knowledge and clinical skills to diagnose and manage patients with syncope, including knowledge of the differential diagnosis, approach to diagnosis and treatment, and risk stratification. Training will include understanding the classifications of syncope, including vasovagal or neurally-mediated syncope, and syncope due to a cardiac arrhythmia such as bradyarrhythmias (sinus bradycardia, AV block) and tachyarrhythmias (SVT and VT), with appreciation of whether the patient is at risk for sudden cardiac death in the setting of structural heart disease or an inherited arrhythmia syndrome. The trainee will learn evaluation with a thorough history, physical examination, and ECG interpretation, and will know the indications for other diagnostic modalities such as short- and long-term ECG monitoring (including ILRs), tilt table testing, and invasive electrophysiological testing. The trainee must learn to manage neurally-mediated syncope with lifestyle measures, pharmacological therapies, nonpharmacological interventions such as lower-body compression garments, and appropriate indications for permanent pacing, and to manage syncope due to cardiac arrhythmias with permanent pacing for bradyarrhythmias and pharmacological therapy or ablation for specific tachyarrhythmias. The trainee must understand unusual causes including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, dysautonomias, and orthostatic hypotension, and must identify patients at risk for sudden cardiac death for which an ICD or other therapies may be indicated.

### Formal analysis of the optimal duration of tilt testing for the diagnosis of neurally mediated syncope [^3b42c111]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Although tilt testing has emerged as the test of choice for assessing patients with suspected neurally mediated syncope, the optimum duration of tilt testing is poorly defined. This in part relates to the absence of a gold standard to assess test performance.

Objective

Our purpose was to formally estimate the effects of varying duration of drug-free tilt testing on test performance in diagnosing neurally mediated syncope.

Design

If a test's specificity is known, then in the absence of a gold standard an imputed (estimated) sensitivity may be calculated on the basis of the observed diagnostic yield in a given population as a function of assumed population prevalence. We determined the relationship of specificity to drug-free tilt test duration by use of data from 11 previous studies reporting the results of drug-free tilt testing in a total of 435 control subjects (60 to 80 degrees of tilt, footboard support, 15- to 60-minute duration). Data (weighted for study size) were fit to an exponential function relating specificity to tilt duration. Test yield was evaluated as a function of tilt duration in 213 consecutive patients referred to our laboratory for the evaluation of suspected neurally mediated syncope who underwent passive tilt testing for up to 30 to 60 minutes.

Results

The estimated specificity of tilt testing was 94% at 30 minutes, 92% at 40 minutes, and 88% after 60 minutes of passive tilt. The cumulative yield of tilt testing was only 17% at 30 minutes, 22% at 40 minutes, and 28% after 60 minutes. On the basis of an estimated population prevalence of 25% to 50% in this referral population, imputed sensitivity is 27% to 48% at 30 minutes, 36% to 64% at 40 minutes, and 43% to 74% after 60 minutes of passive tilt. The overall diagnostic accuracy was not strongly influenced by tilt duration beyond 30 minutes and ranged from 60% to 84%.

Conclusions

Passive tilt testing (ie, tilt testing without pharmacologic provocation) for durations of up to 60 minutes has limited sensitivity for diagnosing neurally mediated syncope. For populations with a pretest likelihood of 25% to 50%, test results are inaccurate in one to two fifths of patients.

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2008), PubMed (1950 until February 2008), EMBASE on OVID (1980 until February 2008) and CINAHL on EBSCOhost (1937 until February 2008). No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel randomized controlled trials and randomized cross-over trials of pharmacological treatment (beta-blockers, fludrocortisone, alpha-adrenergic agonists, selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, disopyramide, anticholinergic agents or salt tablets) or dual chamber pacemaker treatment. Studies were included if pharmacological or pacemaker treatment was compared with any form of standardised control treatment (standard treatment), placebo treatment, or (other) pharmacological or pacemaker treatment. We did not include non-randomized studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias. Using a standardised data extraction form, they extracted characteristics and results of the various studies. In a consensus meeting they discussed any disagreements that had occurred during data extraction. If no agreement could be reached, a third reviewer was asked to make a decision. Summary estimates with 95% confidence intervals of treatment effect were calculated using relative risks, rate ratios or weighted means differences depending on the type of outcome reported.

Main Results

We included 46 randomized studies, 40 on vasovagal syncope and six on carotid sinus syncope. No studies on situational syncope matched the criteria for inclusion in our review. Studies in general were small with a median sample size of 42. A wide range of control treatments were used with 22 studies using a placebo arm. Blinding of patients and treating physicians was applied in eight studies. Results varied considerably between studies and between types of outcomes. For vasovagal syncope, the occurrence of syncope upon provocational head-up tilt testing was lower upon treatment with beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors and anticholinergic agents compared to standard treatment. For carotid sinus syncope, the occurrence of syncope upon carotid sinus massage was lower on midodrine treatment compared to placebo treatment in one study.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any of the pharmacological or pacemaker treatments for vasovagal syncope and carotid sinus syncope. Larger studies using patient relevant outcomes are needed.

Syncope needs careful attribution because "Syncope can be neurally mediated or medication-related as well as due to VA and requires a careful evaluation before considering it a risk factor for SCD", and time since the episode matters: "syncope that was unexplained or thought not to be neurally mediated was associated with SCD risk only when it occurred within the past 6 months but not if the most episode occurred > 5 years previously".

### Diagnostic value of history in patients with syncope with or without heart disease [^3cf90922]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to establish what historical findings are predictive of the cause of syncope.

Background

The clinical features of the various types of syncope have not been systematically investigated.

Methods

Three hundred forty-one patients with syncope were prospectively evaluated. Each patient was interviewed using a standard questionnaire. A cause of syncope was assigned using standardized diagnostic criteria.

Results

A cardiac cause of syncope was established in 23% of the patients, a neurally mediated cause in 58% and a neurologic or psychiatric cause in 1%, and in the remaining 18%, the cause of syncope remained unexplained. In a preliminary analysis including age, gender and the presence of suspected or certain heart disease after the initial evaluation, only heart disease was an independent predictor of a cardiac cause of syncope (odds ratio 16, p = 0.00001), with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 45%. In contrast, the absence of heart disease allowed us to exclude a cardiac cause of syncope in 97% of the patients. In patients with certain or suspected heart disease, the most specific predictors of a cardiac cause were syncope in the supine position or during effort, blurred vision and convulsive syncope. Significant and specific predictors of a neurally mediated cause were time between the first and last syncopal episode > 4 years, abdominal discomfort before the loss of consciousness and nausea and diaphoresis during the recovery phase. In the patients without heart disease, palpitation was the only significant predictor of a cardiac cause.

Conclusions

The presence of suspected or certain heart disease after the initial evaluation is a strong predictor of a cardiac cause of syncope. A few historical findings are useful to predict cardiac and neurally mediated syncope in patients with and without heart disease.

### Enhanced vascular responses to hypocapnia in neurally mediated syncope [^e6005d73]. Annals of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The susceptibility to suffer neurally mediated syncope and loss of consciousness varies markedly. In addition to vasodilatation and bradycardia, hyperventilation precedes loss of consciousness. The resultant hypocapnia causes cerebral vasoconstriction and peripheral vasodilatation. We postulate that more pronounced cerebral and peripheral vascular responses to reductions in arterial CO(2) levels underlie greater susceptibility to neurally mediated syncope.

Methods

We compared vascular responses to CO(2) among 31 patients with histories of recurrent neurally mediated syncope and low orthostatic tolerance and 14 age- and sex-matched control subjects with no history of syncope and normal orthostatic tolerance. Vascular responses to CO(2) were calculated after all subjects had fully recovered and their blood pressures and heart rates were stable. We measured blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (transcranial Doppler) and in the left brachial artery (brachial Doppler), and end-tidal CO(2) during voluntary hyperventilation and hypoventilation (end-tidal CO(2) from 21-45mm Hg), and determined the slopes of the relations.

Results

Hypocapnia produced a significantly greater reduction in cerebral blood flow velocity and in forearm vascular resistance in patients with neurally mediated syncope than in control subjects. Opposite changes occurred in response to hypercapnia. In all subjects, the changes in cerebral blood flow velocity and forearm vasodilatation were inversely related with orthostatic tolerance.

Interpretation

Susceptibility to neurally mediated syncope can be explained, at least in part, by enhanced cerebral vasoconstriction and peripheral vasodilatation in response to hypocapnia. This may have therapeutic implications.

Pediatric syncope recommendations include that VVS evaluation, including a detailed medical history, physical examination, family history, and a 12-lead ECG, should be performed in all pediatric patients presenting with syncope; noninvasive diagnostic testing should be performed in pediatric patients presenting with syncope and suspected congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, or primary rhythm disorder; education on symptom awareness of prodromes and reassurance are indicated in pediatric patients with VVS; tilt-table testing can be useful for pediatric patients with suspected VVS when the diagnosis is unclear; in pediatric patients with VVS not responding to lifestyle measures, it is reasonable to prescribe midodrine; encouraging increased salt and fluid intake may be reasonable in selected pediatric patients with VVS; the effectiveness of fludrocortisone is uncertain in pediatric patients with OH associated with syncope; cardiac pacing may be considered in pediatric patients with severe neurally mediated syncope — secondary to pallid breath-holding spells; and beta blockers are not beneficial in pediatric patients with VVS.

In reflex syncope, Group 2 states "No restriction unless it occurred during high risk activity", and for "Recurrent and severe" cases "Permanent restriction unless effective treatment has been established". For "Unexplained syncope", Group 1 notes "No restrictions unless absence of prodrome, occurrence during driving, or presence of severe structural heart disease", while Group 2 allows driving "After diagnosis and appropriate therapy is established".

### Carotid artery stiffness in patients with neurally mediated syncope [^e908a5e9]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Neurally mediated syncope is defined as a transient loss of blood flow to the brain, resulting in vasodilatation, bradycardia, or both. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of neurally mediated syncope are not clear. In this study, we investigated carotid artery elasticity parameters in patients with neurally mediated syncope.

Methods

The study was conducted on 41 patients who were examined by the tilt table test. Group 1 constituted of 21 patients who had a positive response to the tilt table test. Clinical and hemodynamic parameters were compared with patients in a negative tilt table test group (group 2). The systolic and diastolic diameters of the carotid arteries, carotid distensibility, carotid strain, carotid stiffness index, and carotid elastic modulus of the left carotid arteries were calculated by a high-resolution ultrasound device.

Results

No differences in hemodynamic variables or clinical parameters were detected between the groups. Carotid distensibility (mean ± SD, 1.6 ± 0.6 versus 2.2 ± 0.8 cm(2) × dyne(-1) × 10(-6); P = 0.044) and strain (6.8% ± 1.7% versus 8.2% ± 1.9%; P = 0.026) were lower in group 1 than in group 2. The carotid elastic modulus (0.88 ± 0.33 versus 0.74 ± 0.25 cm(2) × dyne(-1) × 10(-6); P = 0.002) and stiffness index (6.7 ± 0.4 versus 6.2 ± 0.5; P = 0.038) were higher in group 1.

Conclusions

In this study, we concluded that elastic properties of the carotid artery are impaired in patients with neurally mediated syncope. This finding suggests that impaired carotid arterial elasticity may be a factor in the pathophysiologic mechanisms of neurally mediated syncope.

### Therapeutic options for neurocardiogenic syncope: a meta-analysis of randomised trials with and without blinding [^85d5dbc9]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neurocardiogenic syncope is common with a lifetime incidence of > 35% with one-third of these individuals suffering significant psychological and physical injury.

Syncope typically results from a vasodepressor response (hypotension), a cardioinhibitory response (bradycardia) or a combination of both mechanisms. Despite the great variety of proposed therapies, including medications, cardiac pacemaker devices and physical training programmes, it is not clear which therapies are effective beyond placebo.

Syncope could be considered an objective endpoint because loss of consciousness can be thought of as binary, and it might be argued that blinding therefore is unnecessary. Furthermore, blinding and placebo control introduce additional cost and complexity in trial. However, it has been repeatedly found within cardiology that even with endpoints thought to be objective, for example, blood pressure, blinding is essential for reliable results. The merits and need for blinded, placebo-controlled trials have not been tested when evaluating syncope management approaches.

We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of therapies to prevent recurrent syncope. We specifically test whether blinding makes an important difference.

### Hemodynamic significance of heart rate in neurally mediated syncope [^b0c3c851]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Vasovagal and vasodepressor syncope are used interchangeably in the literature to describe the common faint syndrome, now collectively named neurally mediated syncope. The significance of heart rate (HR) in these reflex-induced reactions remains unclear.

Hypothesis

The study was undertaken to investigate the hemodynamic significance of HR in tilt-induced neurally mediated syncope.

Methods

In all, 113 patients with syncope of unknown etiology were studied by head-up tilt test with invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Thirty-five patients (15 women, 20 men, age range 21 to 72 years) developed syncope and were enrolled for analysis. The hemodynamic data were compared between patients who developed bradycardia (vasovagal group, n = 15) and those without bradycardia (vasodepressor group, n = 20).

Results

The baseline hemodynamic data (mean ± standard deviation) and the hemodynamic responses after 10-min headup tilt were similar between patients in the vasovagal and vasodepressor groups. During syncope, patients with vasovagal reaction developed hypotension and paradoxical bradycardia (HR = 52.4 ± 5.9 beats/min), while patients with vasodepressor reaction developed a precipitous drop in arterial blood pressure with inappropriate HR (105 ± 21 beats/min) compensation. Patients with vasovagal syncope manifested a significantly lower cardiac index and a significantly higher systemic vascular resistance index than patients with vasodepressor syncope (1.47 ± 0.29 vs. 1.97 ± 0.41 1/min/m2, p < 0.001 and 2098 ± 615 vs. 1573 ± 353 dynes x s x cm(-5) x m2, p < 0.003, respectively). A positive correlation existed between HR and cardiac index (r = 0.44, p = 0.008) during syncope in the patients studied.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that the hemodynamic characteristics of vasovagal and vasodepressor reactions are different, and that HR plays a significant role in neurally mediated syncope.

### Risk stratification… [^9c66a926]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Syncope is a sudden, brief, and transient loss of consciousness caused by cerebral hypoperfusion. 1 Other nontraumatic loss of consciousness syndromes include seizures, cataplexy, metabolic disorders, acute intoxications, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, and psychogenic pseudosyncope. 2, 3. 8, 9 Historically, neurally mediated and orthostatic hypotension syncope have not conferred an increased risk of death 10; however, in a recent study, healthy adults with a diagnosis of syncope had higher rates of all-cause mortality, recurrent syncope, cardiovascular events, and pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement compared with matched controls. Patients 44 to 75 years of age had the highest risk. 11, 12. Treatment The treatment of syncope is directed at the underlying cause. Morbidity and mortality are generally low except in cardiac syncope; therefore, patient reassurance is an important part of treatment.

NEURALLY MEDIATED SYNCOPE Treatment of neurally mediated syncope includes reassurance, education, and physical therapy. 1 In situational syncope, it is important to avoid potential triggers. Physical counterpressure maneuvers such as leg crossing, squatting, and tensing the lower extremities are effective at the onset of prodromal symptoms. 7 One randomized trial showed that these maneuvers reduce syncope by 39%. 52 Tilt training involves standing for prolonged periods, and compliance is generally poor.
7. 1 In one small randomized trial of patients with a history of recurrent vasovagal syncope, paroxetine prevented additional episodes in
82. 4% compared with 47. 1% in the placebo group over two years, although guidelines recommend its use only in patients with concurrent psychiatric disease.

53 In patients with severe asystole from neurally mediated syncope, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial showed that the use of permanent dual chamber pacing reduced the risk of recurrent syncope.
54. CARDIAC SYNCOPE Management of cardiac syncope is directed at the underlying etiology. Options include antiarrhythmic drugs, cardiac pacing, catheter-directed ablation, and, rarely, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement. 1 This article updates previous articles on this topic by Gauer.

### A profound case of neurally mediated syncope with asystole after septoplasty [^200ee6ed]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) is an alarming yet benign condition that may present postoperatively for the first time in otherwise healthy patients. Although VVS is associated anecdotally with nasal manipulation, no data have been found to quantify this incidence with otolaryngology surgeries. We present a case of profound, recurrent syncope and documented asystole with an initial diagnosis of glossopharyngeal neuralgia. We conclude with a discussion of neurally mediated syncope particular to the perioperative setting. It is essential to recognize neurocardiogenic etiology to differentiate it from other more concerning causes of syncope and asystole.

### Pacemaker therapy in patients with neurally mediated syncope and documented asystole: third international study on syncope of uncertain etiology (ISSUE-3): a randomized trial [^28268378]. Circulation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of cardiac pacing for prevention of syncopal recurrences in patients with neurally mediated syncope is controversial. We wanted to determine whether pacing therapy reduces syncopal recurrences in patients with severe asystolic neurally mediated syncope.

Methods and Results

Double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study conducted in 29 centers in the Third International Study on Syncope of Uncertain Etiology (ISSUE-3) trial. Patients were ≥ 40 years, had experienced ≥ 3 syncopal episodes in the previous 2 years. Initially, 511 patients, received an implantable loop recorder; 89 of these had documentation of syncope with ≥ 3 s asystole or ≥ 6 s asystole without syncope within 12 ± 10 months and met criteria for pacemaker implantation; 77 of 89 patients were randomly assigned to dual-chamber pacing with rate drop response or to sensing only. The data were analyzed on intention-to-treat principle. There was syncope recurrence during follow-up in 27 patients, 19 of whom had been assigned to pacemaker OFF and 8 to pacemaker ON. The 2-year estimated syncope recurrence rate was 57% (95% CI, 40–74) with pacemaker OFF and 25% (95% CI, 13–45) with pacemaker ON (log rank: P = 0.039 at the threshold of statistical significance of 0.04). The risk of recurrence was reduced by 57% (95% CI, 4–81). Five patients had procedural complications: lead dislodgment in 4 requiring correction and subclavian vein thrombosis in 1 patient.

Conclusions

Dual-chamber permanent pacing is effective in reducing recurrence of syncope in patients ≥ 40 years with severe asystolic neurally mediated syncope. The observed 32% absolute and 57% relative reduction in syncope recurrence support this invasive treatment for the relatively benign neurally mediated syncope.

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

2018 ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline — ECG role and yield in syncope notes that unless a patient with suspected bradycardia or conduction disorder is symptomatic or bradycardic at the time of the recording, the 12-lead ECG will not provide a rhythm correlation with symptoms; in patients presenting with syncope, the initial ECG provides a diagnosis in only approximately 5%, but an abnormal initial ECG is predictive of adverse outcomes in patients with syncope and near syncope, including increased all-cause mortality at 1 year and inclusion of abnormal ECG in most multivariate risk scores; risk does not necessarily indicate bradycardia as cause, as only approximately 10% of syncope can be attributed to bradycardia or a conduction disorder at initial presentation, and an additional 18% can be attributed to neurally mediated syncope which frequently manifests with both bradycardia and hypotension; ECG also helps confirm rhythm and rate, define conduction disturbance, and document abnormalities suggestive of structural or systemic disease.

### Diagnosis, management, and outcomes of patients with syncope and bundle branch block [^571bc24e]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main finding in this study is that in patients with syncope, BBB, and preserved LVEF, the application of a systematic diagnostic strategy in accordance with ESC guidelines achieves a high rate of diagnosis (82.6%) with a low rate of mortality (6%), allowing clinicians to institute aetiology-specific treatment.

As expected, the most common cause of syncope in these patients was bradyarrhythmia, mostly due to paroxysmal A-V block. However, following this diagnostic strategy, other aetiologies of syncope were recognized in 17.6% of this population, such as CSS, neurally mediated, or drug-related syncope, or syncope secondary to VT, SVT, or cardiopulmonary disease. In addition, an arrhythmic cause could be ruled out in several patients who had a syncopal event documented by ILR.

### Novel SCN5A mutation (Q55X) associated with age-dependent expression of Brugada syndrome presenting as neurally mediated syncope [^efd2a6f3]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

Background

An association between Brugada syndrome and neurally mediated syncope has been described. Although mutations in SCN5A have been identified in Brugada syndrome, the genetic link between Brugada syndrome and neurally mediated syncope has not been determined.

Objectives

The purpose of the study was to clinically and genetically characterize a man with recurrent syncope that originally was diagnosed as neurally mediated syncope at age 8 years but subsequently manifested as Brugada syndrome at age 17 years.

Methods

The proband underwent clinical examination, which included head-up tilt test, sodium channel provocation test, and electrophysiologic study. Genetic screening of SCN5A was performed for the proband and his family members. The biophysical properties of a mutant SCN5A channel in a heterologous expression system were studied using whole-cell, patch clamp technique.

Results

The proband showed positive head-up tilt test, coved-type ST elevation recorded from the third intercostal space, and positive pilsicainide provocation test. Ventricular fibrillation was inducible at programmed electrical stimulation, consistent with characteristics of both Brugada syndrome and neurally mediated syncope. A novel nonsense SCN5A mutation (Q55X) was identified in the proband, his mother, and his asymptomatic brother. The heterologously expressed mutant channel was nonfunctional.

Conclusion

We genetically determined an SCN5A mutation in a patient showing the combined phenotype of neurally mediated syncope and Brugada syndrome. Neurally mediated syncope and Brugada syndrome may share, at least in part, a common pathophysiologic mechanism.

### Benefit of pacemaker therapy in patients with presumed neurally mediated syncope and documented asystole is greater when tilt test is negative: an analysis from the third international study on syncope of uncertain etiology (ISSUE-3) [^fbc09697]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In the Third International Study on Syncope of Uncertain Etiology (ISSUE-3), cardiac pacing was effective in reducing recurrence of syncope in patients with presumed neurally mediated syncope (NMS) and documented asystole but syncope still recurred in 25% of them at 2 years. We have investigated the role of tilt testing (TT) in predicting recurrences.

Methods and Results

In 136 patients enrolled in the ISSUE-3, TT was positive in 76 and negative in 60. An asystolic response predicted a similar asystolic form during implantable loop recorder monitoring, with a positive predictive value of 86%. The corresponding values were 48% in patients with non-asystolic TT and 58% in patients with negative TT (P = 0.001 versus asystolic TT). Fifty-two patients (26 TT+ and 26 TT-) with asystolic neurally mediated syncope received a pacemaker. Syncope recurred in 8 TT+ and in 1 TT- patients. At 21 months, the estimated product-limit syncope recurrence rates were 55% and 5%, respectively (P = 0.004). The TT+ recurrence rate was similar to that seen in 45 untreated patients (control group), which was 64% (P = 0.75). The recurrence rate was similar between 14 patients with asystolic and 12 with non-asystolic responses during TT (P = 0.53).

Conclusions

Cardiac pacing was effective in neurally mediated syncope patients with documented asystolic episodes in whom TT was negative; conversely, there was insufficient evidence of efficacy from this data set in patients with a positive TT even when spontaneous asystole was documented. Present observations are unexpected and need to be confirmed by other studies. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT01463358.

### Lack of efficacy of atenolol for the prevention of neurally mediated syncope in a highly symptomatic population: a prospective, double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled study [^720e6b12]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of atenolol for the long-term management of patients with vasovagal syncope. The primary hypothesis was that atenolol is not superior to placebo for the treatment of vasovagal syncope.

Background

There is no definitive well-controlled analysis of the efficacy of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope.

Methods

This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Fifty patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope were included (at least two episodes in the last year). A baseline tilt test was performed. Twenty patients (40%) had a positive tilt test. Intravenous atenolol prevented a second positive tilt in five patients. The patients were randomized to receive either atenolol or a placebo (26 patients atenolol 50 mg/day, 24 patients placebo). The follow-up procedure lasted one year. The primary end point of the study was the time to first recurrence of syncope.

Results

In the intention-to-treat analysis, the group treated with atenolol had a similar number of patients with recurrent syncopal episodes as the placebo group. The Kaplan-Meier actuarial estimates of time to first syncopal recurrence showed that the probability of remaining free of syncope drops similarly in both groups and that there was no statistical difference between both curves (patients treated with atenolol vs. the placebo) with a log-rank test p value of 0.4517.

Conclusions

The recurrence of neurocardiogenic syncope in highly symptomatic patients treated with atenolol is similar to that of patients treated with placebo.

### Cerebral blood flow in orthostatic intolerance [^c6e6e9be]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

CBF in OI

in Syncope

CBF dysregulation can cause syncope, a transient loss of consciousness when there is significantly decreased blood flow to the brain.OH is a diagnosis that commonly experiences CBF dysregulation resulting in syncope. Possible causes of OH include dehydration, medications, or health conditions with secondary dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. As the autonomic nervous system regulates the subconscious process of vasoconstriction, autonomic dysfunction hampers the body's ability to vasoconstrict to prevent venous pooling in the lower extremities in the upright position, resulting in low BP and CBF drops.

A head‐up tilt table test is often used by electrophysiologists to test a patient's likelihood of syncope. The test induces orthostatic stress with passive upright posture during which vital signs such as BP and heart rate are monitored, ideally continuously, throughout the test. Since all types of syncope are essentially caused by a rapid drop in CBF, it is clinically relevant to measure CBv in syncope to reach an accurate diagnosis. Figure 2 shows the BP and CBv patterns of a 20‐year‐old woman with mixed syncope. The onset of syncope coincides with a drop in CBF, followed by a delayed decline in BP. Evidence suggests that CBF drops before the fall in BP in syncope contributing to a syncopal event. Cerebral autoregulation, however, does not appear to be affected in syncope during head‐up tilt. Some people with syncope have a paradoxical increase in cerebrovascular resistance that proceeds the drop in BP. There are surprisingly limited studies addressing CBF in syncope and CBF regulation may differ depending on the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorder. For instance, people with neurally mediated syncope or hypotension may develop an altered BP range for autoregulation and baroreflex buffering compared with otherwise healthy people with the occasional vasovagal episodes.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^3df6e279]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Treatment of syncope — general principles: The principal goals of treatment for patients with syncope are to prolong survival, limit physical injuries, and prevent recurrences. The importance and priority of these different goals are dependent on the cause of syncope; for example, in patients with VT causing syncope, the mortality risk is clearly predominant, while in patients with reflex syncope the prevention of recurrences and/or limitation of injuries. Knowledge of the cause of syncope has a key role in selection of treatment, and once the cause has been ascertained, the second goal is to assess the mechanism leading to syncope.

### Gait disorders are associated with non-cardiovascular falls in elderly people: a preliminary study [^2ddca3b6]. BMC Geriatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Why should gait assessment be considered a key component in the assessment of unexplained falls? Gait performance is a fascinating and complex task that depends on the normal functioning of multiple systems working in a highly coordinated and integrated manner. As impairments in different domains can alter this delicate system, it is interesting to hypothesize that different chronic conditions such as visual or hearing problems, muscular weakness, osteoarthritis or peripheral neuropathy could be evidenced through gait performance. Moreover, the use of benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and other drugs with central action may affect gait performance. Chronic cardiovascular diseases and systemic chronic hypertension have been also associated with continuous impairment in gait performance. However, falls secondary to neurally-mediated cardiovascular causes may be expressed by a different mechanism, without necessarily chronically affecting gait performance. Regulation of systemic blood pressure is important for postural control in elderly people since failure to perfuse the brain increases the risk of falls. Additionally, age-related decline in baroreflex sensitivity contributes to the vulnerability in changing posture or in the postprandial state. Although the exact mechanism by which a neurally mediated cardiovascular problem causes a fall remains unclear, there is growing clinical evidence for its association with unexplained falls.

Interestingly, participants in our study who were diagnosed with a cardiovascular cause of falls denied the clinical symptoms traditionally associated with a syncopal phenomenon. This observation agrees with the increasingly detected overlap between syncope and falls in the subgroup of unexplained elderly fallers. A possible explanation may be the incapacity to remember syncopal symptoms due to a retrograde amnesia of the episode.

Since a cardiovascular mediated cause of fall has been described in up to 20 percent of unexplained elderly fallers, and in view of the associated morbidity, mortality and the availability of treatment, careful consideration should be given when assessing patients with unexplained falls. As well, falls related to a neurally mediated cardiovascular event could be expressed acutely and intermittently without chronically affecting gait performance, providing a potential explanation for the absence of gait disorders in these participants. As gait performance can be assessed directly, thus avoiding reporting bias, this approach could be applied even in absence of a detailed description of the episode. Finally, the simplicity of the proposed gait assessment makes it easy to perform and accessible for general clinicians and other health professionals.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric vasovagal syncope (VVS) management — Tilt-table testing can be useful for pediatric patients with suspected VVS when the diagnosis is unclear (IIa, C-LD); in pediatric patients with VVS not responding to lifestyle measures, it is reasonable to prescribe midodrine (IIa, B-R); encouraging increased salt and fluid intake may be reasonable in selected pediatric patients with VVS (IIb, B-R); the effectiveness of fludrocortisone is uncertain in pediatric patients with OH associated with syncope (IIb, C-LD); cardiac pacing may be considered in pediatric patients with severe neurally mediated syncope secondary to pallid breath-holding spells (IIb, B-NR); and Beta blockers are not beneficial in pediatric patients with VVS (III: No Benefit, B-R).

### Classification, diagnosis, and treatment of syncope… [^a336cb6d]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Neurally-mediated syncopes are most commonly reflex in type and consist of a transient disturbance in the autonomic control of heart rate and blood pressure. They occur at any age, but most commonly in toddlers and in children between 9 and 14 years of age. Characteristically, the child is either sitting or standing, and suffers dizziness, nausea, and pallor, followed by loss of tone and consciousness. Hypotension and/or bradycardia result in cerebral hypoxia and, when severe, an anoxic seizure and incontinence. The reflex anoxic seizure resembles a pallid breath-holding attack in a toddler and consists of opisthotonus and twitching. Unlike an epileptiform discharge, the electroencephalographic record is flat during a reflex anoxic seizure. In psychogenic pseudosyncope, the ECG, EEG, and blood pressure are normal during continuous, ambulatory inpatient monitoring.

Management of neurally-mediated syncope consists of reassurance, plenty of fluids and added salt, and maintenance of blood pressure by crossing legs and folding the arms. Drug therapy is considered when simple measures fail. The cardiologist's classification of syncope differs from that of the neurologist, who usually reserves the term simple neurocardiogenic syncope for episodes of for episodes of fainting that occur in older children and are precipitated by pain, fear, excitement, and extended periods of standing, particularly in a warm environment. 1 Simple syncope results from vasovagal stimulation and is characterized by a prodrome of nausea, pallor, diaphoresis, and blurred vision. It is uncommon before 10–12 years of age, and is.

### Multidisciplinary approach for diagnosing syncope: a retrospective study on 521 outpatients [^0b203fed]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe causes of syncope in outpatients in whom structural heart disease was ruled out as a cause, and to analyse the role of a multidisciplinary approach in a syncope unit for the diagnosis of patients with syncope of unknown origin.

Methods

Cardiovascular autonomic nervous system (ANS) function was evaluated extensively in 521 outpatients by careful history, physical examination including orthostatic blood pressure measurement and standard ECG, and tilt testing.

Results

Causes of syncope remained unknown in 29.2% of cases. ANS dysfunction was found in 58.6% of those presenting with either neurally mediated syncope (53.6%) or chronic autonomic failure (5%); 3.8% of the patients suffered from syncope of cardiogenic origin (2.5%) or non-neurogenic hypotension (1.3%), and 8.4% had loss of consciousness of non-syncopal origin. Loss of consciousness was confirmed as being related to seizures in under 30% of patients initially diagnosed as having epilepsy.

Conclusions

Neurally mediated syncope represents the commonest type of syncope. ANS evaluation including tilt testing should be considered as preliminary screening in patients with syncope in the absence of definite heart abnormalities. Neurologists should consider syncope from ANS failure as a comorbid factor in patients with seizures where the clinical characteristics are not straightforward.

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^7d9b20a0]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Syncope classification during pregnancy — key table features and thresholds are as follows: Neurally mediated reflex syncope has a mechanism of reflex-mediated bradycardia (cardioinhibitory type), vasodilatation (vasodepressor), or both (mixed type), with a typical prodrome of diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, feeling warmth, and pallor; vasovagal syncope is most common and can be triggered by longtime standing, fear, pain, or sight of blood. Situational syncope occurs with specific triggers such as micturition, coughing, and defecation and is very rare in pregnancy with history of preexisting symptoms, while carotid sinus syndrome occurs with specific triggers, can be reproduced with carotid sinus massage, and is very rare in pregnancy. Syncope due to orthostatic hypotension is defined by a drop in systolic BP > 20 mmHg or diastolic BP > 10 mmHg with assuming upright position and is exacerbated by thermal stress or venous pooling during exercise or after meals; volume depletion may occur in pregnancy with hemorrhage or vomiting, and drug-induced etiologies include vasodilators or diuretics and are rare in pregnancy.

### Vagal sensory neurons mediate the bezold-jarisch reflex and induce syncope [^13fc21f6]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Visceral sensory pathways mediate homeostatic reflexes, the dysfunction of which leads to many neurological disorders. The Bezold–Jarisch reflex (BJR), first described, in 1867, is a cardioinhibitory reflex that is speculated to be mediated by vagal sensory neurons (VSNs) that also triggers syncope. However, the molecular identity, anatomical organization, physiological characteristics and behavioural influence of cardiac VSNs remain mostly unknown. Here we leveraged single-cell RNA-sequencing data and HYBRiD tissue clearingto show that VSNs that express neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY2R) predominately connect the heart ventricular wall to the area postrema. Optogenetic activation of NPY2R VSNs elicits the classic triad of BJR responses — hypotension, bradycardia and suppressed respiration — and causes an animal to faint. Photostimulation during high-resolution echocardiography and laser Doppler flowmetry with behavioural observation revealed a range of phenotypes reflected in clinical syncope, including reduced cardiac output, cerebral hypoperfusion, pupil dilation and eye-roll. Large-scale Neuropixels brain recordings and machine-learning-based modelling showed that this manipulation causes the suppression of activity across a large distributed neuronal population that is not explained by changes in spontaneous behavioural movements. Additionally, bidirectional manipulation of the periventricular zone had a push–pull effect, with inhibition leading to longer syncope periods and activation inducing arousal. Finally, ablating NPY2R VSNs specifically abolished the BJR. Combined, these results demonstrate a genetically defined cardiac reflex that recapitulates characteristics of human syncope at physiological, behavioural and neural network levels.

### Therapeutic options for neurocardiogenic syncope: a meta-analysis of randomised trials with and without blinding [^21315274]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinicians vary in their acceptance of a necessity of placebo control in trial design. Some have argued that it is unethical. It should be remembered though that patients coming to us for clinical advice are expecting to receive recommendations for therapies that are more effective than placebo. It could be argued to be deceptive or even unethical to offer them therapies whose only benefit is placebo. In contrast, it is certainly not deceptive or unethical to invite patients to participate in a placebo-controlled trial which can calculate whether the therapy is beneficial beyond placebo, for the benefit of future patients.

At first sight, syncope might be considered immune to the placebo effect. However, our meta-analysis suggests otherwise. There are two possible mechanisms through which event counts might be lowered by the knowledge of the presence of intervention. First, the autonomic nervous system can readily be affected by psychological factors leading to an actual difference in haemodynamic events. Second, if the patient experiences dizziness or a fall, whether that becomes categorised as a presyncope/syncope event or not will be affected by the patient and physician's knowledge of whether the patient was receiving active treatment or not. Our meta-analysis cannot identify the mechanism but can only document the implied size of the effect.

### Diagnosis, management, and outcomes of patients with syncope and bundle branch block [^86d169f2]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Diagnostic criteria

According to the ESC guidelines, the following aetiological diagnoses were established: neurally mediated, when syncope was precipitated by emotional triggers and was preceded by typical prodromal symptoms; orthostatic hypotension, when syncope occurred in relation to orthostatism and orthostatic hypotension was elicited; drug induced, when there was a clear relationship between syncope and the introduction of a new hypotensive drug or a change in dosage; secondary to cardiopulmonary disease, when syncope was clearly related to an acute cardiopulmonary disorder; CSS, when syncope or near-syncope was reproduced during or immediately after carotid sinus massage in the presence of asystole > 3 s and/or a fall in systolic blood pressure of > 50 mmHg; and arrhythmic syncope, when complete or advanced A-V block, asystole > 3 s, or the presence of sustained VT or rapid SVT was documented, with or without syncope. – Non-arrhythmic syncope was diagnosed when sinus rhythm was documented during a syncopal episode.

The EPS was considered diagnostic with the following findings: sinus node recovery time > 1500 ms; corrected sinus node recovery time > 525 ms; baseline HV interval ≥ 70 ms; second- or third-degree His–Purkinje block during incremental atrial pacing or after intravenous class IC antiarrhythmic drugs or induction of sustained monomorphic VT or rapid SVT that provoked hypotension or reproduced spontaneous symptoms.

Study endpoints

Clinical endpoints were recurrent syncope, documented spontaneous arrhythmias, or death due to any cause.

All patients were followed quarterly during the first 12 months. Those with longer follow-up had additional visits at 18 and 24 months or at study closure. Whenever there was a syncopal recurrence, an unscheduled control visit was performed.

### Impact of cardiovascular neurohormones on onset of vasovagal syncope induced by head-up tilt [^a05f28e9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Syncope is a common clinical condition having many possible causes, 1, 2 with vasovagal reflex syncope (VVS) being by far the most common. Despite extensive studies, the basis of the VVS reflex remains incompletely understood. 1 In this regard the head‐up tilt test (HUT) is routinely used in clinical practice not only for diagnosing VVS susceptibility but also for studying its pathophysiology. 1

Currently, it is unclear whether neurohormones that are involved in cardiovascular homeostasis contribute to VVS pathophysiology. Further, it is uncertain whether neurohormones contribute directly to triggering VVS or if they instead reflect a compensatory mechanism caused by hemodynamic stress. 3 Defining the neuroendocrine pathophysiology of VVS may determine potential targets for therapy or diagnostic testing.

Previous studies have indicated that resting and orthostatic levels of various neurohormones, such as catecholamines, vasopressin, adrenomedullin, and natriuretic peptides are associated with vasovagal reflex susceptibility. 4, 5, 6, 7 Conversely, in the setting of HUT‐induced VVS, a decrease in circulating levels of atrial natriuretic peptide is associated with VVS. Additionally, increased levels of vasopressin and epinephrine have been reported before VVS. 6, 8, 9 However, it is unclear whether or not the magnitude of neuroendocrine changes during orthostatic challenge correlates with VVS susceptibility.

Consequently, we studied changes in supine and early orthostatic levels of neurohormones involved in control of circulatory homeostasis with the goal of assessing their relation to the onset of the tilt‐induced VVS reflex. Utilizing the concept that a shorter time to syncope during HUT reflected greater VVS susceptibility, 8 we hypothesized that greater neuroendocrine changes during HUT would correlate with a shorter time to syncope.

### Assessment of left ventricular volume by an ambulatory radionuclide monitoring system during head-up tilt in patients with unexplained syncope: relation to autonomic activity assessed by heart rate variability [^4b2ecd68]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Decreased left ventricular volume during head-up tilt plays an important role in triggering syncope in patients with neurally mediated syncope. However, precise changes in left ventricular volume during head-up tilt have not been well investigated. This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the decline in left ventricular volume during tilt could trigger ventricular mechanoreceptor activation.

Methods and Results

To investigate the mechanisms of tilt-induced syncope, we measured the temporal changes in left ventricular volume, ejection fraction, cardiac output, and heart rate variability indices during head-up tilt in 25 patients with syncope of undetermined etiology. Eleven patients had a cardioinhibitory response (CI group), 7 patients showed a vasodepressor response (VD group), and 7 patients demonstrated a negative response (NG group). Before syncope, ejection fraction increased most in the CI group, the left ventricular end-diastolic volume declined most in the VD group (VD group, -11.0% ± 3.3%; CI group, -2.8% ± 4.8%; NG group, -3.4% ± 2.2%; P < .005), and the high-frequency spectra increased most in the CI group (CI group, 25.0% ± 21.0%; VD group, -4.1% ± 11.7%; NG group, -5.3% ± 12.7%; P < .01). The vasodepressor response was dependent on left ventricular volume, whereas the cardioinhibitory response was related to the vagal activity reflected by high-frequency spectra.

Conclusions

The precise evaluation of left ventricular volume by an ambulatory radionuclide monitoring system combined with a heart rate variability analysis is considered useful for clarifying the pathophysiology of neurally mediated syncope.

### Diagnosis, management, and outcomes of patients with syncope and bundle branch block [^3d59ca0b]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

The most common aetiology of syncope in patients with bundle branch block (BBB) is paroxysmal atrio-ventricular (A-V) block. However, other mechanisms such as ventricular tachycardia (VT), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), carotid sinus syndrome (CSS), neurally mediated, or orthostatic hypotension can also cause syncope in this population. In addition, some of these patients are at high risk of sudden death, primarily related to the presence and severity of structural heart disease. –

The first step in the diagnostic strategy is to identify patients who are at high risk of sudden death. In these patients, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), is indicated. The diagnostic and therapeutic strategy in the remaining patients is controversial. Some authors suggest that because the most common cause of syncope in these patients is paroxysmal A-V block, a pacemaker should be indicated, whereas others suggest following a comprehensive diagnostic approach that aims to document the cause of syncope before indicating any treatment.

The Bradyarrhythmia detection in BBB (B4) Study is a multicentre, international, prospective, observational study that aims to analyse the clinical outcomes of patients with syncope and BBB following a systematic diagnostic approach, as recommended in guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope of European Society of Cardiology (ESC).

### The impact of school periods and long holiday periods on the occurrence of neurally mediated syncope in children [^9cfbb587]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The occurrence of NMS-related syncope events in children is associated with school periods and long holiday periods. During school periods, being female is a risk factor for syncope, while situational syncope is a protective factor. The research results have certain reference value for educational administrative departments to develop personalized health education strategies for school-age children during school periods and long holiday periods.

### Significance of circulatory epinephrine levels in exercise-induced neurally mediated syncope [^02a0b8c6]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Hypothesis

Previous research has failed to document temporal changes in epinephrine levels in patients with neurally mediated syncope associated with exercise. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of circulatory catecholamines in exercise-induced neurally mediated syncope, specifically focusing on epinephrine levels.

Methods

The present study deals with temporal changes of circulatory catecholamine levels during head-up tilt tests (40 min, 80 degree tilt) in 62 patients with syncope of unknown origin, 7 of whom had syncope associated with exercise (exercise-induced group, 19 ± 3 years). Data were compared with 10 control subjects (control group, 45 ± 23 years). Of the 55 patients with syncope not associated with exercise, 32 tested positive for the head-up tilt tests (positive group, 31 ± 16 years) and 23 patients tested negative (negative group, 46 ± 19 years). Blood samples for circulatory catecholamine assay were obtained from the antecubital vein in the baseline supine position 2 min after the tilt started, every 10 min during tilt, and at the time of the onset of symptoms or the end of tilt. Levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine were determined using the high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method (pg/ml).

Results

Plasma norepinephrine levels among the four groups were similar at the supine position and during tilt testing. In contrast, patients in the exercise-induced group had significantly higher maximum epinephrine levels during head-up tilt testing than the other three groups (288 ± 191 vs. 148 ± 117, 66 ± 31, and 54 ± 27 pg/ml, respectively, p < 0.05). Patients in the positive group had higher maximum epinephrine levels than those in the negative group (p < 0.05). Also, patients in the exercise-induced group and those in the positive group had a significantly shorter tilt-testing time than patients in the negative and control groups.

Conclusions

A marked increase of epinephrine was observed during head-up tilt testing in patients with neurally mediated syncope associated with exercise. The present findings further accelerate the identification of the role of epinephrine in the mechanisms behind neurally mediated syncope associated with exercise.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Table 2 — choice of pacemaker generator in selected indications for pacing summarizes device selection across sinus node dysfunction (SND), atrioventricular (AV) block, and neurally mediated syncope. For SND, a single-chamber atrial pacemaker is suitable when "No suspected abnormality of atrioventricular conduction and not at increased risk for future atrioventricular block". For SND, a single-chamber ventricular pacemaker fits when "Maintenance of atrioventricular synchrony during pacing not necessary", and in AV block when "Chronic atrial fibrillation or other atrial tachyarrhythmia or maintenance of atrioventricular synchrony during pacing not necessary". A dual-chamber pacemaker is selected when "Atrioventricular synchrony during pacing desired", including SND or AV block, and when there is "Suspected abnormality of atrioventricular conduction or increased risk for future atrioventricular block"; in neurally mediated syncope, it applies when "Sinus mechanism present". A single-lead, atrial-sensing ventricular pacemaker is "Not appropriate" for SND, and in AV block may be chosen with a "Desire to limit the number of pacemaker leads".

Deglutition syncope is a rare, neurally mediated reflex syncope associated with swallowing. It is typically associated with pharyngoesophageal disorders with secondary abnormal vagal reflex causing atrioventricular cardiac block and cerebral hypoperfusion. Diagnosis can be delayed and challenging. Various treatment options have been reported, including withholding cardiac blocker agents, diet modifications, and pacemaker placement. We present a case of persistent deglutition syncope secondary to esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction that failed medical therapy and was managed successfully with peroral endoscopic myotomy with excellent long-term outcome.

Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

CardNMH2 (NCT02954666) is an investigator-initiated, prospective, open-label, interventional, single-center cohort study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of cardioneuromodulation in patients with NMS or functional SN dysfunction. The primary safety outcome was freedom from serious adverse events at 7 days, and the primary efficacy outcome was freedom from syncope at 12 months. Syncope and presyncope burden and electrocardiographic data were compared before and after cardioneuromodulation.

CardNMH2 was approved by the Ethical Committee of Imeldaziekenhuis, Bonheiden, Belgium, and has been conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All patients provided written informed consent. An independent data and safety monitoring board reviewed data at regular intervals to safeguard the well-being of the participants.

The authors declare that all supporting data are available in the article.

Study Population

The study enrollment criteria have been published. Patients were assigned to group A if they were affected by neurally mediated syncope and had a type 1 -, type 2A- or type 2B -positive tilt table test (TTT) result according to the modified version of the classification of neurally mediated syncope proposed by the Vasovagal Syncope International Study group (VASIS) and to group B if they had a documented sinus pause ≥ 3 s. A P-P interval shortening ≥ 20% and < 1000 ms after intravenous administration of 2 mg atropine (AT) was required for both groups. Patients in group A must have had ≥ 2 episodes of syncope (≥ 3 in patients < 18 years of age) in their lifetime unless the last syncope was complicated by an injury or an accident. The main exclusion criteria were age < 14 years, unstable medical condition, life expectancy < 12 months, antiarrhythmic drugs, atrial fibrillation, bi- or trifascicular block, permanent PR prolongation, and valvular or myocardial disorders causing syncope. Patient baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

### Neurocardiogenic mechanisms of unexplained syncope in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy [^d13eec87]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Syncope in patients with advanced heart failure is a sign of poor prognosis. The cause of syncope in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DC) is not fully recognized and may remain elusive even after standardized evaluation. The purpose of the present study was to examine the implication of neurally mediated mechanisms in the pathophysiology of syncopal episodes in patients with DC. Twenty-six patients (21 men, 5 women; mean age 59 ± 2 years, range 38 to 79) with DC and left ventricular ejection fractions ≤ 40% were included in the study. Thirteen patients with unexplained syncope or presyncope and a control group of 13 patients without unexplained syncope underwent head-up tilt tests with clomipramine challenge. The 2 groups were matched with regard to age, gender, and left ventricular ejection fractions, and there were no major differences in terms of medication. Heart rate variability analysis and plethysmography of forearm flow were performed during the tilt tests. Blood samples were also drawn for catecholamine measurements. In the group with histories of unexplained syncope, the head-up tilt test results were positive in 11 patients (84.6%). Sympathetic and parasympathetic heart rate indexes were markedly stimulated, while catecholamine concentrations and blood flow changes indicated sympathetic withdrawal during tilting. In the control group, the head-up tilt test results were negative in 12 patients (92.3%). In conclusion, neurally mediated mechanisms seem to be implicated in the pathophysiology of syncope in patients with DC and should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of syncopal episodes of unexplained origin.

### Durable physiological changes and decreased syncope burden 12 months after unifocal right-sided ablation under computed tomographic guidance in patients with neurally mediated syncope or functional sinus node dysfunction [^b91fc76f]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Neurally mediated syncope (NMS) is often refractory to routine treatments. There is, therefore, a need for a new treatment modality. In 2005, Pachon et al, proposed cardiac vagal denervation to treat NMS, sinus node (SN) dysfunction, and functional atrioventricular block. Other research groups, using different multisite cardioneuroablation approaches, published good clinical results for different clinical conditions caused by an inadequate high vagal tone. – While a (dual) pacemaker implantation is indicated in patients with a degenerative sick sinus syndrome having an intrinsic SN dysfunction, patients with a functional SN dysfunction (sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial pause) secondary to excessive high vagal tone could benefit from an intervention that can correct inadequate neural activity of their intrinsic cardiac autonomous nervous system (ICANS).

Cardioneuromodulation is a cardioneuroablative approach aiming to create adequate vagolysis of the sinoatrial node through partial ablation of the anterior right ganglionated plexus (ARGP). – Ganglionated plexi contain large populations of colocalized sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons. Ablation of these plexi will, therefore, not only affect parasympathetic neural bodies and axons but will also interrupt sympathetic axons.

In this article, we report the 12-month results of the CardNMH2 study in patients with NMS or functional SN dysfunction with no significant impairment of their intrinsic SN activity. We provide innovative data on changes in the ICANS physiology associated with cardioneuromodulation.

Vasovagal syncope — epidemiology and outcomes — emergency department cohorts generally feature older patients with mean ages around 60–65 years, and approximately 35% of patients with syncope remain undiagnosed. Approximately 30%–50% of patients with syncope are diagnosed with an autonomically mediated form, most of which are vasovagal. The overall 1-year recurrence rate is approximately 25%–35%, and this rate can be predicted by the number of syncopes in the year prior to assessment. Most patients stop fainting after assessment and in the absence of specific therapy.

### Update on the role of pacemaker therapy in vasovagal syncope and carotid sinus syndrome [^3b314252]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) and carotid sinus syndrome (CSS) are related, neurally mediated disorders with different clinical features and treatment implications. Pacemaker intervention studies in both syndromes are hampered by a dearth of randomized, controlled (particularly with placebo) studies, unfortunate premature termination of studies, and variation in both the clinical presentation and cardiovascular profile of patients enrolled. Given this relatively limited evidence base, pacing therapy in VVS should be reserved for older sufferers with relatively frequent symptoms and spontaneous asystole documented during real-life monitoring. The long term course of patients paced for vasovagal syncope needs clarification, both in terms of symptom and device-related burden, while a comprehensive health economic evaluation of the costs and benefits of such an invasive approach for this usually benign condition is essential. It will also be important to determine the efficacy of closed loop stimulation pacing in an adequately powered study, including a comparison with standard pacing. Pacing should be considered in those with unexplained syncope with reproduction of symptoms during a cardio-inhibitory or mixed response to carotid sinus massage (asystole > 3 s), though the evidence base for this recommendation is firmly in the consensus rather than pragmatic randomized controlled trial camp. Patients presenting with unexplained falls and drop attacks, particularly where injuries are prominent and where patients cannot give a clear account of their fall ("I just ended up on the floor, didn't slip or trip"), should also be considered for pacing. Pacing is not recommended for the vasodepressor sub-type of CSS.

The point of view of Bennett and Levine highlights two crucial aspects about tilt table testing (TTT): the first is the test's inaccuracy in detecting the etiology of syncope; the second is the potential danger of inadvertently misclassifying a syncope that is actually due to a malignant cause such as cardiac arrhythmias, as a neurally mediated syncope (NMS) (likely benign). In adults under the age of 60, these concerns about TTT may be justifiable, but if applied to older adults they could hinder the utility of TTT in diagnosis of syncope, orthostatic hypotension (OH), and falls.

Certainly, the role of TTT in the diagnosis of NMS can be debated. Patient characteristics (age, comorbidity), test setting (ambulatory, hospital ward, emergency room, or syncope unit), and testing procedure (with/without pharmacological stress, degree of tilt, and duration of the test) influence the TTT sensitivity/specificity and outcomes. Nevertheless, the diagnostic accuracy can increase if additional patient medical history is taken by an expert in syncope. As confirmed by the literature and in agreement with Bennett et al. TTT should not be performed when a diagnosis of NMS is clear after analyzing the patient's history and clinical circumstances of syncope. In contrast, as is extensively recommended, TTT should be considered in the case of suspected but not certain diagnosis of NMS. This is often the case in older "fainters" for whom history may be absent or misleading because of retrograde amnesia. Nonetheless, the risk of misclassifying the cause of syncope as benign through the use of TTT is real (e.g. vasodepressor response to TTT in patients with undiagnosed malignant arrhythmia). In older individuals, more than in young people and adults < 60 years, multiple factors can contribute along with the primary cause to the episode of syncope. Hence, no one test alone may avoid a misdiagnosis of the cause of syncope, and so a multidisciplinary approach, including TTT, should be planned to detect these contributing factors.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Reflex-mediated syncope systematic review — study selection and included trials are as follows: After removing duplicates, 3188 titles were screened with 40 selected for full-text review; after full-text review, 10 studies including 676 adult patients comparing pacing to pacing off (or no pacemaker) with at least 1 year of follow-up were included. Among the included studies, 9 randomized trials (n = 642) and 1 observational study (n = 34) met criteria.

Discussion — summary of evidence: Among unblinded studies, pacing reduced the risk of recurrent reflex-mediated syncope, whereas among the 2 double-blinded randomized trials there was no apparent benefit; considering these 10 studies comprising a total of 676 subjects, there is very limited evidence beyond small, unblinded studies to suggest a benefit of pacing, with 1 notable, but limited exception.

Pathophysiology of syncope

Tilt testing has added greatly to our understanding of syncope mechanisms and different collapse patterns, but these are not further discussed in this review, which is focused on the clinical place of TT.
