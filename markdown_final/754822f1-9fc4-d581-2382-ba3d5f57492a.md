## Question

Until what age does a guardian have to give permission for a vaccine?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking until what age a guardian has to give permission for a vaccine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the default legal rule of majority and how it applies to vaccination. Then, I should verify the major exceptions where minors can consent for themselves, including the mature minor doctrine and emancipation. Next, I will examine state-specific variations and recent legislative changes that restrict adolescent self-consent. After that, I need to check special situations like foster care and school-located programs. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, jurisdiction-aware answer and note documentation requirements and risk-mitigation steps for clinicians.

> Let me first confirm the default rule. In most U.S. jurisdictions, the age of majority is 18, and until that age, a parent or legal guardian generally must provide informed consent for medical care, including immunizations, unless a recognized exception applies, so the baseline answer is "until age 18" unless state law creates an exception [^c8a3631b] [^68a8df6b].

> Wait, let me verify the major exceptions before I overgeneralize. The mature minor doctrine allows adolescents who demonstrate sufficient understanding and maturity to consent to certain medical treatments, including some vaccinations, without parental consent; the specific age threshold and scope vary by state and are typically applied case-by-case by clinicians rather than by a fixed age alone [^2c719fd9] [^d51a8aae]. Emancipation is another pathway: minors who are married, on active military duty, or declared emancipated by a court are legally adults for consent purposes and can make their own medical decisions, including vaccination [^2c719fd9] [^d51a8aae].

> Hold on, I should review concrete examples to anchor this. Historically, Tennessee recognized a mature minor doctrine allowing adolescents 14 and older, in the judgment of a clinician, to consent to immunizations without parental permission; however, in 2023 the Tennessee legislature passed the Mature Minor Doctrine Clarification Act, which now requires parental or guardian consent for all childhood immunizations and written consent for COVID-19 vaccines, effectively overriding the prior mature minor approach in that state [^548e3ce5] [^988dbe76] [^23e7597b]. I initially thought this meant Tennessee now requires consent "until 18", but wait, I should correct that: the new law requires parental consent regardless of maturity, so even a 17-year-old in Tennessee cannot self-consent for vaccines under current state law [^988dbe76].

> Next, I should review other state patterns. Many states allow minors to consent independently for specific categories of care such as sexually transmitted infection services, and some include HPV vaccination within those confidential services; the exact ages and scope differ, with some states setting 12 or 14 as the threshold for certain services, but this does not automatically translate to all vaccines or all adolescents, so clinicians must check the specific statute in their state [^fbc52155] [^2c719fd9]. Let me consider international contrasts briefly: South Africa permitted adolescents aged 12–17 to receive COVID-19 vaccines without parental consent, illustrating that some countries lower the consent threshold for older minors in public health emergencies, though this is not a U.S. standard [^0c10b66b].

> I need to ensure I address special circumstances. In foster care, consent authority varies by state; often the birth parent or legal guardian retains medical consent unless rights have been terminated, and child welfare agencies may need to petition courts if parents are unavailable or uncooperative, so foster parents typically cannot provide consent unless specifically granted that authority by a court order [^b1ef4d9a]. For school-located vaccination programs, federal guidance requires that Vaccine Information Statements be provided to the legal representative prior to vaccination, and when parents are not present, programs must navigate state consent laws and may require preauthorization or other documentation to remain compliant [^de5bb31f].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer, but I should double-check that I'm not overstating uniformity. In most U.S. states, guardians must provide consent for vaccination until the minor reaches age 18, unless the minor is emancipated or meets the criteria of the mature minor doctrine recognized in that jurisdiction; however, some states have narrowed or eliminated mature minor exceptions for immunizations, as Tennessee did in 2023, so the safest default is to obtain parental or guardian consent for anyone under 18 unless you have confirmed that your state and the specific circumstance legally permit minor self-consent [^c8a3631b] [^68a8df6b] [^988dbe76]. I should confirm that clinicians also document informed consent appropriately, provide VISs, and maintain records of who consented and how, because federal and state requirements hinge on proper documentation and legal representation for minors [^26198b8a] [^de5bb31f].

> But wait, what if the adolescent is 17 and highly mature — does that change things? In jurisdictions that still recognize a mature minor doctrine for immunizations, a clinician may judge that the adolescent has the capacity to consent, but in states like Tennessee that have legislated parental consent requirements for vaccines, maturity alone is insufficient and parental consent remains legally required; thus, I need to ensure my advice is state-specific and current [^548e3ce5] [^988dbe76]. If I am uncertain about the law in a given state, I should consult state statutes, medical society guidance, or legal counsel before proceeding without parental consent [^68a8df6b].

> Final answer, keeping the nuances explicit: guardians must give permission for vaccines until the child reaches age 18, unless the minor is emancipated or the state recognizes a mature minor exception that includes immunizations and the clinician determines the minor meets that standard; however, several states have restricted or eliminated mature minor self-consent for vaccines, so in practice many clinicians treat 18 as the universal threshold unless they have verified a valid exception in their jurisdiction [^c8a3631b] [^2c719fd9] [^988dbe76].

Guardian consent is required for vaccines until the child reaches the **age of majority** (18 years in most jurisdictions) [^c8a3631b], unless a state-specific exception applies [^68a8df6b]. Some states allow adolescents to consent to certain vaccines (e.g. HPV, COVID-19) [^fbc52155] under a "mature minor" doctrine [^548e3ce5] or specific statutes, but these exceptions vary and are not universal [^2c719fd9]. For children in foster care, consent typically rests with the state or legal guardian, not the foster parent [^b1ef4d9a]. Always verify **local laws** and document consent appropriately [^26198b8a].

---

## General rule: age of majority

- **Age of majority**: In most jurisdictions, the age of majority is 18 years [^c8a3631b], and individuals younger than 18 are considered minors.
- **Guardian consent**: Minors generally require parental or guardian consent for medical procedures, including vaccinations [^68a8df6b].
- **Federal requirement**: Federal law requires that vaccine information statements (VIS) be provided to the parent or legal representative before administering vaccines to minors [^de5bb31f].

---

## Exceptions to guardian consent

Several exceptions allow minors to consent to vaccinations without guardian approval, but these vary by state and circumstance:

| **Exception category** | **Description** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Mature minor doctrine | Allows adolescents deemed mature enough to understand the consequences of medical decisions to consent to certain treatments, including vaccinations [^2c719fd9] | - Some states allow adolescents to consent to HPV vaccination without parental consent [^8deff9f8] <br/> - Tennessee previously recognized this doctrine but recently enacted legislation requiring parental consent for immunizations [^988dbe76] |
| Emancipated minors | Minors who are legally emancipated (married, in the military, or declared emancipated by a court) can make their own medical decisions, including vaccinations [^2c719fd9] | Emancipated minors can consent to vaccinations without parental approval [^d51a8aae] |
| Specific statutes | Some states have laws allowing minors to consent to certain vaccinations, such as HPV or COVID-19 vaccines, without parental consent [^0c10a66b] | - South Africa allows children aged 12–17 to receive COVID-19 vaccines without parental consent [^0c10a66b] <br/> - Some U.S. states have similar provisions for specific vaccines |

---

## Foster care and guardianship

In foster care, **consent authority** typically rests with the state or legal guardian, not the foster parent [^b1ef4d9a]. Courts may also grant guardianship, transferring consent authority to the appointed guardian.

---

## Documentation and legal considerations

- **Documentation**: Healthcare providers must document consent appropriately, including the date, time, and method of consent (written or verbal) [^26198b8a].
- **Legal liability**: Providers should be aware of state laws regarding minor consent to avoid legal liability [^4b3dc9ad].
- **Confidentiality**: Minors who consent to vaccinations may have confidentiality protections under state and federal laws, such as HIPAA [^da942ff9].

---

## Summary of key points

- **General rule**: Guardian consent is required for vaccinations until the child reaches the age of majority (usually 18 years) [^c8a3631b].
- **Exceptions**: Some states allow minors to consent to certain vaccinations under the mature minor doctrine, emancipation, or specific statutes [^2c719fd9].
- **Foster care**: Consent authority typically rests with the state or legal guardian, not the foster parent [^b1ef4d9a].
- **Documentation**: Proper documentation of consent is essential to comply with legal requirements [^26198b8a].

What criteria of informed consent are to be adopted with minors?

Most jurisdictions rely on a parent or guardian to provide informed consent for children to take part in research, with some also allowing for adolescents (eg, 'mature minors' already living independently, or those who meet a threshold of competence) to consent for themselves even though they have not reached the age of majority. In some jurisdictions, both parents' consent may legally be required before a child may take part in research. Ethically, children who are competent to do so should also be part of the consent process, even if in law their parent's consent is sufficient. Younger children should be involved in the decision in a way suitable to their age and understanding, with requirements of how their 'assent' is sought or documented varying from country to country. Such involvement of younger children in the decision-making process should also include respect for a child's wish not to take part.

There may be cases where legal requirements obstruct the enrolment of particular populations or subgroups, for example, where consent must be provided by both parents but it is common for one or both parents to work a long way away from home. In those cases, if there is no scope for seeking a legal waiver, then additional scrutiny must be given to ensuring that a suitably diverse group of children are recruited, despite these barriers to participation.

Ethics committees will need to scrutinise carefully the proposed consent and assent procedures — especially in an environment of politicised resistance against vaccination or widespread lack of vaccine confidence — so that trial enrolment does not put a child in conflict with one or both of their parents (even if, as noted above, the law would permit a child's inclusion on the basis of their own consent alone). Furthermore, when designing appropriate consent models, it is important to consider the context, especially when using standard protocols in different countries. For instance, if girls will be asked to take a pregnancy test as part of the trial protocol, this must be communicated appropriately to both the child and her parents before consent/assent is sought, and implications for confidentiality (eg, whether the result will be shared with parents) made explicit.

### Mature minor doctrine clarification act: a setback in pediatric immunizations [^d9d25943]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

The issue of who can provide consent for a minor to receive immunizations has been 1 of the points of confusion of this law, as the terms parent and legal guardian are defined differently in different areas of the Tennessee code. Parents are not clearly defined by the law or code, and often a biological parent is not available or may not be a legal consenter for a child. According to the Tennessee Medical Association, until the Department of Health provides further clarification, healthcare providers should operate under the most conservative definition of "parent" which is biological father or mother of the minor patient. St. Jude decided to permit individuals with legal consent authority to sign informed consent forms for immunizations, regardless of their relationship to the patient. Deploying the new process has generated confusion. Lawyers were consulted many times on whether a specific situation would allow immunization, despite clear medical indications. As more patients were vaccinated, more frequently asked questions were raised, and a document was developed for frontline professionals to address common problems and ensure a smoother process.

### Legal basis of consent for health care and vaccination for adolescents [^68a8df6b]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

State law is generally the controlling authority for whether parental consent is required or minors may consent for their own health care, including vaccination. At the federal level, no vaccination consent law exists; however, federal law requires that vaccine information statements be given to the parent or another person who is qualified under state law to consent to vaccination of a minor. All states allow minors to consent for their own health care in some circumstances on the basis of either (1) their status (eg, age, emancipation, marriage) or (2) the kind of health care services they are seeking (eg, family planning services, treatment of sexually transmitted disease). In each state, a specific analysis of laws will be required to determine the circumstances under which a minor can consent for vaccination.

While seemingly simple, the new law has created many pitfalls for clinicians, offices, systems, and institutions, leading to confusion, fear of liability, and additional anxiety around the process of immunizing children against deadly diseases.

These have extended beyond adolescents and the consideration of "mature minors" due to new provisions in the law around informed consent. The most critical concerns include (1) lack of clarity on what type of informed consent is required, the very definition of the term "informed", what information should be included, and whether it must be written or can be verbal; (2) uncertainty on what and how the informed consent process must document in the medical record; (3) what limitations, if any, there may be in who can provide the information that constitutes as informed consent (nursing or physicians, eg); (4) who technically qualifies as a parent or legal guardian and is therefore authorized to provide this informed consent; (5) how to handle obtaining informed consent in situations of joint custody, stepparents, or other family members with power of attorneys. The Tennessee Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Tennessee Medical Association have issued recommendations and FAQs to assist clinicians in navigating this new law (Table 1).

### Informed consent in decision-making in pediatric practice [^2c719fd9]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Special issues in adolescent informed consent/assent/refusal — minors' independent decision-making pathways and service-specific consent rules are outlined as follows: There are 3 broad categories of circumstances in which a minor can legally make decisions regarding his or her own health care: exceptions based on specific diagnostic/ care categories, the mature minor exception, and legal emancipation. Although all states allow access to treatment of STIs, the protection of the adolescent's confidentiality is less widespread; some states permit the practitioner to disclose information to parents/guardians if they believe it is in the minor's best interest, and many states, insurers, and electronic medical record systems do not make provisions for deferred billing and/ or payment for STI services, thus endangering an adolescent's desire for confidentiality; practitioners are best advised to become familiar with their state statutes and to consider promoting changes in legislation to improve adolescent confidentiality protection where appropriate. Primary prevention is available in the form of vaccination, which is recommended for both boys and girls ages 11 through 12 years by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but it is unknown whether most states will include the HPV primary prevention vaccination in the category of protected STI treatment or general vaccination for which minors may not provide consent. The majority of states allow some or all adolescents 12 years or older access to contraceptive services and usually do not require parental notification, whereas minor consent to abortion without parental involvement is uncommon: currently, 37 states require parental involvement, although, in general, there is a mechanism by which the minor can petition the court for access to abortion services without parental knowledge or consent. The mature minor doctrine recognizes that there is a subset of adolescents who have adequate maturity and capacity to understand and appreciate an intervention's benefits, risks, likelihood of success, and alternatives and can reason and choose voluntarily, and under the mature minor doctrine, the age, overall maturity, cognitive abilities, and social situation of the minor are considered in a judicial determination, finding that an otherwise legally incompetent minor is sufficiently mature to make a legally binding decision and provide his or her own consent for medical care; in contrast, legally emancipated minor statutes do not address decision-making ability but rather the legal status of the minor, and adolescents who are living separately from their parents and are self-supporting, married, or on active duty with the armed forces are generally considered legally emancipated and competent to make their own decisions and provide consent for medical care.

### Mature minor doctrine clarification act: a setback in pediatric immunizations [^988dbe76]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

The Mature Minor Doctrine Clarification Act, a Tennessee bill stating that a healthcare provider may not provide vaccination to a minor without the informed consent of a parent/legal guardian, poses significant challenges to pediatric immunization. We outline changes implemented to our processes in response to this bill.

While systems continue to navigate these changes, several options exist to improve the current law in order to facilitate and expand access to immunizations so that children can remain protected against vaccine-preventable illnesses and ensure on-time school entry. Additional legislation or rules may be brought that can provide clarity on some of the challenges embedded in the current law, including clarification on who can provide consent, the definition of a parent or legal guardian, the type of consent required, and the frequency in which this consent is needed. For instance, can a parent provide a written notice that the caregiver accompanying the child has the power to consent for immunizations? Can this be done through an electronic portal? What period would such a notice cover — 1 visit or an entire year? The law has a provision that allows the Tennessee Department of Health to promulgate rules to effectuate the act, which could include providing guidance around issues such as these. While the department has not yet provided any public action, details around these issues and others could potentially be clarified through this process with the input from professional medical groups. Additional legislation may be required to clarify portions of the Tennessee code and to amend the language around children in DCS custody, where the requirements and provisions are more clear and severely restrictive. Professional medical organizations continue to lobby legislators and the Department of Health around these issues and have asked parents and caregivers to contact their legislators as well. These issues have been highlighted in the media which has helped bring attention to the issue and increase activism around it as well. Offices and medical systems may consider using standardized scripts and language to inform parents and caregivers of the new law so that they can be prepared and potentially make the needed provisions to ensure that the vaccination process goes smoothly for their child. Partnerships and coalitions across the state may be considered to provide best practice recommendations to clinicians and to lawmakers as both navigate these issues.

### COVID-19 vaccines for children and adolescents in Africa: aligning our priorities to situational realities [^0c10b66b]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

There is a need to educate caregivers on new SARS-CoV-2 variants that are potentially more transmissible, as well as country consent policies for vaccinating CA. In some countries, COVID-19 vaccines are being offered to CA without parental/guardian consent. For example, children aged 12–17 years old in South Africa are now permitted to receive two doses of the approved Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine without needing parental/guardian consent. The decision to authorise this COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 12 years and older is premised on the understanding that older minors are capable of understanding the risks and benefits of the vaccination. Some of these countries have already set precedents by lowering the age of consent to accessing other health services (eg, HIV testing), which have improved access to care among adolescents. However, mechanisms must be established to provide CA (as well as their caregivers) with accurate information about both the advantages and potential disadvantages of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Governments, civil organisations, and community leaders must collaborate to address concerns raised by disinformation campaigns and find effective ways of delivering reliable information about the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved for use among CA.

Current evidence generally supports the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines for children. For example, recent data from a phase II/III trial indicates that a child-size dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine generates a robust antibody response in children aged 5–11 years old, and side effects are generally comparable to those in young adults. However, more contextual research is required to understand the implications of COVID-19 vaccines on the development of CA, as most evidence about the impacts of COVID-19 in this population comes from studies in high-resource settings. Research is also needed to determine the potential immediate and long-term side effects of COVID-19 vaccines for CA living with chronic and life-threatening medical conditions that are particularly prevalent in Africa. For example, little is known about the effects of COVID-19 vaccines among CA living with HIV and/or TB, which are two serious chronic infections highly prevalent among CA in sub-Saharan Africa. Hence, paediatric COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials among CA in African countries will play an important role in establishing the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines in CA living with HIV and/or TB.

### Mature minor doctrine clarification act: a setback in pediatric immunizations [^548e3ce5]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

A "mature minor" doctrine provides a process for minors to consent to medical procedures if, in the judgment of the treating clinician, they demonstrate they are mature enough to make a medical decision on their own behalf. While there are differences in what types of procedures and care these doctrines typically cover, Tennessee was previously 1 of 5 states with a "mature minor doctrine" allowing healthcare providers to decide whether an adolescent has the capacity to consent to immunizations. This was established through long-standing judicial decisions (Cardwell, v. Bechtol, 724 S.W.2d 739, Tenn. 1987) and subsequently reaffirmed by the state's attorney general in 2003 (Tenn. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 03–087). In determining who is a "mature minor", Tennessee has followed the "Rule of Sevens", meaning that children under 7 years of age do not have the capacity necessary to make their own decisions; children from 7 to 14 years of age are presumed not to have this capacity until proven otherwise in individual cases, and those 14 years of age and older and deemed "mature" by their treating clinician did not require parental consent for certain healthcare services, including immunizations.

### Consent by proxy for nonurgent pediatric care [^c8a3631b]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Minor — by definition, a person younger than the age of legal competence is a minor, and in most states a person is no longer a minor after reaching 18 years of age.

### Recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines in infants, children, and adolescents: policy statement [^07376c16]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

AAP COVID-19 vaccination — single-dose 2025–2026 schedule and product selection states that the AAP recommends a single dose of age-appropriate 2025–2026 COVID-19 vaccine for all children and adolescents 2 through 18 years of age in the following risk groups (as described in Table 1) regardless of prior COVID-19 vaccination status. Children 2 through 18 years of age not included in the risk groups above whose parent or guardian desires their protection from COVID-19 should be offered a single dose of age-appropriate 2025–2026 COVID-19 vaccine, and this dose should be administered at least 8 weeks after the last dose was received. Any available COVID-19 vaccine appropriate by age and health status that is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration through a biologics license application can be used, and the most updated version of the COVID-19 vaccine that is available should be used.

### Mature minor doctrine clarification act: a setback in pediatric immunizations [^7186fba8]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

As the COVID-19 immunizations became available to minors in 2021, Dr Michelle Fiscus, medical director of Tennessee's Vaccine Preventable Diseases and Immunization Program, shared a memo within the Tennessee Department of Health outlining the state's "mature minor doctrine" that would allow adolescents to consent for and receive these immunizations on their own.

Anger in the state legislature around these actions ultimately led to Dr Fiscus' firing, and Tennessee temporarily halted all state-led immunization outreach efforts for children and adolescents. As this brought further attention to this doctrine, the Tennessee General Assembly acted earlier this year to pass the Mature Minor Doctrine Clarification Act in order to further limit the powers of adolescents to provide consent for immunizations. This "parental rights" bill counteracts the Mature Minor Doctrine, instead stating that a clinician may not provide immunizations to a minor without the informed consent of a parent/legal guardian. The new law also prohibits employees or agents of the state, such as the Tennessee Department of Children's Services (DCS), from mandating that minors in state custody receive immunizations. Biological parents of children in foster care must give consent to their children to receive immunizations while in state custody. However, the DCS may also petition the court to provide for them.

### Adolescents, young adults, and vaccine hesitancy: who and what drives the decision to vaccinate? [^240ab9e7]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Although vaccines are important for all age groups, issues of vaccine uptake and vaccine hesitancy have particular salience for the adolescent and young adult age group. This article reviews the importance of vaccination for adolescents and young adults, the variability in uptake of different vaccines, the reasons for vaccine hesitancy for this age group, and the legal framework for consent for vaccination. One important difference between vaccine hesitancy for adolescents and hesitancy for younger children or adults is the unique developmental, clinical, ethical, and legal context in which the decision to vaccinate is made.

### Enrolling minors in COVID-19 vaccine trials [^29aabb4e]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

It is widely agreed that an effective response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic needs to include a vaccine that is safe and effective for minors. However, many current vaccine trials have no plans for when to enroll minors. Others have recently proposed enrolling minors as young as 12 years old. This lack of a systematic approach raises 2 concerns. Waiting too long to enroll minors could unjustly deny minors and their families the benefits of a vaccine and has the potential to delay an effective response to the pandemic by a year or longer. At the same time, enrolling minors too soon runs the risk of exposing them to excessive risks. With these concerns in mind, in the present article, we propose recommendations for when and how to enroll minors in vaccine trials for the coronavirus disease 2019.

### Who calls the shots? The ethics of adolescentself-consent for HPV vaccination [^59363e14]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2018). Low credibility.

While the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is medically indicated to reduce the risk of genital warts and certain types of cancer, rates of HPV vaccination repeatedly fall short of public health goals. Individual-level factors contributing to low vaccination rates are well documented. However, system-level barriers, particularly the need for parental consent, have been less explored. To date, there is no legal or ethical consensus in the USA regarding whether adolescents might permissibly self-consent to the HPV vaccine. Consequently, there is considerable variability in medical practice at the provider and state level. In this essay, we explore the ethical acceptability of vaccinating adolescents for HPV without parental consent. We argue that the same ethical considerations that justify permitting minors to consent to treatment for sexual and reproductive health care-namely, public health benefit and adolescents' developing autonomy-similarly justify permitting minors to consent to HPV vaccination. Based on this analysis, we conclude that allowing adolescents to self-consent to the HPV vaccine is ethically justifiable and should be reflected in US state policies.

INFORMED CONSENT

As per the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH-GCP, and the regulatory guidelines, informed consent is critical to ensure the protection and the rights of potential research participants who come into contact with the research team. In MVP studies, informed consent was taken from all the participants ≥ 18 years of age. For children and adolescents (1–17 years), parents/legal guardians gave the consent. In addition, written assent was taken from the participants for older children aged 12–17 years, following the local EC recommendations. When dealing with illiterate participants/parents/legal guardians, an impartial literate witness, independent from the investigator team, attested the consent process.

### Minority report: can minor parents refuse treatment for their child? [^2de15af7]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

What are the limits to decisions for a minor parent?

If minor parents, like M, are permitted to make medical decisions for their children, should they have the same range of decisions as an adult parent? To assess this question, it will be useful to first assess the range of decisions adult parents can make for their children. We will compare this with the decisions that mature minors are able to make for themselves.

The limits for decisions of adult parents

While parents are usually thought to have a right to make decisions for their young children, no parent can make unlimited decisions for their infants; parents must provide children with basic goods that are necessary for flourishing, and they must not abuse or neglect them.

The 'best interests' of the child are widely accepted as a fundamental ethical principle for decisions about children. However, health professionals do not over-rule parents whenever they appear to be making suboptimal decisions. Instead, where there is uncertainty of outcome or where there is more than one medically reasonable alternative, the choices of parents are respected, unless the decision for their child poses a significant risk of serious harm. Society is morally, and also legally, justified to interfere with the parenthood of parents who harm their children.

In paediatric practice, the range of decisions that parents are ethically entitled to make for their children has been dubbed the 'zone of parental discretion'. Gillam describes this as 'a morally legitimate space' between decisions that are optimal for that child, and decisions that are harmful to the child.

A paradigm example of a suboptimal decision that adult parents are permitted to make is refusal of routine immunisation. It is accepted in most societies that parents can choose to have their child vaccinated or not: the decision to vaccinate falls within the zone of parental discretion. There are a range of other suboptimal choices that also fall within the zone of parental discretion. 8

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^fbc52155]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia explicitly allow minors to consent for their own STI services. No state requires parental consent for STI care, although the age at which a minor can provide consent for specified health care services (i.e. HPV vaccination and HIV testing and treatment) varies among states. In 2019, a total of 18 states allowed but did not require physicians to notify parents of a minor's receipt of STI services, including states where minors can legally provide their own consent to the service.

Protecting confidentiality for STI care, particularly for adolescents enrolled in private health insurance plans, presents multiple problems. After a claim has been submitted, many states mandate that health plans provide a written statement to the beneficiary indicating the service performed, the charges covered, what the insurer allows, and the amount for which the patient is responsible (i.e. explanation of benefits [EOB]). In addition, federal laws obligate notices to beneficiaries when claims are denied, including alerting beneficiaries who need to pay for care until the allowable deductible is reached. For STI testing and treatment-related care, an EOB or medical bill that is received by a parent might disclose services provided and list STI laboratory tests performed or treatment administered. Some states have instituted mechanisms for protecting adolescents' confidentiality and limiting EOBs. Additional risks to confidentiality breaches can inadvertently occur through electronic health records, although technology continues to evolve to assist with ensuring confidential care. AAP and the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine (SAHM) have published guidance on strategies to address emerging risks for confidentiality breaches associated with health information technology.

AAP and the SAHM recommend that providers have time alone with their adolescent patients that includes assessment for sexual behavior. The AAP recommendations are available atand the SAHM recommendations are available at. Discussions concerning sexual behavior should be tailored for the patient's developmental level and be aimed at identifying risk behaviors (e.g. multiple partners; oral, anal, or vaginal sex; or drug misuse behaviors). Careful, nonjudgmental, and thorough counseling is particularly vital for adolescents who might not feel comfortable acknowledging their engagement in behaviors that make them more vulnerable to acquiring STIs.

### Strategies for improving vaccine communication and uptake [^9325bc06]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Practice-level policies for families who refuse or delay vaccination — considerations and alternatives specify that practices should consider having uniform policies across providers for families who refuse or delay vaccination and that there are ethical concerns with the practice of dismissing families; dismissal of a vaccine-refusing family can be an acceptable option, however, after repeated attempts to help understand and address parental values and vaccine concerns, engender trust, and strengthen the therapeutic alliance, and before dismissal other considerations include that less drastic alternatives are not feasible and the clinician has tried to minimize potential negative impacts on the child, that it is done in a manner consistent with applicable state laws prohibiting abandonment of patients, that official notification of the parents or legal guardian is required along with the provision of information for finding a new physician, and that the dismissing physician is obligated to continue current treatment and provide emergency care for a reasonable period of time, usually 30 d; other policies practices sometimes use include not accepting new patients whose parents do not agree to give their children all vaccines according to the recommended schedule and requiring parents to sign a contract stating that their children must be up to date by a certain age, but the parents may spread out the vaccines; practice policies concerning families who refuse vaccinations should be applied uniformly to all such families; and evidence is lacking for the impact of any type of practice-level policy on vaccination uptake, vaccine attitudes and trust in the medical system, or where children who are dismissed from practices receive medical care.

### Consent by proxy for nonurgent pediatric care [^26198b8a]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Immunization consent and Vaccine Information Statements (VISs) — state law and documentation: For pediatric immunizations, the VICP requires that providers distribute a VIS to the patient's legal representative every time a covered immunization is administered, federal law uses "legal representative" for who may consent, and thus, regarding immunizations, state law controls consent. Non-LAR consent to immunizations may be restricted under some state laws, and most states require separate consent for each injection when more than 1 injection is required to complete immunization. Most states require consent for immunization services provided to adolescents, although some states allow adolescents to provide informed consent for immunization, and unless the law provides otherwise, immunizations should not be given without appropriate consent. VISs explain benefits and risks, are intended to facilitate, not replace, effective risk communication and proper informed consent, and for non–English-speaking patients they have been translated into more than 40 languages.

### COVID-19 vaccine trials with children: ethics pointers [^5d73afa8]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

As healthcare authorities around the world strive to get as many citizens as possible vaccinated against the SAR-CoV-2 virus, many countries have begun including children in the population groups to be vaccinated. Properly designed clinical trials involving children are important to ensure safety, efficacy, and dosage of therapies in (developing) children. Within the complex health, social, and political scenario of the ongoing pandemic, ethics committees and policy makers in low-income and middle-income settings need to consider additional ethical questions when called on to review phase III COVID-19 vaccine trials involving in children. We set out some of the ethical questions to keep in mind before, during, and after the implementation of phase III COVID-19 vaccine trials in limited resource settings. Specifically, we discuss and offer succinct answers to the following questions: How relevant will the trial vaccine be for the population participating in the trial? Should vaccines that have not been approved for use among adults be approved for use in trials with children? Which children should be involved in COVID-19 vaccine trials? What criteria of informed consent are to be adopted with minors? Placebo versus an existing already approved vaccine? What specific duties of ancillary care should be taken into consideration for COVID-19 vaccines especially in low-income and middle-income countries? The answers we offer are considerations that can serve as 'things to think about' when reviewing or implementing COVID-19 trials involving children in low-income settings.

### Community perspectives associated with the African PsA-TT (menAfriVac) vaccine trials [^841e872d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

CONSENT AND SUBJECT PARTICIPATION

Informed consent is based on a clear appreciation and understanding of the facts and the consequences of participating in a clinical trial. Obtaining informed consent was therefore quite challenging in these illiterate populations. One such challenge consisted of developing information in the local languages that matched the original English information sheets. Obtaining back-translations was a necessary and challenging process. Details of this process are highlighted in an accompanying article that focuses on ethical issues.

In these communities, male members often have the final say on the consent process even when they are not present. Thus in some instances, the consent had to be done in stages to accommodate this cultural peculiarity. Also, it was rather challenging to get parents to accompany older minors to the clinics for the consent process. Thus, for many in this group it was sometimes necessary to go to the participant's home to sign the consent form. In addition, regarding consent of minors, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) allows for the consent of legal guardians. In these communities, children are often in the custody of more people than just the parents, and in practice this meant that it was not always easy to ascertain who was a legal guardian. The child belongs to the family, so almost any adult could take care of the child and hence decide on behalf of the child. Documented legal guardianship is important however, as some studies have documented that guardians are more willing to allow participation in trials of children other than their own. With infant trials it was easier to identify a parent, but with older children care had to be taken to establish who a legal guardian was. In MRC Gambia, the rule is to accept parental consent, except when there is written documentation of legal guardianship. This remains culturally sensitive in communities where such extended family arrangements are the norm, and research teams may be viewed as usurping this valued tradition.

An impartial witness is required by GCP when obtaining consent from illiterate participants. A major difficulty in The Gambia and Senegal was finding literate and impartial individuals in these rural areas where literacy rates are quite low. In The Gambia, it was customary to use school teachers or health workers who may then need to serve as witness for several participants. Participants were, however, encouraged to come with their own witnesses whenever possible.

### Assessing the impact of a VI-polysaccharide conjugate vaccine in preventing typhoid infections among Nepalese children: a protocol for a phase III, randomized control trial [^ad9cdc9e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS

Study Design

This is a participant- and observer-blind, individually randomized, controlled trial with a 2-year follow-up to assess the protective impact of Vi-TCV.

Population

Children aged 9 months to < 16 years at the time of enrollment will be eligible to participate. Participants will be identified as living within the defined catchment area of the Lalitpur district, within the Kathmandu valley, Nepal. Trial staff, including local community health volunteers, will identify households with children < 16 years of age and approach them for participation.

This age range has been selected because children bear a substantial burden of the disease in both mortality and morbidity, without an effective vaccine available in the routine vaccination schedule. Therefore, this demographic group has the most to gain from vaccination with Vi-TCV and would be the primary target for any subsequent vaccination campaign.

Inclusion Criteria

To be included in the study, the following inclusion criteria must be met:

Parent/legal guardian is willing and competent to provide informed consent. If the participant is 7 years of age or older, assent will also be sought.
Participant is aged between 9 months and < 16 years (ie, up to 15 years and 364 days) at the time of vaccination.
Participant is in good health on the day of vaccination.
Parent/legal guardian confirms that they/their child will be willing and able to comply with the study requirements, including follow-up contacts, according the schedule (Table 1).
Participant lives within the study catchment area at the time of vaccination.

Exclusion Criteria

Any of the following criteria will be grounds for exclusion:

Participant has knowingly received a typhoid vaccine in the last 3 years.
Participant has a known allergy to any of the vaccine components.
Participant or parent/guardian has any medical or social reason that will prevent the participant from conforming to the study requirements, as judged by a medical professional.
Participant or parent/guardian is planning to move away from the catchment area within the next 6 months.

### Childhood immunization: when physicians and parents disagree [^b0319bb1]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Persistent fears about the safety and efficacy of vaccines, and whether immunization programs are still needed, have led a significant minority of parents to refuse vaccination. Are parents within their rights when refusing to consent to vaccination? How ought physicians respond? Focusing on routine childhood immunization, we consider the ethical, legal, and clinical issues raised by 3 aspects of parental vaccine refusal: (1) physician counseling; (2) parental decision-making; and (3) continuing the physician-patient relationship despite disagreement. We also suggest initiatives that could increase confidence in immunization programs.

### Informed consent of the minor. implications of present day Spanish law [^5efda60d]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2002). Low credibility.

In Spain, any person under the age of 18 is a minor. Generally, minors lack the legal capacity to take legally binding actions because they are deemed incapable of legally binding consent. Spanish civil law recognises, however, that the child, in accordance with the law and being sufficiently mature, may act for himself. It stands, then, that consent, as expressed by the "sufficiently mature" minor, should be legally valid.

### Mature minor doctrine clarification act: a setback in pediatric immunizations [^5d7931d6]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Main Points of Confusion and Possible Action

St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (St. Jude) in Memphis, TN, specializes in catastrophic diseases such as cancer, sickle cell disease, and HIV. Many of our patients are at risk of severe disease from vaccine-preventable illnesses. Several roadblocks were encountered in preparation of our annual influenza immunization campaign that have required revised processes. An institutional lawyer was added to the planning group to assist with processes and ensure compliance. First, an informed consent form was created that would capture all doses of all immunizations, as parents likely need to provide separate consent for each immunization at every point of administration. The most conservative approach was advised, which included obtaining signed consent for each dose of each vaccine at every visit. Given the number of vaccines and doses, it is challenging to create a document that is comprehensive yet simple, easy to use and administer (whether on paper or electronically) and that does not significantly disrupt clinic flow processes. The Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) for each immunization has always been provided and discussed with caregivers, however, including the date of the most recent VIS sheet in the consent form has been a barrier to streamlining implementation of this process. As the consent form is part of the medical record, no additional documentation is made in the chart other than which immunizations were administered, any patient-specific information or risks, and any questions raised by patients or caregivers. St. Jude has decided that any healthcare professional caring for the patient can obtain informed consent and has not limited this process to physicians. While the law does not specify that written consent is needed, and phone consent may be possible per some interpretations, St. Jude has opted to obtain written consent unless an opportunity for immunization would be missed, in which phone consent may be obtained.

### Mature minor doctrine clarification act: a setback in pediatric immunizations [^00fd4735]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

UT Le Bonheur General Pediatrics (ULPS), an academic teaching practice within a large healthcare system, provides general pediatrics care for a panel of around 6000 patients in the heart of Memphis, approximately 95% of whom are insured through the state Medicaid program. Patients are often accompanied by grandparents, siblings, aunts or uncles, or other noncustodial caregivers, many who may in fact be the primary caregiver for the patient, which has presented challenges for proper consent. The ULPS system has also implemented new processes, provided extensive education, and consulted with institutional lawyers. ULPS has taken the approach of allowing for verbal informed consent, also utilizing VIS sheets, and providing a preformed block of text that can be inserted using keyboard shortcuts for simple documentation in the medical record that information was provided, and that consent was obtained from a parent or legal guardian. However, parents or legal guardians are often not present and not available in clinic and sometimes have not been present in the child's life for many years. The law has led to children not being able to receive routine immunizations during their medical visit and in some cases has prevented them from attending school due to the lack of required immunizations, not to mention the lack of protection against potentially deadly diseases. This is important as the number of fully immunized children entering kindergarten in TN has trended down for 3 consecutive years, with some vaccines being below the 95% established goal by the state and only 27% of counties reporting at least 95% of kindergartners enrolling in school as being fully immunized. The impact of this new legislation cannot be entirely estimated at this point although this data demonstrates the decrease in immunization rates even before the implementation of this law, likely due to many reasons around access to healthcare, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and vaccine mis- and disinformation that abounds. The complexity of the current situation only adds to the known increase of religious exemptions and temporary certificates. The law places additional constraints around children in state custody, clearly requiring written consent from the parent or legal guardian (although still not clarifying those terms) or requiring a judge's order. The clinic has seen many children in this situation that they have been unable to immunize due to a lack of signed consent from a biological parent at the time of the visit. As influenza season approaches and our clinics attempt to provide these immunizations, uncertainty regarding this law has been a barrier, as these vaccines are administered throughout the system. Similar concerns have arisen at back-to-school immunization events and other efforts intended to prepare children for school, catch up on immunizations, and maximize their health.

### What constitutes consent when parents and daughters have different views about having the HPV vaccine: qualitative interviews with stakeholders [^e0a4fbb0]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The UK Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine programme commenced in the autumn of 2008 for year 8 (age 12–13&emsp14; years) schoolgirls. We examine whether the vaccine should be given when there is a difference of opinion between daughters and parents or guardians.

Design

Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews.

Participants

A sample of 25 stakeholders: 14 professionals involved in the development of the HPV vaccination programme and 11 professionals involved in its implementation.

Results

Overriding the parents' wishes was perceived as problematic and could damage the relationship between school and parents. A number of practical problems were raised in relation to establishing whether parents were genuinely against their daughter receiving the vaccine. Although many respondents recognised that the Gillick guidelines were relevant in establishing whether a girl could provide consent herself, they still felt that there were significant problems in establishing whether girls could be assessed as Gillick competent. In some areas school nurses had been advised not to give the vaccine in the absence of parental consent. None of the respondents suggested that a girl should be vaccinated against her consent even if her parents wanted her to have the vaccine.

Conclusions

While the Gillick guidelines provide a legal framework to help professionals make judgements about adolescents consenting to medical treatment, in practice there appears to be variable and confused interpretation of this guidance. Improved legal structures, management procedures and professional advice are needed to support those who are assessing competence and establishing consent to vaccinate adolescents in a school setting.

STUDY PROCEDURES

Recruitment and Screening

Following community sensitization using Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved materials, local community families with children aged 9–11 months and 15–23 months will be given study information in French and/or a local language (including Mossi, Dyula, and Fulani), either individually or in a group setting. The voluntary nature of the study and the right to withdraw will be explained. Parents of eligible children will then be encouraged to ask questions and will provide written informed consent in a semi-private area before enrollment and vaccination. The consent form will have a signature or thumbprint from the child's parent/guardian before any study procedure. The adult literacy rate in Burkina Faso was 35% in 2014, and providing a thumbprint is a locally acceptable equivalent for a written signature. A copy will be given to the parent/guardian and another copy will be filed on site. If a parent/guardian is unable to read or sign, an impartial witness will document that all information was provided and consent was freely given. After informed consent is obtained, each potential participant will be screened for eligibility, according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Randomization

Randomization will be computer-generated to allocate eligible participants in a 1:1 ratio for the 9–11-month-old cohort or a 1:1:1 ratio for the 15–23-month-old cohort, using stratified block randomization with varying block sizes from 6–12.

Blinding

Vi-TCV and IPV have similar pharmaceutical presentations. Unblinded study personnel will be responsible for vaccine preparation and administration. These unblinded personnel will not be involved in study-related assessments or have contact with subjects for the purpose of data collection following the study vaccination. Study participants, their family members, and study staff will not know the assigned vaccine group. The 15–23-month-old cohort will be unblinded on Day 28, so that Group 3 can receive MCV-A at this visit.

### Vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years-national immunization survey-teen, United States, 2022 [^0fc2f899]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

NIS-Teen is a random-digit–dialed telephone survey ** conducted among households that include adolescents aged 13–17 years in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, selected local areas, and some U.S. territories. †† Parents and guardians are interviewed to obtain adolescent, maternal, and household information and are asked to provide consent for their adolescent's vaccine providers to be contacted. Immunization history questionnaires are mailed to all vaccine providers identified by the parent or guardian to obtain the adolescent's complete vaccination record. The 2022 NIS-Teen vaccination coverage estimates were based on provider-reported vaccination histories from 16,043 adolescents aged 13–17 years §§ who were born during January 2004–January 2010 and included any vaccines received before the household interview date. Recent trends in vaccination coverage were assessed by comparing vaccination coverage by age among the 2008 and 2009 birth cohorts (i.e. those who reached their 12th and 11th birthdays, respectively, in 2020) to vaccination coverage in earlier birth cohorts (i.e. adolescents born in 2006 and 2007) whose routine vaccinations were not affected by the pandemic. Cross-sectional analysis was used to estimate vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years. The household response rate ** was 23.0%, and 38.8% of adolescents with completed interviews had adequate provider data. ††† To better understand recent trends in vaccination coverage, estimates by age and birth year (2006–2009) were obtained; Kaplan-Meier techniques were used to account for censoring of vaccination status at age ≥ 14 years. Z-tests were used to compare differences in vaccination coverage by survey year, birth year, and among sociodemographic groups; differences with p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data were weighted §§§ and analyses were conducted using SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 11; RTI International). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.

### COVID-19 vaccines for children and adolescents in Africa: aligning our priorities to situational realities [^8fbbfbfc]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Conclusion

In Africa, the negative implications of social-structural vulnerabilities (eg, poverty, inequities in access to healthcare) that predated the COVID-19 pandemic have been amplified by its impact. Vaccinating CA for COVID-19 could play an important role in mitigating the strain on overburdened health systems and promoting postpandemic recovery. Expanding COVID-19 vaccine strategies to include a wider age range of CA, especially older adolescents, may help to lower the rate of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools, which could support the well-being of CA more broadly (eg, fewer disruptions in formal learning, greater continuity of daily routines). However, vaccination strategies also need to consider the prevailing global inequities in access to vaccines. In many African countries, capacity to engage in large-scale roll-outs of COVID-19 vaccinations is limited by supply challenges and weak health system infrastructure, suggesting that the African continent should continue to prioritise vaccinations for adults and consider offering COVID-19 vaccines to CA who are at increased risk of severe illness from the disease. A concerted effort to accelerate COVID-19 vaccination coverage among adults to approach at least 70% by early 2022would allow African countries to free up capacity to prioritise COVID-19 vaccines for CA during 2022, with roll-out efforts needing to focus on older and school going CA. Actionable strategies should be developed and implemented to ensure that caregivers have the information they need to make informed decisions about providing consent for their minor children to be vaccinated for COVID-19.

More data are needed to develop a better understanding of the safe and effective use of COVID-19 vaccines in children who are younger than 12 years of age. We need to continue gathering evidence on the use of different COVID-19 vaccines in CA, which would allow for general recommendations on vaccinating children to be made. It will also be important to engage in ongoing evaluation of the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines for CA, as well as research to identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 and the potential impact of future variants on CA. More generally, antibody studies are needed to detect immunity levels in the population and inform public health responses. Although countries throughout Africa should be supported to rapidly expand COVID-19 vaccines to CA in the near future, maintaining control over COVID-19 and its impacts will require African countries to continue prioritising non-pharmaceutical interventions among both vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

### VIS frequently asked questions… [^de5bb31f]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Some states have informed consent laws, covering either procedural requirements or substantive requirements. Check your state medical consent law to determine if there are any specific informed consent requirements relating to immunization. VISs may be used for informed consent as long as they conform to the appropriate state laws. Q: Should the VISs be used for adults getting vaccines as well as for children. A: Yes. Anyone receiving a covered vaccine should be given the appropriate VIS. VISs are worded so they may be used by adults as well as children. Exceptions are VISs for vaccines that are not licensed for adults, such as DTaP or rotavirus. Q: The law states that VISs may be given to a child's "legal representative. " How is "legal representative" defined. Is it different from "legal guardian.

" A: "legal representative" is a parent or other individual who is qualified under state law to consent to the immunization of a minor. It could include people other than the child's legal guardian. Using Vaccine Information Statements Q: How do we determine when a VIS must be given to a "legal representative" rather than to the patient. For example, if an 18-year old is considered a child, would it be illegal to give a VIS to him or her directly, as opposed to a parent or guardian. A: The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act does not define a "child" for purposes of the Act. "Legal representative" is defined as "a parent or an individual who qualifies as a legal guardian under State law. " A reasonable interpretation is that State law, and specifically the State's medical consent law, should be deferred to for purposes of defining who is a minor.

For example, if an 18 year old can consent to immunization under a State's law, that 18 year old is the person who should be provided a copy of the VIS. Q: How should we distribute VISs when the parent or legal representative of a minor is not present at the time the vaccination is given, for example during a school-based adolescent vaccination program. A: When parents/legal representatives are not present at the time of vaccination of a minor, several challenges arise related to provision of Vaccine Information Statements. Please see the questions and answers below for guidance on how to address these challenges: Q: How early can VISs be provided to parents/legal representatives prior to vaccination. A: The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requires that a current VIS be provided to parents/legal representatives. prior to vaccination.

Although the Act does not specify the amount of time allowed between VIS provision and vaccination, they must be provided as close to the time of vaccination as is programmatically feasible and reasonable, keeping in mind that VISs are designed to inform vaccine recipients about the risks and benefits of specific vaccines, as well as medical eligibility, prior to vaccine receipt. For example, providing VISs several weeks prior to a scheduled school-located vaccination clinic may be reasonable. However, providing VISs several months prior to vaccination is not acceptable as parents/legal representatives may not have retained the VISs to review just prior to vaccination, the VIS may have since been revised, and a student's medical eligibility may have changed during that time.

### Adolescent consent for human papillomavirus vaccine: ethical, legal, and practical considerations [^8deff9f8]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

We address ethical, legal, and practical issues related to adolescent self-consent for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. HPV vaccination coverage continues to lag well behind the national goal of 80% series completion. Structural and behavioral interventions have improved vaccination rates, but attitudinal, behavioral, and access barriers remain. A potential approach for increasing access and improving vaccination coverage would be to permit adolescents to consent to HPV vaccination for themselves. We argue that adolescent self-consent is ethical, but that there are legal hurdles to be overcome in many states. In jurisdictions where self-consent is legal, there can still be barriers due to lack of awareness of the policy among healthcare providers and adolescents. Other barriers to implementation of self-consent include resistance from antivaccine and parent rights activists, reluctance of providers to agree to vaccinate even when self-consent is legally supported, and threats to confidentiality. Confidentiality can be undermined when an adolescent's self-consented HPV vaccination appears in an explanation of benefits communication sent to a parent or if a parent accesses an adolescent's vaccination record via state immunization information systems. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a substantial drop in HPV vaccination, there may be even more reason to consider self-consent. The atmosphere of uncertainty and distrust surrounding future COVID-19 vaccines underscores the need for any vaccine policy change to be pursued with clear communication and consistent with ethical principles.

### Effect of a multicomponent HPV intervention on self-reported HPV vaccine uptake and intention among French adolescents and parents: results from the national, cluster-randomised prevHPV trial [^5262bcfb]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, a large proportion of baseline participants were lost to follow-up, which led to imbalances in certain variables, such as multilingualism, between intervention groups. This loss-to-follow-up may have induced selection bias. We have addressed this potential bias as much as possible in our regression models by adjusting for baseline vaccine propensity, and we do not anticipate that any residual bias impacted the direction of our results. However, this residual selection bias may have influenced the validity of the reported estimates in the event that participants were more likely to respond to the follow-up questionnaire if they had gotten vaccinated or experienced new intention to vaccinate between baseline and follow-up. Nonetheless, we do not anticipate such a trend to have been sufficiently extreme to produce a large bias in the analysis of the adolescent data, as the study was designed for them to complete the questionnaire during designated class time. A second implication of the loss to follow-up, along with the specific selection criteria of the study municipalities, is reduced generalisability to all middle schools in France. Rather, the present study results more likely reflect the results that would be seen in middle schools with leadership who are particularly interested in offering HPV vaccination and education and remained in the study despite the unique constraints of conducting the interventions during the 2021–2022 academic year. A similar issue with generalisability is recognisable in the parents' data, which is a small and highly motivated group. Despite these limitations, we believe it is important to present the parent data analysis as parents are important in the vaccine decision-making process for adolescents in France, particularly because two parents/legal guardians must provide consent for a minor to have any non-obligatory medical procedure (eg, HPV vaccination) in France. Another possible limitation was social desirability bias, which we attempted to reduce by using anonymous online questionnaires, and which should not affect our estimates under the assumption that the prevalence of social desirability bias did not significantly differ across our six (randomised) groups. Also, due to convergence issues in modelling the subgroup effects for the first outcome of this analysis, we ran crude effects models that did not adjust for baseline vaccine propensity, suggesting the possibility of confounding (due to collider bias on data observability; see online supplemental figure S1) in these subgroup estimates. Because this subgroup analysis was interested in observing heterogeneity of effect estimates (rather than exactness of estimates), any confounding would have to be differential by subgroup strata in order to bias our interpretation of the results. Moreover, because this specific subgroup analysis found primarily homogenous effects, we would expect that any differential confounding induced by our modelling approach biased our results towards a null (ie, homogenous) result. However, we do not anticipate that there was substantial differential confounding in this subgroup analysis, as the results are quite similar to those of the subgroup analysis for the second outcome, which did adjust for baseline vaccine propensity. Finally, the present analysis assumed homogeneity in questionnaire participants' dose of exposure to interventions per cluster and does not account for the variation in intervention fidelity and delivery among participating middle schools and GPs. Future analyses will model vaccine uptake and intention among adolescents, accounting for the varying levels of adherence to the intervention protocols and whether GPs in their municipality truly engaged in training.

### Efficacy of single-dose HPV vaccination among young African women [^a95efbad]. NEJM Evidence (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Trial design and Oversight

This randomized, multi-center, double-blind, parallel, three-arm controlled, superiority trial tested the efficacy of single-dose bivalent (HPV 16/18) and single-dose nonavalent (HPV 16/18/31/33/45/52/58/6/11) HPV vaccination, as described in the published protocol paper. Kenya's HPV National Immunization Program, launched in October 2019, offers two doses of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine to 9-10-year-old girls and is not provided through the National Immunization Program for persons aged 15 years and older; meningococcal vaccination is used during outbreaks. Meningococcal vaccination was chosen as the comparator because meningococcal antibodies offer potential clinical benefits and do not impact HPV outcomes. Participants were randomized to 1) immediate nonavalent HPV vaccination and delayed (36 months after enrollment) meningococcal vaccination, 2) immediate bivalent HPV vaccination and delayed meningococcal vaccination, or 3) immediate meningococcal vaccination and delayed HPV vaccination. The primary analysis was planned for month 18, with the final analysis at month 36 evaluating durability (not reported herein). At this time the trial is ongoing. After the 18 month results presented herein, we are continuing follow-up in a blinded cross-over design to evaluate vaccine durability.

The Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) Scientific and Ethics Review Unit (SERU) and the University of Washington (UW) Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the study. The study was registered with.

Participants

Participants were recruited through community outreach. Participants were eligible for randomization if they were able to provide informed consent, age 15 to 20 years old, female sex assigned at birth, sexually active reporting one to five lifetime partners, and resident within the study area. Study exclusion criteria were a positive HIV diagnostic test, history of HPV vaccination, allergies to vaccine components or latex, current pregnancy, hysterectomy, or history of immunosuppressive conditions.

Setting

The study was conducted at three KEMRI clinical sites in Thika, Nairobi, and Kisumu. All participants, and their parents/guardians in the case of minors, provided informed consent, which included counseling about randomization, risks and benefits of participation, study procedures, and their rights as research participants.

### Consent by proxy for nonurgent pediatric care [^4b3dc9ad]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Consent by proxy for nonurgent pediatric care — liability, legal awareness, and communication are emphasized as follows: When the care provided is done so in the best interest of the child, the liability risk is generally low, even without appropriate consent, though this risk is likely to be higher in situations that involve immunizations, language barriers, limited health literacy, and the initial visit. Medical practice is primarily regulated by the states, and it is essential that pediatricians are aware of the medical consent laws where they practice. Policies should be developed that promote good, informed decision-making and risk management, and care should be taken to make sure that such policies meet applicable laws without blocking access to necessary but nonurgent health care. Informed consent works best when efforts are made to help proxies understand the health information that is being conveyed to them, and developing a legally sound office policy on consent by proxy is essential for maintaining efficient office operations and strong physician-patient relationships.

### Consent by proxy for nonurgent pediatric care [^b935bb63]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Immunizations — consent communication notes that although some debate requiring informed consent for state-mandated services such as immunizations, it is clear that open dialogue about risk is at the crux of the national Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), and vaccine information statements (VISs) were created to meet the informational requirements of the VICP.

### Assessing the impact of a VI-polysaccharide conjugate vaccine in preventing typhoid infection among Bangladeshi children: a protocol for a phase IIIb trial [^af933d76]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Population

Children aged 9 months to < 16 years who are living in the defined catchment area in Mirpur, Dhaka, and who are in good health at the time of enrollment will be invited to take part. Households with children < 16 years of age will be identified and approached for participation by trial staff, including local community health volunteers. At least 32 500 eligible, consenting children/guardians within the target age range (9 months to < 16 years) residing in the target area at baseline will be vaccinated.

The participant must satisfy all of the following criteria to be eligible for enrollment:

Parent/guardian is willing and competent to provide informed consent. If the participant is 11 to < 16 years of age, informed assent will also be sought.
Participant is aged between 9 months and < 16 years at time of vaccination.
Participant is apparently healthy (no complaints of febrile illness) on the day of vaccination.
Parent/guardian confirms that their child will be willing and able to comply with study requirements, including follow-up contact, according to the schedule.
Participant and parent/guardian live within the study catchment area at the time of vaccination.

The participant will not be enrolled if any of the following criteria apply:

Participant has knowingly received a typhoid vaccine or JE in the last 3 years.
Participant has a known allergy to any of the vaccine components.
There are medical or social reasons that will prevent the participant from conforming to the study requirements, as judged by a medical professional.
Participant or parent/guardian is planning to move away from the catchment area within the next month.
Participant is pregnant at the time of vaccination, as confirmed by a urine test (urine pregnancy test will be done in girls who are married).

Participants will be temporarily excluded, and asked to return at a later date, if any of the following apply:

Participant received any other vaccine in the previous 30 days.
Participant has a current temperature of at least 38°C or a reported fever within 24 hours prior to vaccination.
Participant used antipyretics within 4 hours prior to vaccination.
Participant is a girl between the ages of ≥ 12 and < 16 years old whose first day of her last menstrual period was more than 28 days ago or who does not remember the date of her last menstruation at presentation.

### The initial reproductive health visit: ACOG committee opinion, number 811 [^3c37ab89]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Initial reproductive health visit — timing, scope, and components — should take place between the ages of 13 and 15 years, and the primary goal of the initial reproductive health visit is to provide preventive health care services, educational information, and guidance, in addition to problem-focused care. Obstetrician–gynecologists should assess a patient's human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination status, educate about the vaccine, and provide it, if appropriate, and can support the adolescent patients by reassuring them that their concerns will be addressed in a confidential setting, when possible, to help them begin to transition their health care away from the parent or guardian and to develop patient autonomy. If the patient is sexually active or considering becoming sexually active, the obstetrician–gynecologist should provide counseling on contraception options, including emergency contraception and long-acting reversible methods, and it is important to screen for physical and sexual abuse, eating disorders, anxiety, and depression; screening for risk-taking behaviors can be facilitated by using a questionnaire as an alternative to direct interviewing. Adolescents with intellectual disabilities also require reproductive health care, and depending on the degree of disability or developmental delay, the obstetrician–gynecologist may need to engage in an in-depth discussion with the parent or guardian regarding menstruation, fertility, hygiene, options for menstrual manipulation and contraception, and how to keep the patient safe.

### Strategies for improving vaccine communication and uptake [^6dccc99d]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric practice policies for dismissing vaccine-refusing families — dismissal can be an acceptable option after repeated attempts to address values and concerns fail, and when less drastic alternatives are not feasible, with steps to minimize potential negative impacts on the child; the consideration, design, and implementation of office policies for dismissal will ideally take into account practice setting, patient population, availability of other nearby, reputable sources of medical care for children, and the framing of the policy, with transparency and equitable application. Dismissal must be conducted in a manner consistent with state laws prohibiting abandonment, with official notification of the parents or legal guardian required, provision of information for finding a new physician, documentation of parental refusal and counseling attempts in the medical record, and an obligation to continue current treatment and provide emergency care for a reasonable period of time, usually 30 days. Opponents of dismissal policies advocate cultural humility, respectful exploration of value differences, and implementation of less drastic alternatives to dismissal policies; evidence that vaccine refusal is a modifiable behavior and that vaccine-hesitant parents can change their mind after conversations with their child's pediatrician supports this approach.

### COVID-19 vaccine trials with children: ethics pointers [^c4ef23ea]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Background

As the number of persons vaccinated against COVID-19 around the world increases and the number of approved vaccines for use among adults rises, there is growing recognition of the need to extend vaccination campaigns to children. Emergency use authorisation has already been provided by various national regulators to allow for the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines in children 12 years of age and older. Furthermore, vaccine trials involving younger children and testing different vaccines are underway in various countries. While most of these trials are currently conducted in high-income countries, it is likely — and necessary — that COVID-19 vaccine trials involving children will increasingly be extended to lower/middle-income countries (LMICs) in order to ensure that vaccines are effective in these different populations and contexts. In that case, ethics committees and policy makers will be faced with the review of trial proposals that not only raise potentially challenging ethical questions (as in all interventional studies with children), but where those questions are further complicated by a number of factors associated with the pandemic context in a low-resource setting. These include the urgency to act (which may add to the pressure experienced by those tasked with reviewing studies); a lack of clarity as to where future benefit from the studies may accrue (given current concerns about inequality of vaccine access); and, more broadly, the impact of inequalities in terms of scientific capacity and economic power which may skew the ability of some committees to provide independent reviews.

As members of the ethics working group of the COVID-19 Clinical Research Coalition (which brings together expertise in research ethics from across a wide range of LMICs), we are aware that ethics committees in LMICs do not all feel well-placed to review such trial proposals. Our goal in this paper is to share our insights and key recommendations for the elements of vaccine trial proposals that ethics committees should particularly scrutinise when reviewing such proposals. Below we set out some ethical questions and possible replies that researchers and ethics review committees might need to keep in mind before, during and after the implementation of phase III vaccine clinical trials with children. We use the term 'children' in this article to refer to persons who cannot legally give consent because of their age: this will commonly be those under the age of 18, although depending on jurisdiction this may vary from 16 to 21. Our concern is especially with children living in lower-income and middle-income settings.

### Health care issues for children and adolescents in foster care and kinship care [^b1ef4d9a]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Consent and confidentiality barriers in foster care — pediatricians are advised to familiarize themselves with the pertinent laws and regulations governing these issues in their own states and to consult with state and local authorities, including their legal teams, for clarification when needed. In many states, the birth parent/ legal guardian at the time of entry to care retains guardianship and, thus, the right to consent to treatment on behalf of the child, and in many states, the commissioner/ director of child welfare, or his or her designee, is the consenting party for children who are freed for adoption and residing in foster care, unless the court has designated a legal guardian; a court process is required to terminate parental rights or grant guardianship to another caregiver. Many agencies have parents/ guardians sign a general medical consent at or shortly after placement, which covers most routine care, whereas special situations, such as prescription of psychotropic medications, mental health evaluations, surgery, and chemotherapy, are not considered routine care in most states and would require separate specific informed consent. In most states, foster parents have physical custody of the child but do not have the legal authority to provide consent for health care, except where the court has granted consent rights or through guardianship, and those with guardianship should have a court-issued document indicating this. In situations in which the birth parent/guardian is uncooperative or unable to provide consent, the child welfare commissioner/ director or his or her designee has the authority to provide consent after diligent effort has been made to engage the parent/guardian; specific time frames and what constitutes diligent effort vary among states, and in some states, child welfare has to petition the courts for consent. A Vaccine Information Statement should be given to the adult who accompanies the child to the visit and a notation made in the child's medical records, and foster parents do not have the right to refuse immunizations for a child in foster care; use of blanket consents for immunizations may not satisfy the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program requirements for distributing the Vaccine Information Statement to the patient's legal representative before administering the vaccine. If a child in foster care presents with an emergency medical or mental health problem and no consenting party is available, the physician may render appropriate medical care without signed consent. Local health or child welfare authorities should be able to address applicable regulations and legislation regarding consent for HIV screening in the foster care population; some states address this issue on their HIV consent forms, and adolescents desiring confidential testing may be directed to confidential state HIV screening/testing sites in some states. Adolescents in foster care with capacity to consent may consent for reproductive health care, family planning, and specific other health concerns, including mental health, substance use and abortion, although laws and age of consent vary among states; youth 18 years and older with capacity to consent should be treated as adults. Some states have specific consent procedures related to the administration of psychotropic medications to children and adolescents in foster care, and some states require written informed consent before the administration of these medications to a child in foster care.

### Voluntary COVID-19 vaccination of children: a social responsibility [^0ee7d1cc]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2021). Medium credibility.

Nearly 400 million adults have been vaccinated against COVID-19. Children have been excluded from the vaccination programmes owing to their lower vulnerability to COVID-19 and to the special protections that apply to children's exposure to new biological products. WHO guidelines and national laws focus on medical safety in the process of vaccine approval, and on national security in the process of emergency authorisation. Because children suffer much from social distancing, it is argued that the harms from containment measures should be factored in a broader perspective on the good of the child. Considering the available knowledge on the disease, vaccine, and coping strategies, the decision about vaccine access to children is a public responsibility. The ultimate choice is a matter of paediatric informed consent. Moreover, jurisdictions that permit non-participation in established childhood vaccination programmes should also permit choice of vaccines outside of the approved programmes. Even if vaccine supply is too short to cover the paediatric population, the a priori exclusion of children is unjust. It may also exacerbate local and global inequalities. The second part of the paper delineates a prudent and ethical scheme for gradual incorporation of minors in vaccination programmes that includes a rigorous postvaccination monitoring. This is a theoretical paper in ethics that uses the Pfizer vaccine as a stock example, without discussing possible differences among existing vaccines. The key purpose is reflection on the good of the child in emergencies and vaccine policymaking.

### National vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years-national immunization survey-teen, United States, 2023 [^c2eb04aa]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

NIS-Teen is a random–digit-dialed mobile telephone survey conducted in the United States to monitor vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years. A household survey is administered to parents or guardians of eligible adolescents to collect information about the adolescent and the household, and to obtain consent to contact the adolescent's vaccination providers. Once consent is received, a mailed survey is sent to all vaccination providers identified by the parent or guardian to compile the adolescent's complete vaccination record.

The 2023 NIS-Teen vaccination coverage estimates were derived from provider-reported data for 16,658 adolescents aged 13–17 years †† who were born during January 2005–December 2010. §§ The household response rate was 24.4%, and 39.5% of adolescents with completed interviews had adequate provider data. * Cross-sectional analysis was used to estimate vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years in the 2023 survey year compared with the 2022 survey year. Using methodology established in 2021 and 2022 NIS-Teen reports, vaccination coverage by birth year was assessed using combined 2015–2023 NIS-Teen data. To assess coverage trends before and after the COVID-19 pandemic began, the 2007–2010 birth years were compared by age using the 2007 birth year as the reference group, because this was the last birth year that consisted of adolescents whose routine vaccinations were not affected by health care disruptions during the pandemic. To assess coverage trends by VFC eligibility, the 2002–2010 birth years were evaluated. Kaplan-Meier techniques were used to account for censoring of vaccination status at age ≥ 13 years. ††† Z-tests were used to compare differences in vaccination coverage by survey year, birth year, and eligibility for the VFC program; differences with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data were weighted §§§ and analyses were conducted using SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 11; RTI International). This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.

### Immunogenicity and safety of an inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine candidate: a phase III randomized controlled trial in children [^dd9db4ba]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Study Procedures

Following the consent process, study staff determined treatment allocation using an Internet-based central randomization system. The randomization sequence was generated using MATEX, a software program developed for use in SAS (Cary, NC) by GlaxoSmithKline (Rixensart, Belgium). Randomization was stratified equally between groups by age (3–8 years and 9–17 years). A minimization procedure accounted for previous receipt of influenza vaccine ("priming" status), country, and age subgroups (3–4 years and 5–8 years). Neither the parents/guardians, participants, or study staff were aware of treatment allocation for participants ≥ 3 years of age. In the open-label study, parents/guardians and study staff were not blinded.

Prior to the first vaccination, a brief history-directed physical examination was performed and blood drawn. Children who were ≥ 9 years of age or had prior receipt of ≥ 2 doses of an influenza vaccine at least 1 month apart were considered "primed". Primed children received one 0.5 mL dose of study vaccine on day 0 and had blood collected on day 28 (visit 2). Unprimed participants received a second 0.5 mL dose of vaccine on day 28, and had blood collected on day 56. Vaccines were administered intramuscularly in the anterolateral region of the left thigh (age 6–11 months) or deltoid region of the left arm (age ≥ 12 months). Children were observed at the study site for 30 minutes after administration of study vaccine.

Parents/guardians were instructed on the use of a diary card for recording any solicited injection site or general adverse events (AEs) for 7 days, and any unsolicited AEs for 28 days, and to bring the diary to study visits. Parents/guardians of children < 5 years of age were asked to contact study staff immediately if a seizure or fever ≥ 39°C occurred within 2 days of vaccination. On day 180, parents/guardians were asked if changes in health or AEs had occurred since the last vaccination.

Participant flow is shown in Figure 1.

### The promise of the human papillomavirus vaccine does not confer immunity against ethical reflection [^67cd7c5b]. The Oncologist (2006). Low credibility.

The recent announcement of an experimental vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV) has raised great hopes and expectations. Promising trial results, however, should not obscure ethical issues related to a vaccine's ultimate dissemination. Although lay media might view an HPV vaccine as a panacea, a more complicated ethical reality exists, touching upon public knowledge, health care disparities, and parental consent for childhood vaccination.

### Confidentiality in the care of adolescents: technical report [^da942ff9]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Confidentiality in the care of adolescents — foundational concepts and legal context define adolescent age ranges and specify when minors may control protected health information (PHI) under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The American Academy of Pediatrics Bright Futures defines adolescents as 11 to 21 years, and for this report minor adolescence is from 13 years until the 18th birthday; most state-law confidentiality provisions do not apply below age 13 and the age of majority is accepted to be 18 years in most jurisdictions. Federal protections include the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the Title X Family Planning Program, and confidentiality regulations for substance use disorder programs (42 CFR Part 2); state laws may provide more, but not less, protection, and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the 21st Century Cures Act also affect adolescent health information. Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, adults, legally emancipated minors, and minors considered "individuals" can control access to their health records in most circumstances; minors are considered individuals when (1) a parent or guardian agrees to a confidential relationship with a health care professional, (2) the minor obtains care without parental consent and the minor, court, or another authorized person consents, or (3) the minor independently consents for care as allowed by law. Parents' access depends on whether other applicable law requires or prohibits disclosure, grants discretion to the health care professional, or is silent, and clinicians may exercise medical judgment and act in the best interests of the patient within these laws. States can provide more protective rules but must at least ensure the minimum protections required by the Privacy Rule. The right to confidentiality is not absolute, and health care professionals must know what may or may not be disclosed and convey those limits to patients and to parents or guardians.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^526daeaa]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Considerations for treatment implementation — importance of informed consent emphasizes that the panel "encourages all clinicians to provide informed consent to patients", and that "psychologists should obtain an informed consent from the patient prior to implementing psychological services". Informed consent requires clinicians to "inform clients/patients as early as is feasible in the therapeutic relationship about the nature and anticipated course of therapy, fees, involvement of third parties, and limits of confidentiality and provide sufficient opportunity for the client/patient to ask questions and receive answers", and the Code of Ethics notes it "should include information about any known diagnosis; why particular interventions are recommended and what is involved in these interventions; and benefits, harms, and burdens of possible interventions including those for choosing to receive no treatment", thereby allowing patients "to make an informed decision of whether to initiate or continue treatment", and satisfying "the General Principles of Beneficence and Nonmaleficence". For minors, "the provider should convey the same information to the parent/guardian who must provide consent for treatment" and also to "adolescents who must assent to treatment", and "for children, it also would be helpful to convey some of the information… in an age-appropriate manner".

### Spatial analyses of oral polio vaccine transmission in an community vaccinated with inactivated polio vaccine [^282a74cb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

METHODS

Study Design

The study has already been described in detail elsewhere but, in brief, this was a prospective, cluster-randomized trial in 3 indigenous localities in Orizaba, Veracruz, Mexico (Capoluca, Campo Grande, and Tuxpanguillo). Within each community, approximately 150 households were enrolled in this study, and each community cluster received a different amount of OPV coverage as part of the study: 70% of enrolled households in Capoluca, 30% in Campo Grande, and 10% in Tuxpanguillo. When enrollment began in February 2015, 155 households were randomized to receive OPV out of 466 households included across the 3 localities. No other households in any of the 3 communities received OPV until the May 2015 NHW. Only 1 child from each of the 155 households received OPV. Inclusion criteria for household enrollment was the presence of a child < 5 years old who had an up-to-date IPV vaccination record and was eligible to receive OPV. All adult participants consented to participation, and the guardians of minors consented for minors to participate. Exclusion criteria for children < 5 included presentation with illness (febrile, diarrhea, or respiratory); an immunodeficiency caused by AIDS, disease, or medication; a recent blood transfusion; and prior adverse reactions to OPV. Exclusion criteria for all other participants was refusal to participate or a change in residence during the study period. Within our study population, global positioning system (GPS) coordinates were collected from 423 households: 137 of the vaccinated households and 286 unvaccinated households. As a result, only the shedding and transmission results from these participants were considered in this analysis.

### Parent-son decision-making about human papillomavirus vaccination: a qualitative analysis [^10f37604]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

Sample

Adolescent males, 13–17 years of age, and their parents or guardians (referred to as parents) were recruited from adolescent primary care clinics serving primarily lower income families in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S. This age range was chosen because parental consent in Indiana is required for all vaccines for individuals under 18 years of age. Participants could not have received any HPV vaccine prior to the current health care visit and had to be accompanied by a parent or guardian. Otherwise eligible participants were excluded if a sibling already participated in the study. Both male and female parents were eligible to participate. A total of 23 parent-son dyads were approached for participation in the study. Two dyads refused participation, both due to time constraints. Therefore, a total of 21 dyads (42 interviews) participated in this study. This study was approved by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board.

All providers in these clinics routinely recommended the HPV vaccine to their eligible male patients, even prior to the revised ACIP recommendation. Lack of provider recommendation is a known barrier to vaccination, therefore, this design allows us to control for provider recommendation, and focus, instead, on the parent-son decision-making process.

Procedures

During the clinic visit, prospective participants were seen by their provider and offered any ACIP-indicated vaccines as part of routine clinical care, including HPV vaccine. All study interviews occurred after the provider had finished and the parent-son dyad had either agreed or refused HPV vaccination. The research team approached the dyad immediately after the clinic visit, explained the study, and obtained parental consent and adolescent assent to participation. The parent-son dyad was then separated for simultaneous 30–60 minute interviews conducted in separate rooms with separate interviewers.

### Willingness of children and adolescents to have a COVID-19 vaccination: results of a large whole schools survey in england [^b97c3310]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

We will focus the discussion on resource, ethical and policy implications of COVID-19 vaccination for adolescents. Adolescents are an important population group with currently 1.2 billion 10–19 years olds globally, the highest proportions are living in lower resource settings. Addressing adolescent COVID-19 vaccination must reflect resource implications as well as issues of equity, justice and prioritisation of certain population groups, especially given vaccination distribution and acceptance in lower resource settings. Whether adolescents in higher resource settings should have access to the vaccination before more vulnerable groups elsewhere remains a high priority to consider. Nevertheless, as vaccination availability increases, questions remain about the relative benefit of providing COVID-19 vaccinations for adolescents.

We found that the majority of older school-aged students would opt-in to having a COVID-19 vaccination. There is, therefore, likely to be increasing prominence to the question of adolescent self-consent as at present for those under the age of 18 in many countries (under age 16 in a minority of countries including the UK, USA and Australia) parental knowledge and/or explicit consent is required. In England and Wales, the standard of Gillick competence is used to determine if a child is able to give legally effective consent. For an adolescent to be able to consent for COVID-19 vaccination, they need to be able to understand the reason for why the vaccination has been recommended- for which a broad explanation including that it would be to protect them and others from catching an unpleasant disease is required. Secondly, they would need to understand in broad terms the nature of the procedure, for example that it would involve an injection into their arm which might result in pain at the injection site. Furthermore, it is required that health care professionals inform recipients of the risks that 'a reasonable patient would want to know' -known as the material riskwhich does not require the disclosure of all risks of the vaccination but only those where harm is highly likely to occur or where there is a non-negligible risk of a serious harm.

### COVID-19 vaccines: a look at the ethics of the clinical research involving children [^5512c7ca]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Currently, millions of minors are being inoculated against SARS-CoV-2 in many countries in the world. Ethical concerns about clinical research involving children have barely been addressed in the literature, despite the fact that the paediatric population is particularly vulnerable within this context. Children should be included in the research plans for COVID-19 vaccines. Nevertheless, it is necessary to critically assess to what extent clinical trials are being conducted according to methodological and ethical criteria that allow us to conclude that the results are valid and, in consequence, how far the vaccination plans for children are scientifically justified. The principal aim of this article is to analyse critically the process of clinical research on COVID-19 vaccines involving children, highlighting the ethical concerns that arise, including the need to stratify the results from older adolescents separately for analysis before proceeding, if further research is warranted, in descending age order. The development of COVID-19 vaccines is examined, with a special look at the participation of children throughout their clinical development, including a review of the clinical trials registered in three international databases. We also offer some additional considerations about the inclusion of minors in vaccination plans. Finally, we conclude with some recommendations, with particular emphasis on the following ethical duties: research in children should be carried out only once the relevant research in adults has previously been conducted; issues that concern children's needs and rights should be specifically addressed; and, therefore, the highest standards of ethical and scientific quality should be met.

### Recommendation by a law body to ban infant male circumcision has serious worldwide implications for pediatric practice and human rights [^1bee5fe8]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Ethics and human rights

Parents can legally authorize surgical procedures in the best interests of their children. The AAP policy asserts that, " As a general rule, minors in the United States are not considered competent to provide legally binding consent regarding their health care, and parents or guardians are empowered to make health care decisions on their behalf. In most situations, parents are granted wide latitude in terms of the decisions they make on behalf of their children, and the law has respected those decisions except where they are clearly contrary to the best interests of the child or place the child ' s health, well - being, or life at significant risk of serious harm ". Likewise consideration of internationally recognized rights of children results in a similar conclusion. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) 44/25 20 November 1989 held at Article 14 (2), " States Parties shall respect the rights and duties of the parents and, when applicable legal guardians, to provide direction to the child in the exercise of his or her right in a matter consistent with the evolving capacities of the child ". Clearly for infants with no effective capacity, decisions are entirely the duty of the parents. Of course exceptions include failing to act in the interests of children or situations where a medical procedure or withholding a medical procedure causes serious harm. A recent critical analysis of the Australian government's rationale for its vaccination policy argued that, " vaccine choice [is] a human rights issue ". Vaccination is a minor medical procedure and is one that most parents choose for their children. Since the benefits of this intervention outweigh the risks and similarly failure to circumcise boys in a population will create a risk for future sexual partners, the vaccination of minors would appear to us to be analogous to the issue of the circumcision of boys. While a century ago US constitutional law has upheld the " police power of the state " in relation to compulsory vaccination, in democratic societies today neither vaccination nor childhood male circumcision are ever likely to be made compulsory.

### National, regional, state, and selected local area vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years-United States, 2019 [^ba5df289]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

NIS-Teen is a random-digit-dial telephone survey conducted annually to monitor vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, selected local areas, and selected U.S. territories. †† Sociodemographic information is collected during the telephone interview with a parent or guardian, and a request is made for consent to contact the adolescent's vaccination provider(s). If consent is obtained, a questionnaire is mailed to the vaccination provider(s) to request the adolescent's vaccination history. Vaccination coverage estimates are determined from these provider-reported immunization records. This report provides vaccination coverage estimates on 18,788 adolescents aged 13–17 years. §§ The overall Council of American Survey Research Organizations (CASRO) response rate was 19.7%, and 44.0% of adolescents for whom household interviews were completed had adequate provider data.

Data were weighted and analyzed to account for the complex sampling design. * T-tests were used to assess vaccination coverage differences between sociodemographic subgroups. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 11; RTI International).

### Hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant) (Engerix-B) [^e234b670]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Information for the Patient:

Patients, parents, or guardians should be informed of the potential benefits and risks of the vaccine, and of the importance of completing the immunization series. As with any vaccine, it is important when a subject returns for the next dose in a series that he or she be questioned concerning occurrence of any symptoms and/or signs of an adverse reaction after a previous dose of the same vaccine. Patients, parents, or guardians should be told to report severe or unusual adverse reactions to their healthcare provider.

The parent or guardian should be given the Vaccine Information Materials, which are required by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 to be given prior to immunization.

Drug Interactions:

For information regarding simultaneous administration with other vaccines, refer to INDICATIONS AND USAGE.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:

ENGERIX-B has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or for impairment of fertility.

Pregnancy:

Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with ENGERIX-B. It is also not known whether ENGERIX-B can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. ENGERIX-B should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

Nursing Mothers:

It is not known whether ENGERIX-B is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when ENGERIX-B is administered to a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use:

ENGERIX-B has been shown to be well tolerated and highly immunogenic in infants and children of all ages. Newborns also respond well; maternally transferred antibodies do not interfere with the active immune response to the vaccine. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY for seroconversion rates and titers in neonates and children. See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for recommended pediatric dosage and for recommended dosage for infants born of HBsAg - positive mothers.)

Geriatric Use:

Clinical studies of ENGERIX-B did not include sufficient numbers of subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reports from the clinical literature indicate that hepatitis B vaccines are less immunogenic in adults 65 years of age and older than in younger individuals. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in overall safety between these subjects and younger adult subjects.

### National vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years-national immunization survey-teen, United States, 2021 [^0d034fcf]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

NIS-Teen is an annual random-digit–dialed telephone survey that estimates vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, selected local areas, and some U.S. territories. ** Parents and guardians of age-eligible adolescents are interviewed about household sociodemographic characteristics and are asked for permission to contact the adolescent's vaccination providers. Immunization history questionnaires are mailed to vaccination providers with the permission of the parent or guardian to obtain the adolescent's vaccination record. Vaccination coverage estimates are based on provider-reported vaccination histories and include any vaccines administered before the 2021 NIS-Teen interview date. This report presents vaccination coverage estimates for 18,002 adolescents aged 13–17 years. ††† The overall Council of American Survey Research Organizations response rate §§§ was 21.0%; 41.2% of adolescents with completed interviews had adequate provider data. Data were weighted and analyzed to account for the complex survey design. T-tests were used to compare differences in vaccination coverage by survey year (2021 versus 2020) and among sociodemographic groups; differences with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The cumulative percentage of adolescents vaccinated by single year of age milestones was assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates to account for censoring of vaccination status at ages ≥ 14 years, stratified by annual birth cohort (2002–2008). To assess potential COVID-19 pandemic effects for ≥ 1 HPV vaccine, ≥ 1 MenACWY, and ≥ 1 Tdap dose, vaccination coverage by age 12 years was compared for children born in 2008 (i.e. those who reached age 12 years in 2020, during the pandemic) to those born in 2007 (i.e. those who reached age 12 years in 2019, before the pandemic); vaccination coverage by age 13 years was compared for adolescents born in 2007 and 2008 (those who reached age 13 years in 2020 and 2021, respectively) to those born in 2006 (those who reached age 13 years in 2019). Analyses were conducted using SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 11; RTI International). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. **

### COVID-19 vaccine trials with children: ethics pointers [^7ab241ba]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Some ethics Q&A when implementing COVID-19 vaccine trials with children

Guidelines and normative documents on vaccine clinical trials with children in many countries and regions were written before the COVID-19 outbreak. The scale of the threat posed by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, however, cutting across borders, age groups, race, socioeconomic situation, gender and sexual orientation, is unprecedented. There is an urgent need to immunise as many people as possible and as quickly as possible. Yet, there is an equally important need to avoid exposing people to excessive risks, especially children. Moreover in some countries, as some vaccines are undergoing clinical trials involving children, other vaccines have already been approved for use among adults and some minors. In other countries, mostly LMICs, vaccines are yet to be made available even for vulnerable and adult populations. These differences and the impellent need to vaccinate populations generate novel ethical questions that were not at the fore prior to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some jurisdictions, for example, the US Food and Drug Administration, offer updated guidelines on COVID-19 clinical trials involving children. Many are yet to do so; thus, it is in this vein that as members of the Ethics Working Group of the COVID-19 Research Coalition we offer some ethical 'things to think about' as researchers and IRBs embark on or follow through with COVID-19 clinical trials involving children.

### Parental perceptions of Tennessee's mature minor doctrine [^23e7597b]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Mature minor doctrines (MMDs) permit adolescent consent for medical services in some states. Tennessee's longstanding MMD was challenged during the COVID-19 pandemic by state lawmakers concerned for children obtaining COVID-19 vaccines against parental wishes. Tennessee's 2023 Mature Minor Clarification Act (MMCA) was passed in response, counteracting the MMD and requiring parental consent for childhood vaccines and written consent for COVID-19 vaccines, fueling concern for childhood vaccination rates.

Although most US individuals believe childhood vaccines are safe, those considering them extremely or very important decreased 25 percentage points between 2001 and 2024, and support of school vaccine requirements has decreased since 2019, a possible response to increasing opposition of government mandates. Whether MMCA reflects parental opinion is unclear. We used a randomized survey experiment to evaluate whether framing questions about MMD was associated with parental opinions of adolescent consent for medical services overall and for specific care types.

Methods

Survey Methodology

NIS-Teen is an annual two-phase survey that monitors vaccination coverage in the United States among adolescents aged 13–17 years. The first phase is a random-digit–dialed mobile telephone survey of parents or guardians (parents) in households with eligible adolescents aged 13–17 years. The NIS-Teen mobile telephone sample is designed to meet target precision requirements using flagged telephone numbers from the NIS-Child sample and excludes telephone numbers in the National Immunization Survey do-not-call list. At the end of the household survey, permission is requested to contact the adolescent's vaccination providers. The second phase of NIS-Teen is a mailed survey to the adolescent's vaccination providers identified by the parent or guardian (parent) to obtain the adolescent's vaccination history. NIS-Teen contacts all vaccination providers identified by the parent, including medical offices, health departments, pharmacies, and any other locations where the adolescent might have received vaccinations.

### Exploration and ethical analysis of open-label pediatric vaccine trials in a pandemic [^dd892219]. Clinical Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Young children will ultimately need to be vaccinated to stop the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Initial studies of vaccine were performed in adults. Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard. In the COVID-19 pandemic, many questions need to be answered about the ethics and feasibility of these trials. Given the harms of the COVID-19 pandemic and the now-known efficacy of the vaccines in adults and teens, the question of whether clinical equipoise exists for a placebo-controlled trial of vaccines in younger children remains. Parents may be reluctant to enroll children in these trials because they want their child to receive the vaccine or because they are worried about vaccines or clinical trials in general. One option for gathering data on tolerability and efficacy in children would be to use a nonrandomized trial to enroll parents willing to vaccinate their children and those who are hesitant. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of such an open-label trial that could provide guidance for future pandemics. (Clin Ther.

### Could poor parental recall of HPV vaccination contribute to low vaccination rates? [^e39b6558]. Clinical Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rates of initiation and completion of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine series remain below national goals. Because parents are responsible for ensuring vaccination of their children, we examined the accuracy of parental recall of the number of shots their daughters received.

Methods

Parents/guardians of girls aged 11 to 17 years were asked to recall the number of HPV doses received by their daughters. Dose number was confirmed using provider-verified medical records. Logistic regression assessed variables associated with correct recall.

Results

A total of 79 (63%) parents/guardians correctly identified the number of shots their daughters received. Ninety-one (73%) were aware of whether their daughter started the series at all. The only factor significantly associated with accurate recall in logistic regression models was female gender of parent/guardian.

Conclusion

Nearly 40% of parents/guardians inaccurately recalled the number of HPV shots their children received, which may contribute to low rates of vaccine initiation and completion.

### Confidentiality in adolescent health care: ACOG committee opinion, number 803 [^d51a8aae]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Legal principles and definitions of adolescents' rights to receive health care independently — mature minor is defined as an adolescent younger than the age of majority who, even if living at home as a dependent, demonstrates the cognitive maturity to give informed consent, with capacity influenced by developmental maturity, previous experience with illness, the gravity of the current illness, and the risks of proposed therapy, and the right of a mature minor to consent to medical care without previous parental or guardian consent has been recognized in many states. Emancipation is described as a legal procedure whereby minors become legally responsible for themselves and their parents or guardians are no longer responsible, the minor can consent to medical, dental, or psychiatric care, and statutes vary by state but minors may become emancipated when they marry, serve in active duty in the U.S. military, or obtain a declaration from the court. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, the privacy rule provides protection against parents' or guardians' access to protected health information for the following circumstances: adolescents aged 18 years and older; emancipated minors; minors who can legally consent to services or receive services without parental or guardian consent or notification according to state or other applicable law; or when a parent or guardian assents to an agreement of confidentiality between the minor adolescent and health care provider.

Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 2019 human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — For children and adults aged 9–26 y, HPV vaccination is routinely recommended at age 11 or 12 y; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 y, and vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 y who are not adequately vaccinated. For adults aged > 26 y, catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all adults aged > 26 y; instead, shared clinical decision making regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for some adults aged 27–45 y who are not adequately vaccinated, and HPV vaccines are not licensed for use in adults aged > 45 y. Administration guidance states that dosing schedules, intervals, and definitions of persons considered adequately vaccinated have not changed and that no prevaccination testing (eg, Pap or HPV testing) is recommended to establish the appropriateness of HPV vaccination. Cervical cancer screening guidelines and recommendations should be followed. These recommendations for children and adults aged 9–26 y and for adults aged > 26 y apply to all persons, regardless of behavioral or medical risk factors; for persons who are pregnant, HPV vaccination should be delayed until after pregnancy, however, pregnancy testing is not needed before vaccination, and persons who are breastfeeding or lactating can receive HPV vaccine.

Background — before providing nonurgent medical care to a minor patient not accompanied by a legally authorized representative (LAR), the report states that important questions regarding informed consent and the delegation of parental responsibilities need to be asked and answered. These include who has a legal right to delegate consent to health care decisions for a child, to whom the power to consent to health care for a child can be delegated, in what circumstances the power to consent to health care for a child can be delegated, and what the limitations are on the right to delegate the power to consent to health care for a child.

### COVID-19 trial enrollment for those who cannot consent: ethical challenges posed by a pandemic [^ff71d73d]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has triggered an intense global research effort to inform the life-saving work of frontline clinicians who need reliable information as soon as possible. Yet research done in pressured circumstances can lead to ethical dilemmas, especially for vulnerable research subjects. We present the case of a child with neurocognitive impairment who is diagnosed with COVID-19 infection after presenting with fever and a seizure. The child lives in a group home and is in the custody of the state; her parents lost parental rights many years ago. Some members of the health care team want to enroll her in a randomized clinical trial evaluating an experimental treatment of COVID-19. For minor patients to enroll in this clinical trial, the institutional review board requires assent of patients and consent of guardians. An ethics consult is called to help identify relevant concerns in enrollment. In the accompanying case discussion, we address historical perspectives on research involving people with disabilities; proper management of research participation for people with disabilities including consent by proxy, therapeutic misconception, and other threats to the ethical validity of clinical trials; and the potentially conflicting obligations of researchers and clinicians.

Third, the level of risk to participants in the placebo group must be justified by the social value of the research. Because the placebo itself carries few risks, the key issue is whether participants are denied a vaccine to which they are otherwise entitled (ie, the de jure standard of care). If so, their lack of protection is the relevant research-related risk that requires ethical scrutiny. There is agreement that the risks from receiving placebo should be minimized, for example, through promptly providing care for participants who become infected. However, once minimized, what level of risk is justifiable remains contested. The Council for International Organizations of the Medical Sciences indicates participants should be exposed to no more than a minor increase over minimal risk. Yet this approach is more restrictive than for research interventions other than placebo, because competent adults can normally consent to higher risks provided the risks are justified by the social value of the research. Accordingly, a World Health Organization panel applied this standard approach to risk/benefit evaluations, determining that the risks of receiving placebo should be justified by the trial's social value. Consistent with the first 2 conditions of acceptable placebo use that we mention above, social value in this case depends on the value of the knowledge produced by the research for improving health, including whether the research has a compelling scientific rationale and is responsive to local health priorities.

Implementing Ethical Guidance for COVID-19 Vaccine Trials

There is an emerging agreement based on these criteria that placebo-controlled COVID-19 vaccine trials could be ethically acceptable depending on the circumstances. The scientific goal of these trials would be to demonstrate sufficient efficacy and safety to warrant approval, even if the candidate vaccine were somewhat less effective than those already authorized. Although a noninferiority design could theoretically produce needed data, comparing a candidate vaccine to an already authorized one poses logistical, methodological, and interpretative challenges. A placebo-controlled trial would therefore be preferable for scientific reasons — and as long as the de jure standard of care is no vaccination, participants in the placebo arm would be exposed to limited research-related risks (eg, from the placebo injection or study-related blood draws). However, the justification for such a placebo-controlled trial could diminish rapidly if already-authorized or new vaccines become more accessible or implementable. For example, with the authorization of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, placebo use might not be justified if manufacturing capacity is rapidly scaled up to meet global need.

### The status and challenges of HPV vaccine programme in China: an exploration of the related policy obstacles [^a3dd4d55]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Disparities in public perceptions of the HPV vaccine

As a class II vaccine with a commercial character, the HPV vaccine is available in China; however, the decision to receive the vaccine ultimately rests on the individual's volition. According to recent studies, the acceptance rate of the HPV vaccine among mainland Chinese individuals varies widely, ranging from 35% to 90%. This broad range suggests that there may be significant differences in attitudes and beliefs about the vaccine, and underscores the importance of understanding the factors that influence vaccine uptake in this population.

Given that the recommended age for HPV vaccination falls within the category of minors, obtaining parental consent in addition to the individual's permission is necessary. In traditional Chinese parent–child families, where parents make most of the decisions, parental attitudes and understanding are crucial. Nevertheless, various studies have revealed that most Chinese parents exhibit vaccine hesitancy, primarily due to a lack of confidence and accessibility to vaccines. The lack of confidence in vaccines is exemplified by questions regarding safety and efficacy. Due to limited availability of the HPV vaccine in China, numerous parents hold the view that there is insufficient evidence to verify its effectiveness and safety without side effects. Furthermore, previous incidents of vaccine safety issues in China, such as the Changchun Changsheng Biotechnology Company's rabies vaccine falsification scandal in 2018, have significantly diminished public trust, resulting in lower vaccination rates and an increase in vaccine hesitancy. The lack of accessibility is apparent from the fact that, apart from the 15 pilot cities where HPV vaccination is free for school-age adolescents, parents are required to pay for their children to receive the HPV vaccine. Although parental acceptance of the HPV vaccine is relatively high, when it comes to self-payment, only 56% of parents accept the price of < US$140. Therefore, in addressing parental vaccine hesitancy, Chinese public health authorities must prioritise increasing public trust in the HPV vaccine and finding ways to make it more affordable.

### COVID-19 vaccine trials with children: ethics pointers [^27013fcf]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

The CIOMS Ethical Guidelines (2016, Guideline 17) recommend that 'children and adolescents must be included in health-related research unless a good scientific reason justifies their exclusion', while emphasising the importance of minimising risks and, where relevant, waiting first for data from adult trials. A more restrictive position is presented, for instance, by the national South African Health Research Ethics guidelines, which propose that research should involve children only if the research cannot equally be conducted with adults, if the outcome of the research is directly relevant for children, and if the risk is reasonable — and preferably, minimal. Importantly, these and other guidelines suggest that since children in general are less able than adults to protect their own interests, additional safeguards are needed to ensure they are not exploited.

### Adolescents and consent to treatment [^def429b5]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2005). Low credibility.

Adolescents, defined by WHO as 10 to 19 years old, can give independent consent for reproductive health services if their capacities for understanding have sufficiently evolved. The international Convention on the Rights of the Child, almost universally ratified, limits parental powers, and duties, by adolescents' "evolving capacities" for self-determination. Legal systems may recognize "mature minors" as enjoying adult rights of medical consent, even when consent to sexual relations does not absolve partners of criminal liability; their consent does not make the adolescents offenders. There is usually no chronological "age of consent" for medical care, but a condition of consent, meaning capacity for understanding. Like adults, mature minors enjoy confidentiality and the right to treatment according to their wishes rather than their best interests. Minors incapable of self-determination may grant or deny assent to treatment for which guardians provide consent. Emancipated minors' self-determination may also be recognized, for instance on marriage or default of adults' guardianship.

### COVID-19 vaccine trials with children: ethics pointers [^62c1b181]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Should vaccines that have not been approved for use among adults be approved for use in trials with children?

In order to minimise the risks to which children are exposed, normal practice is to commence trials with children only when a vaccine has already been shown to be safe and effective in adults. This would suggest that only those vaccines that have been approved for use in adults should be used in trials involving children. However, this requirement could constitute a long delay which could hinder global efforts to curb the pandemic — and might thus delay important benefits for children. Moreover, there are vaccines that are intended to be used only in the paediatric population.

The case of novel candidate vaccines that have not yet received approval for use among adults, or for which trials among adults are still ongoing, requires a different ethical evaluation. The challenge here is to weigh the risks posed to child participants in starting trials before more certain data are available from adult trials (thus, eg, potentially including children in trials of ultimately unsuccessful vaccine candidates), and the risks of delaying too long (thereby exposing more children to the direct and indirect harms of COVID-19 discussed earlier in this article). In order to achieve this difficult balancing of risk and prospect of benefit, ethics committees may need to liaise with regulatory authorities, in order to access the appropriate technical expertise. Some experts advise, as part of this fine balancing of risk, that trials should commence with older children first as they are most similar to adults — again this will be a judgement about relative risks of early action versus delay, based on evolving knowledge of the risks of COVID-19 to younger children.

### When understanding fails: how diverging norms in medicine and research led to informed consent failures during the pandemic [^049ae88d]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were many vaccine trials which had significant purposes which participants needed to understand to validly consent. For example, participants needed to understand that the purpose of dose-escalation vaccine trials was to give incremental doses of a vaccine until participants became ill. Likewise, participants needed to understand that even if they received placebos, they could not take a genuine vaccine to preserve the integrity of the trials. Yet, these intuitive judgements about what participants need to understand to validly consent are rejected by recent accounts of consent. According to these accounts, as long as participants were given a good opportunity to learn these purposes, they do not need to actually understand them to consent. In this paper, I reject this consensus, and I argue that participants who failed to understand these aims associated with vaccine trials failed to provide legitimate consent. I defend this claim by developing and defending a new understanding condition for valid consent. According to this understanding condition, a participant must understand when a consent transaction has features which violate the norms which govern the medical practice with which they are acquainted. I argue that this condition is independently plausible and best explains why participants needed to understand these aims associated with vaccine trials to validly consent.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^dbc9f0d9]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to prevent new HPV infections and HPV-associated diseases, including some cancers. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)* routinely recommends HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years. Catch-up vaccination has been recommended since 2006 for females through age 26 years, and since 2011 for males through age 21 years and certain special populations through age 26 years. This report updates ACIP catch-up HPV vaccination recommendations and guidance published in 2014, 2015, and 2016 (1–3). Routine recommendations for vaccination of adolescents have not changed. In June 2019, ACIP recommended catch-up HPV vaccination for all persons through age 26 years. ACIP did not recommend catch-up vaccination for all adults aged 27 through 45 years, but recognized that some persons who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range; therefore, ACIP recommended shared clinical decision-making regarding potential HPV vaccination for these persons.

### Off-label prescription of COVID-19 vaccines in children: clinical, ethical, and legal issues [^2a22f91f]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the biologics license application for the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine (Comirnaty) on August 23, 2021, opened the door to the off-label vaccination of children younger than the age range currently covered by either the biologics license application (16 years old and older) or the emergency use authorization (12 to 15 years old). Although prescribing medications at doses, for conditions, or in populations other than those approved by the FDA is generally legal and is common in pediatrics, the FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Academy of Pediatrics have recommended against off-label prescription of the coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine. Several commentaries consider a case in which parents ask their child's pediatrician to prescribe the vaccine for their 11-year-old with special health care needs before approval or authorization in her age group. The first commentary considers the potential benefits and risks to the patient, as well as to the family, the provider, and society, emphasizing the unknown risks in younger patients and the need for adequate informed consent. The second commentary describes an algorithm and principles for evaluating off-label prescribing and argues that the current benefits of prescribing Comirnaty off label to children < 12 do not outweigh the risks. The third commentary addresses ethical and legal issues, ultimately calling on federal agencies to remove legal barriers to making the vaccine available to children in age groups that currently lack authorization.

### Long-term effectiveness of one and two doses of a killed, bivalent, whole-cell oral cholera vaccine in Haiti: an extended case-control study [^67e3d8dc]. The Lancet: Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Data completeness was high for covariate data. Therefore, primary analyses were restricted to cases and controls that had complete information on all covariates. We did sensitivity analyses in which we altered the presumed dates of vaccination (ie, used the beginning and end dates of the vaccination campaign, rather than the midpoint); imputed missing covariate data; and excluded children younger than 5 years of age since vaccine effectiveness is known to be lower in this group. Multiple imputation (n = 25) was done using covariate and outcome data and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (SAS MI Procedure), and effect estimates were pooled across datasets. Owing to small numbers, we did not do adjusted analyses or examine effectiveness over time in the subgroup of children less than 5 years of age. We calculated vaccine effectiveness using the formula (1-relative risk).

Bias-indicator analysis

Bias-indicator case-control studies are often conducted in parallel with vaccine effectiveness case-control studies to assess the likelihood of bias in the latter. We previously reported results from the bias-indicator study that we did in tandem with this case-control study. Some sensitivity analyses revealed a bias-indicator estimate that was significantly different from zero; however, we derived similar vaccine effectiveness estimates using both community-based and test-negative controls, which led us to conclude that bias, if present, was minimal.

Ethical considerations

Written informed consent was obtained for all participants, or from a health-care proxy if the participant was unable to consent. Consent from a parent or guardian was obtained for children younger than 18 years of age, and assent was sought from children aged 7–17 years. The study protocol was approved by Partners Human Research Committee and the Haiti National Bioethics Committee.

Role of the funding sourceThe study funders had no role in the design of the study; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; in the writing of the report; or in the decision to submit the paper for publication.

### Assessing the impact of the 2018 changchun changsheng vaccine incident on childhood vaccination in China [^f72d0036]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Guardians of children were interviewed by trained interviewers using an online questionnaire system on a portable Android device (PAD) which allowed quality control in a timely manner. The survey questionnaire covered the socio-demographic characteristics of the children (e.g. child's age, gender, and number of children in a family) and their guardians (e.g. guardian's age, relationship with the child, ethnicity, education level, household income, status of residence, and place of residence). Using PAD, we took snapshots of children's vaccination records where the type and date of different vaccine doses received by each child were clearly written or printed. Written informed consent was obtained from children's guardians.

The sample size was initially set to 3840 (Supplementary Note 1), and was increased in practice to accommodate the response rate and ensure data integrity. In the survey, 6 668 children were recruited, among whom the guardians of 5384 (80.74%) children agreed to provide their vaccination records, and the records of 5294 (79.39%) were legible and complete with snapshots of every page.

Outcome measures

Our study examined the vaccines scheduled for children below 18 months of age and widely used before the vaccine incident (Supplementary Table 1), including seven types of NIP vaccines which are delivered to children free of charge, and two types of non-NIP vaccines which are recommended but non-compulsory and self-paid. The NIP vaccines, all with national uptake around 99% prior to the vaccine incident, were DTaP vaccine (four doses), Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine (one dose), Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine (three doses), Polio vaccine (three doses), MMR vaccine (one dose), Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine (one dose), and Hepatitis A (HepA) vaccine (one dose). Two widely used non-NIP vaccines of interest were Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine (four doses) and Varicella vaccine (one dose), with national uptake around 40% and 70% before the vaccine incident, respectively. Note that besides Hib and Varicella vaccines, we also collected information on other non-NIP vaccines available in the private market in China such as pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and rotavirus vaccine, but their uptake was too low to identify the impact of the vaccine incident.

### Why we should not' just use age' for COVID-19 vaccine prioritisation [^3b782553]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Older age is one of the greatest risk factors for severe outcomes from COVID-19. If we believe it is important to use limited supplies of COVID-19 vaccines to protect the most vulnerable and prevent deaths, then available doses should be allocated with significant priority to older adults. Yet, we should resist the conclusion that age should be the sole criterion for COVID-19 vaccine prioritisation or that no younger populations (eg, those under the age of 60) should be prioritised until all older adults have been vaccinated. This article examines arguments that are commonly presented to abandon 'complex' vaccine prioritisation schemes in favour of 'just using age' (eg, prioritising those 80 years of age and older and then decreasing in a 5-year age bands until the entire population has had the opportunity to be vaccinated), and articulates the ethical reasons why these arguments are not persuasive.

Adolescents — obstetrician–gynecologists should protect adolescents' access to reproductive health care services, including HPV vaccination, while following CDC and ACOG guidance and legal requirements; they should educate adolescent patients and parents, provide age-appropriate risk–benefit discussions, and pursue shared decision making. Laws on adolescent consent vary by state and treatment, so obstetrician–gynecologists should familiarize themselves with current laws and policies; even when parental consent is required, clinicians should still obtain adolescent assent and involve them in decisions appropriate to developmental stage.

Vaccination Coverage

Since 2006, NIS-Teen has collected vaccination information for adolescents aged 13–17 years in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and selected areas, † using a random-digit–dialed sample of landline and, starting in 2011, cell phone numbers. § After a teen's parent/guardian grants permission to contact their teen's vaccination provider(s), a questionnaire is mailed to each provider to obtain a vaccination history from medical records. Analysis for this report was limited to adolescent girls and boys with provider-reported vaccination histories. HPV vaccination coverage represents receipt of any HPV vaccine and does not distinguish between HPV2 or HPV4. NIS-Teen methodology, including weighting procedures, has been described previously. Differences in vaccination coverage were evaluated using t-tests and were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05.

### HIV preexposure prophylaxis prescriptions, consent laws, and uptake barriers among adolescents [^077645ce]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a safe and effective way to reduce HIV acquisition and was approved for adolescents in 2018. We assessed whether states with minor consent laws (MCLs) allowing younger adolescents to receive PrEP without parental/guardian consent were associated with increased prescription fills.

Methods

A legal review classified whether states had MCLs. A negative binomial regression model using national all-payer pharmacy claims compared PrEP fills between minors (13–17 years) and majority-age adolescents (18–19 years) between states with and without MCLs from 2015 to 2021, among 15 states with the highest minor PrEP fills. Key informant interviews (n = 25 experts from 7 states) elicited context for interpreting statistical results.

Results

On average, minors had lower PrEP fills than majority-age adolescents (incident rate ratio [IRR],0.21; 95% CI, 0.17–0.24). However, the interaction term between MCL and age group was insignificant (IRR,1.11; 95% CI, 0.91–1.36), indicating that age group differences were similar between MCL and non-MCL states. Experts described numerous barriers faced by adolescents in accessing PrEP, including confidentiality concerns, clinic access, stigma, providers' hesitancy to discuss sexual health with and prescribe PrEP to minors, limited information on PrEP in school-based sexual education, and health care literacy.

Conclusions

We did not find evidence that the gap in PrEP prescription fills between minor and majority-age adolescents was smaller among states with PrEP-inclusive MCLs. Strategies to address the numerous barriers in PrEP access experienced by adolescents may be needed.

### Vaccination coverage among children aged 19–35 months-United States, 2016 [^21eb3f91]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

The NIS-Child uses a random-digit–dialing sample of landline and cellular telephone numbers to contact parents or guardians of children aged 19–35 months in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, selected local areas, and U.S. territories. Parents/guardians are interviewed by telephone to collect sociodemographic and health insurance information for age-eligible children in the household. With consent of parent or guardian, a survey is mailed to all identified vaccination providers to collect dates and types of all vaccines administered to the child. Vaccination coverage estimates use only provider-reported vaccination data. NIS-Child methodology, including weighting procedures, has been described previously. The household interview response rate †† was 33.9% from the combined landline/cell phone sample. Among households with completed interviews, 54.6% had adequate vaccination data from providers, §§ yielding 14,988 children available for determination of national coverage estimates for 2016. Logistic regression was used to assess the association of race/ethnicity with vaccination coverage, adjusting for poverty status. T-tests on weighted data were used to evaluate differences in coverage estimates by demographic characteristics; differences were considered to be statistically significant for p-values < 0.05. Trends in vaccination coverage by ages 19, 24, and 35 months were evaluated by month and year of birth using weighted linear regression. Linear trends were estimated using combined data from 2015 and 2016 NIS-Child (births from January 2012 through January 2015), and an expanded analysis of the 2012–2016 data (births from January 2009 through January 2015). Results by age 24 months (2 years) most closely approximate the average age at vaccination assessment in the annual NIS-Child sample (28 months).

Site selection and recruitment

Households, schools, and vaccination centres were selected from within three non-administrative zones representative of urban Blantyre's socioeconomic spectrum in medium- to high-density townships. These zones were further divided into clusters, allowing for ~25,000 adults per zone and 1200 adults per cluster. At the start of each rolling cross-sectional survey, eight clusters were randomly selected. Clusters were not purposely resampled but eligible if randomly selected in subsequent surveys. Within each cluster, after randomly choosing a first house, teams moved systematically, recruiting one eligible child per household until a required number of children were recruited from each cluster. If no parent/guardian was available or no child age eligible for household recruitment was at home (including when no one was home), the study team moved systematically to the next house without attempting to revisit the skipped household. At the start of each survey, updated school registers were collected from schools. Individual school-goers were randomly selected from school registers, and letters were sent home inviting parents/guardians to travel to the school within the following 3 school days to discuss the study and consider consenting to their child's participation. If the parent/guardian did not respond to the letter or did not visit the school within the specified 3 days, another child was randomly selected from the school's register.

Determining PCV vaccination status

A child was considered PCV vaccinated if she/he had received at least one dose of PCV before screening. Vaccination status and inclusion/exclusion criteria were further assessed from subject-held medical records (known as health passports). If a child was reported by the parent/guardian to be PCV vaccinated but no health passport was available, a questionnaire was applied. The questionnaire was developed by identifying, among a subset of 60 participants, four questions most commonly answered correctly by parents/guardians of children with proof of PCV vaccination. The questions included the child's age when vaccinated, vaccine administration route (oral or injectable), anatomical site of vaccination, and which other (if any) vaccines were received at the time of PCV vaccination. If the child was PCV age eligible and the parent/guardian answered all four questions correctly, the child was recruited as PCV vaccinated.

### Adolescents and young adults: the pediatrician's role in HIV testing and pre-and postexposure HIV prophylaxis [^9a20bef1]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Implementation of HIV screening — The USPSTF recommends that clinicians routinely screen for HIV infection in adolescents and adults aged 15 to 65 years and screen younger adolescents and older adults at increased risk. Opt-out HIV testing should be voluntary and done only with the patient's knowledge and understanding but can be performed without a separate written informed consent or pretest counseling, and most states allow opt-out testing without written consent; at the time of publication 39 states stipulated that HIV testing may be provided to a minor without parental or guardian consent, with caveats. Youth may request HIV testing in the absence of reported risk factors, and testing should be driven by youth request. One reasonable approach to screening frequency is initial screening of all youth, followed by periodic repeat screening annually for sexually active youth or every 3 months for those on PrEP or with high-risk behaviors and/or receiving care in high HIV prevalence settings; routine rescreening may not be necessary for individuals who have not been at increased risk since they were found to be HIV-negative. Female youth screened during a previous pregnancy should be rescreened during each subsequent pregnancy, and because 27% of pregnancies in the United States occur in women younger than 25 years, routine HIV screening and rescreening in the third trimester in jurisdictions with high rates of HIV infection in pregnant women can lead to early identification of HIV infection and have a substantial impact on preventing perinatal transmission of HIV.

### Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975–2009, featuring the burden and trends in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers and HPV vaccination coverage levels [^dc2570be]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

HPV Vaccination Coverage

Data on HPV vaccination coverage for receipt of one or more and three (some received more than three) doses of HPV vaccine among girls aged 13 to 17 years for 2008 and 2010 were obtained from the National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen), a random-digit-dialed landline telephone survey of US households. The parents and guardians of eligible adolescents are asked during the telephone interview for verbal consent to contact the adolescents' vaccination provider(s). The NIS-Teen uses the list-assisted method of random-digit-dialed survey, and the sampling frame of telephone numbers is updated each quarter to reflect new telephone exchanges and area codes. The NIS-Teen is the only national data source to assess provider-verified vaccination coverage among adolescents. Estimates are reported among adolescents aged 13 to 17 years. Measuring at ages 13 through 17 years allows sufficient time for those who initiated the series at age 11 or 12 years to complete it, and it captures information on those vaccinated at older ages. Data from this national survey are weighted based on the sampling design. National estimates are used to monitor coverage as vaccination histories are obtained from medical records and sociodemographic information is obtained from parents. Three-dose series completion rates were determined among girls who received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine 24 weeks or more before the NIS-Teen interview date because administration of the third dose is recommended 24 weeks after receipt of the first dose. Vaccination coverage estimates are presented by demographic characteristics, including by insurance status and Vaccines for Children (VFC) program eligibility. The VFC program provides free vaccine to children and adolescents through 18 years of age who are uninsured, eligible for the Medicaid program, American Indian or Alaska Native, or underinsured. Underinsured children (whose insurance does not cover vaccine) are eligible to receive VFC vaccine only through a federally qualified health center or rural health clinic.

Prevalence of Pap Testing

Data from the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a state-based, random-digit-dialed telephone survey, were used to estimate the state-level (and national average) prevalence of recent Pap testing (during the previous 3 years) for women aged 21 to 65 years with an intact uterus, overall, and by usual source of medical care. Verbal consent is obtained during the interview from survey participants.

### A randomised controlled trial to compare opt-in and opt-out parental consent for childhood vaccine safety surveillance using data linkage [^a74174e3]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

No consent for health and medical research is appropriate when the criteria for a waiver of consent are met, yet some ethics committees and data custodians still require informed consent.

Methods

A single-blind parallel-group randomised controlled trial: 1129 families of children born at a South Australian hospital were sent information explaining data linkage of childhood immunisation and hospital records for vaccine safety surveillance with 4 weeks to opt in or opt out by reply form, telephone or email. A subsequent telephone interview gauged the intent of 1026 parents (91%) in relation to their actions and the sociodemographic differences between participants and non-participants in each arm.

Results

The participation rate was 21% (n = 120/564) in the opt-in arm and 96% (n = 540/565) in the opt-out arm (χ²(1 df) = 567.7, p < 0.001). Participants in the opt-in arm were more likely than non-participants to be older, married/de facto, university educated and of higher socioeconomic status. Participants in the opt-out arm were similar to non-participants, except men were more likely to opt out. Substantial proportions did not receive, understand or properly consider study invitations, and opting in or opting out behaviour was often at odds with parents' stated underlying intentions.

Conclusions

The opt-in approach resulted in low participation and a biased sample that would render any subsequent data linkage unfeasible, while the opt-out approach achieved high participation and a representative sample. The waiver of consent afforded under current privacy regulations for data linkage studies meeting all appropriate criteria should be granted by ethics committees, and supported by data custodians.

### Consent by proxy for nonurgent pediatric care [^5534e0ce]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Nonurgent pediatric care — For the purposes of this clinical report, nonurgent pediatric care is defined as preventive medicine (ie, services encompassed in pediatric health supervision visits, including immunizations and screening tests) and outpatient medical encounters for minor illnesses or injuries. Differences in operations and procedures may depend on whether the nonurgent medical encounter is the initial visit or a follow-up visit.
