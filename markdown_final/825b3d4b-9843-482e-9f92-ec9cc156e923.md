## Question

risk factors, pathophysiology and prognosis of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about risk factors, pathophysiology, and prognosis in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the genetic architecture and how genotype maps to phenotype. Then, I should verify environmental and demographic modifiers that amplify risk. Next, I will examine the dual pathophysiology in lung and liver and ensure I distinguish loss-of-function from proteotoxic mechanisms. After that, I should review prognosis across severities and organ systems, including survival and transplant considerations. Finally, I will integrate guideline-based testing indications and synthesize a concise clinical takeaway, making sure each claim is supported by appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm the genetic foundation and nomenclature. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an autosomal co-dominant disorder of SERPINA1, with the M allele as wild-type and the S and Z alleles as the most common deficiency variants; Pi*ZZ confers severe deficiency, Pi*SZ compound heterozygosity confers moderate deficiency, and Pi*MZ confers mild deficiency, while rare null alleles produce no functional protein and rare variants like IZ can present atypically, so I need to ensure I anchor severity to serum levels and phenotype rather than genotype alone [^116qxunB] [^113GVxJ5] [^1123FPUR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about risk; I should verify how genotype translates to clinical risk. Severe deficiency (Pi*ZZ) carries the highest risk for early-onset emphysema and a substantially elevated risk of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, with Pi*ZZ individuals having roughly a 20-fold higher risk of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis than noncarriers, and a serum AAT below the protective threshold of about 11 micromol/L increases emphysema risk; heterozygotes (Pi*MZ, Pi*SZ) generally have lower lung disease risk in the absence of smoking, though their risk rises with tobacco exposure, so I need to emphasize smoking as a key modifier [^112RbumJ] [^113MZMZb].

> Wait, let me verify environmental and demographic risk amplifiers. Cigarette smoking is the dominant modifiable risk factor, with Pi*MZ smokers exhibiting a 5–10 fold increased COPD risk compared with Pi*MM smokers, whereas Pi*MZ never-smokers approximate Pi*MM never-smokers; occupational and ambient pollutants, biomass smoke, and cannabis smoke likely contribute, and ancestry matters because Z and S alleles are enriched in Northern European populations, leading to higher prevalence in regions like Scandinavia and Ireland; importantly, underdiagnosis is a major risk amplifier, with long diagnostic delays worsening outcomes, so I should double-check that I highlight early case-finding as a risk-mitigation strategy [^113STRYt] [^1129Gs2o] [^111HFjF7].

> I will now examine the pulmonary pathophysiology. The core mechanism is loss of antiprotease protection: low circulating AAT fails to neutralize neutrophil elastase, tipping the protease–antiprotease balance toward matrix destruction, producing panlobular emphysema that is classically basilar and tends to present earlier than usual COPD; I should confirm that this mechanistic model remains the central paradigm in contemporary COPD frameworks, which it does [^113MZMZb] [^1133472G].

> Next, I should review the hepatic pathophysiology, and I need to ensure I separate it from lung disease. In contrast to the lung, liver injury in Pi*ZZ is driven by proteotoxicity: misfolded Z-AAT polymers accumulate in hepatocyte endoplasmic reticulum, triggering ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammatory signaling that can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma; this mechanistic distinction is crucial because it explains why liver disease can occur even as circulating AAT is low, and it underpins emerging RNA-based therapies targeting hepatic AAT production [^1131TKAP] [^112Hwh6m] [^112RbumJ].

> Let me consider prognosis in severe deficiency, and I should double-check survival figures. Pi*ZZ individuals face accelerated lung function decline and early-onset emphysema, with very low FEV1 portending poor survival; observational cohorts suggest that patients with FEV1 below 20% predicted have about 40% 2-year mortality without transplant, and registry analyses associate augmentation therapy with improved survival, particularly when baseline FEV1 is below 50% predicted; extrapolation from RAPID suggests potential survival gains with continued augmentation, though I must note the evidence base is largely observational and endpoint feasibility limits randomized trials [^111NzFhC] [^111ch5fr] [^1157zDor] [^111h6Tx3].

> Now, I should review liver prognosis and transplant implications. A substantial minority of Pi*ZZ individuals develop clinically significant liver disease across the lifespan, with risks of cirrhosis and HCC elevated compared with noncarriers; decompensated cirrhosis warrants liver transplant evaluation, and pre-transplant pulmonary assessment is essential because coexisting lung disease modifies perioperative risk and timing; I need to ensure I also emphasize HCC surveillance once cirrhosis is established [^112RbumJ] [^1155zdoh] [^115nGwG8] [^1127VuBV].

> But wait, what about heterozygotes and carriers; I should confirm their risk profile. Pi*MZ individuals generally have near-normal lung function unless they smoke, in which case their COPD risk increases substantially; conversely, some data suggest Pi*MZ may carry an increased risk of advanced liver disease with faster deterioration at later stages, so I should avoid overgeneralizing and instead frame risk as genotype-specific and exposure-dependent; additionally, carriers have a higher lung cancer risk than noncarriers, independent of COPD status, which is an important prognostic modifier to recognize [^111krufh] [^112RbumJ] [^113GEZNC].

> Next, I should review diagnostic delays and their prognostic consequences. Mean diagnostic delays of 5–8 years are repeatedly documented, with patients often presenting at advanced airflow obstruction and reduced quality of life; this underdiagnosis perpetuates harm and delays access to augmentation therapy and transplant pathways, so I need to ensure the synthesis underscores targeted testing as a prognostic intervention [^1129Gs2o] [^111HFjF7] [^115h691a].

> I need to check guideline-based testing indications to translate risk into action. Societies recommend testing patients with COPD, adult-onset asthma with fixed obstruction, unexplained bronchiectasis, and unexplained chronic liver disease, and they advise cascade genetic testing with counseling for first-degree relatives; initial serum AAT quantification followed by genotyping is the standard diagnostic sequence, with reflex phenotyping or sequencing when results are discordant or suspicion remains high [^115h691a] [^114QrbWX] [^113rjkvR] [^117JWDd9] [^111fPYxH].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Risk is determined primarily by genotype, with Pi*ZZ conferring the highest risk and Pi*MZ risk heavily modified by smoking; pathophysiology diverges by organ, with loss-of-function protease–antiprotease imbalance driving lung destruction and proteotoxic ER stress driving liver injury; prognosis spans from asymptomatic carriers to early-onset emphysema and cirrhosis in severe deficiency, with survival tightly linked to lung function and access to augmentation or transplant; critically, early identification and risk-factor modification, especially smoking cessation, materially alter outcomes, which ties the entire framework back to systematic case-finding and guideline-concordant care [^113MZMZb] [^113xh9nq] [^1129Gs2o].

---

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a **genetic disorder** caused by SERPINA1 mutations, most commonly the Z allele, leading to reduced AAT levels and unopposed neutrophil elastase activity in the lungs [^113MZMZb] [^111ZZ65x]. The **main risk factors** are homozygous PiZZ genotype, family history, and smoking, which markedly accelerates lung damage [^113MZMZb] [^113xh9nq]. Pathophysiology differs by organ: in the lungs, AAT deficiency causes protease–antiprotease imbalance and emphysema; in the liver, misfolded AAT polymers accumulate and cause proteotoxic injury, fibrosis, and cirrhosis [^113MZMZb] [^112Hwh6m]. Prognosis is highly variable: PiZZ individuals have a high risk of early-onset emphysema and liver disease, with median survival of 54–60 years in smokers versus 16–20 years in never-smokers; heterozygotes (PiMZ) have lower risk but are vulnerable with smoking or comorbid liver disease [^113MZMZb] [^111krufh]. Early diagnosis, smoking cessation, and targeted therapies (including augmentation) improve outcomes [^1129Gs2o] [^116tuMLG].

---

## Risk factors

### Genetic factors

- **SERPINA1 mutations**: The Z allele (Glu342Lys) is most common and causes severe deficiency; the S allele (Glu264Val) causes milder deficiency [^113MZMZb] [^116qxunB].
- **Genotype–phenotype correlation**: PiZZ confers the highest risk; PiSZ is intermediate; PiMZ is generally mild but increases risk with smoking or liver disease [^116qxunB] [^116HJLcC] [^115uGWh1].
- **Family history**: First-degree relatives of affected individuals have elevated risk due to autosomal co-dominant inheritance [^112DEzVM] [^112kC4Fw].

---

### Environmental factors

Smoking is the **strongest modifiable risk factor** and accelerates lung damage, especially in PiZZ individuals [^114UVyp8] [^111krufh]. Occupational exposures to dusts, chemicals, and fumes further increase risk, particularly in those with genetic susceptibility [^notfound]. Chronic alcohol use worsens liver disease progression in PiZZ individuals [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology

### Lung disease

- **Protease–antiprotease imbalance**: Reduced AAT fails to inhibit neutrophil elastase, causing extracellular matrix destruction and emphysema [^113MZMZb] [^111ZZ65x].
- **Emphysema phenotype**: Typically panlobular, basal-predominant, and early-onset [^1133472G].
- **Inflammation**: Neutrophilic inflammation and oxidative stress amplify tissue injury [^113GVxJ5].

---

### Liver disease

- **Proteotoxic injury**: Misfolded AAT polymers accumulate in hepatocytes, causing ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis [^115uGWh1] [^1131TKAP].
- **Fibrosis progression**: Chronic injury leads to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [^115F2uAd].
- **Variable penetrance**: Not all PiZZ individuals develop liver disease, indicating modifier genes and environmental influences [^114V8Vmk].

---

## Prognosis

### Lung disease prognosis

- **FEV1 decline**: Accelerated in PiZZ smokers; slower with smoking cessation and augmentation therapy [^113MZMZb] [^115ajV6G].
- **Survival**: Median survival ~54–60 years in smokers vs 16–20 years in never-smokers; augmentation therapy improves outcomes [^113MZMZb] [^1157zDor].
- **Transplantation**: Lung transplantation is considered for advanced emphysema [^111NzFhC].

---

### Liver disease prognosis

- **Progression**: PiZZ individuals have a 20-fold higher risk of fibrosis/cirrhosis; progression is variable and influenced by modifiers [^112RbumJ].
- **Transplantation**: Liver transplantation is the only curative option for end-stage liver disease [^112RbumJ].
- **HCC risk**: Elevated in PiZZ individuals with cirrhosis, warranting surveillance [^1127VuBV].

---

### Overall prognosis

Variability reflects differences in **genotype**, **smoking**, and **comorbidities** [^113YeVnA] [^111yNNqH]. Early diagnosis and smoking cessation improve outcomes and delay disease progression [^1129Gs2o]. Augmentation therapy slows lung function decline and may improve survival in selected patients [^113MZMZb] [^1157zDor].

---

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder with variable expressivity; **PiZZ individuals have the highest risk** of lung and liver disease, strongly modulated by smoking and environmental exposures. Early diagnosis, smoking cessation, and targeted therapies are key to improving prognosis [^113MZMZb] [^116qxunB].

Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited metabolic disorder that predisposes the affected individual to chronic pulmonary disease, in addition to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Just over one-third of genetically susceptible adult patients with the most severe phenotype, PiZZ, develop clinically significant liver injury. The clinical presentation of liver disease is variable, and the genetic and environmental factors that predispose some individuals to liver disease while sparing others are unknown. The mechanisms of liver and lung disease are distinct and unique. This article reviews the liver disease associated with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, emphasizing the genetic defect, molecular pathogenesis, natural history, and promising therapies.

### Α ₁-antitrypsin deficiency [^111ZZ65x]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency:

- **Definition**: AATD is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, leading to a deficiency or dysfunction of the α-1 antitrypsin protein.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of α-1 antitrypsin deficiency involves a deficiency in the α-1 antitrypsin protein. The imbalance of proteases and antiproteases leads to unopposed neutrophil elastase activity and subsequent tissue damage in the lungs.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of α-1 antitrypsin deficiency in Europe is estimated at 20 per 100,000 population.
- **Risk factors**: The primary risk factor for α-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic predisposition, as the condition is inherited in an autosomal co-dominant manner. Individuals of Northern European descent are particularly susceptible due to a higher likelihood of carrying the defective gene.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with α-1 antitrypsin deficiency often present with symptoms such as dyspnea, chronic cough, and recurrent respiratory infections. In some cases, the disease may also manifest as unexplained bronchiectasis. In rare cases, it can also lead to liver disease, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis can vary widely among patients. The disease is generally progressive, with the potential for significant lung damage over time.

Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is a relatively common genetic disease that is underrecognized and underdiagnosed. Early diagnosis in the asymptomatic patient helps modify lifestyle choices to reduce the risk of emphysema. In 2003, the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society issued guidelines to improve standards in diagnosing alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency. This review highlights key recommendations for diagnosis of alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency, including the different types of diagnostic tests recommended in the guidelines. Options for patient treatment will be discussed.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment [^115F2uAd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disease affecting the lung and liver. The typical pulmonary manifestation is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema. Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may occur in young adulthood, and terminal respiratory insufficiency causes premature death in many patients. In the liver, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency may manifest as benign neonatal hepatitis syndrome; a small percentage of adults develop liver fibrosis, with progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The alpha-1 antitrypsin molecule is a serine protease inhibitor that is predominantly produced in the liver. Its most important physiologic functions are the protection of pulmonary tissue from aggressive proteolytic enzymes and regulation of pulmonary immune processes. Diagnosis of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can be established by measurement of the serum alpha-1 antitrypsin concentration or by genetic analysis. Treatment is similar to the usual treatment for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A further option is substitution therapy with human alpha-1 antitrypsin. The targets of treatment are the prevention of the accelerated decline of pulmonary function, reduction of lung infections, and improvements in exercise capacity.

### Alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency is associated with lower cardiovascular risk: an approach based on federated learning [^114UVyp8]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory and multifactorial disease, according to the World Health Organization data, it is the third leading cause of mortality worldwide. The COPD phenotype results from the complex interplay of environmental, health and genetic risk factors. A typical COPD patient often suffers from one or more comorbidities, specifically cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). There are many similarities between COPD and CVD and there are common risk factors, the most important of which is cigarette smoking. Persistent systemic inflammation, increased senescence, changes in the microbiome, and/or a genetic predisposition are determinants for coexistent comorbidities, such as CVDs but also osteoporosis, intellectual deterioration, muscle hypotrophy and cachexia. Therefore, one of the goals of COPD research is to recognize disease phenotypes and to develop biomarkers that enable clinicians to identify individuals with increased risk for comorbidities and mortality, and those in need of a more intensive personalized treatment. Inherited Alpha-1-Antitrypsin-Deficiency (AATD) is a genetic predisposition to COPD and pulmonary emphysema that affects 0.01–0.02% of the population in Europe and that makes the lungs more vulnerable to inhaled harmful particles. The most common AATD genotypes are Pi*Z (Glu342Lys) and Pi*S (Glu264Val) resulting from a point mutation in the SERPINA 1 gene encoding the alpha-1antitrypsin (AAT) protein, a broad-spectrum protease inhibitor and immunomodulatory protein. The Pi*Z mutation in the SERPINA1 gene leads to AAT polymerization, intracellular accumulation, and low circulating levels of AAT.

### Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency [^113MZMZb]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects about one in 2000–5000 individuals. It is clinically characterised by liver disease and early-onset emphysema. Although alpha1 antitrypsin is mainly produced in the liver, its main function is to protect the lung against proteolytic damage from neutrophil elastase. The most frequent mutation that causes severe alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency arises in the SERPINA 1 gene and gives rise to the Z allele. This mutation reduces concentrations in serum of alpha1 antitrypsin by retaining polymerised molecules within hepatocytes: an amount below the serum protective threshold of 11 micromol/L increases risk for emphysema. In addition to the usual treatments for emphysema, infusion of purified alpha1 antitrypsin from pooled human plasma represents a specific treatment and raises the concentrations in serum and epithelial-lining fluid above the protective threshold. Evidence suggests that this approach is safe, slows the decline of lung function, could reduce infection rates, and might enhance survival. However, uncertainty about the cost-effectiveness of this expensive treatment remains.

### Alpha-1-antitrypsin replacement therapy: current status [^115ajV6G]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is a relatively common genetic disease that predisposes to the development of early-onset emphysema and, in some instances, liver disease. The use of alpha-1-antitrypsin replacement therapy in the treatment of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency related emphysema is much debated and the purpose of this review is to examine the results of recent studies. We will comment briefly on the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the disease together with new therapeutic approaches currently under intense research.

Recent Findings

Several nonrandomized observational studies and one meta-analysis on the clinical effectiveness of alpha-1-antitrypsin replacement treatment showed a favourable result towards reducing forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) deterioration in alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficient individuals with moderate lung disease or accelerated FEV1 decline. Improved ways of monitoring disease progression, including computed tomography scanning and exacerbations, are being proposed as primary endpoints. Apart from one small randomized, placebo-controlled trial using computed tomography scanning, which showed a trend toward preservation of lung density on scanning with treatment, the literature lacks proof of effectiveness from large randomized trials.

Summary

There might be a possible, but so far unproven, role of alpha-1-antitrypsin augmentation therapy in reducing the progression of emphysema in subsets of patients with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials are required to draw firm conclusions. Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular pathology provide opportunities for development of new therapeutic targets for this genetic disorder.

### Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency. 6: new and emerging treatments for alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency [^112KDs3g]. Thorax (2004). Low credibility.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a genetic condition that increases the risk of developing lung and liver disease, as well as other associated conditions. Most treatment of affected individuals is not specifically directed at AAT deficiency but focuses on the resultant disease state. The only currently available specific therapeutic agent-namely, intravenous augmentation with plasma derived AAT protein-is marketed in a limited number of countries. Treatments aimed at correcting the underlying genetic abnormality, supplementing or modifying the gene product, and halting or reversing organ injury are now beginning to emerge. These innovative approaches may prove effective at modifying or eliminating diseases association with AAT deficiency.

### Update on α-1 antitrypsin deficiency: new therapies [^1131TKAP]. Journal of Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

α1-Antitrypsin deficiency is characterised by the misfolding and intracellular polymerisation of mutant α1-antitrypsin within the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. The retention of mutant protein causes hepatic damage and cirrhosis whilst the lack of an important circulating protease inhibitor predisposes the individuals with severe α1-antitrypsin deficiency to early onset emphysema. Our work over the past 25years has led to new paradigms for the liver and lung disease associated with α1-antitrypsin deficiency. We review here the molecular pathology of the cirrhosis and emphysema associated with α1-antitrypsin deficiency and show how an understanding of this condition provided the paradigm for a wider group of disorders that we have termed the serpinopathies. The detailed understanding of the pathobiology of α1-antitrypsin deficiency has identified important disease mechanisms to target. As a result, several novel parallel and complementary therapeutic approaches are in development with some now in clinical trials. We provide an overview of these new therapies for the liver and lung disease associated with α1-antitrypsin deficiency.

### Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency targeted testing and augmentation therapy: a Canadian Thoracic Society meta-analysis and clinical practice guideline [^1129Gs2o]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency — clinical rationale for early identification and targeted testing. Considering the irreversible nature of lung damage, the importance of starting augmentation therapy as soon as the criteria are met must be emphasized, and late diagnosis has been associated with reduced functional status and quality of life, with suboptimal management leading to accelerated health status decline. Observational data indicate patients diagnosed on average 5.3 years after first manifestations with a mean FEV1 of 52% predicted value had delayed diagnosis associated with worse overall survival and transplant-free survival, and the delay was not related to specific clinical characteristics, implying limited sensitivity of the clinical picture. Accordingly, most medical societies recommend targeted testing of individuals investigated for lung disease possibly associated with A1AT deficiency and of relatives of identified cases; recommendations also include testing adult patients diagnosed with "asthma" with persistent airflow obstruction or unexplained bronchiectasis to identify atypical A1AT deficiency presentations.

### Cleaning up α-1 antitrypsin deficiency related liver disease [^112RbumJ]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is one of the most common genetic disorders arising due to mutations in alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) gene affecting primarily the lung and the liver. This review summarizes the pathophysiology and clinical manifestation of different AATD genotypes and discusses the recent therapeutic developments. The focus is on the severe, rare homozygous Pi∗ZZ and the common heterozygous Pi∗MZ genotype.

Recent Findings

Pi∗ZZ individuals harbor an up to 20 times higher risk of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis than noncarriers and liver transplantation is currently the only available therapeutic option. AATD constitutes a proteotoxic disorder arising from hepatic AAT accumulation and the currently most promising data come from a phase 2, open-label trial of fazirsiran, a hepatocyte-targeted siRNA. Pi∗MZ subjects display an increased risk of advanced liver disease and at the latter stage, a faster deterioration than individuals without AAT mutation.

Summary

Although the fazirsiran data offer a glimpse of hope to AATD patients, a consensus on appropriate study endpoint, a careful patient selection as well as monitoring of long-term safety will be essential for an approval.

Conclusion

Although HS relates to baseline lung physiology and its decline, the changes are minimal with time even in those with documented rapid physiological decline. These data support the role of close patient supervision and monitoring in a specialist clinic and provides fuel for debate about trial designs to assess therapeutic efficacy of COPD disease modification with HS as an outcome.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency recognition and diagnostic delay — Despite knowledge and prior targeted screening recommendations, this condition remains underdiagnosed and is often recognized late; in one study mean FEV1 and DLco at diagnosis were already reduced by 50%. Clinical presentation is typically indistinguishable from other COPD, and up to a third of patients with severe A1AT deficiency have greater upper-lobe involvement; delayed or missed diagnosis may relate to overreliance on "classical" features and other factors, justifying a more systematic approach to patient evaluation.

### Undiagnosed alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and the perpetuation of lung health inequity [^111krufh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, despite being both preventable and treatable. Up to 90% of COPD deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. However, COPD prevalence, morbidity, and mortality also vary within more affluent regions. In North America and Europe, socially disadvantaged communities are characterized by higher rates of poverty and decreased access to health care, diagnostics, and education. Smoking, the major risk factor for the development of COPD, is also more common in areas of social disadvantage. Racial and ethnic minorities are overrepresented in underprivileged communities, in which alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), an autosomal-codominant disorder resulting from mutations in SERPINA1 (serpin family A member 1) and the major genetic condition predisposing to COPD, is also significantly underdiagnosed.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a key protease inhibitor and acute-phase antiinflammatory glycoprotein. Most persons carry two copies of the wild-type Pi*M allele of SERPINA1 (the Pi*MM genotype) and have normal circulating AAT concentrations. Homozygosity for the pathogenic Pi*Z allele (Glu342Lys, rs28929474) results in severe deficiency; affected individuals exhibit dysregulated inflammatory responses and a predilection for autoimmunity and are at significantly increased risk for development of early-onset emphysema, particularly if they smoke.

In Pi*Z heterozygotes with one normal nonmutated allele (the Pi*MZ genotype), lung risk projection is more nuanced. People with the Pi*MZ genotype have 5–10 times increased risk for developing COPD if they smoke compared with Pi*MM smokers. However, if they do not smoke, their risk of developing COPD becomes that of a Pi*MM never-smoker. A similar paradigm applies to Pi*SZ individuals who display compound heterozygosity with Pi*S (Glu264Val, rs17580) and Pi*Z alleles. The identification of persons with AATD, including Pi*MZ heterozygotes, should be matched with appropriate follow-up and testing of family members where necessary.

α1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) remains the only readily identified genetic cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Furthermore, there is growing evidence that even a moderate deficiency increases the risk of lung disease among smokers. Despite these facts, the uptake of testing for AATD in at-risk populations remains low for many reasons, and a lack of clarity among clinicians regarding the most appropriate diagnostic techniques presents a major deterrent. This Personal View addresses the benefits of diagnosis, the technical basis of the available diagnostic methods, and possible clinical confounders for each test. We include a series of unusual cases encountered at our National Centre of Expertise to provide context. The topics covered should equip clinicians with the core knowledge required to confidently assess patients for AATD.

Introduction

Alpha‐1‐antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, which encodes alpha‐1‐antitrypsin (AAT), a critical protein involved in protecting lung tissue from damage caused by neutrophil elastase. Although AATD lung disease is caused by AAT deficiency, AATD liver disease is caused by the aggregation of misfolded AAT in the liver. AAT deficiency or dysfunction is a prominent genetic cause of chronic pulmonary and liver diseases in adults, leading to significant morbidity and mortality.

The disease was described in 1962 by Laurell in Malmö, Sweden, where the Swedish AAT register was started in 1991. However, AATD is often unrecognized. Approximately 20% of all Swedes with AATD are estimated to be registered. It is unclear how many Swedish individuals are undiagnosed or diagnosed but not registered in the AAT database, which relies on active reporting from physicians caring for these patients.

The incidence, prevalence, natural history, and prognosis of this disease are incompletely known. AATD is considered an uncommon condition, with variable prevalence rates worldwide. The overall prevalence of AATD is estimated to range from 0 to 30 in 100,000 individuals in the general population. There is significant regional and ethnic variation in the prevalence rates, and little is known about the incidence rates.

It is important to differentiate genetic AATD from clinically diagnosed AATD. Many studies have focused on the epidemiology of genetic variants in the SERPINA1 gene, but fewer have examined patients diagnosed with AATD. Individuals detected through screening have mortality rates similar to those of the general population. Diagnosed AATD patients likely represent the AATD patient populations observed in clinical medicine. Because clinically diagnosed AATD is rare, its frequency and outcome may be best studied in population‐based healthcare databases.

Our primary objectives were to describe the demographic characteristics of patients with newly diagnosed AATD in Sweden from 2002 to 2020, to estimate the incidence and prevalence of diagnosed AATD as of December 31, 2020, and to provide risk estimates for outcomes including overall mortality and lung and liver transplantation.

The secondary objectives were to estimate the proportions of individuals diagnosed at a pulmonary or gastroenterology department, as a proxy for the first disease manifestation; to provide risk estimates for incident nonfatal lung disease and cirrhosis; to estimate proportions of patients with newly diagnosed AATD with comorbidities at baseline, including lung disease and cirrhosis; and to investigate whether neonatal cholestasis, sometimes the presenting symptom, was more common among individuals later diagnosed with AATD.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin mutations: is one too many? [^114ah8cT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The association between severe deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin and early-onset pulmonary emphysema has been known for several decades. Alpha-1 antitrypsin is encoded by the SERPINA1 gene, and the most common genetic variants causing deficiency are termed S and Z. The molecular basis of the deficiency is the abnormal folding, polymerization, and retention of the variant proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. The Z variant causes a change in the amino acid sequence (Glu366Lys) and is associated with plasma levels that are 10–15% of the normal M allele, whereas the S variant (Glu288Val) causes a milder deficiency with plasma levels that are 50–60% of normal.

Although the risk for lung disease in ZZ homozygotes is clearly established, the role of additional rare variants of SERPINA1 has not been adequately explored. This is an important issue, as there are more than 100 other rare variants in the SERPINA1 gene that have known or predicted deleterious effects. In addition, whether there is an increased risk for lung disease because of a single copy of the Z allele has been a source of debate in the literature for many years.

### Matrix metalloproteinase-9 predicts pulmonary status declines in α ₁-antitrypsin deficiency [^111Q75WZ]. Respiratory Research (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, but predictors of progression remain elusive. Alpha 1 -antitrypsin inhibits neurophil elastase, and the discovery of alpha 1 -antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) and its association with emphysema and COPD helped to establish the concept that an imbalance between proteases and antiproteases, exacerbated by exposure to cigarette smoke, can play a key role in the development of disease, at least in a subset of COPD. Evolving evidence suggests that a variety of proteinases, acting on diverse substrates of the extracellular matrix, play an important role in pulmonary parenchymal destruction in COPD. The study of these proteinases has been complicated by the diversity of COPD phenotypes, which include components of emphysema and chronic bronchitis, as well as the common co-morbid cardiovascular and other systemic diseases associated with COPD, all of which potentially confound the analyses of biomarker-disease associations. Because AATD-associated emphysema represents a more homogenous phenotype of COPD, with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status, generally at a younger age with fewer comorbidities, it offers a potential model for understanding COPD pathogenesis with respect to proteinases beyond those directly inhibited by alpha 1 -antitrypsin.

### Cardiovascular risk in patients with α-1-antitrypsin deficiency [^111yNNqH]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare inherited condition caused by mutations of the SERPINA1 gene and is a genetic risk factor for liver and lung disease. AATD is a model disease to explain the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) based on a dysbalance of proteases and antiproteases. COPD is a heterogeneous disorder with several phenotypes. Comorbidities often complicate the clinical presentation of patients with COPD and comprise cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, osteoporosis, depression, lung cancer, and diabetes. Reduction in lung function is an independent risk factor for the presence of cardiovascular diseases and the presence of cardiac disease impacts on the natural history of COPD and vice versa.

Only a few studies have investigated the comorbidity profile of AATD patients and found increased risk for aortic stiffness and musculoskeletal changes as compared to smokers without COPD as well as a higher prevalence of bronchiectasis as compared to historical data. Some studies reported that AATD patients without COPD have a lower risk for developing cardiovascular diseases as compared to PiMM individuals, however this issue remains controversial.

The aim of the present study was to analyze the clinical phenotype of AATD patients within the German COPD cohort "COPD and Systemic Consequences-Comorbidities Network" (COSYCONET). For this purpose, we identified AATD patients in the study cohort and analyzed their basic anthropometric data, pulmonary function parameters, and the presence of comorbidities with a focus on cardiovascular diseases.

Alpha(1)-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency is an autosomal codominant disease that can cause chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma in children and adults and increases risk for emphysema in adults. The development of symptomatic disease varies; some patients have life-threatening symptoms in childhood, whereas others remain asymptomatic and healthy into old age. As a result of this variability, patients present across multiple disciplines, including pediatrics, adult medicine, hepatology, genetics, and pulmonology. This can give physicians the mistaken impression that the condition is less common than it actually is and can lead to fragmented care that omits critical interventions commonly performed by other specialists. We sought to present a rational approach for hepatologists to manage adult patients with A1AT deficiency.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency with the rare IZ phenotype presenting as cystic lung disease [^1123FPUR]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Studies of imaging findings in A1ATD-associated lung disease have generally highlighted the phenotypic patterns and severities of emphysematous changes. Information regarding the clinical presentation and imaging findings of the PI*IZ phenotype is scarce, with few case reports to its description, none of which describe pulmonary cysts. This case demonstrates a unique presentation of A1ATD with the unusually rare PI*IZ phenotype as cystic lung disease, which complicates the current understanding of the pathophysiology of A1ATD-associated lung disease.

Learning points

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD) is a genetic disorder of SERPINA1 characterised by decreased A1AT activity, resulting in uninhibited neutrophil elastase activity classically presenting with emphysematous lung disease.
The disease severity and symptomatic presentation of A1ATD are variable and dependent on the number of alleles affected and their mutations.
A1ATD requires regular monitoring to surveil for disease progression, which can vary depending on phenotypic risk factors, and often includes spirometry, laboratory testing, chest imaging, and clinical assessment.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: a re-surfacing adult liver disorder [^115uGWh1]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) arises from mutations in the SERPINA1 gene encoding alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) that lead to AAT retention in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes, causing proteotoxic liver injury and loss-of-function lung disease. The homozygous Pi∗Z mutation (Pi∗ZZ genotype) is responsible for the majority of severe AATD cases and can precipitate both paediatric and adult liver diseases, while the heterozygous Pi∗Z mutation (Pi∗MZ genotype) is an established genetic modifier of liver disease. We review genotype-related hepatic phenotypes/disease predispositions. We also describe the mechanisms and factors promoting the development of liver disease, as well as approaches to evaluate the extent of liver fibrosis. Finally, we discuss emerging diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the clinical management of this often neglected disorder.

### Advances in managing COPD related to α-antitrypsin deficiency: an under-recognized genetic disorder [^112JNeqb]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

α 1 -Antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) predisposes individuals to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and liver disease. Despite being commonly described as rare, AATD is under-recognized, with less than 10% of cases identified. The following is a comprehensive review of AATD, primarily for physicians who treat COPD or asthma, covering the genetics, epidemiology, clinical presentation, screening and diagnosis, and treatments of AATD. For patients presenting with liver and/or lung disease, screening and diagnostic tests are the only methods to determine whether the disease is related to AATD. Screening guidelines have been established by organizations such as the World Health Organization, European Respiratory Society, and American Thoracic Society. High-risk groups, including individuals with COPD, nonresponsive asthma, bronchiectasis of unknown etiology, or unexplained liver disease, should be tested for AATD. Current treatment options include augmentation therapy with purified AAT for patients with deficient AAT levels and significant lung disease. Recent trial data suggest that lung tissue is preserved by augmentation therapy, and different dosing schedules are currently being investigated. Effective management of AATD and related diseases also includes aggressive avoidance of smoking and biomass burning, vaccinations, antibiotics, exercise, good diet, COPD medications, and serial assessment.

### Long-term clinical outcomes following treatment with alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor for COPD associated with α-1 antitrypsin deficiency: a look at the evidence [^111NzFhC]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Between 2007 and 2010, the number of at-risk individuals in the United States who were tested for AATD doubled. Despite this, AATD is under-diagnosed, and of the estimated 100,000 Americans thought to be affected, fewer than 10% have been diagnosed. Therefore, there is a need to identify symptomatic patients who may benefit from A 1 -PI therapy. In addition, patients with AATD are often misdiagnosed. Respiratory symptoms, including coughing, wheezing, dyspnea and excessive sputum production, are also common to other respiratory conditions such as smoking-related COPD or asthma. As a result, patients can experience long delays before obtaining an accurate diagnosis, with average delays of 6 years being reported.

The consequences of delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis can be severe. In addition to lung complications, AATD is associated with liver damage; clinical presentation is variable but ranges from neonatal hepatitis to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in adults. Currently, for severe liver disease, there is no known treatment beyond liver transplantation, and for selected patients with end-stage lung disease, lung transplantation is a valuable treatment option. If not treated by lung transplant, patients with AATD and a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) below 20% predicted have a 2-year mortality of 40%. Between 2011 and 2014, the median waiting list time for a lung transplant in the US was 226 days (95% confidence interval: 187, 268) for patients aged 35–49 years (last available data from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network). In May 2005, a new system was developed, and for the majority of patients, its introduction has reduced the time to lung transplant and the risk of death whilst on the waiting list.

### Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency targeted testing and augmentation therapy: a Canadian Thoracic Society meta-analysis and clinical practice guideline [^116qxunB]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency — genetic basis and associated respiratory risk notes that Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) is the major antiprotease in plasma and functions primarily to inhibit neutrophil elastase, and deficiency occurs because of the inheritance of two protease inhibitor (Pi) deficiency alleles in the SERPINA1 gene located on chromosome 14. The normal protein phenotype has been designated M, often expressed as Pi*M, and the most common proteins leading to circulating A1AT deficiency are Z and S caused by c.1096G > A (p.E342K) and c.863A > T (p.E264V), respectively. The presence of two deficiency alleles, most commonly Pi*ZZ, results in significantly reduced serum levels of A1AT and is associated with a markedly increased risk for the development of COPD, classically in the form of basilar, pan-lobular emphysema.

### Key current clinical issues in α-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^1126bLXc]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a common but under-recognized condition on which respiratory therapists can have a large impact. A key recent development is the issuance of an international evidence-based standards document regarding diagnosis and management of individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. This report summarizes that standards document, which recommends more widespread testing for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, in order to extend the benefits of diagnosis to individuals found to have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. An important aspect of the standards document is that evidence regarding the clinical efficacy of intravenous alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy is reviewed. Though no definitive support from a randomized clinical trial is available, the weight of evidence favors the clinical efficacy of alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy, at least in individuals with moderate degrees of established airflow obstruction. On that basis the standards document recommends intravenous augmentation therapy in specified clinical circumstances.

### Long-term clinical outcomes following treatment with alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor for COPD associated with α-1 antitrypsin deficiency: a look at the evidence [^111ch5fr]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Despite its limitations, FEV 1 has been used to stratify disease severity in COPD in general, and mortality risk in patients with AATD in particular. Findings of an early National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) registry study of patients with severe AATD (n = 1129) showed that, compared with patients not receiving active treatment, the use of A 1 -PI therapy was associated with lower mortality (risk ratio = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.43 to 0.94, p = 0.02). This benefit was particularly evident in those patients with a baseline FEV 1% predicted below 50%. More recent analysis of these data further stratified patients based on their baseline FEV 1 levels and other lung function parameters. A 1 -PI therapy was shown to be associated with improved survival in patients with baseline FEV 1% predicted < 20% (n = 161), < 30% (n = 424) and 30–65% (n = 444; p < 0.0001 for all); a benefit that was not observed in patients with baseline FEV 1% predicted > 65% (n = 258; p = 0.38). Nevertheless, for a clinical study using mortality as a primary endpoint, it has been estimated that 684 individuals with AATD and a baseline FEV 1 of 35–49% predicted would need to be followed in a 5-year study to detect a 40% reduction in mortality.

### A review of α ₁-antitrypsin deficiency [^113YZgjZ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

α(1)-Antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is an underrecognized genetic condition that affects approximately 1 in 2,000 to 1 in 5,000 individuals and predisposes to liver disease and early-onset emphysema. AAT is mainly produced in the liver and functions to protect the lung against proteolytic damage (e.g., from neutrophil elastase). Among the approximately 120 variant alleles described to date, the Z allele is most commonly responsible for severe deficiency and disease. Z-type AAT molecules polymerize within the hepatocyte, precluding secretion into the blood and causing low serum AAT levels (∼ 3–7 μM with normal serum levels of 20–53 μM). A serum AAT level of 11 μM represents the protective threshold value below which the risk of emphysema is believed to increase. In addition to the usual treatments for emphysema, infusion of purified AAT from pooled human plasma-so-called "augmentation therapy"-represents a specific therapy for AAT deficiency and raises serum levels above the protective threshold. Although definitive evidence from randomized controlled trials of augmentation therapy is lacking and therapy is expensive, the available evidence suggests that this approach is safe and can slow the decline of lung function and emphysema progression. Promising novel therapies are under active investigation.

### Long-term clinical outcomes following treatment with alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor for COPD associated with α-1 antitrypsin deficiency: a look at the evidence [^113GVxJ5]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a common hereditary disorder caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, which encodes alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT; also known as alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, A 1 -PI). Mutations within this gene can lead to the production of a misfolded protein that accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in reduced secretion, and hence reduced circulating levels, of A 1 -PI. In addition, variants can lead to a complete absence of protein product (null/null genotypes) or the production of normal levels of a dysfunctional protein (e.g. the F variant, which is associated with decreased binding to neutrophil elastase). An important function of A 1 -PI in the lung is to inhibit neutrophil elastase, one of various proteolytic enzymes released by activated neutrophils during inflammation. Therefore, absence or deficiency of A 1 -PI leads to an imbalance between elastase and anti-elastase activity. This results in progressive, irreversible destruction of lung tissue, and ultimately the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with early-onset emphysema, which increases the risk of crippling respiratory complaints and premature death.

### Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency: best clinical practice [^111toLXT]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

alpha(1)-Antitrypsin (AAT), a 52 kDa plasma protein, is produced mainly in the liver. It is the most abundant circulating serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin). It has also previously been called protease inhibitor to reflect its function as a general inhibitor of serine proteases. Its main physiological role is to inhibit neutrophil elastase and it contributes to the innate immune system as an anti-inflammatory protein. Severe AAT deficiency is most prevalent in northern Europeans affecting about 1 in 3000 of the population. AAT deficiency predisposes individuals who smoke to developing pulmonary emphysema in the fourth-fifth decade of adult life and to childhood cirrhosis in about 10% of cases, with the initial presentation being prolonged neonatal jaundice. The mean interval from presentation with symptoms to diagnosis in adults is about 8 years. The condition is under-recognised and under-diagnosed. The only effective current treatment for the severe liver disease that occurs in childhood currently is liver transplantation. Replacement therapy with purified AAT from human plasma is being used in clinical practice for the lung disease though it is not known whether this influences the outcome of this chronic condition. The liver pathology arises from intracellular polymerisation of mutant protein, and attenuation of polymerisation is a potential target for therapy.

### The prevalence of α-1 antitrypsin deficiency in Ireland [^113STRYt]. Respiratory Research (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that the Z and S allele frequencies in Ireland are among the highest in the world, with large numbers of individuals at risk of disease due to AATD in the Irish population. The vast majority of these individuals remain undetected. The importance of an early diagnosis of AATD cannot be over-emphasised as the resulting appropriate medical follow-up and lifestyle changes can help prevent or at least postpone the development of the lung and liver disease associated with this condition.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^113xh9nq]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

COPD definition and causes — chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition with chronic respiratory symptoms due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities causing persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction; COPD results from gene–environment–time interactions, with key environmental exposures including tobacco smoking and inhalation of toxic particles and gases from household and outdoor air pollution, and host factors, while mutations in the SERPINA1 gene leading to α1-antitrypsin deficiency are the most relevant (though epidemiologically rare) genetic risk factor and other low-effect genetic variants are associated with reduced lung function and COPD risk.

### Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency targeted testing and augmentation therapy: a Canadian Thoracic Society meta-analysis and clinical practice guideline [^111h6Tx3]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin augmentation trials — endpoint feasibility and design: The familiar forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) endpoint of many COPD trials is widely regarded as unfeasible because randomization of 700–1000 patients for a 5-year study period is not feasible; accordingly, the largest published randomized controlled trial has been the RAPID trial, a 2-year intervention in 180 patients, whose completion took 7 years and 24 international study sites, and a 5-year placebo-controlled trial based on FEV1 as the primary outcome is unlikely to happen. Computed tomography (CT) scan lung density has been proposed as a clinically relevant endpoint and has been shown to be more closely linked to survival than measures of lung function, such as FEV1.

### If all that you have is a hammer…: can we phenotype our patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? [^112Apr9w]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

There are limitations to the study, of course. Was there elevation of elastin breakdown products in subjects with mildly reduced alpha-1 antitrypsin levels? Was the accelerated loss of lung function linear or intermittent and related to exacerbations? Did carriers of the deficiency achieve the same acute phase response elevation of alpha-1 antitrypsin levels as their nondeficient counterparts? These and many other questions are beyond the scope of the published study and should stimulate further research.

Will this paper change our clinical approach to COPD? I hope so. This study reminds us once again that there is no single disease called COPD but a variety of injuries and pathophysiologic pathways that can produce persistent airflow limitation. The phenotype described by Ghosh and colleagues is associated with more emphysema and might therefore prompt us to assess oxygen requirements earlier than we might otherwise. This risk of unopposed protease activity might prompt increased vigilance to address exacerbations early. But there is no evidence that augmentation therapy plays a role in these mildly deficient patients with COPD. Alpha-1 antitrypsin purified from pooled blood donations remains a scarce and expensive resource. Perhaps the small molecule chaperones or recombinant alpha-1 antitrypsin now in development will become feasible and testable interventions for the carrier with COPD. For now, the study should remind us to screen routinely for the alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in all of our newly diagnosed patients with COPD, so as to detect the severely deficient individuals who are usually diagnosed late or not at all. As we do so, we will come to recognize the more common mildly deficient carrier, a distinct phenotype of COPD.

### Improving detection of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: role of the allergist [^115NuiSJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder that manifests as lung and/or liver disease. Because symptoms of AATD overlap with those of common pulmonary and hepatic conditions, AATD is often misdiagnosed, which has resulted in substantial underdiagnosis of AATD worldwide. Although screening patients for AATD is recommended, the lack of procedures to facilitate testing remains a barrier to accurate diagnosis of AATD. Delays in AATD diagnosis can worsen outcomes for patients by postponing appropriate disease-modifying treatments. Patients with AATD-related lung disease experience symptoms similar to other obstructive lung disorders and are often misdiagnosed for years. In addition to existing screening guidelines, we recommend that screening for AATD become a standard part of allergists' workups of patients with asthma and fixed obstructive disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis without known origin, and patients under consideration for treatment with biologics. This Rostrum article reviews screening and diagnostic tests available in the United States and emphasizes evidence-based strategies to increase testing frequency and improve AATD detection rates. We underscore the pivotal role of allergists in managing care for patients with AATD. Finally, we urge health care providers to be aware of potentially poor clinical outcomes among patients with AATD during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

### Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (carrier) as possible risk factor for development of colonic diverticula. A multicentre prospective case-control study: the ALADDIN study [^1152Vax8]. Colorectal Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

Connective tissue changes due to ageing or diseases leading to changes in the colonic wall are one theory for the development of diverticula. Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT), a protease inhibitor that protects connective tissue, possibly plays a role in the aetiology of diverticulosis. The aim of this study was to explore associations between the development of diverticula and A1AT deficiency.

Methods

This was a multicentre prospective case-control study. A total of 221 patients aged ≥ 60 years with acute abdominal pain undergoing abdominal CT were included and analysed. Patients with diverticula were defined as the research group, patients without diverticula as controls. Genotype analysis for A1AT deficiency was performed.

Results

Twenty-six of 221 (11.8%) patients were diagnosed with (being a carrier of) A1AT deficiency. A non-significant difference in prevalence between patients with and without diverticula was found, 20 (13.9%) of 144 vs 6 (7.8%) of 77, respectively, with a crude OR of 1.9 (95% CI 0.7–5.0; P = 0.186) and after adjustment for confounders an adjusted OR of 1.5 (95% CI 0.5–4.0; P = 0.466). A non-significant difference in 30-day mortality rate from acute diverticulitis between A1AT deficient patients (or carriers) and those without was observed: two (22.2%) of nine patients with A1AT deficiency vs 1 (1.8%) of 55 without.

Conclusion

We found no convincing evidence that A1AT deficiency plays a role in the aetiology of diverticulitis, although deficient patients and carriers had a higher mortality when experiencing diverticulitis. Diverticulitis is a multifactorial disease and larger numbers may be needed to explore the role of A1AT deficiency among other contributing factors.

### Increased risk of cholesteatoma in individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: a cohort study [^111EYVjU]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To estimate the risk of cholesteatoma in patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) compared to the general population using time-to-event analysis.

Methods

We conducted a nationwide nested cohort study identifying all patients with AATD in Denmark and subsequently matching each case with up to 10 controls based on age, sex, and municipality. Hazard ratios (HR) of cholesteatoma by AATD were calculated using Cox regression analysis adjusted for age and sex.

Results

The study identified 2702 individuals with AATD and 26,750 control subjects. Individuals with AATD versus controls had a HR for cholesteatoma surgery of 3.62 (95% CI: 1.93–6.80) and a HR for non-cholesteatoma surgery of 1.40 (1.04–1.89).

Conclusion

Individuals with AATD had a 3.6-fold increased risk of cholesteatoma surgery compared with matched controls without AATD. The data support that AATD contributes to pathophysiological processes underlying the development of cholesteatoma.

### COVID-19 infection in severe alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency: looking for a rationale [^117YSsGy]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are heterogeneous: 46.4% of patients admitted into hospital reported to have at least one comorbidity. Comorbidities such as COPD, diabetes, hypertension and malignancy predispose patients with Covid-19 to adverse clinical outcomes. Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder caused by pathological mutation(s) in the SERPINA1 gene resulting in an imbalance in proteinase activity which may lead to premature emphysema and COPD. Our aim was to investigate whether people with severe AAT deficiency (AATD) have an increased risk of (severe) COVID-19 infection. We collected data on COVID-19 symptoms, laboratory-confirmed infection, hospitalization and treatment by means of a telephone survey, directly administered to Italian severe AATD subjects in May 2020. We then compared our findings with data collected by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità on the total population in Italy during the same period. We found an higher frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort (3.8%) compared to national data regarding infection, thus giving severe AATD a relative risk of 8. 8 (95%CI 5.1–20,0; p < 0.0001) for symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the relative risk (RR) was higher in AATD patients with pre-existing lung diseases (RR 13.9; 95%CI 8.0–33.6; p < 0.001), but with a similar death rate (1 in 8, 12.5%) compared to the general population (13.9%; RR 0.9). These preliminary findings highlight the importance of close surveillance in the spread of COVID-19 in patients with severe AATD and underlines the need for further studies into the role of the antiprotease shield in preventing SARS-Cov-2 infection.

### Molecular pathogenesis of α-1-antitrypsin deficiency-associated liver disease: a meeting review [^112Hwh6m]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

In recent years, we have witnessed several important paradigm shifts in understanding the molecular basis of liver disease in alpha-1-antitrypsin (AT) deficiency. These shifts have become possible as a result of a number of advances in research on the cell biology of aggregation-prone mutant proteins and in research on the pathobiological mechanisms of liver disease in general. Late-breaking research in these areas was the subject of an AASLD/Alpha-1 Foundation Single Topic Conference in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 26 to 28, 2006. The conference was titled "Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency and Other Liver Diseases Caused by Aggregated Proteins". Investigators from all over the world, representing a broad array of scientific disciplines and perspectives, discussed the pathobiology of AT deficiency, mechanisms of cell injury in diseases associated with aggregation-prone proteins, pathways by which cells respond to protein aggregation and mislocalization, and mechanisms of liver injury in general and in diseases related to AT deficiency. A session of the meeting was devoted to novel therapeutic strategies being developed for AT deficiency as well as to strategies either in development or already being applied to the class of diseases associated with mutant proteins.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^116HJLcC]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Genetic factors — familial risk and α-1 antitrypsin deficiency — contribute to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) susceptibility. The best documented genetic risk factor for COPD is mutations in SERPINA1 leading to hereditary α-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). A European systematic review found AATD PiZZ genotypes in 0.12% of COPD patients (range 0.08–0.24%), with prevalence ranging from 1 in 408 in Northern Europe to 1 in 1,274 in Eastern Europe. For heterozygotes (MZ and SZ), careful sibling studies indicated no increased risk in the absence of smoking, although lung function was reduced in smokers compared to MZ siblings, and this is not an indication for augmentation therapy.

### Patient-focused drug development for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency… [^115vCNcK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Overview of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Individuals with AATD have low serum levels of alpha-1-antitrypsin). They have an increased risk of developing a form of chronic obstructive lung disease called emphysema, caused by damage to the small air sacs in the. clinical severity. A substantial percentage of individuals with severe AATD never develop symptomatic lung disease during their lifetimes. Others may develop the first signs and symptoms of lung disease between the ages of approximately 25 and 50 years, or older. Some AATD patients with emphysema have symptoms of asthma. Progression of emphysema in. AATD may lead to respiratory failure, a need for lung transplantation, and eventually death. The only specific medication approved for raising the blood levels of AAT in severe AATD patients with emphysema is weekly intravenous treatment with A1-PI, purified from human plasma.

 Participants with ATTD spoke about their ongoing struggle with shortness of breath while exercising or even at rest. They told of wheezing, productive coughing, frequent exacerbations, exhaustion and anxiety. Some participants, with liver disease, described their experiences with bleeding, failure to thrive, and complications caused by. medications received after liver transplantation.  Participants stressed that one of the biggest challenges to effective therapy was the cost of augmentation therapy and insurance limitations. They also mentioned the need for optimal dosing strategies, and the narrow range of treatment options, especially for liver- affected individuals. Other issues they cited were access to treatment, side effects,… She got and they banded her and it actually worked out really well. But she was very lucky. The physician who admitted her told her that it's an 80% mortality rate for that type of bleed.

### Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency carriers, tobacco smoke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer risk… [^113GEZNC]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Adjusted odds ratio of risk factors by smoking intensity. α1ATD indicates alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and ETS, environmental tobacco smoke. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. Adjusted odds ratios of risk factors by cell types of lung cancer. α1ATD indicates alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; AD, adenocarcinoma; BAC, bronchioalveolar carcinoma; SQCLC, squamous cell lung cancer; and SCLC, small cell lung cancer. We found a significantly increased lung cancer risk among α1ATD carriers from 2 parallel case-control comparisons: when patients were compared with unrelated controls, α1ATD carriers had a 70% higher risk of developing lung cancer than noncarriers.

In a further comparison of patients with their cancer-free siblings, we found a 2-fold increased lung cancer risk in α1ATD carriers. Stratified analysis by tumor histologic subtypes showed a significant increase for adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma among α1ATD carriers. Conclusion Our results suggest that α1ATD carriers are at a 70% to 100% increased risk of lung cancer and may account for 11% to 12% of the patients with lung cancer in our study. Light smokers were those who smoked for fewer than 20 pack-years; moderate smokers, between 20 and 40 pack-years; and heavy smokers, more than 40 pack-years. These carriers were at a 70% higher risk of developing lung cancer than the noncarriers. Among nonsmokers, ETS was associated with a 2-fold increase in lung cancer independent of α1ATD carrier status.

Compared with model 1, the risk for chronic bronchitis or emphysema was similar, whereas the risks associated with the different levels of smoking intensity were approximately doubled. When adding COPD to the model that included α1ATD and the other covariates, we found that the odds ratio for an increased lung cancer risk in α1ATD carriers was 2. 0, supporting an independent role of α1ATD state in lung cancer development.
