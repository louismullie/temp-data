## Question

what are potential etiologies for serous discharge from umbilicus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the potential etiologies (causes) of serous (clear, watery) umbilical discharge. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining "serous" umbilical discharge and its most likely embryologic sources. Then, I should verify which specific anomalies classically produce clear/urine-like effluent versus other discharge types. Next, I will review how to distinguish these entities clinically and with imaging. After that, I need to outline management strategies, including when conservative measures are acceptable and when excision is preferred. Finally, I will consider age-specific differentials and close with a concise synthesis and next-step recommendations, while double-checking key points against guidelines and case-based evidence [^113HpEug] [^114d8von].

> Let me first confirm the term "serous discharge". By "serous", I mean a clear, watery fluid at the umbilicus, often raising concern for urine leakage when a urachal communication exists; I should be careful not to conflate this with purulent, mucinous, or bloody effluent that points to different etiologies. The European Association of Urology–European Society of Paediatric Urology guideline explicitly lists "urine leakage from the umbilicus" and "umbilical discharge" among the clinical features of urachal remnants, supporting the link between clear discharge and urachal pathology, especially patent urachus, so serous fluid should immediately prompt me to consider a bladder–umbilicus fistula until proven otherwise [^113HpEug].

> I will now examine embryologic structures that can persist and cause umbilical drainage. Hold on, I should verify the two classic culprits. The urachus connects the fetal bladder to the umbilicus and normally involutes to the median umbilical ligament; failure of obliteration yields anomalies such as patent urachus, urachal sinus, diverticulum, and cyst, any of which can present with umbilical discharge depending on patency and infection status. Separately, the omphalomesenteric (vitelline) duct connects midgut to yolk sac and can persist as a patent duct, sinus, cyst, polyp, or Meckel's diverticulum with umbilical connection; however, its discharge character is typically enteric rather than purely serous, which I need to keep in mind as I sort the differential [^113HpEug] [^111WnHrU].

> Next, I should review which conditions most definitively produce clear or urine-like drainage. Patent urachus represents complete failure of urachal obliteration, creating a fistulous tract from bladder to umbilicus with clinical descriptions of "urine drainage from the umbilicus" or visible leakage at the umbilical site; voiding cystourethrography can confirm patency, and presentations range from neonates to adolescents and adults, so age does not exclude the diagnosis. Wait, let me verify examples: neonatal leakage cases and adolescent presentations are reported, and rare variants include bladder prolapse through a patent urachus presenting as an umbilical mass with urine leakage, further underscoring the spectrum of urachal patency and the consistency of serous/urine discharge in this entity [^114hpuEz] [^114Fr4gU] [^113SK299] [^113t5qFj] [^113HpEug].

> I need to check partial urachal anomalies that might still yield clear drainage. An umbilical urachal sinus, which is patulous at the umbilical end but not the bladder, can present with swelling and discharge at the umbilicus; when not secondarily infected, the effluent may be serous, although superinfection converts it to purulence. Urachal cysts tend to present with pain and infection but can intermittently drain to the umbilicus if they communicate, and imaging with ultrasound and CT helps define tract/cyst anatomy and extent; antenatally associated vesico-allantoic cysts may coexist with patent urachus and affect fluid accumulation and drainage patterns, so I should confirm tract connections before concluding etiology [^117E9YW7] [^114LvURc] [^113t5qFj].

> Hold on, let me reconsider omphalomesenteric duct (OMD) remnants as a source of clear fluid — I initially thought they could explain serous discharge, but that risks overgeneralizing. The typical discharge from a patent OMD or related remnant is green-brown, bubbling, sometimes foul, and may include flatus, reflecting enteric content, not true serous fluid; systematic review and case descriptions emphasize enteric character rather than clear transudate. That said, in rare circumstances, mucosal secretions could appear relatively clear; still, for a truly serous, water-like discharge, OMD etiologies are less likely than urachal patency, and I should prioritize urachal evaluation first [^111WnHrU] [^114527Ny].

> Next, I should review what to exclude when the effluent is not serous, so I do not misclassify. Purulent discharge raises omphalitis or infected urachal cyst; bloody discharge suggests etiologies like umbilical endometriosis with catamenial symptoms, while mucinous or purulent material with an intra-abdominal source could represent unusual pathologies such as appendiceal mucinous cystadenoma eroding to the umbilicus. I should double-check that intrapartum umbilical vessel rupture is not conflated with postnatal umbilical discharge presentations; it is a separate obstetric emergency rather than a cause of chronic umbilical drainage in infants or adults, but recognizing hemorrhagic differentials remains important to avoid anchoring bias [^114d8von] [^114LvURc] [^1122cTst] [^117TE7kn] [^112y9ZTQ] [^114FkX9E].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach, step by step, and I should confirm the sequence with available guidance. Start with careful inspection of the umbilicus and surrounding skin for erythema, granulation, sinus opening, mass, or hernia, and characterize the discharge; in infants, note any giant umbilical cord or mass that might hint at urachal pathology. Ultrasound is the initial imaging modality to identify urachal cysts or sinus tracts; if complexity or deep extension is suspected, CT can delineate the extent and exclude mimics such as actinomycosis or tumor. Critically, for suspected patent urachus, a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) documents bladder–umbilicus communication. If infection is present, obtain cultures and inflammatory markers to guide antibiotics, while avoiding delay in source control if abscess or necrotizing infection is suspected [^113HpEug] [^114LvURc] [^117E9YW7] [^1133WM6T] [^114hpuEz] [^114d8von] [^114ywxnN].

> Let me think about management tiers, and I should verify where conservative therapy is acceptable versus when surgery is indicated. For a neonate with patent urachus and stable anatomy, short-term urethral catheter drainage (1–2 weeks) can facilitate spontaneous closure; this is based on limited case-level evidence and must be followed by repeat VCUG to confirm resolution before abandoning surgical plans. Hold on, I should emphasize that most persistent urachal remnants, particularly beyond early infancy or when symptomatic, warrant complete excision (often with a bladder cuff) due to recurrence and the small but real risk of malignant transformation to urachal adenocarcinoma; minimally invasive approaches are reasonable in experienced hands. For infected urachal cysts or sinuses, treat infection first with antibiotics and drainage if needed, then proceed to interval excision to prevent recurrence and clarify pathology [^114hpuEz] [^113SK299] [^1133WM6T] [^112aRLXF] [^114LvURc].

> I need to ensure I cover age-specific considerations so clinicians can prioritize appropriately. In neonates and infants, patent urachus and OMD remnants are the primary congenital considerations when discharge is present, with patent urachus classically producing urine-like leakage and OMD remnants producing enteric material; giant umbilical cord or exophytic umbilical masses can be clues to urachal anomalies. In adults, while urachal anomalies can persist and present late with discharge or infection, differentials expand to include umbilical endometriosis in reproductive-age women and rare chronic infections such as actinomycosis masquerading as urachal carcinoma, so I should tailor workup by age and symptom profile [^114Fr4gU] [^114527Ny] [^113SK299] [^1122cTst] [^117TE7kn] [^1133WM6T].

> But wait, what if the discharge is intermittent and only with voiding or straining? That pattern strengthens suspicion for a patent urachus or a communicating urachal sinus; synchrony with micturition is particularly telling for true vesico-umbilical fistula, and VCUG timing with filling and voiding phases should be optimized to capture the tract. Conversely, discharge associated with feeding, straining, or flatus and green-brown character suggests an OMD fistula, for which targeted ultrasound and surgical exploration are often required both to treat and to exclude complications such as Meckel's diverticulum with heterotopic mucosa, which may alter operative planning and postoperative surveillance [^114hpuEz] [^111WnHrU] [^114527Ny].

> In conclusion, I should double-check that my synthesis aligns with the evidence. True serous, water-like umbilical discharge is most definitively explained by patent urachus — a complete bladder–umbilicus fistula — though partial urachal anomalies (umbilical sinus, occasionally cysts with communication) can also yield clear effluent when not infected; OMD remnants typically produce green-brown, enteric discharge and are less likely to account for purely serous fluid. Accurate diagnosis relies on meticulous examination plus imaging — ultrasound and CT for anatomy and VCUG to confirm vesical communication — followed by management ranging from brief catheter drainage with confirmatory imaging in select neonates to definitive surgical excision for persistent or complicated cases, with antibiotic therapy for superinfection. Age-tailored differentials and vigilance for mimics like endometriosis or actinomycosis help prevent delays and mismanagement [^113HpEug] [^114hpuEz] [^114LvURc] [^1133WM6T] [^1122cTst] [^111WnHrU].

Serous umbilical discharge most often arises from a **benign umbilical granuloma** or a **urachal remnant** (patent urachus [^114Fr4gU], urachal sinus, or cyst) [^114LvURc] [^113HpEug]. Other causes include omphalomesenteric duct remnants [^111WnHrU], omphalitis [^114d8von], umbilical hernia, endometriosis [^1122cTst], and iatrogenic injury [^111arnGG]. Evaluation should include a **focused exam, ultrasound, and culture**; management is cause-directed, with silver nitrate for granulomas, antibiotics for infection, and surgical excision for persistent embryonic remnants or endometriosis [^113HpEug] [^114d8von] [^1122cTst].

## Embryological remnants

### Urachal anomalies

In urachal anomalies, a **patent urachus** [^114Fr4gU] is a persistent urachal tract causing clear or serous, urine-like discharge and may even present with bladder prolapse through the umbilicus [^113t5qFj], whereas a **urachal sinus or cyst** [^114LvURc] results from partial urachal obliteration [^113HpEug] with intermittent serous discharge, often complicated by infection [^112aRLXF] or inflammation [^117E9YW7].

---

### Omphalomesenteric duct remnants

In omphalomesenteric duct remnants, a **persistent omphalomesenteric duct** [^111WnHrU] reflects failure of involution of the embryonic connection between the midgut and yolk sac, leading to serous or mucous discharge [^114527Ny] and sometimes umbilical polyps or granulation tissue [^113BSdHC].

---

## Infectious etiologies

In infectious etiologies, **omphalitis** [^114d8von] is an umbilical stump infection — typically in neonates [^115Dm3dn] — characterized by erythema, induration, and serous or purulent discharge and can progress to systemic infection if untreated [^1135qwVB]. **Chronic bacterial colonization** (e.g. hemolytic streptococcus) [^114ywxnN] can cause a persistent low-grade infection with chronic serous discharge.

---

## Inflammatory and granulomatous conditions

In inflammatory and granulomatous conditions, an **umbilical granuloma** is benign granulation tissue at the umbilicus and commonly causes serous discharge in infants, whereas **umbilical endometriosis** [^1122cTst] involves ectopic endometrial tissue at the umbilicus with cyclical serous or bloody discharge that correlates with menses [^117TE7kn].

---

## Hernias and structural abnormalities

In hernias and structural abnormalities, an **umbilical hernia** is a protrusion of intra-abdominal contents through the umbilical ring and may cause serous discharge when associated with irritation or minor trauma.

---

## Iatrogenic and traumatic causes

For iatrogenic and traumatic causes, **surgical or procedural trauma** — such as umbilical trocar insertion [^111arnGG] or other surgical interventions — can cause serous discharge due to local tissue injury or inflammation.

---

## Diagnostic approach

A structured **diagnostic approach** is essential:

- **Clinical examination**: Assess for erythema, induration, granulation tissue, hernia, or mass [^114d8von].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound [^113HpEug] is first-line to identify urachal or omphalomesenteric remnants, cysts, or hernias; CT or MRI may be needed for complex cases [^112aRLXF].

- **Laboratory tests**: Culture discharge to identify infectious organisms [^114d8von]; urinalysis if urine-like discharge suggests patent urachus [^114Fr4gU].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying etiology**:

| **Etiology** | **Management** |
|-|-|
| Urachal anomalies | Surgical excision of the urachal remnant; antibiotics if infected [^113HpEug] [^114LvURc] |
| Omphalomesenteric duct remnants | Surgical excision of the remnant [^111WnHrU] |
| Omphalitis | Systemic antibiotics; surgical intervention if severe or unresponsive [^114d8von] [^115Dm3dn] |
| Umbilical granuloma | Topical silver nitrate cauterization [^113BSdHC] |
| Umbilical endometriosis | Surgical excision; medical management for recurrence prevention [^1122cTst] [^117TE7kn] |
| Umbilical hernia | Surgical repair if symptomatic or persistent [^112bRWXh] |
| Iatrogenic or traumatic causes | Conservative management; surgical intervention if persistent or complicated [^111arnGG] |

---

Serous umbilical discharge has a broad differential — including embryological remnants, infection, inflammation, hernias, and trauma — and requires **targeted evaluation and cause-specific therapy** for resolution.

### Cutaneous presentations of omphalomesenteric duct remnant: A systematic review of the literature [^111WnHrU]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Disorders of the umbilicus are commonly seen in infancy, including hernias, infections, anomalies, granulomas, and malignancies. Meticulous inspection of the umbilicus at birth might reveal a persisting embryonic remnant, such as an omphalomesenteric duct (OMD), manifested by a variety of cutaneous signs, such as an umbilical mass, granulation tissue, or discharge.

- **Objective**: To systematically review the available data regarding the presence and management of OMD remnant with cutaneous involvement to suggest a practical approach for diagnosis and treatment.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of the literature evaluating OMD anomalies presenting with cutaneous symptoms was performed. In addition, an index case of an 11-month-old patient is presented.

- **Results**: We included 59 publications reporting 536 cases; 97% of the patients whose age was noted were infants (mean age 11 months). In 7.5% of the cases, diagnosis was established only after treatment failure. In 6.4% of patients, nonlethal complications were reported, and in 10.3%, the outcome was death, partly due to delayed diagnosis or mismanagement.

- **Limitations**: Limited quality of the collected data and reporting bias.

- **Conclusion**: OMD is relatively rare; however, the clinician must consider this remnant while examining patients with umbilical abnormalities because mismanagement could cause severe morbidity and mortality.

### Surgical management of umbilical endometrioma within an umbilical hernia [^1122cTst]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

In summary, umbilical endometriosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of umbilical tumors, and the workup should include a search for pelvic endometriosis. Surgical excision in this reported case had a 2-year recurrence-free interval but was complicated by a surgical site infection. Several umbilicoplasty techniques exist for optimal cosmesis. We agree with the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology guidelines, which state that surgical management is preferred for extrapelvic endometriosis as it removes the symptomatic mass and provides a histopathological diagnosis. Medical management may have a role in the treatment of umbilical endometriosis; however, further studies in cases of endometriosis in a hernia are warranted, as it may be futile to attempt medical therapy, prolonging time to surgery. The role of medical management after surgery to prevent recurrence also deserves further study, especially in the presence of pelvic endometriosis.

- **Learning points**: Recognize the prevalence of extrapelvic endometriosis in reproductive age women. Umbilical endometriosis usually presents with catamenial symptoms and can exist within an umbilical hernia. After complete surgical excision, individualized approaches to umbilical reconstruction based on patient and disease characteristics may be warranted.

The disease urachal remnant can be associated with abdominal pain, palpable abdominal mass, umbilical discharge, umbilical granulation tissue, fever, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), suprapubic pain, periumbilical abdominal pain, urine leakage from the umbilicus, vesicoureteral reflux, umbilical erythema, recurrent urinary tract infections (reUTIs), and abdominal tenderness.

### Omphalitis: Clinical presentation and approach to evaluation and management [^114d8von]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). High credibility.

Omphalitis is an uncommon but potentially serious infection in neonates. Findings include erythema and induration around the umbilical stump, and purulent drainage may be present. Fever and signs of systemic illness may occur, or there may only be signs of localized soft tissue infection. Until recently, there have been very few cohort studies of omphalitis in high-income countries, and no literature was available regarding the incidence of concurrent serious bacterial infection such as meningitis or urinary tract infection. A recent large, multicenter study suggests that most omphalitis presents as localized soft tissue infection, with very low rates of concurrent serious bacterial infection or adverse outcomes. Underlying urachal abnormalities should be considered in infants with umbilical drainage. Treatment of omphalitis consists primarily of antibiotic administration, with surgical intervention rarely needed. Although antibiotics are typically administered intravenously, there may be a role for oral antibiotics in some lower-risk infants with omphalitis.

### Impact of 4.0% chlorhexidine cleansing of the umbilical cord on mortality and omphalitis among newborns of Sylhet, Bangladesh: Design of a community-based cluster randomized trial [^116RkSYB]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization recommends dry cord care for newborns, but this recommendation may not be optimal in low-resource settings where most births occur in unclean environments and infections account for up to half of neonatal deaths. A previous trial in Nepal indicated that umbilical cord cleansing with 4.0% chlorhexidine could substantially reduce mortality and omphalitis risk, but policy changes await additional community-based data.

- **Methods**: The Projahnmo Chlorhexidine study was a three-year, cluster-randomized, community-based trial to assess the impact of three cord care regimens on neonatal mortality and omphalitis. Women were recruited mid-pregnancy, received a basic package of maternal and neonatal health promotion messages, and were followed to pregnancy outcome. Newborns were visited at home by local village-based workers whose areas were randomized to either single or 7-day cord cleansing with 4.0% chlorhexidine, or promotion of dry cord care as recommended by WHO. All mothers received messages regarding hand-washing, clean cord cutting, and avoidance of harmful home-based applications to the cord. Death within 28 days and omphalitis were the primary outcomes; these were monitored directly through home visits by community health workers on days 1, 3, 6, 9, 15, and 28 after birth.

- **Discussion**: Due to report in early 2010, the Projahnmo Chlorhexidine Study examines the impact of multiple or single chlorhexidine cleansing of the cord on neonatal mortality and omphalitis among newborns of rural Sylhet District, Bangladesh.

### Effect of timing of umbilical cord clamping and other strategies to influence placental transfusion at preterm birth on maternal and infant outcomes [^114kBvz5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Infants born preterm (before 37 weeks' gestation) experience poorer outcomes than those born at term, particularly if born before 32 weeks. Early cord clamping has been standard practice for many years and enables quick transfer of the infant to neonatal care. Delayed clamping allows blood flow between the placenta, umbilical cord, and baby to continue and may aid transition. Keeping the baby at the mother's side enables neonatal care with the cord intact, and this, along with delayed clamping, may improve outcomes. Umbilical cord milking (UCM) is proposed for increasing placental transfusion when immediate care for the preterm baby is needed. This Cochrane Review is a further update of a review first published in 2004 and updated in 2012.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects on infants born at less than 37 weeks' gestation, and their mothers, of: 1) delayed cord clamping (DCC) compared with early cord clamping (ECC), both with immediate neonatal care after cord clamping; 2) DCC with immediate neonatal care with the cord intact compared with ECC with immediate neonatal care after cord clamping; 3) DCC with immediate neonatal care after cord clamping compared with UCM; 4) UCM compared with ECC with immediate neonatal care after cord clamping.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register.

### Baby-directed umbilical cord clamping: A feasibility study [^115JTLm2]. Resuscitation (2018). Low credibility.

Over five percent of infants born worldwide will need help breathing after birth. Delayed cord clamping (DCC) has become the standard of care for vigorous infants. However, DCC in non-vigorous infants is uncommon due to logistical difficulties in providing effective resuscitation during DCC. In baby-directed umbilical cord clamping (Baby-DUCC), the umbilical cord remains patent until the infant's lungs are exchanging gases. We conducted a feasibility study of the Baby-DUCC technique.

- **Methods**: We obtained antenatal consent from pregnant women to enroll infants born at ≥ 32 weeks. Vigorous infants received ≥ 2 minutes of DCC. If the infant received respiratory support, the umbilical cord was clamped ≥ 60 seconds after the colorimetric carbon dioxide detector turned yellow. Maternal uterotonic medication was administered after umbilical cord clamping. A pediatrician and researcher entered the sterile field to provide respiratory support during a cesarean birth. Maternal and infant outcomes in the delivery room and prior to hospital discharge were analyzed.

- **Results**: Forty-four infants were enrolled, 23 delivered via cesarean section (8 unplanned), and 15 delivered vaginally (6 via instrumentation). Twelve infants were non-vigorous. ECG was the preferred method for recording HR. Two infants had a HR of 100 BPM by 80 seconds after birth. Median time to umbilical cord clamping was 150 and 138 seconds in vigorous and non-vigorous infants, respectively. Median maternal blood loss was 300 ml.

- **Conclusions**: It is feasible to provide resuscitation to term and near-term infants using the Baby-DUCC technique.

### Impact of 4.0% chlorhexidine cleansing of the umbilical cord on mortality and omphalitis among newborns of Sylhet, Bangladesh: Design of a community-based cluster randomized trial [^112gnFtG]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

All live-born babies in the study area were eligible for the study (Figure 2). Babies were enrolled if they were alive at the time of the VHWs' first home visit and if this first visit occurred within 7 days after birth. All enrolled babies are included in the primary intent-to-treat analysis, regardless of the status of receipt of the allocated intervention.

Some pregnant women delivered in a location other than where the initial pregnancy was identified and data collected. For example, in this region, approximately 15% of women move late in pregnancy to deliver at their maternal home, and 10–12% deliver in a health facility. In this trial, all neonates were assigned the treatment code corresponding to the cluster in which they were born, regardless of whether the birth cluster matched the one in which the mother was first enrolled. Infants born in a facility were enrolled in the cluster in which they were first met after returning from the facility. That is, infants born alive in a facility were eligible and included in the primary analysis if enrolled (i.e. if they were met at home by a project worker during the first seven days of life).

- **Trial design flowchart**: See Figure 2.

- **Outcome measures**: The two primary outcomes of this trial were neonatal mortality and omphalitis among live-born enrolled infants. Neonatal mortality was defined as death within the first 28 days after birth. The sample size calculation (see Sample Size) was based on the detection of mortality differences among enrolled infants.

### Umbilical cord bilirubin as a predictor of neonatal jaundice: A retrospective cohort study [^114Ea5us]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinaemia is one of the most common causes of hospital admission in the neonatal period among term babies in all settings. Prevention of serious complications depends on effective early treatment, but clinically significant jaundice may not develop until one or more days after delivery. The practice of promoting early discharge after delivery may introduce delays in the recognition and initiation of medical therapy. Identification of biomarkers that could be measured within a few hours following birth, which robustly predict incident jaundice, would represent a significant advance.

The estimation of umbilical cord blood bilirubin (UCB) at delivery is practicable, cheap, and non-invasive. It could be easily integrated with the trend towards routine umbilical cord blood biochemical evaluation practiced in many centers. Several previous studies have investigated the potential utility of UCB estimation in predicting subsequent hyperbilirubinaemia. Results have been inconsistent, and a review by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) concluded that it was not a useful index of risk.

In this study, we exploited the fact that at our institution, UCB estimation is routine and performed a retrospective analysis to assess the potential utility of arterial umbilical cord bilirubin (aUCB) in predicting clinically significant hyperbilirubinaemia and hyperbilirubinaemia due to neonatal haemolytic disease.

### Impact of 4.0% chlorhexidine cleansing of the umbilical cord on mortality and omphalitis among newborns of Sylhet, Bangladesh: Design of a community-based cluster randomized trial [^113PXXit]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Of the annual 3.7 million global neonatal deaths, almost all (99%) occur in developing countries, and one-third to one-half are attributed to infections such as sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, omphalitis, tetanus, and diarrhea. In settings where home delivery is common and the attendance by skilled personnel is low, many babies are born in unhygienic conditions, leading to common infections of the umbilical cord stump. Exposure of the freshly cut umbilical cord stump to pathogens on the cutting instrument, on the hands of caretakers, or elsewhere in the environment leads to local cord infections (omphalitis) that may progress to systemic infection and death. Alternatively, during the period immediately following birth, while the vessels of the umbilical cord remain patent, direct exposure to the bloodstream via the cord may lead to systemic infection without any visible signs of local cord infection.

### Surgical retrieval of transected umbilical vein catheter in an extremely preterm neonate [^1133Ptdh]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Umbilical catheters are used in the care of critically ill neonates for intravenous treatment. It is generally considered a safe procedure, although complications can occur. Of these complications, catheter breakage and intravenous migration are rare but potentially life-threatening events. Due to the low frequency at which these events occur, obtaining detailed descriptions of removal techniques can pose a challenge. Here, we describe a case of a broken umbilical vein catheter and the surgical retrieval of the retained fragment. We also present a thorough literature search of cases of broken umbilical catheters and the method by which they were removed.

### Effect of timing of umbilical cord clamping and other strategies to influence placental transfusion at preterm birth on maternal and infant outcomes [^114L9LJC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

Optimal timing for clamping the umbilical cord at preterm birth is unclear. Early clamping allows for immediate transfer of the infant to the neonatologist, while delaying clamping allows blood flow to continue between the placenta, the umbilical cord, and the baby. The blood that transfers to the baby between birth and cord clamping is known as placental transfusion, which may improve circulating volume at birth and in turn, improve outcomes for preterm infants.

- **Objectives**: To assess the short- and long-term effects of early versus delayed clamping or milking of the umbilical cord for infants born at less than 37 completed weeks' gestation, and their mothers.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register as of 31 May 2011. We updated this search on 26 June 2012 and added the results to the awaiting classification section.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing early with delayed clamping of the umbilical cord and other strategies to influence placental transfusion for births before 37 completed weeks' gestation were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three review authors assessed eligibility and trial quality.

- **Main results**: Fifteen studies (738 infants) were eligible for inclusion. Participants were between 24 and 36 weeks' gestation at birth. The maximum delay in cord clamping was 180 seconds. Delaying cord clamping was associated with fewer infants requiring transfusions for anaemia (seven trials, 392 infants; risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.81).

### Umbilical cord accidents: Human studies [^113EGZF3]. Seminars in Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

Research is needed to determine the cause of unexplained stillbirth. Sudden antenatal death syndrome is an important national issue that requires more scrutiny. Umbilical cord accidents as a causative factor of stillbirth require intensive investigation. Evidence supports a role of the umbilical cord in a portion of stillbirth cases, and theory suggests additional causes. This article summarizes the known information relating to umbilical cord accidents and stillbirth, highlighting the research needs.

### A case of appendiceal mucinous cystadenoma which presented as painless purulent umbilical discharge [^112y9ZTQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 57-year-old obese, diabetic woman presented with a one-day history of purulent umbilical discharge. She was vitally stable and afebrile. Abdominal examination revealed a full abdomen with purulent discharge from the umbilicus, swelling with erythema, and induration surrounding the umbilicus. Lab tests were normal.

The initial impression was an abdominal wall abscess. Ultrasound showed subcutaneous fluid collection. Non-contrast CT showed collection and an abdominal wall defect at the umbilicus. On exploration of the abscess cavity, there were two defects (umbilical and supraumbilical) with the appendix protruding through the umbilical defect and part of a small bowel and omentum adherent to the other defect. Wash was given, the bowel and omentum were released, and appendectomy was performed. Histopathology showed mucinous cystadenoma with periappendicitis.

We would like to highlight the rare occurrence of an appendiceal mucinous cystadenoma in such a clinical presentation.

### Necrotizing funisitis and calcification of umbilical vein: Case report and review [^111tgVS6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Necrotizing funisitis (NF) is a rare, chronic stage of funisitis, which is a severe inflammation of the umbilical cord and an important risk factor for adverse fetal outcomes. NF is characterized by yellow-white bands running parallel to the umbilical blood vessels. These bands consist of inflammatory cells, necrotic debris, and calcium deposits. Calcification is visible in ultrasonography, making it possible to suspect NF when umbilical vascular wall calcification is detected by prenatal ultrasonography.

- **Case presentation**: Ultrasonography revealed calcification of the umbilical venous wall in an expectant 31-year-old woman who was gravida 1, para 0. The woman required an emergency cesarean section because of fetal distress and suspected umbilical cord torsion at 31 weeks gestation. The root of the umbilical cord was quite fragile and broke during the operation. The pathological results on the placenta showed histologic chorioamnionitis and NF. The infant was diagnosed with neonatal sepsis and acidosis after delivery but was discharged without severe complications following a one-month hospitalization that included antibiotic and supportive therapy.

- **Conclusion**: NF is a rare and severe inflammation of the umbilical cord. Umbilical vascular wall calcification discovered in prenatal ultrasonography is diagnostically helpful.

### Primary actinomycosis mimicking urachal carcinoma [^1133WM6T]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

We report a case of urachal actinomycosis that presented with a progressively enlarging infraumbilical mass associated with umbilical discharge. Computed tomography revealed an extraperitoneal mass involving the dome of the bladder. The possible diagnoses included a malignant urachal neoplasm or a chronic inflammatory mass. Partial cystectomy and excision of the mass were performed. The pathologic examination revealed actinomycosis. The patient was treated with a 6-month course of antibiotics, and no recurrence was noted 1 year postoperatively.

### Antenatal diagnosis of chorioamnionitis: A review of the potential role of fetal and placental imaging [^116uRHkw]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Low credibility.

Chorioamnionitis is acute inflammation of the chorion with or without involvement of the amnion and serves as evidence of a maternal immunological response to infection. A fetal inflammatory response can coexist and is diagnosed histopathologically when chorionic vasculitis, umbilical phlebitis, or funisitis are present. Detection of a fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS) is associated with poorer outcomes for infants compared to gestation-matched infants without FIRS. Overall, chorioamnionitis is implicated in up to 4% of term deliveries, but up to 70% of spontaneous preterm deliveries.

Chorioamnionitis has significant implications for both mother and fetus. In the mother, sepsis can ensue, culminating in intensive care admission and maternal death. Although all fetuses born extremely preterm are at higher risk of mortality, respiratory, neurological, and gastroenterological morbidity, these risks are increased in the presence of chorioamnionitis. It has been demonstrated that this may, at least in part, be due to the activation of a fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS) that results in marked immune changes that ultimately affect multi-organ development.

Currently, there is no non-invasive antenatal diagnostic test in clinical practice for chorioamnionitis that is recognized internationally as safe for, and acceptable to, women. Amniocentesis for assessment of the amniotic cavity is the gold standard for intra-amniotic infection; it is not routinely used in clinical practice as it is an invasive procedure associated with an increased risk of preterm birth.

### Caldolor [^112kfRki]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Clinical considerations:

- **Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions**:
	- **Premature closure of fetal ductus arteriosus**: Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including Caldolor, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see data).

	- **Oligohydramnios/neonatal renal impairment**: If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If Caldolor treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue Caldolor and follow up according to clinical practice (see data).

- **Labor or delivery**: There are no studies on the effects of Caldolor during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth.

- **Human data**:
	- **Premature closure of fetal ductus arteriosus**: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.

	- **Oligohydramnios/neonatal renal impairment**: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours.

### Bladder prolapse through a patent urachus presenting as an umbilical mass in the newborn: Characteristic prenatal sonographic findings and the diagnostic benefit of postnatal cystography [^113t5qFj]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Bladder prolapse through a patent urachus is a rare condition. In this case, we present a newborn with an unusual exophytic, erythematous umbilical mass. Voiding cystography readily demonstrated the continuity of the bladder dome with the umbilical mass, confirming bladder prolapse through a patent urachus. The diagnosis of bladder prolapse was rapidly made in a second newborn with similar imaging and clinical findings and was confirmed by cystography. We discuss the embryology of this condition, including the association with a vesico-allantoic cyst in utero. Pre- and postnatal images are presented. The use of cystography in diagnosis is emphasized.

### Nonoperative management of a patent urachus [^114hpuEz]. Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Patent urachus accounts for 10% to 15% of all reported urachal abnormalities in the literature. Treatment in the past has relied on immediate surgery. Conservative therapy with bladder catheter drainage, resulting in spontaneous closure, has not been described. We report a case of patent urachus in a 6-day-old infant who presented with urine drainage from the umbilicus. Radiographic studies confirmed a patent urachus. One week of urethral catheterization resulted in spontaneous closure of the patent urachus. This case suggests that initial treatment should consist of urethral catheterization for 1 to 2 weeks, followed by repeat voiding cystourethrogram. If the patent urachus still persists, one should proceed to surgical correction.

### Adverse outcomes of nonnuchal umbilical cord entanglement [^11512wSS]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Low credibility.

To evaluate the perinatal effects of umbilical cord entanglement (UCE) of different body parts, the database of a tertiary medical center was retrospectively searched for women who gave birth to a liveborn singleton newborn between 2014 and 2018. Those diagnosed postpartum with UCE were matched 1:10 with women who were not, and they were compared for adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes, both overall and by site of entanglement.

A total of 14,299 women were evaluated, of whom 1,243 were diagnosed with UCE: 78.7% neck, 26% trunk, and 6.7% limb. UCE was associated with lower birth weight percentile and higher rate of small for gestational age; however, findings were significant only for neck and trunk UCE. On multivariate regression analysis, adjusted for maternal age, parity, gestational age at birth, and history of cesarean delivery, UCE was identified as an independent risk factor for nonreassuring fetal heart rate, labor induction, operative vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery, and meconium-stained amniotic fluid, but not for lower absolute birth weight/birth weight percentile, small for gestational age, low 1-minute Apgar score, or neonatal asphyxia.

While fetuses with UCE might be more compromised during labor, they apparently recover shortly after birth. The impact on perinatal outcomes was similar for UCE of the neck and trunk and lower for UCE of the limb.

### Necrotizing funisitis and calcification of umbilical vein: case report and review [^112SQPt7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Necrotizing funisitis (NF) is a rare, chronic stage of funisitis, which is a severe inflammation of the umbilical cord and an important risk factor for fetal adverse outcomes. NF is characterized by yellow-white bands running parallel to the umbilical blood vessels. These bands consist of inflammatory cells, necrotic debris, and calcium deposits. Calcification is visible in ultrasonography, making it possible to suspect NF when umbilical vascular wall calcification is detected by prenatal ultrasonography.

- **Case presentation**: Ultrasonography revealed calcification of the umbilical venous wall in an expectant 31-year-old woman who was gravida 1, para 0. The woman required an emergency cesarean section because of fetal distress and suspected umbilical cord torsion at 31 weeks gestation. The root of the umbilical cord was quite fragile and broke during the operation. The pathological results on the placenta showed histologic chorioamnionitis and NF. The infant was diagnosed with neonatal sepsis and acidosis after delivery but was discharged without severe complications following a one-month hospitalization that included antibiotic and supportive therapy.

- **Conclusion**: NF is a rare and severe inflammation of the umbilical cord. Umbilical vascular wall calcification discovered in prenatal ultrasonography is diagnostically helpful.

### Spontaneous umbilical cord vascular rupture during labor: A retrospective analysis of 12 cases [^114FkX9E]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Low credibility.

Regarding the delivery mode, 2 cases involved vaginal delivery, while the remaining 10 required emergency termination of pregnancy: 3 via forceps delivery and 7 through emergency cesarean section. The BDI ranged from 6 to 26 minutes.

- **Clinical characteristics**: Of the 12 cases, 5 had velamentous cord insertion (VCI) and three had marginal cord insertion (MCI). No cases of excessively short umbilical cords were observed, but seven had relatively short cords (37–50 cm) with entanglement. Eight cases showed ruptured umbilical vessels or their branches (fetal surface vessels) with bloody amniotic fluid, while four exhibited an umbilical cord or subchorionic hematoma on the fetal side of the placenta. Macroscopic examination of the placentas revealed vein rupture in six cases, with unspecified vessel types in the rest.

- **Ultrasound findings**: Fig. 3 illustrates the second-trimester ultrasound image of Case 9, demonstrating a VCI. The white arrow points to the location of the umbilical cord insertion, while the red arrow indicates the amniotic membrane and the green arrow denotes the placenta.

Three cases (Cases 2, 4, and 10) had undetectable FHR upon discovery, leading to two stillbirths and one neonatal death. Ultrasonography detected isolated valvular motion in these fetuses before immediate intervention.

Postpartum bleeding, discharge, infection

Complaint of abnormal vaginal and/or vulvo-perineal bleeding, mucus or pus discharge during the postpartum period and up to 12 months after delivery.

- **Obstetric pelvic floor trauma related sexual dysfunction symptoms**:

	- **Postpartum dyspareunia**: Complaint of pain or discomfort associated with attempted or complete vaginal penetration during the postpartum period and up to 12 months after delivery.

	- **Postpartum vaginal laxity**: Feeling of vaginal looseness during the postpartum period and up to 12 months after delivery.

	- **Postpartum obstructed intercourse**: New onset difficulty or obstruction of vaginal intercourse that occurs during the postpartum period and within 12 months after delivery.

	- **Postpartum anorgasmia or difficulty in achieving orgasm**: Complaint of lack of orgasm during the postpartum period and within 12 months after delivery; difficulty, delay in, or absence of attaining orgasm following sufficient sexual stimulation and arousal, which causes personal distress.

	- **Postpartum decreased arousal**: Inability to achieve or maintain sexual excitement during the postpartum period and within 12 months after delivery. This may be expressed as lack of excitement, lack of lubrication, lack of vaginal and clitoral engorgement, or lack of expression of other somatic responses.

	- **Postpartum decreased libido or sexual desire**: Absent or diminished feelings of sexual interest or desire, absent sexual thoughts or fantasies, and a lack of response.

### Effect of timing of umbilical cord clamping of term infants on maternal and neonatal outcomes [^117XNpgT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). High credibility.

Policies for timing of cord clamping vary, with early cord clamping generally carried out in the first 60 seconds after birth, whereas later cord clamping usually involves clamping the umbilical cord more than one minute after birth or when cord pulsation has ceased. The benefits and potential harms of each policy are debated.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effects of early cord clamping compared with late cord clamping after birth on maternal and neonatal outcomes.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (13 February 2013).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing early and late cord clamping.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted data.

- **Main results**: We included 15 trials involving a total of 3911 women and infants. We judged the trials to have an overall moderate risk of bias.

	- **Maternal outcomes**: No studies in this review reported on maternal death or severe maternal morbidity. There were no significant differences between early versus late cord clamping groups for the primary outcome of severe postpartum haemorrhage (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.65; five trials with data for 2066 women with a late clamping event rate (LCER) of ~3.5%, I(2) 0%) or for postpartum haemorrhage of 500 mL or more (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.44; five trials, 2260 women with an LCER of ~12%, I(2) 0%). There were no significant differences between subgroups depending on the use of uterotonic drugs.

### Mononessa [^111fQqPy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

What are the most common side effects of MonoNessa or TriNessa? Headache (migraine), breast pain or tenderness, enlargement or discharge, stomach pain, discomfort, and gas, vaginal infections and discharge, mood changes, including depression, nervousness, changes in weight, and skin rash are prevalent side effects.

These are not all the possible side effects of MonoNessa or TriNessa. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1–800-FDA-1088.

- **What else should I know about taking MonoNessa or TriNessa**: If you are scheduled for any lab tests, inform your healthcare provider that you are taking MonoNessa or TriNessa, as certain blood tests may be affected. Note that MonoNessa or TriNessa does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections.

- **How should I store MonoNessa or TriNessa**: Store at room temperature between 68°F to 77°F (20°C to 25°C) and keep it out of the reach of children. Store away from light.

- **General information about the safe and effective use of MonoNessa or TriNessa**: Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a Patient Information leaflet. Do not use MonoNessa or TriNessa for conditions other than those prescribed. Do not give MonoNessa or TriNessa to others, even if they have the same symptoms.

### Recognising serious umbilical cord anomalies [^116ixtY1]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Umbilical vessel catheterisation is a common intervention in neonatal care. Many complications are recognised, some of which are life-threatening. We report the case of a term neonate who was compromised at birth following antepartum haemorrhage with evidence of multiorgan ischaemic injury. Following resuscitation and umbilical vessel catheterisation, she developed pneumoperitoneum. At laparotomy, a patent vitellointestinal duct was identified and resected. Intestinal perforation was found in the duct wall, most plausibly explained by the unintentional catheterisation of the duct via the umbilicus. Learning to recognise umbilical cord anomalies, such as a patent vitellointestinal duct, can be simple and could prevent potentially serious complications.

### Knots of the umbilical cord: Incidence, diagnosis, and management [^115xzp17]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Low credibility.

Knots of the umbilical cord have received emphasis because clinical assessments and sonographic literature show a crucial role in fetal outcomes. A true umbilical cord knot can occur in a singleton pregnancy or as an entanglement of two umbilical cords in monoamniotic twins. Clinical manifestations are almost silent, which can pose clinical challenges. These knots can worsen outcomes and may easily be missed during prenatal visits because ultrasonographers do not usually focus on the cord during an obstetric ultrasound scan. However, most medical centers now have ultrasound machines that improve fetal assessment. The umbilical cord should be routinely evaluated during a fetal assessment. Suspicion of an umbilical cord knot can be more frequently diagnosed and is often detected only incidentally. Clinical outcomes are usually good but depend on the knot's characteristics and whether it is tight or loose.

In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology, theories on formation, main risk factors, ultrasound signs and findings, different opinions on management, and features related to pregnancy outcomes.

### Impact of 4.0% chlorhexidine cleansing of the umbilical cord on mortality and omphalitis among newborns of Sylhet, Bangladesh: Design of a community-based cluster randomized trial [^115chGLu]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

After being notified of an ongoing labor or recent delivery, the local VHW traveled to the home of the newborn to deliver the assigned intervention. Depending on the cord care regimen randomly allocated to that location (i.e. cluster), the VHW either provided the standard set of dry cord care promotional messages (dry cord care group) or applied the initial cleansing of the cord (single and multiple cleansing groups). VHWs in all groups visited the home of the newborn daily through the first week of life (i.e. 7 days) and promoted basic messages about cord hygiene across all groups at these visits.

In addition, the VHW provided the chlorhexidine cleansing intervention at each visit in the multiple-cleansing arm and at the first visit only in the single-cleansing arm. Each individual VHW consistently followed only one set of procedures throughout the trial period, as the unit of randomization was the area (cluster) of the VHW's supervising CHW. The VHW recorded the date and approximate time of visits, the vital status of the baby (alive/dead), and the status of the intervention for that day (provided, refused) on a pictorial form.

### Umbilical cord management in newborn resuscitation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114yDkod]. Pediatric Research (2025). Low credibility.

The systematic search yielded 17,141 articles. Following duplicate removal and selection processes, we identified 11 eligible studies and an additional one by reference and citation search. In a subset of the qualified papers, the study population included infants for whom it was either uncertain or unnecessary to administer any form of resuscitation following birth. After contacting the corresponding authors for more detailed data, we included one more study in the analysis. In one article, we successfully obtained the necessary information needed to determine the total sample size for in-hospital mortality.

In conclusion, a total of six RCTs were included in our quantitative analysis, along with ten RCTs and two observational studies in the systematic review. Details and results of the studies included in the systematic review are summarized in Supplementary Table 3.

### Umbilical cord milking and delayed cord clamping for the prevention of neonatal hypoglycaemia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111q9fo2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

- **Secondary outcomes**: The evidence suggests that umbilical cord milking (UCM) may result in little to no difference in admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (3 studies, 336 infants, RR = 1.22, CI: 0.37–4.08, p = 0.74, I² = 0%).

- **Neurodevelopmental impairment**: Evidence from two studies suggests that UCM does not reduce the risk of neurodevelopmental impairment at 18–26 months (196 infants, RR = 2.16, CI: 0.73 to 6.37, p = 0.16, I² = 0%). A further five studies assessed the effect of UCM on neurodevelopmental outcomes at various ages, but meta-analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneous nature of the assessment methods and outcome interpretation. Of the five studies, one reported statistically significantly improved motor outcome after UCM at 18–22 months of age. The remaining four studies reported no difference in developmental outcomes between the intervention and control groups at 12 months, 22–26 months, 36 months, and 2 to 3.5 years.

- **Neonatal mortality**: In the 11 studies that reported neonatal mortality data, 76 out of 1,378 infants died before discharge. The evidence suggests that UCM results in little to no difference in neonatal mortality (RR = 0.79, CI: 0.44 to 1.41, p = 0.42, I² = 27%).

- **Length of hospital stay**: Evidence from eight studies suggests that UCM may result in little to no difference in the length of hospital stay.

### Umbilical cord milking and delayed cord clamping for the prevention of neonatal hypoglycaemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114NqByG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). High credibility.

Receipt of treatment for hypoglycaemia during initial hospital stay: DCC may not reduce the receipt of treatment for hypoglycaemia during the initial hospital stay (RR 0.14, 95% CI: 0.01 to 2.68, p = 0.19). One study of women with gestational diabetes who gave birth to term infants (> 37 weeks gestation) reported that no infants in the DCC group (cord clamping 60 seconds after birth, n = 40) required treatment (defined as glucose infusion) for hypoglycaemia, compared to three infants in the ECC group (cord clamped as early as possible, n = 40). This evidence was graded as low certainty.

Severity of hypoglycaemia: The same study reported that 0 out of 40 infants in the DCC group had severe hypoglycaemia (blood glucose < 1.4 mmol/L), compared to 2 out of 40 (5%) in the ECC group. This evidence was graded as low certainty. DCC may not reduce the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia (RR 0.20, 95% CI: 0.01 to 4.04, p = 0.29).

Breastfeeding at discharge: DCC may result in little to no difference in breastfeeding at discharge (5 studies, 1,564 infants, RR = 1.04, CI: 0.99 to 1.09, p = 0.14, I^2 = 0%, low certainty evidence).

Neurodevelopmental impairment: Data from two studies and 1,448 infants suggest that DCC results in little to no difference in neurodevelopmental impairment at 12–24 months (RR = 0.86, CI: 0.71 to 1.04, p = 0.11, I^2 = 0%).

### Persistent omphalomesenteric duct in an infant with trisomy 21 [^114527Ny]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

We present the case of a term newborn with trisomy 21 who presented to the paediatric emergency department with periumbilical flare and green-brown discharge from a clamped umbilical cord, initially suspected to be omphalitis. However, it was noticed later that when the infant strained or cried, a thick, bubbling, and offensive green-brown discharge came out of the clamped umbilical cord with umbilical flatus. An ultrasound of the abdomen and umbilical cord confirmed the presence of a persistent omphalomesenteric duct (POMD). He was then transferred to the paediatric surgical unit where he underwent a laparotomy and surgical resection of the POMD and was discharged home two days later.

### Delayed interval delivery in a quadruplet pregnancy: A case report and literature review [^114HWFb7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

At 23 3/7 weeks of pregnancy, a small amount of vaginal liquid was leaked. It was confirmed via speculum examination, suggesting amniotic fluid leakage. Laboratory examinations revealed the presence of mildly elevated white blood cell count (11.1×10^9/L) and C-reactive protein (18.94 mg/L, with an upper normal laboratory limit of 10 mg/L). Chorioamnionitis was highly suspected, and amniocentesis was recommended to confirm the diagnosis. However, the patient declined amniocentesis and requested to continue the pregnancy. Informed consent was obtained.

At 25 4/7 weeks of pregnancy, the culture of vaginal discharge was suggestive of Candida albicans infection, and clotrimazole vaginal tablets were given for intravaginal placement.

At 25 6/7 weeks of pregnancy, a large amount of streaky discharge was observed, and the cervix was dilated about 6 cm. Cervical cerclage was removed, and a male fetus was delivered, weighing 735 g, with Apgar scores of 6 at the first minute and 8 at 5 minutes, and transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for treatment. Then uterine contractions gradually decreased, and no signs of active labor were noticed. After informing the patient and family in detail of the possible benefits and complications, they chose to delay the delivery of the other fetuses. Cervical cerclage was performed after high ligation of the umbilical cord, and the vagina was rinsed with iodophor. Ritodrine hydrochloride and indomethacin were used to prolong pregnancy, and antibiotic therapy (cefazolin and metronidazole) was continued while continuously monitoring the patient and fetuses.

### Umbilical cord anomalies: Antenatal ultrasound findings and postnatal correlation [^117V6m9D]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Umbilical cord anomalies are rare. The differential diagnosis for a cystic structure around the umbilical cord and its insertion includes pseudocyst, omphalomesenteric duct cyst, haemangioma, omphalocele, or anterior abdominal wall defects. Although cord anomalies can be detected through antenatal ultrasound scans (US), very often a definitive diagnosis cannot be made, which may affect the management of the infant at birth. In cases where antenatal US was not diagnostic, evidence supports the use of MRI to aid in making an accurate diagnosis. We report two cases of umbilical cord anomalies. The first case was diagnosed via antenatal US as an omphalocele but was found to be an allantoic cyst with hamartoma upon postnatal diagnosis. The second case was not detected on antenatal US and was diagnosed postnatally as a small omphalocele with vitellointestinal duct remnants.

### Infected urachal cyst initially misdiagnosed as an incarcerated umbilical hernia [^112aRLXF]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Urachal abnormalities are a rare cause of lower abdominal pain. They are often initially mistaken for more common causes of lower abdominal pain, and the diagnosis is usually made during evaluation for one of these more common conditions.

- **Case report**: We report a case of a painful periumbilical mass ultimately diagnosed as an infected urachal cyst. Although the cyst was evident sonographically, it was misidentified as an umbilical hernia, and the correct diagnosis was not made until the patient underwent computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis before surgery.

- **Conclusion**: Emergency physicians should consider urachal disease in patients presenting with lower abdominal pain and should also be familiar with both the clinical and radiologic findings characteristic of this disease.

### Prolonged cord separation in a newborn: A rare case of an unusual epithelialised umbilical cord [^113TMcjW]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A female full-term neonate, accompanied by her parents, was referred to the paediatric surgery department on the day after birth. She presented with a 9 cm long pathological umbilical cord, of which the first 7 cm was red and wet, with ulceration, necrosis, and healing areas. The patient never had a fever. Abdominal palpation showed no umbilical hernia, and an abdominal Doppler ultrasound was normal. After several days of disinfection using biseptine antiseptic solution and a monthly follow-up, most of the umbilical cord fell off, leaving only a 4 cm long navel consisting of 2 cm of excessive skin and 2 cm of mucous tissue. The lesion was surgically excised when the patient was 6 months old. She was discharged on postoperative day 1. The results of the histology confirmed the diagnosis of an epithelialised umbilical cord. The 1-month follow-up was uneventful.

### Persistent omphalomesenteric duct and urachus presenting as an umbilical hernia [^112bRWXh]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Vitellointestinal duct anomalies are among the most frequent malformations, occurring in 2%-3% of the population, although they are unlikely to cause symptoms. A persistent vitellointestinal duct can induce abdominal pain, bowel obstruction, intestinal hemorrhage, and umbilical sinus, fistula, or hernia, which commonly occur in children. Patent vitellointestinal duct, or persistent omphalomesenteric duct, is a very unusual congenital anomaly that occurs in 2% of the population and is related to the embryonic yolk stalk. Similarly, urachal anomalies are rare, the most common being a cyst or sinus followed by patent urachus, and rarely a urachal diverticulum. Presenting symptoms include periumbilical discharge, pain, and a palpable mass. Here, we report a case of an adult patient with patent vitellointestinal duct and urachus, identified intraoperatively during diagnostic laparoscopy when the patient was being operated on for umbilical hernia repair.

### Guideline no. 424: Umbilical cord management in preterm and term infants [^111nTwTF]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for postpartum hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to umbilical cord clamping, the SOGC 2022 guidelines recommend administering IV uterotonic medications with the delivery of the anterior shoulder of the final infant in term pregnancies. This approach is associated with a lower risk of bolus effects of blood, fewer benefits of deferred cord clamping, and a higher risk for maternal postpartum hemorrhage.

### Laparoscopic repair of gastric perforation secondary to umbilical trocar insertion [^111arnGG]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

A postmenopausal woman was scheduled to undergo laparoscopic treatment of an 8-cm simple ovarian cyst. During abdominal entry, umbilical trocar insertion caused a gastric perforation that was diagnosed immediately and repaired laparoscopically. Following the completion of the procedure, the patient was observed for 24 hours with a nasogastric tube in place and was discharged to home on the second postoperative day without further complications. The possibility of gastric distension and perforation is almost always present during laparoscopic abdominal entry. When perforation occurs, repair can be accomplished safely by laparoscopy.

Infection-related neonatal mortality due to omphalitis in developing country home births is an important public health problem. Three cluster randomized trials of 4% chlorhexidine applied to the umbilical cord stump, from once to multiple times in the days following a home birth, have evaluated this intervention compared with other types of cord care on the development of omphalitis and neonatal mortality. Each of the three studies showed significant reductions in either omphalitis, neonatal mortality, or both, with the 4% chlorhexidine. However, the optimal dosing schedule remains uncertain.

Although further studies are needed to clarify this issue, from the three studies it is now clear that with a minimum of one application of 4% chlorhexidine to the umbilical cord stump following delivery, the incidence of omphalitis and neonatal mortality can be reduced, especially in preterm newborns. This intervention, which is safe and inexpensive and requires minimal training and skill, should strongly be considered for adoption wherever home births occur.

### Belly button piercings: A saving grace? A patent urachus presenting in a 17-year-old girl [^113SK299]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 17-year-old girl who presented to the accident and emergency department with dysuria and foul-smelling, bloody discharge from her umbilicus. The definitive diagnosis was that of a patent urachus, which is a fistulous communication between the bladder and the umbilicus, usually diagnosed in early infancy. The incidence of a patent urachus is approximately 1 in 70,000 in the general population. It is highly likely that removal of a recent belly button piercing resulted in the acute presentation by completing the fistulous tract to the skin. This case is of clinical relevance as the diagnosis was missed 18 months prior with a milder presentation. The recommended treatment option is surgical excision due to the potential risk of malignant change, with urachal adenocarcinoma accounting for 0.3% of all bladder cancers.

### Efficacy and safety of umbilical cord milking at birth: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116PvUbp]. JAMA Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Umbilical cord milking (UCM) is suggested to improve neonatal outcomes. This study aims to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of UCM in full-term and preterm neonates.

A systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Database of Clinical Trials, the clinicaltrials.gov database, and the reference list of retrieved articles, covering publications from 1940 to 2014. Randomized clinical trials comparing UCM with other strategies of handling the umbilical cord at birth in full-term and preterm infants were considered, with seven of the 18 initially identified studies selected for final analysis.

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

The main outcome measured was neonatal mortality before discharge from the hospital. In the included seven randomized clinical trials with 501 infants, those with a gestational age of less than 33 weeks assigned to UCM showed no difference in risk for mortality [risk ratio (RR), 0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.35 to 1.64; risk difference (RD), -0.02; 95% CI, -0.09 to 0.04], hypotension requiring volume expanders (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.25; RD, -0.09; 95% CI, -0.22 to 0.05), or inotrope support (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.17; RD, -0.10; 95% CI, -0.25 to 0.05). However, a higher initial level of hemoglobin (mean difference, 2.0 g/dL; 95% CI, 1.3–2.7) and hematocrit (mean difference, 4.5%; 95% CI, 1.5%-7.4%) was observed in the UCM group.

### Prevention and treatment of neonatal infections in facility and community settings of low- and middle-income countries: A descriptive review [^112u4tT8]. Neonatology (2025). Low credibility.

While chlorhexidine cleansing of the umbilical cord showed no impact on mortality, there was a significant benefit on the risk of omphalitis when compared to dry cord care. These results are comparable to those of a Cochrane review, which also showed chlorhexidine cord cleansing reduced the risk of omphalitis by 52% but similarly showed no effect on mortality. Furthermore, we found that, when compared to dry cord cleansing, multiple cleansing is more effective than single cleansing in preventing omphalitis. Chlorhexidine cleansing at any frequency was effective in preventing mild, moderate, and severe omphalitis when compared to dry cord care.

It is important to note, however, the substantial to considerable between-study heterogeneity. Although chlorhexidine cord cleansing in community settings is effective in preventing omphalitis, establishing the safety of this intervention in the long term is necessary before a case can be made for its widespread use in community settings. This is noted by another review on this topic. Based on evidence from the same five trials in our meta-analysis, the WHO guidelines for a positive postnatal experience conditionally recommend the application of chlorhexidine cord cleansing only in contexts where unhygienic cord practices are known to occur.

### Impact of 4.0% chlorhexidine cleansing of the umbilical cord on mortality and omphalitis among newborns of Sylhet, Bangladesh: Design of a community-based cluster randomized trial [^113uHRyn]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). High credibility.

The World Health Organization recommends dry cord care for newborns, but this recommendation may not be optimal in low-resource settings where most births occur in unclean environments and infections account for up to half of neonatal deaths. A previous trial in Nepal indicated that umbilical cord cleansing with 4.0% chlorhexidine could substantially reduce mortality and the risk of omphalitis, but policy changes await additional community-based data.

- **Methods**: The Projahnmo Chlorhexidine study was a three-year, cluster-randomized, community-based trial to assess the impact of three cord care regimens on neonatal mortality and omphalitis. Women were recruited mid-pregnancy, received a basic package of maternal and neonatal health promotion messages, and were followed to pregnancy outcome. Newborns were visited at home by local village-based workers whose areas were randomized to either 1) single or 2) 7-day cord cleansing with 4.0% chlorhexidine, or 3) promotion of dry cord care as recommended by WHO. All mothers received basic messages regarding hand washing, clean cord cutting, and avoidance of harmful home-based applications to the cord. Death within 28 days and omphalitis were the primary outcomes; these were monitored directly through home visits by community health workers on days 1, 3, 6, 9, 15, and 28 after birth.

- **Discussion**: Due to report in early 2010, the Projahnmo Chlorhexidine Study examines the impact of multiple or single chlorhexidine cleansing of the cord on neonatal mortality and omphalitis among newborns of rural Sylhet District, Bangladesh.

### Topical application of chlorhexidine to neonatal umbilical cords for prevention of omphalitis and neonatal mortality in a rural district of Pakistan: A community-based, cluster-randomised trial [^115Dm3dn]. Lancet (2012). High credibility.

Umbilical cord infection (omphalitis) is a risk factor for neonatal sepsis and mortality in low-resource settings where home deliveries are common. We aimed to assess the effect of umbilical-cord cleansing with 4% chlorhexidine (CHX) solution, with or without handwashing with antiseptic soap, on the incidence of omphalitis and neonatal mortality.

- **Methods**: We conducted a two-by-two factorial, cluster-randomised trial in Dadu, a rural area of Sindh province, Pakistan. Clusters were defined as the population covered by a functional traditional birth attendant (TBA) and were randomly allocated to one of four groups (groups A to D) with a computer-generated random number sequence. Implementation and data collection teams were masked to allocation. Liveborn infants delivered by participating TBAs who received birth kits were eligible for enrollment in the study. One intervention comprised birth kits containing 4% CHX solution for application to the cord at birth by TBAs and once daily by family members for up to 14 days, along with soap and educational messages promoting handwashing. The interventions included CHX solution only and handwashing only. Standard dry cord care was promoted in the control group. The primary outcomes were incidence of neonatal omphalitis and neonatal mortality. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00682006.

- **Findings**: 187 clusters were randomly allocated to one of the four study groups. Of 9741 newborn babies delivered by participating TBAs, factorial analysis indicated a reduction in the risk of omphalitis with CHX application.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: Management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^112pSgbA]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, specifically with respect to follow-up after discharge, AAP 2022 guidelines recommend calculating and using the difference between the bilirubin concentration measured closest to discharge and the phototherapy threshold at the time of the bilirubin measurement. This should begin at least 12 hours after birth to guide follow-up if patient discharge is being considered.

### Sacrococcygeal teratoma presenting with vaginal discharge and polyp in an infant [^111j28TB]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Sacrococcygeal teratoma is the most common solid tumor in neonates. Due to advances in technology, 50%-70% of cases can be diagnosed antenatally through routine ultrasound screenings. If not diagnosed antenatally, clinical findings at birth are distinct in most cases, including a palpable or visible mass.

We report an unusual case of a 1-year-old girl who presented with persistent vaginal discharge. This led to the diagnosis of a mucosal polypoid lesion of the vagina, ultimately revealing a hidden sacrococcygeal teratoma.

We suggest a thorough investigation of all infants who present with purulent discharge and vaginal mass. Sacrococcygeal teratoma should routinely be considered as a differential diagnosis.

### Incidence and risk factors for clinical omphalitis among neonates in Eastern Uganda using chlorhexidine gel for cord care: A community-cohort study [^115MEaAf]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Omphalitis is a bacterial infection of the umbilicus, often involving surrounding tissues, primarily occurring in the neonatal period. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has the highest neonatal mortality rate globally, at 27 deaths per 1,000 live births. In Uganda, neonatal mortality is 22 deaths per 1,000 live births, with infections being one of the leading causes of these deaths. Infection of the umbilical cord stump may serve as a route for pathogenic bacteria to enter the bloodstream, potentially progressing to neonatal sepsis, death, or lifelong complications such as poor growth, cerebral palsy, and neurodevelopmental delay. Omphalitis is associated with an estimated mortality rate between 7% and 15%, with an average case fatality risk of up to 13%.

The incidence of omphalitis varies across different settings. For instance, studies in high-resource settings have reported rates as low as 0.7%, while rates in low-resource settings are as high as 8% for neonates born in hospitals and 22% for those born at home. Furthermore, a recent cohort study in Uganda among 769 neonates found an 8.5% incidence of omphalitis. In another study within sub-Saharan Africa, an incidence of 23% was reported among 540 newborns in Kenya. The high rates of omphalitis in low-resource settings have been linked to the application of unhygienic substances on the umbilical cord, such as baby powder, animal dung, butter, ghee, soot, and plant extracts.

In 2016, the Ministry of Health in Uganda began promoting the use of chlorhexidine gel for umbilical cord care to address this issue.

### Maternal and umbilical cord blood lactate for predicting perinatal death: A secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial [^113pfvHp]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

The study was designed as a prospective cohort study where women with obstructed labor were consecutively recruited into the clinical trial at the point of diagnosis. This trial was double-blind and randomized. Preoperatively, half of the patients received an infusion of sodium bicarbonate (intervention arm), while the other half did not receive sodium bicarbonate (control arm). The mother-baby pairs were then monitored up until the seventh day postpartum.

This analysis represents a secondary examination of data initially collected during a study conducted in the labor ward of Mbale Regional Referral Hospital in Eastern Uganda from July 2018 to September 2019. Serving a population of approximately four million people across 16 districts and one city, Mbale Hospital is the central referral center for four district hospitals and ten health sub-districts within and around the Mount Elgon zone. The hospital facilitates around 12,000 deliveries each year, with approximately 600 cases diagnosed as obstructed labor.

Participants included in the study were mother-baby pairs from the randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the impact of sodium bicarbonate on maternal and perinatal outcomes among women experiencing obstructed labor at Mbale Regional Referral Hospital.

- **Inclusion criteria**:
	- We included patients experiencing obstructed labor who were carrying singleton term pregnancies (≥ 37 weeks of gestation) in cephalic presentation, with a live baby at the time of enrollment.

- **Exclusion criteria**:
	- We excluded patients who did not have a fetal heart rate at enrollment and patients with other obstetric emergencies, such as antepartum hemorrhage.

### Umbilical endometriosis mistaken for a keloid in a premenopausal woman of Caribbean descent [^117TE7kn]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is defined as endometrial tissue located outside of the uterine cavity. Common locations for endometriosis include the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and peritoneum. This condition is relatively common, affecting between 1% and 5% of women of reproductive age. It classically presents with a triad of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and dyschezia, with cyclical pain fluctuating with the menstrual cycle. Endometriosis is often associated with infertility and ectopic pregnancy. The spread of endometrial implants to extrapelvic organs, such as the lung and skin, occurs less frequently, with estimates of between 12% and 34% of patients experiencing this.

Umbilical endometriosis represents a rare subtype of cutaneous endometriosis. The greatest risk factor for developing cutaneous endometriosis is a history of abdominal or pelvic surgery, including cesarean section, laparoscopy, amniocentesis, abortion, and inguinal hernia repairs. In many cases of umbilical endometriosis, the umbilicus has served as a site for trocar placement. Additionally, cases of spontaneous umbilical endometriosis are reported. It is hypothesized that the umbilicus, even without iatrogenic manipulation, represents a physiological scar which may support the development of ectopic endometrial tissue. Alternatively, metaplasia of local tissue, or activation and differentiation of precursor cells, may explain the formation of endometrial tissue. It remains to be elucidated if additional factors in the local tissue environment participate in the development and propagation of endometriosis.

### A febrile infant with abdominal erythema and irritability [^111F6ikW]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

During operative exploration, the periumbilical subcutaneous tissue and surrounding skin were inflamed and friable. The umbilical stalk was woody and friable, suggesting omphalitis. No umbilical hernia with strangulated viscera was identified; however, an intraperitoneal abscess was found abutting the underside of the anterior abdominal wall at the base of the umbilical stalk. Extensive debridement of all associated fibrinopurulent tissues revealed a perforated Meckel's diverticulum approximately 10 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve abutting the abscess cavity. A small defect at the base of the umbilical stalk, where the abscess had eroded through the anterior abdominal wall, was repaired. The pathology report confirmed a Meckel's diverticulum with gastric heterotopia, transmural inflammation, focal necrosis, and acute serositis.

Postoperative care for sepsis required admission to the pediatric intensive care unit where the patient was treated with ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg) daily and metronidazole (10 mg/kg) every 8 hours concurrently for 5 days, followed by metronidazole alone for an additional 6 days. Blood and urine cultures showed no growth, and abscess cultures could not be obtained. Total parenteral nutrition was needed for 7 days, after which enteral feeds were initiated and well-tolerated. The patient was discharged in good condition. One year from surgery, the patient is growing and developing appropriately.

A ruptured Meckel's diverticulum in infancy is rare, as is omphalitis occurring outside of the neonatal period.

### Guideline no. 424: Umbilical cord management in preterm and term infants [^112qLVfQ]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for umbilical cord management, more specifically with respect to uterotonics, the SOGC 2022 guidelines recommend administering IV uterotonic medications with delivery of the anterior shoulder of the final infant in term pregnancies. This is due to the lower risk for bolus effects of blood, lower benefits of deferred cord clamping, and higher risk for maternal postpartum hemorrhage.

### Intrauterine fetal death due to rupture of umbilical vessels: a rare case of furcate cord insertion [^112Sy5qq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

Written informed consent for publication has been obtained from the participants in this study. The patient was a 30-year-old primigravida who was generally in good health and successfully passed all prenatal check-ups. At 40 weeks pregnant, she presented to the hospital due to a cessation of fetal movements for one day. Ultrasound examination revealed intrauterine fetal death.

After admission, the patient was given rivanol for amniotic cavity injection to induce labor. During this process, the amniotic fluid was found to be bloody upon retraction. To exclude the possibility of placental abruption, an ultrasound was repeated, which showed no signs of placental abruption. The patient vaginally delivered a male stillborn on the second day after induction of labor, weighing 3450 g. The neonate had a pale complexion, and the amniotic fluid was bloody with clots. The placenta was spontaneously delivered, with a furcate cord insertion. The main umbilical vessels separated into several branches before reaching the placenta, and one of the free umbilical vessels was ruptured.

- **Macroscopic examination of placenta**: The main umbilical vessels separated into several branches before reaching the placenta, and one of the free umbilical vessels was ruptured.

The patient recovered well postpartum and was discharged two days after delivery.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: Management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^116zxn1Y]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Regarding patient education for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, specifically concerning counseling before discharge, the AAP 2022 guidelines recommend providing written and verbal education about neonatal jaundice to all families before discharge. Written information should facilitate post-discharge care, including details of the follow-up appointment, such as date, time, and place, and, if necessary, a prescription and appointment for a follow-up transcutaneous bilirubin or total serum bilirubin.

Birth hospitalization information, including the most recent transcutaneous bilirubin or total serum bilirubin and the age at which it was measured, as well as direct antiglobulin test results (if any), should be transmitted to the primary care provider who will see the infant at follow-up. This information should also be provided to families if there is uncertainty about who will provide the follow-up care.

### Knowledge gaps in optimal umbilical cord management at birth [^111DZdVq]. Seminars in Perinatology (2023). Low credibility.

In 2014, the World Health Organization recommended providing placental blood to all newborn infants by waiting for at least one minute before clamping the umbilical cord. Mounting evidence supports providing a placental transfusion at the time of birth for all infants. However, the optimal time before clamping and cutting the umbilical cord remains unknown, and debate exists around other cord management issues. The newborn's transition phase from intra- to extra-uterine life and the effects of blood volume on the many necessary adaptations are understudied, guiding our suggested research questions. Parents' perceptions of enrolling their unborn infant into a study play important parts in the conduct of such trials. This article aims to address these topics and suggest research questions for further studies.

### Umbilical cord-care practices in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review [^111SjuDs]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Findings from this review suggest that documentation of cord-care practices is not consistent throughout low- and middle-income countries. Given the heterogeneity of practices described in the literature, it is not clear if data from one country in a region also pertains to other surrounding countries and/or nearby ethnic groups. Overall, however, existing literature depicts a firm tradition of umbilical cord care in every culture. The desire to take some kind of action to address the newly cut umbilical cord seems to be a strong human desire.

Participants in several studies noted that adhering to dry cord care was very difficult. For example, in Ghana, there was a belief that applying nothing to the cord would delay separation, cause discomfort, and potentially cause death for the infant by preventing the sore from healing and causing a sickness in the stomach. In Uganda, the practice of dry cord care was noted as difficult to follow as it delays the cord separation and the return of the mother to chores. This desire to actively care for a newborn could be utilized as a trigger for behavior change. For example, as applied in the Health Belief Model, knowledge of effective cord care (i.e. product, application procedure, number of days to use, number of times per day to apply) could function as a "cue to action" to allow caretakers to act positively.

This review has limitations, as noted. Reporting is not global in nature as the review was limited to sources published in English in peer-reviewed journals. Few of the studies conducted have been in-depth, qualitative analyses.

### Sonographic features of umbilical catheter-related complications [^114tcLmS]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Umbilical catheters are commonly used in the neonatal period for blood sampling or for administering medication or parenteral nutrition. The position of the catheter is usually confirmed with radiography. However, many complications associated with the use of umbilical catheters, such as liver collections from extravasation or vascular thrombosis, are not apparent on radiographs but can be easily diagnosed with ultrasound. This pictorial review illustrates the sonographic findings of complications that should be excluded in the sick neonate with an indwelling catheter.

### "The cord is the child": Meanings and practices related to umbilical cord care in Central Uganda [^112VhPDK]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

The cord and its meaning: "The cord is the child"

We found that the umbilical cord carried symbolic meanings that extended beyond the health of the child and the newborn period. The treatment and maintenance of the cord reflected parental care and responsibility and were understood to be important for the future well-being of the child. One study participant emphasized the significance attributed to the cord by stating, "the cord is the child". We will attempt to uncover what this concept involved and to describe the various meanings associated with the cord. Using Mary Douglas' conceptualisation of the body and its boundaries, and her elaboration on how matter changes meaning when it passes boundaries, we explore how the meaning of the cord changes as it transcends from inside the womb to the outside, and from the surface of the baby's body until it falls off.

- **Inside the womb**: The participants appreciated the umbilical cord as a vital organ necessary for child growth in the uterus. Well in line with biomedical thinking, the umbilical cord was seen as a source of nourishment to the baby, and it was associated with life and death. A TBA told us, "We see this umbilical cord as the center of life" (TBA IDI). Explaining further, a participant in a FGD told us, "The umbilical cord is the life of the child because it is where the child breathes. If it is cut off before time, the child could die" (Grandmother FGD).

Below, we shall see how the meanings and understandings of the umbilical cord change as the baby passes through the birth canal and is detached from…

### Umbilical cord-care practices in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review [^114VaStg]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Our initial search focused on studies that described traditional umbilical cord care practices globally. For the purposes of this article, traditional practices were those that focused on the cultural beliefs and customs that guided how the umbilical cord was cared for, including the length of the cord stump, substances applied, and the decisions regarding disposal of the cord stump. We developed systematic searches for PubMed and Google Scholar using controlled vocabulary (Additional file 1: Search Terminology). Initial criteria for eligibility were determined by topic, time period, and language of the publication. We included articles that were published between January 1, 2000, and January 30, 2016. A second search was performed in August 2016 to account for any publications during the intervening months. The language of publication was limited to English. References in the identified articles were reviewed to determine if other sources would be pertinent, and additional articles were abstracted if relevant.

The original search yielded 321 articles, from which 107 duplicates were excluded. A reviewer then screened titles and abstracts of the remaining 214 articles to determine suitability for inclusion. Articles that did not meet the criteria included those unrelated to the application of substances to the umbilical cord, articles focused on clinical trials comparing a variety of antiseptic applications to the umbilical cord, articles wherein the authors related only secondary data sources regarding umbilical cord-care practices, and articles that were unrelated.

### Life-threatening complication: The development of necrotising fasciitis in a preterm neonate with omphalitis [^1135qwVB]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Omphalitis is a mild medical condition that can escalate into severe complications such as necrotising fasciitis in rare instances. The most common cause of omphalitis is umbilical vein catheterisation (UVC), during which sterility may be compromised. Treatment options for omphalitis include antibiotics, debridement, and supportive care. Unfortunately, the fatality rate for such cases remains high.

This report discusses a premature female infant admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit after being born at 34 weeks gestation. During her treatment, UVC was performed, leading to abnormal changes in the skin around her umbilicus. Subsequent tests confirmed she had developed omphalitis and she was treated with antibiotics and supportive care. Tragically, her condition rapidly deteriorated, resulting in the diagnosis of necrotising fasciitis, which ultimately led to her demise.

This report provides details concerning the patient's symptoms, the progression of her illness, and the treatment approach for necrotising fasciitis.

### Omphalomesenteric duct remnants: Umbilical versus umbilical cord lesions [^113BSdHC]. Pediatric dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The omphalomesenteric duct is an embryologic connection between the digestive tract and yolk sac, which typically involutes by the time of birth. Failure of the obliteration process can result in omphalomesenteric duct remnants. We present two cases of children with such remnants: one with an umbilical polyp requiring traditional excisional therapy and one more unusual case of an umbilical cord cyst resolving spontaneously without intervention. The differential diagnosis, which includes urachal remnants and umbilical pyogenic granulomas, is discussed, along with management and special considerations that practitioners should be aware of when treating pediatric umbilical and umbilical cord lesions.

### Infected umbilical urachal sinus in a neonate [^117E9YW7]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

The urachus is an embryonic tube that connects the upper portion of the bladder to the umbilicus and normally obliterates during embryonic development, forming the median umbilical ligament. Incomplete obliteration of the urachus can result in various anomalies such as congenital patent urachus, umbilical urachal sinus, vesico-urachal diverticulum, and urachal cyst. We report a term neonate who presented with swelling and discharge from the umbilical region, which, through clinical evaluation and radiological investigations, was diagnosed as an infected umbilical urachal sinus.
