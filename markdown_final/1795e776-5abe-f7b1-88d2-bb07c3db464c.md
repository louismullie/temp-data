## Question

Different types of headgear in Orthodontic

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the different types of orthodontic headgear, their mechanisms, indications, effectiveness, and safety considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts where headgear is used and why. Then, I should categorize the major headgear types by mechanism and direction of force. Next, I will examine the evidence for effectiveness in Class II, Class III, and molar distalization scenarios. After that, I need to appraise safety, compliance, and alternatives like surgical anchorage. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and highlight evidence gaps that could change practice, making sure I verify each claim against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts in which headgear is employed, because I need to ensure I'm not conflating indications. Headgear is used for Class II malocclusion with prominent upper front teeth, for Class III malocclusion with prominent lower front teeth, and for molar distalization to create space or reinforce anchorage; it is also used in cleft lip and palate to protract the maxilla, and occasionally in craniofacial syndromes for growth modification, so I should keep these buckets distinct as I proceed [^a30f92a0] [^09e55884] [^aa6cd2e9] [^85615166] [^f82db069].

> I will now categorize the headgear types by mechanism and force direction, but wait, let me verify the standard nomenclature. Extraoral headgear includes cervical-pull headgear for distalization and Class II correction, high-pull headgear for vertical control, and combination headgear; reverse-pull headgear, also called protraction headgear or facemask, is used for Class III maxillary deficiency; J-hook headgear is a variant for anterior teeth or premaxillary control; and mandibular headgear is less common and used selectively in Class III mechanics, so I should explicitly separate these because their force vectors and outcomes differ [^aa6cd2e9] [^09e55884] [^11544baa].

> Next, I should review cervical-pull headgear for Class II malocclusion. Mechanistically, it applies a distal and extrusive force to the maxilla and maxillary molars to restrain forward growth and distalize molars, thereby reducing overjet; clinically, it is often used in early two-phase treatment or as an adjunct to fixed appliances, and I need to check whether early treatment yields durable benefits. Evidence suggests early headgear reduces overjet and ANB during phase one, but at the end of comprehensive treatment there is no significant difference in overjet or ANB versus one-phase adolescent treatment, though early treatment may reduce incisal trauma, which is a meaningful patient-centered outcome [^a30f92a0] [^1dd75abe].

> Hold on, I should verify the magnitude and certainty of these effects. Meta-analytic data show early headgear reduces overjet by about 1 mm and ANB by about 0.7 degrees during phase one, but these gains dissipate by the end of comprehensive care; the trauma reduction signal is consistent across trials, which strengthens its clinical relevance even if skeletal endpoints converge later [^a30f92a0] [^1dd75abe].

> Now, let me consider high-pull headgear and combination headgear. High-pull headgear aims to control vertical dimension by applying an upward and backward force, which can help in hyperdivergent Class II patients; combination headgear blends cervical and high-pull vectors to balance sagittal and vertical effects, but I should confirm how often these are studied in isolation. Most high-quality trials aggregate headgear types, so device-specific effect sizes are less certain, and I need to be cautious not to overstate differential effects without direct comparisons [^notfound].

> I will now examine reverse-pull headgear, or facemask, for Class III malocclusion. Mechanistically, it delivers a forward and downward force to the maxilla via elastics to an intraoral appliance, often with rapid maxillary expansion to facilitate sutural response; I should double-check the magnitude of skeletal change. Moderate-certainty evidence shows substantial short-term improvements in overjet and ANB, with mean overjet gains around 5 mm and ANB gains around 3 degrees versus untreated controls, but long-term durability is questionable, with benefits diminishing by 3 to 6 years and a meaningful minority still requiring orthognathic surgery [^09e55884] [^1f70f17c].

> Wait, let me verify predictors of long-term success or failure. Retrospective cohorts suggest that more severe initial skeletal discrepancy, younger age at treatment, and greater maxillary advancement during therapy predict better short-term response, but also that a substantial fraction still progress to surgery; compliance is necessary but not sufficient to avoid surgery in severe phenotypes, so counseling must be balanced and individualized [^791f0b94] [^05c7ac45].

> Next, I should review molar distalization with extraoral headgear versus intraoral appliances. Headgear can distalize upper first molars, but intraoral distalizing appliances achieve greater molar movement at the expense of more anterior anchorage loss; meta-analytic data suggest about 1.5 mm more distal molar movement with intraoral devices but roughly 1.8 mm more mesial incisor movement, which can undermine overjet control, so the choice hinges on anchorage needs and patient cooperation [^aa6cd2e9].

> I need to ensure I address safety and compliance, because these drive real-world decisions. Headgear carries risks of facial injury, particularly eye and soft tissue trauma, and requires consistent wear on the order of 12 to 14 hours per day; poor compliance limits effectiveness and may shift the balance toward surgical anchorage or alternative strategies, so risk mitigation and motivational support are essential parts of planning [^aa6cd2e9] [^09e55884].

> Let me consider alternatives to headgear, especially when compliance is unlikely or anchorage demands are high. Surgical anchorage with palatal implants or miniscrews provides more reliable anchorage than headgear in many contexts, with moderate-quality evidence showing about 1.7 mm less unwanted molar mesial movement versus conventional anchorage; however, invasiveness, cost, and soft tissue irritation must be weighed, and headgear remains a valid non-surgical option when cooperation is adequate [^7413fa93] [^eca4878f].

> But wait, what if the patient has cleft lip and palate or a craniofacial syndrome. In cleft populations, protraction headgear improves maxillary position and dental arch relationships in the short term, and may reduce future surgical need in milder cases, yet severe skeletal discrepancies often still require orthognathic surgery; in syndromic craniosynostosis, multidisciplinary care and staged orthodontics are standard, with growth modification considered selectively and surgery typically deferred until skeletal maturity, so expectations must be framed carefully [^85615166] [^791f0b94] [^f82db069].

> I should double-check the practical synthesis so I don't overgeneralize. For Class II malocclusion, cervical or combination headgear can be used in compliant patients, particularly when early treatment is intended to reduce trauma risk; for Class III malocclusion, facemask therapy is appropriate in growing children with maxillary deficiency, acknowledging that skeletal relapse and the potential need for surgery should be discussed upfront; for molar distalization, headgear remains an option, but intraoral appliances or surgical anchorage may be preferable when anchorage preservation is critical or cooperation is uncertain [^a30f92a0] [^09e55884] [^aa6cd2e9] [^7413fa93].

> Finally, I need to highlight evidence gaps and what would change practice. Higher-quality, adequately powered RCTs with long-term follow-up are still needed to clarify which headgear types, timing, and patient phenotypes yield durable skeletal benefits and to quantify cost-effectiveness versus surgical anchorage; until then, shared decision-making that incorporates patient values, compliance, and malocclusion severity remains the most defensible approach [^a30f92a0] [^09e55884] [^aa6cd2e9].

Orthodontic headgear is an extraoral appliance used to modify jaw growth and correct bite problems, primarily in children and adolescents. The main types are **cervical-pull** for Class II correction, **high-pull** for vertical control, **combination** for mixed needs, **reverse-pull (facemask)** for Class III maxillary deficiency, and **J-hook** for upper incisor retraction. Headgear is typically worn 12–14 hours per day and requires patient compliance; risks include soft tissue irritation, discomfort, and rare injury. Effectiveness depends on adherence and growth stage, and alternatives like mini-implants may be used when compliance is poor or headgear is contraindicated [^a30f92a0] [^7413fa93].

## Types of orthodontic headgear

Orthodontic headgear is classified by the **direction of force** and the **specific clinical indication**:

| **Type** | **Description** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Cervical-pull headgear | - Straps around the neck <br/> - Distalizes maxillary molars <br/> - Corrects Class II malocclusion | - Class II malocclusion <br/> - Overjet reduction [^a30f92a0] |
| High-pull headgear | - Straps over the crown of the head <br/> - Controls vertical growth <br/> - Prevents extrusion of molars | - High-angle Class II <br/> - Vertical maxillary excess [^notfound] |
| Combination headgear | - Combines cervical and high-pull forces <br/> - Balances sagittal and vertical control | - Complex Class II cases <br/> - Mixed vertical and sagittal problems [^notfound] |
| Reverse-pull headgear (facemask) | - Pulls maxilla forward <br/> - Corrects Class III malocclusion | - Maxillary deficiency <br/> - Class III malocclusion [^09e55884] |
| J-hook headgear | - Hooks attach to anterior teeth <br/> - Retracts and intrudes upper incisors | - Upper incisor protrusion <br/> - Deep bite correction [^notfound] |

---

## Mechanism of action

Headgear works by applying **continuous, controlled forces** to the teeth and jaws, guiding growth and tooth movement. Cervical-pull and combination headgear distalize maxillary molars and restrain maxillary growth, reducing overjet and correcting Class II relationships [^a30f92a0]. High-pull headgear limits vertical molar eruption and controls the occlusal plane. Reverse-pull headgear stimulates forward growth of the maxilla, correcting Class III discrepancies [^09e55884]. J-hook headgear retracts and intrudes upper incisors, improving overbite and lip competence.

---

## Clinical indications

Headgear is indicated for **specific malocclusions and skeletal discrepancies**:

- **Class II malocclusion**: Cervical-pull or combination headgear to distalize molars and reduce overjet [^a30f92a0].
- **High-angle Class II**: High-pull headgear to control vertical growth and prevent molar extrusion [^notfound].
- **Class III malocclusion**: Reverse-pull headgear to promote maxillary forward growth [^09e55884].
- **Upper incisor protrusion**: J-hook headgear for retraction and intrusion [^notfound].

---

## Patient compliance and comfort

Compliance is critical; headgear is typically worn **12–14 hours per day**, often evenings and nights. Discomfort, social stigma, and inconvenience reduce adherence, limiting effectiveness. Clinicians address these issues with education, motivation, and comfort modifications (e.g. padding, strap adjustments).

---

## Risks and complications

Headgear is generally safe, but potential risks include:

- **Soft tissue irritation**: From straps or facebows.
- **Discomfort**: Pressure sores or headaches.
- **Injury**: Rare facial or ocular trauma from improper use or accidents [^aa6cd2e9].
- **Relapse**: If retention is inadequate after treatment.

---

## Alternatives to headgear

When headgear is contraindicated or compliance is poor, **alternatives include**:

- **Mini-implants (TADs)**: Provide skeletal anchorage without patient compliance [^7413fa93].
- **Functional appliances**: For Class II correction (e.g. Herbst, Twin Block) [^a30f92a0].
- **Clear aligners**: Limited force, mainly for mild cases.

---

## Long-term stability

Stability depends on growth completion, retention, and the original malocclusion severity. Relapse can occur if retention is inadequate or growth is unfavorable; therefore, **long-term retention and monitoring** are essential [^4e13a430].

---

Orthodontic headgear is a **versatile tool** for growth modification and tooth movement, with types tailored to specific malocclusions. Success hinges on patient compliance, careful monitoring, and appropriate retention, with alternatives considered when headgear is unsuitable.

### Orthodontic treatment for prominent lower front teeth (class III malocclusion) in children [^1f70f17c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Prominent lower front teeth (termed reverse bite; under bite; Class III malocclusion) may be due to a combination of the jaw or tooth positions or both. The upper jaw (maxilla) can be too far back or the lower jaw (mandible) too far forward, or both. Prominent lower front teeth can also occur if the upper front teeth (incisors) are tipped back or the lower front teeth are tipped forwards, or both. Various treatment approaches have been described to correct prominent lower front teeth in children and adolescents.

Objectives

To assess the effects of orthodontic treatment for prominent lower front teeth in children and adolescents.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 7 January 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 7 January 2013), and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 7 January 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting children or adolescents or both (aged 16 years or less) receiving any type of orthodontic treatment to correct prominent lower front teeth (Class III malocclusion). Orthodontic treatments were compared with control groups who received either no treatment, delayed treatment or a different active intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening of references, identification of included and excluded studies, data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias of the included studies was performed independently and in duplicate by two review authors. The mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for continuous data. Meta-analysis was only undertaken when studies of similar comparisons reported comparable outcome measures. A fixed-effect model was used. The I2 statistic was used as a measure of statistical heterogeneity.

Main Results

Seven RCTs with a total of 339 participants were included in this review. One study was assessed as at low risk of bias, three studies were at high risk of bias, and in the remaining three studies risk of bias was unclear. Four studies reported on the use of a facemask, two on the chin cup, one on the tandem traction bow appliance, and one on mandibular headgear. One study reported on both the chin cup and mandibular headgear appliances. One study (n = 73, low quality evidence), comparing a facemask to no treatment, reported a mean difference (MD) in overjet of 4.10 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.04 to 5.16; P value < 0.0001) favouring the facemask treatment. Two studies comparing facemasks to untreated control did not report the outcome of overjet. Three studies (n = 155, low quality evidence) reported ANB (an angular measurement relating the positions of the top and bottom jaws) differences immediately after treatment with a facemask when compared to an untreated control. The pooled data showed a statistically significant MD in ANB in favour of the facemask of 3.93 ° (95% CI 3.46 to 4.39; P value < 0.0001). There was significant heterogeneity between these studies (I2 = 82%). This is likely to have been caused by the different populations studied and the different ages at the time of treatment. One study (n = 73, low quality evidence) reported outcomes of the use of the facemask compared to an untreated control at three years follow-up. This study showed that improvements in overjet and ANB were still present three years post-treatment. In this study, adverse effects were reported but due to the low prevalence of temporomandibular (TMJ) signs and symptoms no analysis was undertaken. Two studies (n = 90, low quality evidence) compared the chin cup with an untreated control. Both studies found a statistically significant improvement in ANB, and one study also found an improvement in the Wits appraisal. Data from these two studies were not suitable for pooling. A single study of the tandem traction bow appliance compared to untreated control (n = 30, very low quality evidence) showed a statistically significant difference in both overjet and ANB favouring the intervention group. The remaining two studies did not report the primary outcome of this review.

Authors' Conclusions

There is some evidence that the use of a facemask to correct prominent lower front teeth in children is effective when compared to no treatment on a short-term basis. However, in view of the general poor quality of the included studies, these results should be viewed with caution. Further randomised controlled trials with long follow-up are required.

### Orthodontic treatment for deep bite and retroclined upper front teeth in children [^f74e3847]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Correction of the type of dental problem where the bite is deep and the upper front teeth are retroclined (Class II division 2 malocclusion) may be carried out using different types of orthodontic treatment. However, in severe cases, surgery to the jaws in combination with orthodontics may be required. In growing children, treatment may sometimes be carried out using special upper and lower dental braces (functional appliances) that can be removed from the mouth. In many cases this treatment does not involve taking out any permanent teeth. Often, however, further treatment is needed with fixed braces to get the best result. In other cases, treatment aims to move the upper first permanent molars backwards to provide space for the correction of the front teeth. This may be carried out by applying a force to the teeth and jaws from the back of the head using a head brace (headgear) and transmitting this force to a part of a fixed or removable dental brace. This treatment may or may not involve the removal of permanent teeth. In some cases, neither functional appliances nor headgear are required and treatment may be carried out without extraction of any permanent teeth. Instead of using a headgear, in certain cases, the back teeth are held back in other ways such as with an arch across or in contact with the front of the roof of the mouth which links two bands glued to the back teeth. Often in these cases, two permanent teeth are taken out from the middle of the upper arch (one on each side) to provide room to correct the upper front teeth. It is important for orthodontists to find out whether orthodontic treatment only, carried out without the removal of permanent teeth, in children with a Class II division 2 malocclusion produces a result which is any different from no orthodontic treatment or orthodontic treatment only involving extraction of permanent teeth.

Objectives

To establish whether orthodontic treatment, carried out without the removal of permanent teeth, in children with a Class II division 2 malocclusion, produces a result which is any different from no orthodontic treatment or orthodontic treatment involving removal of permanent teeth.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. The handsearching of the main international orthodontic journals was updated to April 2006. There were no restrictions with regard to publication status or language of publication. International researchers, likely to be involved in Class II division 2 clinical trials, were contacted to identify any unpublished or ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Trials were selected if they met the following criteria: randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of orthodontic treatments to correct deep bite and retroclined upper front teeth in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the methodological quality of the trials and data extraction were to be conducted in duplicate and independently by two review authors. Results were to be expressed as random-effects models using mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was to be investigated including both clinical and methodological factors.

Main Results

No RCTs or CCTs were identified that assessed the treatment of Class II division 2 malocclusion in children.

Authors' Conclusions

It is not possible to provide any evidence-based guidance to recommend or discourage any type of orthodontic treatment to correct Class II division 2 malocclusion in children.

### Orthodontic treatment for crowded teeth in children [^629113df]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Crowded teeth develop when there is not enough space in the jaws into which the teeth can erupt. Crowding can affect baby teeth (deciduous dentititon), adult teeth (permanent dentition), or both, and is a common reason for referral to an orthodontist. Crowded teeth can affect a child's self-esteem and quality of life. Early loss of baby teeth as a result of tooth decay or trauma, can lead to crowded permanent teeth. Crowding tends to increase with age, especially in the lower jaw.

Objectives

To assess the effects of orthodontic intervention for preventing or correcting crowded teeth in children. To test the null hypothesis that there are no differences in outcomes between different orthodontic interventions for preventing or correcting crowded teeth in children.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 11 January 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated any active interventions to prevent or correct dental crowding in children and adolescents, such as orthodontic braces or extractions, compared to no or delayed treatment, placebo treatment or another active intervention. The studies had to include at least 80% of participants aged 16 years and under.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors, independently and in duplicate, extracted information regarding methods, participants, interventions, outcomes, harms and results. We resolved any disagreements by liaising with a third review author. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess the risk of bias in the studies. We calculated mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous data and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs for dichotomous data. We undertook meta-analysis when studies of similar comparisons reported comparable outcome measures, using the random-effects model. We used the I 2 statistic as a measure of statistical heterogeneity.

Main Results

Our search identified 24 RCTs that included 1512 participants, 1314 of whom were included in analyses. We assessed 23 studies as being at high risk of bias and one as unclear. The studies investigated 17 comparisons. Twenty studies evaluated fixed appliances and auxiliaries (lower lingual arch, lower lip bumper, brackets, archwires, lacebacks, headgear and adjunctive vibrational appliances); two studies evaluated removable appliances and auxiliaries (Schwarz appliance, eruption guidance appliance); and two studies evaluated dental extractions (lower deciduous canines or third molars). The evidence should be interpreted cautiously as it is of very low certainty. Most interventions were evaluated by a single study. Fixed appliances and auxiliaries One study found that use of a lip bumper may reduce crowding in the early permanent dentition (MD -4.39 mm, 95% CI -5.07 to -3.71; 34 participants). One study evaluated lower lingual arch but did not measure amount of crowding. One study concluded that coaxial nickel-titanium (NiTi) archwires may cause more tooth movement in the lower arch than single-stranded NiTi archwires (MD 6.77 mm, 95% CI 5.55 to 7.99; 24 participants). Another study, comparing copper NiTi versus NiTi archwires, found NiTi to be more effective for reducing crowding (MD 0.49 mm, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.63, 66 participants). Single studies did not show evidence of one type of archwire being better than another for Titinol versus Nitinol; nickel-titanium versus stainless steel or multistrand stainless steel; and multistranded stainless steel versus stainless steel. Nor did single studies find evidence of a difference in amount of crowding between self-ligating and conventional brackets, active and passive self-ligating brackets, lacebacks added to fixed appliances versus fixed appliances alone, or cervical pull headgear versus minor interceptive procedures. Meta-analysis of two studies showed no evidence that adding vibrational appliances to fixed appliances reduces crowding at 8 to 10 weeks (MD 0.24 mm, 95% CI -0.81 to 1.30; 119 participants). Removable appliances and auxiliaries One study found use of the Schwarz appliance may be effective at treating dental crowding in the lower arch (MD -2.14 mm, 95% CI -2.79 to -1.49; 28 participants). Another study found an eruption guidance appliance may reduce the number of children with crowded teeth after one year of treatment (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.68; 46 participants); however, this may have been due to an increase in lower incisor proclination in the treated group. Whether these gains were maintained in the longer term was not assessed. Dental extractions One study found that extracting children's lower deciduous canines had more effect on crowding after one year than no treatment (MD -4.76 mm, 95 CI -6.24 to -3.28; 83 participants), but this was alongside a reduction in arch length. One study found that extracting wisdom teeth did not seem to reduce crowding any more than leaving them in the mouth (MD -0.30 mm, 95% CI -1.30 to 0.70; 77 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

Most interventions were assessed by single, small studies. We found very low-certainty evidence that lip bumper, used in the mixed dentition, may be effective for preventing crowding in the early permanent dentition, and a Schwarz appliance may reduce crowding in the lower arch. We also found very low-certainty evidence that coaxial NiTi may be better at reducing crowding than single-stranded NiTi, and that NiTi may be better than copper NiTi. As the current evidence is of very low certainty, our findings may change with future research.

### Reinforcement of Anchorage during orthodontic brace treatment with implants or other surgical methods [^eca4878f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The term anchorage in orthodontic treatment refers to the control of unwanted tooth movement. This is conventionally provided either by anchor sites within the mouth, such as the teeth and the palate or from outside the mouth (headgear). Orthodontic implants which are surgically inserted to bone in the mouth are increasingly being used as an alternative form of anchorage reinforcement in orthodontics.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of surgical methods for preventing unwanted tooth movement compared with conventional anchorage reinforcement techniques. The secondary objectives were to examine patient acceptance, discomfort and failure rates associated with these techniques.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. No language restrictions were applied. Authors were identified and contacted to identify unpublished trials. The most recent search was conducted in February 2006.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials involving the use of surgically assisted means of anchorage reinforcement on orthodontic patients. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied when considering the studies to be included in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was performed by two review authors working independently using a previously piloted data collection form. Data were entered into RevMan with planned analysis of mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous outcomes and risk ratios (RR) and 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes. Pooling of data and meta-analysis were not performed due to an insufficient number of similar studies.

Main Results

At present few trials have been carried out in this field and there are little data of adequate quality in the literature to meet the objectives of the review. The review authors were only able to find one study assessing the use of surgical anchorage reinforcement systems. This trial examined 51 patients with 'absolute anchorage' requirements treated in two centres. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either headgear or a mid-palatal osseointegrated implant. Anchorage loss was measured cephalometrically by mesial movement of dental and skeletal reference points between T1 (treatment start) and T2 (end of anchorage reinforcement). All skeletal and dental points moved mesially more in the headgear group than the implant group. Results showed significant differences for mesial movement of the maxillary molar in both groups. The mean change in the implant group was 1.5 mm (standard deviation (SD) 2.6; 95% CI 0.4 to 2.7) and for the headgear group 3.0 mm (SD 3.4; 95% CI 1.6 to 4.5). The trial was designed to test a clinically significant difference of 2 mm, so the result was not statistically significant, but the authors conclude that mid-palatal implants do effectively reinforce anchorage and are an acceptable alternative to headgear in absolute anchorage cases.

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence that osseointegrated palatal implants are an acceptable means of reinforcing anchorage. The review authors were unable to identify trials addressing the secondary objectives of the review relating to patient acceptance, discomfort and failure rates. In view of the fact that this is a dynamic area of orthodontic practice we feel there is a need for high quality, randomised controlled trials. There are financial restrictions in running trials of this nature. However it would be in the interest of implant manufacturers to fund high quality, independently conducted, trials of their products.

### Orthodontic treatment for deep bite and retroclined upper front teeth in children [^cc58cbf8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

A Class II division 2 malocclusion is characterised by upper front teeth that are retroclined (tilted toward the roof of the mouth) and an increased overbite (deep overbite), which can cause oral problems and may affect appearance. This problem can be corrected by the use of special dental braces (functional appliances) that move the upper front teeth forward and change the growth of the upper or lower jaws, or both. Most types of functional appliances are removable and this treatment approach does not usually require extraction of any permanent teeth. Additional treatment with fixed braces may be necessary to ensure the best result. An alternative approach is to provide space for the correction of the front teeth by moving the molar teeth backwards. This is done by applying a force to the teeth from the back of the head using a head brace (headgear) and transmitting this force to part of a fixed or removable dental brace that is attached to the back teeth. The treatment may be carried out with or without extraction of permanent teeth. If headgear use is not feasible, the back teeth may be held in place by bands connected to a fixed bar placed across the roof of the mouth or in contact with the front of the roof of the mouth. This treatment usually requires two permanent teeth to be taken out from the middle of the upper arch (one on each side).

Objectives

To establish whether orthodontic treatment that does not involve extraction of permanent teeth produces a result that is any different from no orthodontic treatment or orthodontic treatment involving extraction of permanent teeth, in children with a Class II division 2 malocclusion.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 13 November 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2017, Issue 10), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 13 November 2017), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 13 November 2017). To identify any unpublished or ongoing trials, the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch) were searched. We also contacted international researchers who were likely to be involved in any Class II division 2 clinical trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of orthodontic treatments to correct deep bite and retroclined upper front teeth in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results to find eligible studies, and would have extracted data and assessed the risk of bias from any included trials. We had planned to use random-effects meta-analysis; to express effect estimates as mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals; and to investigate any clinical or methodological heterogeneity.

Main Results

We did not identify any RCTs or CCTs that assessed the treatment of Class II division 2 malocclusion in children.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence from clinical trials to recommend or discourage any type of orthodontic treatment to correct Class II division 2 malocclusion in children. This situation seems unlikely to change as trials to evaluate the best management of Class II division 2 malocclusion are challenging to design and conduct due to low prevalence, difficulties with recruitment and ethical issues with randomisation.

### Prosthetic considerations for orthodontic implant site development in the adult patient [^1f5c1a8b]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Proper site development is a key factor for long-term clinical success of dental implants. Whereas surgical and restorative techniques have been refined to ensure predictable functional and esthetic outcome, individual clinical prerequisites do not always allow proper placement of implants when prosthetic and material properties are considered. Orthodontic tooth movement may be a viable and nonsurgical site development treatment option. With the introduction and advancements of minimal invasive and less visible orthodontic appliances, a growing number of adult patients are willing to obtain orthodontic treatment. The spectrum of modern appliances is broad and ranges from clear aligners to lingual brackets. Skeletal anchorage devices such as orthodontic mini-implants often eliminate unpopular external anchorage devices (ie, headgear) in adult patients, This article discusses the selection of an appropriate pretreatment approach by taking patient-specific criteria into account.

### Orthodontic treatment for distalising upper first molars in children and adolescents [^aa6cd2e9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

When orthodontic treatment is provided with fixed appliances, it is sometimes necessary to move the upper molar teeth backwards (distalise) to create space or help to overcome anchorage requirements. This can be achieved with the use of extraoral or intraoral appliances. The most common appliance is extraoral headgear, which requires considerable patient co-operation. Further, reports of serious injuries have been published. Intraoral appliances have been developed to overcome such shortcomings. The comparative effects of extraoral and intraoral appliances have not been fully evaluated.

Objectives

To assess the effects of orthodontic treatment for distalising upper first molars in children and adolescents.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 10 December 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 11), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 10 December 2012) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 10 December 2012). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials involving the use of removable or fixed orthodontic appliances intended to distalise upper first molars in children and adolescents.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We performed data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias independently and in duplicate. We contacted authors to clarify the inclusion criteria of the studies.

Main Results

Ten studies, reporting data from 354 participants, were included in this review, the majority of which were carried out in a university dental hospital setting. The studies were published between 2005 and 2011 and were conducted in Europe and in Brazil. The age range of participants was from nine to 15 years, with an even distribution of males and females in seven of the studies, and a slight predominance of female patients in three of the studies. The quality of the studies was generally poor; seven studies were at an overall high risk of bias, three studies were at an unclear risk of bias, and we judged no study to be at low risk of bias. We carried out random-effects meta-analyses as appropriate for the primary clinical outcomes of movement of upper first molars (mm), and loss of anterior anchorage, where there were sufficient data reported in the primary studies. Four studies, involving 159 participants, compared a distalising appliance to an untreated control. Meta-analyses were not undertaken for all primary outcomes due to incomplete reporting of all summary statistics, expected outcomes, and differences between the types of appliances. The degree and direction of molar movement and loss of anterior anchorage varied with the type of appliance. Four studies, involving 150 participants, compared a distalising appliance versus headgear. The mean molar movement for intraoral distalising appliances was -2.20 mm and -1.04 mm for headgear. There was a statistically significant difference in mean distal molar movement (mean difference (MD) -1.45 mm; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.74 to -0.15) favouring intraoral appliances compared to headgear (four studies, high or unclear risk of bias, 150 participants analysed). However, a statistically significant difference in mean mesial upper incisor movement (MD 1.82 mm; 95% CI 1.39 to 2.24) and overjet (fixed-effect: MD 1.64 mm; 95% CI 1.26 to 2.02; two studies, unclear risk of bias, 70 participants analysed) favoured headgear, i.e. there was less loss of anterior anchorage with headgear. We reported direct comparisons of intraoral appliances narratively due to the variation in interventions (three studies, high or unclear risk of bias, 93 participants randomised). All appliances were reported to provide some degree of distal movement, and loss of anterior anchorage varied with the type of appliance. No included studies reported on the incidence of adverse effects (harm, injury), number of attendances or rate of non-compliance.

Authors' Conclusions

It is suggested that intraoral appliances are more effective than headgear in distalising upper first molars. However, this effect is counteracted by loss of anterior anchorage, which was not found to occur with headgear when compared with intraoral distalising appliance in a small number of studies. The number of trials assessing the effects of orthodontic treatment for distilisation is low, and the current evidence is of low or very low quality.

### Reinforcement of Anchorage during orthodontic brace treatment with implants or other surgical methods [^7413fa93]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The term anchorage in orthodontic treatment refers to methods of controlling unwanted tooth movement. This is provided either by anchor sites within the mouth, such as the teeth and the palate, or from outside the mouth (headgear). Recently, new methods of providing anchorage have been developed using orthodontic implants which are surgically inserted into the bone in the mouth. This is termed surgical anchorage. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2007.

Objectives

To assess the effects of surgical anchorage techniques compared to conventional anchorage in the prevention of unwanted tooth movement in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment by evaluating the mesiodistal movement of upper first molar teeth. A secondary objective was to compare the effects of one type of surgical anchorage with another.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 28 October 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 28 October 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 28 October 2013). We handsearched key international orthodontic and dental journals, and searched the trial database ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing and unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing surgical anchorage with conventional anchorage in orthodontic patients. Trials comparing two types of surgical anchorage were also included.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently and in duplicate extracted data and carried out risk of bias assessments. We contacted study authors to clarify aspects of study design and conduct, and to obtain unreported data.

Main Results

Fourteen new studies were added in this update resulting in a total of 15 studies reporting data from 561 randomised patients. The studies were conducted in Europe, India, China, South Korea and the USA. The age range of patients was commonly restricted to adolescents or young adults, however the participants of two studies were from a much wider age range (12 to 54 years). The distribution of males and females was similar in eight of the studies, with a predominance of female patients in seven studies. Eight studies were assessed to be at high overall risk of bias; six studies at unclear risk of bias; one study at low risk of bias. Ten studies with 407 randomised and 390 analysed patients compared surgical anchorage with conventional anchorage for the primary outcome of mesiodistal movement of upper first molars. We carried out a random-effects model meta-analysis for the seven studies that fully reported this outcome. There was strong evidence of an effect of surgical anchorage on this outcome. Compared with conventional anchorage, surgical anchorage was more effective in the reinforcement of anchorage by 1.68 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.27 mm to -1.09 mm; seven studies, 308 participants analysed) with moderate quality of evidence (one study at high overall risk of bias, five studies at unclear risk of bias, one study at low risk of bias). This result should be interpreted with some caution, however, as there was a substantial degree of heterogeneity for this comparison. There was no evidence of a difference in overall duration of treatment between surgical and conventional anchorage (-0.15 years; 95% CI -0.37 years to 0.07 years; three studies, 111 analysed patients) with low quality of evidence (one study at high overall risk of bias and two studies at unclear risk of bias). Information on patient-reported outcomes such as pain and acceptability was limited and inconclusive. When direct comparisons were made between two types of surgical anchorage, there was a lack of evidence to suggest that any one technique was better than another. No included studies reported adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate quality evidence that reinforcement of anchorage is more effective with surgical anchorage than conventional anchorage, and that results from mini-screw implants are particularly promising. While surgical anchorage is not associated with the inherent risks and compliance issues related to extraoral headgear, none of the included studies reported on harms of surgical or conventional anchorage.

### Orthodontic treatment for prominent upper front teeth in children [^15b4b116]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Prominent upper front teeth are an important and potentially harmful type of orthodontic problem. This condition develops when the child's permanent teeth erupt and children are often referred to an orthodontist for treatment with dental braces to reduce the prominence of the teeth. If a child is referred at a young age, the orthodontist is faced with the dilemma of whether to treat the patient early or to wait until the child is older and provide treatment in early adolescence. When treatment is provided during adolescence the orthodontist may provide treatment with various orthodontic braces, but there is currently little evidence of the relative effectiveness of the different braces that can be used.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of orthodontic treatment for prominent upper front teeth, when this treatment is provided when the child is 7 to 9 years old or when they are in early adolescence or with different dental braces or both.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. The handsearching of the key international orthodontic journals was updated to December 2006. There were no restrictions in respect to language or status of publication. Date of most recent searches: February 2007.

Selection Criteria

Trials were selected if they met the following criteria: design - randomised and controlled clinical trials; participants - children or adolescents (age < 16 years) or both receiving orthodontic treatment to correct prominent upper front teeth; interventions - active: any orthodontic brace or head-brace, control: no or delayed treatment or another active intervention; primary outcomes - prominence of the upper front teeth, relationship between upper and lower jaws; secondary outcomes: self esteem, any injury to the upper front teeth, jaw joint problems, patient satisfaction, number of attendances required to complete treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Information regarding methods, participants, interventions, outcome measures and results were extracted independently and in duplicate by two review authors. The Cochrane Oral Health Group's statistical guidelines were followed and mean differences were calculated using random-effects models. Potential sources of heterogeneity were examined.

Main Results

The search strategy identified 185 titles and abstracts. From this we obtained 105 full reports for the review. Eight trials, based on data from 592 patients who presented with Class II Division 1 malocclusion, were included in the review. Early treatment comparisons: Three trials, involving 432 participants, compared early treatment with a functional appliance with no treatment. There was a significant difference in final overjet of the treatment group compared with the control group of -4.04 mm (95% CI -7.47 to -0.6, chi squared 117.02, 2 df, P < 0.00001, I(2) = 98.3%). There was a significant difference in ANB (-1.35 mm; 95% CI -2.57 to -0.14, chi squared 9.17, 2 df, P = 0.01, I(2) = 78.2%) and change in ANB (-0.55; 95% CI -0.92 to -0.18, chi squared 5.71, 1 df, P = 0.06, I(2) = 65.0%) between the treatment and control groups. The comparison of the effect of treatment with headgear versus untreated control revealed that there was a small but significant effect of headgear treatment on overjet of -1.07 (95% CI -1.63 to -0.51, chi squared 0.05, 1 df, P = 0.82, I(2) = 0%). Similarly, headgear resulted in a significant reduction in final ANB of -0.72 (95% CI -1.18 to -0.27, chi squared 0.34, 1 df, P = 0.56, I(2) = 0%). No significant differences, with respect to final overjet, ANB, or ANB change, were found between the effects of early treatment with headgear and the functional appliances. Adolescent treatment (Phase II): At the end of all treatment we found that there were no significant differences in overjet, final ANB or PAR score between the children who had a course of early treatment, with headgear or a functional appliance, and those who had not received early treatment. Similarly, there were no significant differences in overjet, final ANB or PAR score between children who had received a course of early treatment with headgear or a functional appliance. One trial found a significant reduction in overjet (-5.22 mm; 95% CI -6.51 to -3.93) and ANB (-2.27 degrees; 95% CI -3.22 to -1.31, chi squared 1.9, 1 df, P = 0.17, I(2) = 47.3%) for adolescents receiving one-phase treatment with a functional appliance versus an untreated control. A statistically significant reduction of ANB (-0.68 degrees; 95% CI -1.32 to -0.04, chi squared 0.56, 1 df, P = 0.46, I(2) = 0%) with the Twin Block appliance when compared to other functional appliances. However, there was no significant effect of the type of appliance on the final overjet.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence suggests that providing early orthodontic treatment for children with prominent upper front teeth is no more effective than providing one course of orthodontic treatment when the child is in early adolescence.

### Occlusal plane and skeletal changes after cervical headgear treatment with and without lower utility arch in class II growing patients [^e8d8c1dd]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The purpose of this study was to investigate skeletal and dental changes affecting occlusal plane inclination after cervical headgear treatment with and without lower utility arch. In order to distinguish the orthodontic changes from natural growth a control group was employed. The sample of this study consisted by 20 Class II subjects (10 males, 10 females; mean age 8.54) treated by using cervical headgear, 19 class II children (19 males, 9 females; mean age 8.64) treated with cervical headgear and utility arch, and 21 Class II patients (11 males, 10 females; mean age 8.41) who had no therapy. Lateral head films were studied for all the patients before treatment (T1) and after therapy (T2) for all the treated groups and at the beginning and at the end of observational period for the control group; cephalometric analysis was carried out in order to seek for the modifications between time points and between groups. Means and standard deviation have been analyzed for all the groups. In order to compare the modification between the time points within the same group the ANOVA test was applied. The ANOVA test was used to compare the mean differences (T2-T1) of 3 groups. The study revealed that there were significant changes in occlusal plane inclination after the different treatment modalities employed instead control group. The treatment with cervical headgear and utility arch is more effective than cervical headgear alone in lowering occlusal plane posteriorly when it is compared with controls.

### Orthodontic treatment for prominent upper front teeth (class II malocclusion) in children [^1dd75abe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Prominent upper front teeth are a common problem affecting about a quarter of 12-year old children in the UK. The correction of this condition is one of the most common treatments performed by orthodontists. This condition develops when the child's permanent teeth erupt and children are often referred to an orthodontist for treatment with dental braces to reduce the prominence of the teeth. These teeth are more likely to be injured and their appearance can cause significant distress. If a child is referred at a young age, the orthodontist is faced with the dilemma of whether to treat the patient early or to wait until the child is older and provide treatment in early adolescence.

Objectives

To assess the effects of orthodontic treatment for prominent upper front teeth when this treatment is initiated when the child is seven to 11 years old compared to when they are in early adolescence, or when treatment uses different types of orthodontic braces.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 17 April 2013), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 3), MEDLINE (OVID) (1946 to 17 April 2013) and EMBASE (OVID) (1980 to 17 April 2013). There were no restrictions regarding language or publication date.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of children and/or adolescents (age < 16 years) on early treatment (either one or two-phase) with any type of orthodontic braces (removable, fixed, functional) or head-braces compared with late treatment with any type of orthodontic braces or head-braces; or, on any type of orthodontic braces or head-braces compared with no treatment or another type of orthodontic brace or appliance (with treatment starting in children of similar ages in both groups) to correct prominent upper front teeth.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors screened the search results, extracted data and assessed risk of bias independently, used odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes, mean differences (MDs) and 95% CIs for continuous outcomes and a fixed-effect model for meta-analyses as there were fewer than four studies.

Main Results

We included 17 studies based on data from 721 participants. Three trials (n = 343) compared early (two-phase) treatment (7–11 years of age) with a functional appliance, with adolescent (one-phase) treatment. Statistically significant differences in overjet, ANB and PAR scores were found in favour of functional appliance when the first phase of early treatment was compared with observation in the children due to receive treatment in adolescence. However, at the end of treatment in both groups, there was no evidence of a difference in the overjet (MD 0.21, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.51, P = 0.18) (low quality evidence), final ANB (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.47 to 0.43, P = 0.92), PAR score (MD 0.62, 95% CI -0.66 to 1.91, P = 0.34) or self concept score (MD 0.83, CI -2.31 to 3.97, P = 0.60). However, two-phase treatment with functional appliance showed a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of incisal trauma (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.99, P = 0.04) (moderate quality evidence). The incidence of incisal trauma was clinically significant with 29% (54/185) of patients reporting new trauma incidence in the adolescent (one-phase) treatment group compared to only 20% (34/172) of patients receiving early (two-phase) treatment. Two trials (n = 285), compared early (two-phase) treatment using headgear, with adolescent (one-phase) treatment. Statistically significant differences in overjet and ANB were found in favour of headgear when the first phase of early treatment was compared with observation in the children due to receive treatment in adolescence. However, at the end of treatment in both groups, there was no evidence of a difference in the overjet (MD 0.22, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.12, P = 0.20) (low quality evidence), final ANB (MD -0.27, 95% CI -0.80 to 0.26, P = 0.32) or PAR score (MD -1.55, 95% CI -3.70 to 0.60, P = 0.16). The incidence of incisal trauma was, however, statistically significantly reduced in the two-phase treatment group (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.83, P = 0.009) (low quality evidence). The adolescent treatment group showed twice the incidence of incisal trauma (47/120) compared to the young children group (27/117). Two trials (n = 282) compared different types of appliances (headgear and functional appliance) for early (two-phase) treatment. At the end of the first phase of treatment statistically significant differences, in favour of functional appliances, were shown with respect to final overjet only. At the end of phase two, there was no evidence of a difference between appliances with regard to overjet (MD -0.21, 95% CI -0.57 to 0.15, P = 0.26), final ANB (MD -0.17, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.34, P = 0.52), PAR score (MD -0.81, 95% CI -2.21 to 0.58, P = 0.25) or the incidence of incisal trauma (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.44, P = 0.44). Late orthodontic treatment for adolescents with functional appliances showed a statistically significant reduction in overjet of -5.22 mm (95% CI -6.51 to -3.93, P < 0.00001) and ANB of -2.37° (95% CI -3.01 to -1.74, P < 0.00001) when compared to no treatment (very low quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in overjet when Twin Block was compared to other appliances (MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.48, P = 0.95). However, a statistically significant reduction in ANB (-0.63°, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.08, P = 0.02) was shown in favour of Twin Block. There was no evidence of a difference in any reported outcome when Twin Block was compared with modifications of Twin Block. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of Activator, FORSUS FRD EZ appliances, R-appliance or AIBP.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence suggests that providing early orthodontic treatment for children with prominent upper front teeth is more effective in reducing the incidence of incisal trauma than providing one course of orthodontic treatment when the child is in early adolescence. There appears to be no other advantages for providing treatment early when compared to treatment in adolescence.

### Orthodontic treatment for prominent upper front teeth (class II malocclusion) in children and adolescents [^a30f92a0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Prominent upper front teeth are a common problem affecting about a quarter of 12-year-old children in the UK. The condition develops when permanent teeth erupt. These teeth are more likely to be injured and their appearance can cause significant distress. Children are often referred to an orthodontist for treatment with dental braces to reduce the prominence of their teeth. If a child is referred at a young age, the orthodontist is faced with the dilemma of whether to treat the patient early or to wait and provide treatment in adolescence.

Objectives

To assess the effects of orthodontic treatment for prominent upper front teeth initiated when children are seven to 11 years old ('early treatment' in two phases) compared to in adolescence at around 12 to 16 years old ('late treatment' in one phase); to assess the effects of late treatment compared to no treatment; and to assess the effects of different types of orthodontic braces.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 27 September 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2017, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 27 September 2017), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 27 September 2017). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of orthodontic treatments to correct prominent upper front teeth (Class II malocclusion) in children and adolescents. We included trials that compared early treatment in children (two-phase) with any type of orthodontic braces (removable, fixed, functional) or head-braces versus late treatment in adolescents (one-phase) with any type of orthodontic braces or head-braces, and trials that compared any type of orthodontic braces or head-braces versus no treatment or another type of orthodontic brace or appliance (where treatment started at a similar age in the intervention groups). We excluded trials involving participants with a cleft lip or palate, or other craniofacial deformity/syndrome, and trials that recruited patients who had previously received surgical treatment for their Class II malocclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors screened the search results, extracted data and assessed risk of bias independently. We used odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MDs) and 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. We used the fixed-effect model for meta-analyses including two or three studies and the random-effects model for more than three studies.

Main Results

We included 27 RCTs based on data from 1251 participants. Three trials compared early treatment with a functional appliance versus late treatment for overjet, ANB and incisal trauma. After phase one of early treatment (i.e. before the other group had received any intervention), there was a reduction in overjet and ANB reduction favouring treatment with a functional appliance; however, when both groups had completed treatment, there was no difference between groups in final overjet (MD 0.21, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.51, P = 0.18; 343 participants) (low-quality evidence) or ANB (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.47 to 0.43; 347 participants) (moderate-quality evidence). Early treatment with functional appliances reduced the incidence of incisal trauma compared to late treatment (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.95; 332 participants) (moderate-quality evidence). The difference in the incidence of incisal trauma was clinically important with 30% (51/171) of participants reporting new trauma in the late treatment group compared to only 19% (31/161) of participants who had received early treatment. Two trials compared early treatment using headgear versus late treatment. After phase one of early treatment, headgear had reduced overjet and ANB; however, when both groups had completed treatment, there was no evidence of a difference between groups in overjet (MD -0.22, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.12; 238 participants) (low-quality evidence) or ANB (MD -0.27, 95% CI -0.80 to 0.26; 231 participants) (low-quality evidence). Early (two-phase) treatment with headgear reduced the incidence of incisal trauma (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.80; 237 participants) (low-quality evidence), with almost half the incidence of new incisal trauma (24/117) compared to the late treatment group (44/120). Seven trials compared late treatment with functional appliances versus no treatment. There was a reduction in final overjet with both fixed functional appliances (MD -5.46 mm, 95% CI -6.63 to -4.28; 2 trials, 61 participants) and removable functional appliances (MD -4.62, 95% CI -5.33 to -3.92; 3 trials, 122 participants) (low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in final ANB between fixed functional appliances and no treatment (MD -0.53°, 95% CI -1.27 to -0.22; 3 trials, 89 participants) (low-quality evidence), but removable functional appliances seemed to reduce ANB compared to no treatment (MD -2.37°, 95% CI -3.01 to -1.74; 2 trials, 99 participants) (low-quality evidence). Six trials compared orthodontic treatment for adolescents with Twin Block versus other appliances and found no difference in overjet (0.08 mm, 95% CI -0.60 to 0.76; 4 trials, 259 participants) (low-quality evidence). The reduction in ANB favoured treatment with a Twin Block (-0.56°, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.16; 6 trials, 320 participants) (low-quality evidence). Three trials compared orthodontic treatment for adolescents with removable functional appliances versus fixed functional appliances and found a reduction in overjet in favour of fixed appliances (0.74, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.33; two trials, 154 participants) (low-quality evidence), and a reduction in ANB in favour of removable appliances (-1.04°, 95% CI -1.60 to -0.49; 3 trials, 185 participants) (low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence of low to moderate quality suggests that providing early orthodontic treatment for children with prominent upper front teeth is more effective for reducing the incidence of incisal trauma than providing one course of orthodontic treatment in adolescence. There appear to be no other advantages of providing early treatment when compared to late treatment. Low-quality evidence suggests that, compared to no treatment, late treatment in adolescence with functional appliances, is effective for reducing the prominence of upper front teeth.

### Repositioning of premaxilla in bilateral cleft lip and palate using a "J-hook headgear" [^11544baa]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this clinical approach is to present the successful treatment of the severely protruded and extruded premaxilla with high-pull J-hook headgear. Two patients with bilateral cleft lip and palate deformity and a protruding and extruding premaxilla causing a deep bite were treated with high-pull J-hook headgear and fixed orthodontic appliances. The lateral cephalometric measurements before and after orthodontic treatment were evaluated with Ricketts analysis. The premaxillae of the two patients were repositioned, correcting the deep overbite and overjet and a well-functioning occlusion was attained. The repositioning of an inferiorly positioned and protruded premaxilla with J-hook headgear is an alternative treatment approach compared to other treatment modalities.

### Changes of occlusal plane in growing patients with increased vertical dimension during class II correction by using cervical headgear [^4ef6b193]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

This retrospective research aimed to highlight the changes of occlusal plane in Class II hyperdivergent subjects that received cervical headgear treatment and compared them to untreated controls in order to evaluate the occlusal changes that might be connected to a potential mandibular rotation. The sample of this investigation was represented by 20 hyperdivergent Class II subjects (10 males, 10 females; mean age 8.54) corrected by using cervical headgear (treated group) and 21 Class II patients (11 males, 10 females; mean age 8.41) hyperdivergent who had no therapy (control group). Lateral head films were studied for all the patients before treatment (T1) and after therapy (T2) for both groups; cephalometric analysis was used in order to seek the modifications between time points and between groups. Means and standard deviation have been computed for both groups. In order to confront the modification between the time points within the same group the Wilcoxon test was applied. The Mann-Whitney U test was applied to confront the dissimilarities between groups at T2. As a result of the Class II correction by using the cervical headgear treatment the occlusal plane was lowered and flattened compared to T1 and to the control group; the upper molars showed extrusion to the palatal plane, there was a significant forward rotation of mandible and the vertical dimension was not significantly modified. Downward and backward displacement of the upper jaw occurred.

### Predictors of long-term protraction headgear success in patients with cleft lip and palate: a 5-year follow-up [^791f0b94]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients with cleft lip and palate (CLP) characteristically present with maxillary hypoplasia and class III malocclusion. Protraction headgear (PHG) is a commonly used treatment for this type of malocclusion, with the goal of reducing future surgical needs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of PHG treatment and determine the pretreatment predictors of long-term PHG success in patients with CLP. Twenty-nine patients with CLP who had undergone PHG treatment from 2012 to 2017 at a single institution were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were included if they had a lateral cephalogram or CBCT before, immediately after, and at least 5 years after their PHG treatment. Patients were divided into surgery and nonsurgery groups based on their 5-year follow-up clinical presentation. Student t tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and a multivariate logistic regression model were used to compare pretreatment and post-treatment changes in both groups. Immediately post-treatment, the maxilla advanced 2.6 mm, the maxillary dentition advanced 4.7 mm, and the mandible rotated downward 5.0 mm and backward 2.6 mm. At long-term follow up the maxilla advanced 0.0 mm while the mandible advanced an additional 7.5 mm. Thus, PHG treatment is effective at improving class III malocclusion in the short term, but may not prevent future surgical need for patients with more severe skeletal discrepancies. Variables predictive of future surgical need include ANB, anterior facial height, overjet, and starting age of treatment, with ANB as the most reliable early predictor.

### Protraction headgear compliance and orthognathic surgery in patients with cleft lip and palate [^05c7ac45]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Assess cephalometric parameters and the need for orthognathic surgery (OS) and its relationship with compliance in protraction headgear (PHG).

Retrospective case series.

Hospital cleft-craniofacial center.

23 patients with nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate and history of lip and palate repair.

Patients received PHG and orthodontic treatment. Compliant patients were compared to patients that were not. Protraction was applied with 170-gram elastics and patients were instructed to wear for at least 12 hours daily.

Cephalometric measurements at initial (T1), post-PHG (T2), and pre-surgical or post-orthodontic treatment (T3) of at least age 15 for females and 17 for males and the presence of OS were compared.

83% (19) of patients reported compliance with therapy. Of those compliant, 68% (13) had OS and 32% (6) did not (P = 0.99). Inter-group comparisons at T1 between compliant and noncompliant showed no significant differences and the non-OS patients started with larger nasolabial angles (P < .05). At T2, there were no significant cephalometric differences between groups. At T3, compliant patients showed significantly more upper incisor proclination than noncompliant patients. Between OS and non-OS, OS patients had significantly decreased ANB, Wits, convexity, overjet, and FMA and larger nasolabial angles (P < .05).

Patients compliant with PHG showed no difference in the need for OS. However, after orthodontic treatment, compliant patients showed more upper incisor proclination and OS patients with decreased ANB, Wits, convexity, overjet, FMA, and larger nasolabial angles.

### Saving lives, one breath at a time: the key role of noninvasive ventilation interfaces [^738cf7b0]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Unintentional leaks can occur around the mask or through an open mouth. They are major contributors to NIV intolerance, errors in tidal volume estimation, patient‐ventilator asynchrony, desaturations, alveolar hypoventilation, and sleep fragmentation. Unintentional leaks are often variable, making recognition and compensation by the ventilator challenging. They can be prevented or fixed by symmetrically and moderately tightening the headgear straps, cleaning the skin every evening to remove sebum, and cleaning the mask according to the manufacturer's instructions. Other solutions include using a moisturizer/mask sealer cream or a mask liner to improve mask adherence to the skin, using a chin strap if the mouth opens during NIV, using a mask pillow for side or stomach sleepers, using a circuit hose holder and/or switching to a mask with a hose connection over the head.

Midface hypoplasia is a serious adverse effect of NIV on the growing midface and maxillary dentition. It can lead to overall maxillary retrusion, counterclockwise tipping of the palatal plane, flaring of the maxillary incisors and underbite, and obstructive sleep‐disordered breathing. Midface hypoplasia must be prevented by avoiding excessive tightening of headgear straps, alternating masks to change pressure points on the face, and ensuring regular orthodontic follow‐up. Treatment may involve various surgical techniques, including distraction osteogenesis for the most severe cases.

Nasal congestion often makes it difficult for a child to tolerate NIV with a nasal mask. Recommendations during a cold include increasing the humidifier level, sleeping with the head elevated, using a nasal decongestant for no more than 5 days, or switching to a full‐face (oronasal) mask temporarily. For allergies, it is advised to use a hypoallergenic filter on the NIV device, keep windows closed, and use air conditioning as needed.

In conclusion, home NIV for children must consider the key role of the interface, in addition to selecting the ventilatory mode and settings. Acceptance and adherence to NIV often depend on the time spent selecting the right mask, as well as on regular and careful attention to preventing and addressing various issues that arise during NIV.

### Orthodontic treatment for prominent lower front teeth (class III malocclusion) in children [^09e55884]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Prominent lower front teeth (Class III malocclusion) may be due to jaw or tooth position or both. The upper jaw (maxilla) can be too far back or the lower jaw (mandible) too far forward; the upper front teeth (incisors) may be tipped back or the lower front teeth tipped forwards. Orthodontic treatment uses different types of braces (appliances) fitted inside or outside the mouth (or both) and fixed to the teeth. A facemask is the most commonly reported non-surgical intervention used to correct Class III malocclusion. The facemask rests on the forehead and chin, and is connected to the upper teeth via an expansion appliance (known as 'rapid maxillary expansion' (RME)). Using elastic bands placed by the wearer, a force is applied to the top teeth and jaw to pull them forwards and downward. Some orthodontic interventions involve a surgical component; these go through the gum into the bone (e.g. miniplates). In severe cases, or if orthodontic treatment is unsuccessful, people may need jaw (orthognathic) surgery as adults. This review updates one published in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effects of orthodontic treatment for prominent lower front teeth in children and adolescents.

Search Methods

An information specialist searched four bibliographic databases and two trial registries up to 16 January 2023. Review authors screened reference lists.

Selection Criteria

We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving children and adolescents (16 years of age or under) randomised to receive orthodontic treatment to correct prominent lower front teeth (Class III malocclusion), or no (or delayed) treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was overjet (i.e. prominence of the lower front teeth); our secondary outcomes included ANB (A point, nasion, B point) angle (which measures the relative position of the maxilla to the mandible).

Main Results

We identified 29 RCTs that randomised 1169 children (1102 analysed). The children were five to 13 years old at the start of treatment. Most studies measured outcomes directly after treatment; only one study provided long-term follow-up. All studies were at high risk of bias as participant and personnel blinding was not possible. Non-surgical orthodontic treatment versus untreated control We found moderate-certainty evidence that non-surgical orthodontic treatments provided a substantial improvement in overjet (mean difference (MD) 5.03 mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.81 to 6.25; 4 studies, 184 participants) and ANB (MD 3.05°, 95% CI 2.40 to 3.71; 8 studies, 345 participants), compared to an untreated control group, when measured immediately after treatment. There was high heterogeneity in the analyses, but the effects were consistently in favour of the orthodontic treatment groups rather than the untreated control groups (studies tested facemask (with or without RME), chin cup, orthodontic removable traction appliance, tandem traction bow appliance, reverse Twin Block with lip pads and RME, Reverse Forsus and mandibular headgear). Longer-term outcomes were measured in only one study, which evaluated facemask. It presented low-certainty evidence that improvements in overjet and ANB were smaller at 3-year follow-up than just after treatment (overjet MD 2.5 mm, 95% CI 1.21 to 3.79; ANB MD 1.4°, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.37; 63 participants), and were not found at 6-year follow-up (overjet MD 1.30 mm, 95% CI -0.16 to 2.76; ANB MD 0.7°, 95% CI -0.74 to 2.14; 65 participants). In the same study, at the 6-year follow-up, clinicians made an assessment of whether surgical correction of participants' jaw position was likely to be needed in the future. A perceived need for surgical correction was observed more often in participants who had not received facemask treatment (odds ratio (OR) 3.34, 95% CI 1.21 to 9.24; 65 participants; low-certainty evidence). Surgical orthodontic treatment versus untreated control One study of 30 participants evaluated surgical miniplates, with facemask or Class III elastics, against no treatment, and found a substantial improvement in overjet (MD 7.96 mm, 95% CI 6.99 to 8.40) and ANB (MD 5.20°, 95% CI 4.48 to 5.92; 30 participants). However, the evidence was of low certainty, and there was no follow-up beyond the end of treatment. Facemask versus another non-surgical orthodontic treatment Eight studies compared facemask or modified facemask (with or without RME) to another non-surgical orthodontic treatment. Meta-analysis did not suggest that other treatments were superior; however, there was high heterogeneity, with mixed, uncertain findings (very low-certainty evidence). Facemask versus surgically-anchored appliance There may be no advantage of adding surgical anchorage to facemasks for ANB (MD -0.35, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.07; 4 studies, 143 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence for overjet was of very low certainty (MD -0.40 mm, 95% CI -1.30 to 0.50; 1 study, 43 participants). Facemask variations Adding RME to facemask treatment may have no additional benefit for ANB (MD -0.15°, 95% CI -0.94 to 0.64; 2 studies, 60 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence for overjet was of low certainty (MD 1.86 mm, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.33; 1 study, 31 participants). There may be no benefit in terms of effect on ANB of alternating rapid maxillary expansion and constriction compared to using expansion alone (MD -0.46°, 95% CI -1.03 to 0.10; 4 studies, 131 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-certainty evidence showed that non-surgical orthodontic treatments (which included facemask, reverse Twin Block, orthodontic removable traction appliance, chin cup, tandem traction bow appliance and mandibular headgear) improved the bite and jaw relationship immediately post-treatment. Low-certainty evidence showed surgical orthodontic treatments were also effective. One study measured longer-term outcomes and found that the benefit from facemask was reduced three years after treatment, and appeared to be lost by six years. However, participants receiving facemask treatment were judged by clinicians to be less likely to need jaw surgery in adulthood. We have low confidence in these findings and more studies are required to reach reliable conclusions. Orthodontic treatment for Class III malocclusion can be invasive, expensive and time-consuming, so future trials should include measurement of adverse effects and patient satisfaction, and should last long enough to evaluate whether orthodontic treatment in childhood avoids the need for jaw surgery in adulthood.

### Pharmacological interventions for pain relief during orthodontic treatment [^b6a90435]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pain is a common side effect of orthodontic treatment. It increases in proportion to the amount of force applied to the teeth, and the type of orthodontic appliance used can affect the intensity of the pain. Pain during orthodontic treatment has been shown to be the most common reason for people wanting to discontinue treatment, and has been ranked as the worst aspect of treatment. Although pharmacological methods of pain relief have been investigated, there remains some uncertainty among orthodontists about which painkillers are most suitable and whether pre-emptive analgesia is beneficial. We conducted this Cochrane Review to assess and summarize the international evidence relating to the effectiveness of analgesics for preventing this unwanted side effect associated with orthodontic treatment.

Objectives

The objectives of this review are to determine:- the effectiveness of drug interventions for pain relief during orthodontic treatment; and- whether there is a difference in the analgesic effect provided by different types, forms and doses of analgesia taken during orthodontic treatment.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Trials Register (to 19 June 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 7), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 19 June 2017), Embase Ovid (1980 to 19 June 2017) and CINAHL EBSCO (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; 1937 to 19 June 2017). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched on the 19 June 2017 for ongoing studies. We placed no restrictions on language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) relating to pain control during orthodontic treatment. Pain could be measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS), numerical rating scale (NRS) or categorical scale.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results, agreed the studies to be included and extracted information from the included studies regarding methods, participants, interventions, outcomes, harms and results. We planned to resolve any discrepancies or disagreements through discussion. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess the risk of bias in the studies.

Main Results

We identified 32 relevant RCTs, which included 3110 participants aged 9 to 34 years, 2348 of whom we were able to include in our analyses. Seventeen of the studies had more than two arms. We were able to use data from 12 trials in meta-analyses that compared analgesics versus control (no treatment or a placebo); nine that compared non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) versus paracetamol; and two that compared pre-emptive versus post-treatment ibuprofen for pain control following orthodontic treatment. One study provided data for the comparison of NSAIDs versus local anaesthetic. We found moderate-quality evidence that analgesics effectively reduced pain following orthodontic treatment when compared to no treatment or a placebo at 2 hours (mean difference (MD) -11.66 mm on a 0 to 100 mm VAS, 95% confidence interval (CI) -16.15 to -7.17; 10 studies, 685 participants), 6 hours (MD -24.27 mm on a VAS, 95% CI -31.44 to -17.11; 9 studies, 535 participants) and 24 hours (MD -21.19 mm on a VAS, 95% CI -28.31 to -14.06; 12 studies, 1012 participants). We did not find any evidence of a difference in efficacy between NSAID and paracetamol at 2, 6 or 24 hours (at 24 hours: MD -0.51, 95% CI -8.93 to 7.92; 9 studies, 734 participants; low-quality evidence). Very low-quality evidence suggested pre-emptive ibuprofen gave better pain relief at 2 hours than ibuprofen taken post treatment (MD -11.30, 95% CI -16.27 to -6.33; one study, 41 participants), however, the difference was no longer significant at 6 or 24 hours. A single study of 48 participants compared topical NSAIDs versus local anaesthetic and showed no evidence of a difference in the effectiveness of the interventions (very low-quality evidence). Use of rescue analgesia was poorly reported. The very low-quality evidence did not show evidence of a difference between participants taking ibuprofen and participants taking paracetamol (relative risk (RR) 1.5, 95% CI 0.6 to 3.6). Nor did we find evidence of a difference between groups in likelihood of requiring rescue analgesia when ibuprofen was taken pre-emptively compared to after treatment (RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.9). Adverse effects were identified in one study, with one participant developing a rash that required treatment with antihistamines. This was provisionally diagnosed as a hypersensitivity to paracetamol.

Authors' Conclusions

Analgesics are more effective at reducing pain following orthodontic treatment than placebo or no treatment. Low-quality evidence did not show a difference in effectiveness between systemic NSAIDs compared with paracetamol, or topical NSAIDs compared with local anaesthetic. More high-quality research is needed to investigate these comparisons, and to evaluate pre-emptive versus post-treatment administration of analgesics.

### Enamel etching for bonding fixed orthodontic braces [^12dfc294]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acid etching of tooth surfaces to promote the bonding of orthodontic attachments to the enamel has been a routine procedure in orthodontic treatment since the 1960s. Various types of orthodontic etchants and etching techniques have been introduced in the past five decades. Although a large amount of information on this topic has been published, there is a significant lack of consensus regarding the clinical effects of different dental etchants and etching techniques.

Objectives

To compare the effects of different dental etchants and different etching techniques for the bonding of fixed orthodontic appliances.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 8 March 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 2), MEDLINE via OVID (to 8 March 2013), EMBASE via OVID (to 8 March 2013), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (to 12 March 2011), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 8 March 2013) and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry (to 8 March 2013). A handsearching group updated the handsearching of journals, carried out as part of the Cochrane Worldwide Handsearching Programme, to the most current issue. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different etching materials, or different etching techniques using the same etchants, for the bonding of fixed orthodontic brackets to incisors, canines and premolars in children and adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies independently and in duplicate. We resolved disagreements by discussion among the review team. We contacted the corresponding authors of the included studies to obtain additional information, if necessary.

Main Results

We included 13 studies randomizing 417 participants with 7184 teeth/brackets. We assessed two studies (15%) as being at low risk of bias, 10 studies (77%) as being at high risk of bias and one study (8%) as being at unclear risk of bias. Self etching primers (SEPs) versus conventional etchantsEleven studies compared the effects of SEPs with conventional etchants. Only five of these studies (three of split-mouth design and two of parallel design) reported data at the participant level, with the remaining studies reporting at the tooth level, thus ignoring clustering/the paired nature of the data. A meta-analysis of these five studies, with follow-up ranging from 5 to 37 months, provided low-quality evidence that was insufficient to determine whether or not there is a difference in bond failure rate between SEPs and convention etchants (risk ratio 1.14; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.73; 221 participants). The uncertainty in the CI includes both no effect and appreciable benefit and harm. Subgroup analysis did not show a difference between split-mouth and parallel studies. There were no data available to allow assessment of the outcomes: decalcification, participant satisfaction and cost-effectiveness. One study reported decalcification, but only at the tooth level. SEPs versus SEPsTwo studies compared two different SEPs. Both studies reported bond failure rate, with one of the studies also reporting decalcification. However, as both studies reported outcomes only at the tooth level, there were no data available to evaluate the superiority of any of the SEPs over the others investigated with regards to any of the outcomes of this review. We did not find any eligible studies evaluating different etching materials (e.g. phosphoric acid, polyacrylic acid, maleic acid), concentrations or etching times.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low-quality evidence that was insufficient to conclude whether or not there is a difference in bond failure rate between SEPs and conventional etching systems when bonding fixed orthodontic appliances over a 5- to 37-month follow-up. Insufficient data were also available to allow any conclusions to be formed regarding the superiority of SEPs or conventional etching for the outcomes: decalcification, participant satisfaction and cost-effectiveness, or regarding the superiority of different etching materials, concentrations or etching times, or of any one SEP over another. Further well-designed RCTs on this topic are needed to provide more evidence in order to answer these clinical questions.

### Dental arch relationships and reverse headgear effects in Southern Chinese patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate: a retrospective study [^e430e85a]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the severity of the dental arch relationships and the treatment outcomes of reverse headgear (RHG) in southern Chinese patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP).

Design

A retrospective study.

Setting

Faculty of Dentistry, The University of Hong Kong.

Patients

Thirty-eight UCLP patients with complete records. Among them, 14 were later treated with RHG (RHG group) and 24 were under review (non-RHG group) before definitive orthodontic or in conjunction with orthognathic surgery.

Interventions

Study models at T1 (aged 9.4 ± 0.4 years old), prebone grafting and before any orthodontic treatment started; T2 (aged 11.3 ± 0.6 years old), after bone grafting, and RHG treatment (RHG group) or under review (non-RHG group); and T3 (aged 15.3 ± 3.2 years old), pretreatment of definitive orthodontic or in conjunction with orthognathic surgery.

Main Outcome Measures

With satisfactory intra- and interexaminer agreement proven by the kappa value, the dental arch relationships of the study models at T1, T2, and T3 were assessed by a solo calibrated examiner using the GOSLON Yardstick.

Results

The median GOSLON score for southern Chinese patients with UCLP at T1 was 4.0. Sixty percent of the patients were categorized as "poor" at T1. RHG significantly improved dental arch relationships from T1 to T2, and the improvement was maintained until T3 assessed by the GOSLON Yardstick.

Conclusions

The dental arch relationships in southern Chinese UCLP patients at 8 to 10 years old are unfavorable. RHG treatment shows positive effects in improving the dental arch relationships in UCLP patients, as assessed by the GOSLON Yardstick.

### Orthodontic treatment for posterior crossbites [^8348891a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A posterior crossbite occurs when the top back teeth bite inside the bottom back teeth. The prevalence of posterior crossbite is around 4% and 17% of children and adolescents in Europe and America, respectively. Several treatments have been recommended to correct this problem, which is related to such dental issues as tooth attrition, abnormal development of the jaws, joint problems, and imbalanced facial appearance. Treatments involve expanding the upper jaw with an orthodontic appliance, which can be fixed (e.g. quad-helix) or removable (e.g. expansion plate). This is the third update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different orthodontic treatments for posterior crossbites.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 8 April 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of orthodontic treatment for posterior crossbites in children and adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors, independently and in duplicate, screened the results of the electronic searches, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. A third review author participated to resolve disagreements. We used risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to summarise dichotomous data (event), unless there were zero values in trial arms, in which case we used odds ratios (ORs). We used mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs to summarise continuous data. We performed meta-analyses using fixed-effect models. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for the main outcomes.

Main Results

We included 31 studies that randomised approximately 1410 participants. Eight studies were at low risk of bias, 15 were at high risk of bias, and eight were unclear. Intervention versus observation For children (age 7 to 11 years), quad-helix was beneficial for posterior crossbite correction compared to observation (OR 50.59, 95% CI 26.77 to 95.60; 3 studies, 149 participants; high-certainty evidence) and resulted in higher final inter-molar distances (MD 4.71 mm, 95% CI 4.31 to 5.10; 3 studies, 146 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). For children, expansion plates were also beneficial for posterior crossbite correction compared to observation (OR 25.26, 95% CI 13.08 to 48.77; 3 studies, 148 participants; high-certainty evidence) and resulted in higher final inter-molar distances (MD 3.30 mm, 95% CI 2.88 to 3.73; 3 studies, 145 participants, 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). In addition, expansion plates resulted in higher inter-canine distances (MD 2.59 mm, 95% CI 2.18 to 3.01; 3 studies, 145 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The use of Hyrax is probably effective for correcting posterior crossbite compared to observation (OR 48.02, 95% CI 21.58 to 106.87; 93 participants, 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Two of the studies focused on adolescents (age 12 to 16 years) and found that Hyrax increased the inter-molar distance compared with observation (MD 5.80, 95% CI 5.15 to 6.45; 2 studies, 72 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Intervention A versus intervention B When comparing quad-helix with expansion plates in children, quad-helix was more effective for posterior crossbite correction (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.46; 3 studies, 151 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), final inter-molar distance (MD 1.48 mm, 95% CI 0.91 mm to 2.04 mm; 3 studies, 151 participants; high-certainty evidence), inter-canine distance (0.59 mm higher (95% CI 0.09 mm to 1.08 mm; 3 studies, 151 participants; low-certainty evidence) and length of treatment (MD -3.15 months, 95% CI -4.04 to -2.25; 3 studies, 148 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between Hyrax and Haas for posterior crossbite correction (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.18; 3 studies, 83 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or inter-molar distance (MD -0.15 mm, 95% CI -0.86 mm to 0.56 mm; 2 studies of adolescents, 46 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between Hyrax and tooth-bone-borne expansion for crossbite correction (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.12; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 120 participants; low-certainty evidence) or inter-molar distance (MD -0.66 mm, 95% CI -1.36 mm to 0.04 mm; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 65 participants; low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between Hyrax with bone-borne expansion for posterior crossbite correction (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07; I² = 0%; 2 studies of adolescents, 81 participants; low-certainty evidence) or inter-molar distance (MD -0.14 mm, 95% CI -0.85 mm to 0.57 mm; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 81 participants; low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: For children in the early mixed dentition stage (age 7 to 11 years old), quad-helix and expansion plates are more beneficial than no treatment for correcting posterior crossbites. Expansion plates also increase the inter-canine distance. Quad-helix is more effective than expansion plates for correcting posterior crossbite and increasing inter-molar distance. Treatment duration is shorter with quad-helix than expansion plates. For adolescents in permanent dentition (age 12 to 16 years old), Hyrax and Haas are similar for posterior crossbite correction and increasing the inter-molar distance. The remaining evidence was insufficient to draw any robust conclusions for the efficacy of posterior crossbite correction.

### Orthodontic treatment for posterior crossbites [^2812ec2d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A posterior crossbite occurs when the top back teeth bite inside the bottom back teeth. When it affects one side of the mouth, the lower jaw may have to move to one side to allow the back teeth to meet together. Several treatments have been recommended to correct this problem. Some treatments widen the upper teeth while others are directed at treating the cause of the posterior crossbite (e.g. breathing problems or sucking habits). Most treatments have been used at each stage of dental development. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001.

Objectives

To assess the effects of orthodontic treatment for posterior crossbites.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 21 January 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 21 January 2014), and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 21 January 2014). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register and the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of orthodontic treatment for posterior crossbites in children and adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors, independently and in duplicate, screened the results of the electronic searches, and extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We attempted to contact the first named authors of the included studies for missing data and for clarification. We used risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to summarise dichotomous (event) data, and mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs to summarise continuous data. We performed meta-analyses using fixed-effect models (we would have used random-effects models if we had included four or more studies in a meta-analysis) when comparisons and outcomes were sufficiently similar.

Main Results

We included 15 studies, of which two were at low risk of bias, seven were at high risk of bias and six were unclear. Fixed appliances with mid-palatal expansionNine studies tested fixed appliances with mid-palatal expansion against each other. No study reported a difference between any type of appliance. Fixed versus removable appliancesFixed quad-helix appliances may be 20% more likely to correct crossbites than removable expansion plates (RR 1.20; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.37; two studies; 96 participants; low-quality evidence). Quad-helix appliances may achieve 1.15 mm more molar expansion than expansion plates (MD 1.15 mm; 95% CI 0.40 to 1.90; two studies; 96 participants; moderate-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence of a difference in canine expansion or the stability of crossbite correction. Very limited evidence showed that both fixed quad-helix appliances and removable expansion plates were superior to composite onlays in terms of crossbite correction, molar and canine expansion. Other comparisonsVery limited evidence showed that treatments were superior to no treatment, but there was insufficient evidence of a difference between any active treatments.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a very small body of low- to moderate-quality evidence to suggest that the quad-helix appliance may be more successful than removable expansion plates at correcting posterior crossbites and expanding the inter-molar width for children in the early mixed dentition (aged eight to 10 years). The remaining evidence we found was of very low quality and was insufficient to allow the conclusion that any one intervention is better than another for any of the outcomes in this review.

Dentofacial Orthopedics: Orthodontic Treatment for AI Patients

Orthodontic treatment for patients with AI aims to facilitate oral hygiene, improve tooth alignment, restore or maintain masticatory function, and prevent complications such as open bites or posterior crossbites. Patient and parent expectations often include esthetic improvements, and realistic goal setting is essential. Orthodontic treatment in AI presents unique challenges, including bracket bonding failure due to compromised enamel quality, longer treatment durations and higher complication rates, as well as increased sensitivity to pain.

Treatment is often conducted in phases. An examination around 6 to 8 years of age is recommended for early identification of anomalies. Initial efforts address tooth impaction, eruption difficulties, and space management issues, sometimes through serial extractions. Growth-modification methods, such as block appliances or reverse headgear, may be indicated in younger patients. Many alternatives are available nowadays. In cases of maxillary constriction, upper jaw expansion may also be required. The later stages involve aligning the dental arches.

A multidisciplinary team is always necessary. Backward planning, in collaboration with the specialized dentist, is essential before the start of the orthodontic treatment. For example, in some cases, alignment of the teeth may need to leave open or redistribute spaces between teeth to allow for indirect composite crowns or other prosthetic solutions to provide a complete mouth rehabilitation with an esthetic smile. This also helps to reduce severe hypersensitivity and prevent the preparation of the tooth surfaces. Restauration of contact points to establish proper distances between roots and re-establish a correct OVD; also extractions or intrusion of second molars may be required.

After the active treatment phase, a retention phase typically begins. Retention is managed using fixed retainers (bonded wires) and removable night guards to maintain the achieved treatment outcomes.

In adulthood, skeletal discrepancies must be re-evaluated, and surgical correction may be considered if necessary. – More recent approaches, such as aligners, are increasingly viable alternatives for orthodontic care in individuals with AI. Aligners can offer greater comfort and are often better accepted by patients with oral hypersensitivity. However, the retentive aspect must be carefully considered due to the reduction in the crown height and absence of undercuts. Close monitoring, including scheduling multiple consecutive appointments, is crucial for maintaining optimal oral hygiene and following up treatment progress.

### Surgical-orthodontic considerations in subcranial and frontofacial distraction [^d9f9ccd5]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Subcranial and frontofacial distraction osteogenesis have emerged as powerful tools for management of hypoplasia involving the upper two-thirds of the face. The primary goal of subcranial or frontofacial distraction is to improve the orientation of the upper face and midface structures (frontal bone, orbitozygomatic complex, maxilla, nasal complex) relative to the cranial base, globes, and mandible. The various techniques used are tailored for management of specific phenotypic differences in facial position and may include segmental osteotomies, differential vectors, or synchronous maxillomandibular rotation.

### Clinical guidelines for the manual titration of positive airway pressure in patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^be084207]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Positive airway pressure (PAP) modalities and titration approach — components, device types, and current standard are described. A PAP delivery system consists of three main components: a PAP device; a nasal, oral, or oronasal interface (i.e., nasal mask, nasal pillows, full-face mask) held to the face by headgear; and a flexible hose that connects the device to the interface. PAP devices are divided into four basic types depending on their pressure delivery options: continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bi-level positive airway pressure (BPAP), automatic titrating positive airway pressure (APAP), and adaptive servoventilation (ASV), with definitions provided for each. Nevertheless, manual titration of CPAP or BPAP is currently the gold standard for selection of the optimal (effective) pressure. A 2004 national survey reported that only 4% of PAP devices prescribed were APAP and that 30% of board certified sleep physicians reported having never prescribed APAP devices.

### Orthodontic preparation for orthognathic surgery [^2339ccff]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Orthodontic preparation is critical to the success of orthognathic surgery. Recognition and correction of existing dental compensations allows full correction of skeletal discrepancies. Presurgical orthodontic goals are important to define at the start of treatment and may not always include complete arch leveling or space closure, or ideal interdigitation. Orthodontic preparation dictates the skeletal movements that are possible at the time of surgery. Different malocclusion types have characteristic dental compensations that can be identified and described. Proper planning, monitoring, and communication between surgeon and orthodontist are critical to avoid potential pitfalls in the orthodontic preparation.

### Increase in sagittal depth of the bony nasopharynx following maxillary protraction in patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate [^b2e564d5]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Objective: To study the change in the sagittal depth of the bony nasopharynx in patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP), following maxillary protraction using reverse headgear. Methods: Nineteen patients (14 male, five female; aged 9.36 ± 2.89 years) with repaired complete UCLP underwent maxillary protraction with a Delaire type reverse headgear at a tertiary-care referral teaching hospital. Control data were taken from five patients (four male, one female; aged 8.25 ± 2.25 years) who did not receive any orthopedic/orthodontic treatment for a similar duration of time as the treated patients. Average treatment/observation period was 11.71 ± 3.39 months for the treated patients and 12.40 ± 2.60 months for the untreated subjects. Changes in the sagittal bony nasopharynx depth were measured by comparing pretreatment (T1) and posttreatment (T2) lateral cephalograms. Correlations between the changes in the bony nasopharynx depth and in other variables measured in the treated patients were analyzed. An exploratory analysis of differences in the changes from T1 to T2 between the treated patients and untreated subjects was also conducted. Results: The favorable skeletal changes seen in SNA and ANB following maxillary protraction were accompanied by a significant increase in the sagittal depth of bony nasopharynx (1.74 ± 1.10 mm; P < .001). This change was significant when compared with the data from the untreated subjects (P = 0.004). Correlations between the increase in bony nasopharynx depth and changes in other variables studied in the treated patients were weak and not statistically significant. Conclusion: Sagittal depth of the bony nasopharynx in patients with repaired UCLP increased following maxillary protraction therapy using reverse headgear.

### Orthodontic treatment for posterior crossbites [^5acadf08]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

'Posterior crossbite' occurs when the top back teeth bite inside the bottom back teeth. When it affects one side of the mouth the lower jaw may have to move to one side to allow the back teeth to meet together. It is unclear what causes posterior crossbites and they may develop or improve at any time from when the baby teeth come into the mouth to when the adult teeth come through. Several treatments have been recommended to correct this problem. Some treatments widen the upper teeth whilst others are directed at treating the cause of the posterior crossbite e.g. breathing problems or sucking habits. Most treatments have been used at each stage of dental development.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to evaluate orthodontic treatments used to expand the maxillary dentition and correct posterior crossbites.

Search Strategy

All randomised and controlled clinical trials identified from the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register according to the Oral Health Group Search Strategy and stored in the Cochrane Collaboration Oral Health Group Database of Clinical Trials, a MEDLINE search using the Mesh term Palatal Expansion Technique and relevant free text words, hand searching the British, European and American journals of orthodontics and Angle Orthodontist, and the bibliographies of papers and review articles which reported the outcome of orthodontic treatment to expand the maxillary dentition and/or correct a posterior crossbite that were published as abstracts or papers between 1970 and 1999.

Selection Criteria

All randomised and controlled clinical trials published as full papers or abstracts which reported quantitative data on the outcomes crossbite correction, molar and/or canine expansion, signs and symptoms of temporomandibular joint dysfunction or respiratory disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted without blinding to the authors, treatments used or results obtained. The first named authors of randomised and controlled clinical trials were written to in an attempt to establish the method of randomisation / allocation and identify unpublished studies. Odds ratio, relative risk, relative risk reduction, absolute risk reduction, the number need to treat and corresponding 95% confidence intervals, were calculated for event data. The weighted mean difference and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for continuous data.

Main Results

Using the search strategy seven randomised and five controlled clinical trials were identified but following correspondence with the authors, three of the randomised and one of the controlled clinical trials were reclassified giving five randomised and seven controlled clinical trials for inclusion in the review. For the update an additional CCT was found giving five RCTs and eight CCTs for inclusion in this update. Trials comparing occlusal grinding in the primary dentition with/without an upper removable expansion appliance in the mixed dentition versus no treatment, banded versus bonded and two point versus four point rapid maxillary expansion, banded versus bonded slow maxillary expansion, transpalatal arch with/without buccal root torque, an upper removable expansion appliance versus quad-helix were identified. Occlusal grinding in the primary dentition with/without the addition of an upper removable expansion plate, in the mixed dentition for those children who did not respond to grinding, was shown to be effective in preventing a posterior crossbite in the primary dentition from being perpetuated to the mixed and permanent dentitions. No evidence of a difference in treatment effect (molar and canine expansion) between the test and control intervention was found in the trials which compared banded versus bonded and two point versus four point rapid maxillary expansion, banded versus bonded slow maxillary expansion, transpalatal arch with/without buccal root torque, or upper removable expansion appliance versus quad-helix. Insufficient data were provided in the paper comparing two point versus four point rapid maxillary expansion to allow a formal analysis.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The evidence from the trials reported by Lindner (1989); Thilander (1984) suggests that removal of premature contacts of the baby teeth is effective in preventing a posterior crossbite from being perpetuated to the mixed dentition and adult teeth. When grinding alone is not effective, using an upper removable expansion plate to expand the top teeth will decrease the risk of a posterior crossbite from being perpetuated to the permanent dentition. The comparisons of treatments made in the trials reported by Asanza (1997); Sandikçioglu (1997); Mossaz-Joëlson (1989); Ingervall (1995); Schneidman (1990) were inconclusive so recommendations for clinical practice can not be made based on the results of these trials.

### Optimal management of orthodontic pain [^b3896af9]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Results

We recovered 1281 articles. Of these, 342 were duplicates and were excluded. The other 939 were classified on the basis of analyses of titles, abstracts, and keywords. Of these, 12 were not scientific articles and 820 were not aligned with the objective of this study. The other 107 articles were selected and subjected to a new classification, in which only randomized clinical trials were selected: 56 articles remained. Of these, 19 evaluated the effects of different types of drugs to manage orthodontic pain, 16 evaluated the effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT), and the other 21 studies evaluated other types of intervention (Figure 2). Table 1 shows the selected articles, their general methods, and the main outcomes.

Systematic analysis

Drug therapy

Several studies have evaluated the effects of different types of drugs on the control of orthodontic pain. Steen Law et alcompared three groups of patients subjected to the insertion of elastic separators. One group used ibuprofen 1 hour before and placebo 1 hour after the procedure; another group was administered placebo 1 hour before and ibuprofen 1 hour after the procedure, and the third group received only placebo 1 hour before and 1 hour after the procedure. The group that received the drug before the separator placement experienced less pain when compared to the other groups. Bernhardt et alcompared the use of ibuprofen administered only before the separator placement, both before and after the separator placement, and only after the separator placement. They observed that administration before the procedure was more effective in pain control. Minor et alcompared a group of patients who received ibuprofen both before and after separator placement with one group that received the drug only after the procedure and with another group that received only placebo. The group receiving the drug in both the preoperative and postoperative periods had a more effective pain reduction.

### Optimal management of orthodontic pain [^8c84461b]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Pain is an undesirable side effect of orthodontic tooth movement, which causes many patients to give up orthodontic treatment or avoid it altogether. The aim of this study was to investigate, through an analysis of the scientific literature, the best method for managing orthodontic pain. The methodological aspects involved careful definition of keywords and diligent search in databases of scientific articles published in the English language, without any restriction of publication date. We recovered 1281 articles. After the filtering and classification of these articles, 56 randomized clinical trials were selected. Of these, 19 evaluated the effects of different types of drugs for the control of orthodontic pain, 16 evaluated the effects of low-level laser therapy on orthodontic pain, and 21 evaluated other methods of pain control. Drugs reported as effective in orthodontic pain control included ibuprofen, paracetamol, naproxen sodium, aspirin, etoricoxib, meloxicam, piroxicam, and tenoxicam. Most studies report favorable outcomes in terms of alleviation of orthodontic pain with the use of low-level laser therapy. Nevertheless, we noticed that there is no consensus, both for the drug and for laser therapy, on the doses and clinical protocols most appropriate for orthodontic pain management. Alternative methods for orthodontic pain control can also broaden the clinician's range of options in the search for better patient care.

### Comment on "Near-normalized maxillomandibular relationship and upper airway in infants with robin sequence treated with stanford orthodontic airway plate" [^251008db]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

It's interesting to note that despite clinical improvements in upper airway dimensions, the maxillary, mandibular, and mandibular body lengths remained smaller than those of controls. This finding may represent an underlying neurocristopathy, which represents a deficiency in the population of neural crest cells available in the embryonic maxillary and mandibular processes de novo. Indeed, it is known that craniofacial dimensions in infants with malformations, such as cleft palate, are often smaller when compared to non-cleft counterparts. The post-treatment decrease in the SNA angle and increase in angle SNB, which resulted in a decreased ANB angle may be associated with a "headgear effect" whereby the maxilla is dragged postero-inferiorly by the mandible, aided by gravity. To avoid this effect, proactive maxillary development might be beneficial. In fact, the concept of "catch-up growth" is also noteworthy since a developmental mechanism would need to be invoked. The authors referred to the old Functional matrix hypothesis, but the treatment effect was primarily a change in jaw position, which evoked a positive functional outcome. Thus, according to the Spatial matrix hypothesis, clinical decompensation of a dysfunctional spatial matrix leads to a cascade of events since a change in mandibular position is associated with changes in gene expression. Recently, genetic expression of Sdf1 and Foxc1 associated with histologic changes following mandibular advancement in rats has been reported as well as the effects of the PINK1/Parkin pathway on the genioglossus muscle through mandibular advancement device use in rabbits with obstructive sleep apnea. Clinically, therapeutic epigenetic changes using an orthodontic mandibular advancement device have also been reported in children.

### Youth participation and injury risk in martial arts [^e97e9acf]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Martial arts protective equipment and concussion risk — There is "a lack of data suggesting that the use of padded or other protective headgear can prevent or reduce the consequences of martial arts–related concussions," and "at the time of this writing, it cannot be recommended with any level of certainty that use of any type of protective headgear or mouthguard can reduce the risk of concussions during sparring or competitive martial arts participation." Mouthguards reduce dental/oral trauma in other combat sports, but "no solid evidence exists in the martial arts or in any other type of sport or activity that suggests a reduction in concussion incidence or severity with mouthguard use." Clear plastic face guards or padded metal grills integrated into sparring headgear "do provide a significant level of eye and face protection," yet "Currently, few martial arts participants wear this type of protection" and "There are no published studies evaluating the use of eye protection in the martial arts." Soft body padding is used in some disciplines, but "there are no data on their efficacy in the practice of martial arts," and "no protective device worn during MMA competition can mitigate the potentially serious effects of chokeholds leading to near- or full suffocation" with risks including "anoxic brain injury" and "vertebral artery injury." The authors also note that "there is also the potential that protective headgear in other sports may actually confer a higher risk of concussion because of a potentially perceived false sense of security for participants, parents, and instructors."

### Late maxillary protraction in patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate: a retrospective study [^3d003abb]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

This retrospective study assessed the dentoskeletal effect of late maxillary protraction (LMP; reverse-pull headgear, Class III elastics, and maxillary sutural loosening) in unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) patients versus a control group of untreated UCLP patients.

Materials and Methods

Cephalograms taken at age 13 to 14 years (T1) and 17 to 18 years (T2) were used for this study. The study group comprised 18 patients (10 male and 8 female, mean age at start of LMP therapy = 13.4 [0.45] years). A control groups of 17 patients (8 male and 9 female, mean age = 13.5 [0.44] years) was used for comparison.

Results

The repeated-measures analysis of variance showed statistically significant changes across time between groups for the following variables (mean difference [T2-T1] in the study group, 95% confidence interval): SNA (°) (1.95, 0.75 to 3.15), A ⊥ Na Perp (mm) (1.82, 0.86 to 2.77), CoA (mm) (2.92, 1.53 to 4.31), ANB (°) (3.13, 2.02 to 4.24), Wits (mm) (7.82, 5.01 to 10.54), Mx-Md Diff (mm) (0.62, -1.58 to 2.83), Occl P-SN (°) (-3.98, -5.99 to -1.98), overjet (mm) (8.82, 5.90 to 11.74), FMIA (°) (4.05, -0.05 to 8.15), and IMPA (°) (-5.77, -9.74 to -1.80). Late maxillary protraction created a slight open bite (0.66 mm). Trends for overeruption of mandibular incisors and an increase in lower face height (P = 0.07 for both) were noted in the study group.

Conclusions

Late maxillary protraction produced a combination of skeletal changes (protraction of maxilla, improvement in the maxillo-mandibular skeletal relationship) and dental compensations (counterclockwise rotation of occlusal plane, retroclination of mandibular incisors) in patients with UCLP. Late maxillary protraction was also associated with some unwanted tooth movements (open bite tendency, mandibular incisors overeruption).

### Time used for orthodontic surgical treatment of dentofacial deformities in white patients [^b9de112d]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of the present study was to assess the duration of each treatment phase that a patient with dentofacial disorders and eligible for orthodontic surgery undergoes and to identify those factors that determine the time. We have also included a description of the demographic and skeletal characteristics of the patients treated at our center, the surgery type, and movements performed.

Patients and Methods

A sample of 148 patients undergoing orthognathic surgery from 2004 to 2007 at Princesa University Hospital, Madrid, was studied. The demographic data of each patient, their facial pattern, skeletal disorders, and surgical movements performed were recorded, as was the duration of orthodontic treatment, both pre- and postoperatively, length of surgery, and length of hospital stay.

Results

The length of preoperative orthodontic treatment was 24 months and that of postoperative treatment was 12 months. The average operative time was 4 hours for those interventions in which both dental arches were involved, and the average length of hospital stay was 3 days. No relevant differences were found for the length of orthodontic treatment according to gender, age, or type of skeletal disorder. Differences were observed in the length of hospital stay between those patients who underwent segmentation of the maxilla and those who did not.

Conclusions

The length of the different phases into which an orthodontic surgical treatment is divided can differ within some given limits. However, it does not depend on either the patients' demographic skeletal characteristics or the surgical movements performed.

### Updated guideline on treatment and management of craniosynostosis [^397d47cc]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

- Balance of Anticipated Desired and Undesired Outcomes

Following the opinion of the working group members, orthodontic pre-treatment in children with craniosynostosis will facilitate good oral hygiene, thus reducing the risk of periodontal problems. A good occlusion also ensures that no abnormal wear and tear and/or overloading of elements will occur due to abnormal tooth positions. Multiple interventions at different ages are regularly required.

Rationale of the recommendation(s)

The guiding principle in drawing up the recommendations is that very lengthy orthodontic treatments should be avoided. In almost all cases there will be several treatment phases, each with a specific goal. Each phase will be complementary and a preparation for the final jaw correction.

Recommendations

Research Gaps

Dentofacial abnormalities occur in almost all syndromic craniosynostosis abnormalities. However, there is still insufficient knowledge about the type and prevalence of dentofacial abnormalities and the effectiveness of orthodontic treatments in syndromic craniosynostosis patients. The extent to which patients with other syndromes such as Saethre-Chotzen and Muenke are as severely affected as Apert and Crouzon syndromes is unclear, as is a possible difference in type and prevalence of dentofacial abnormalities between single-suture and multisuture. For this reason, it is of great importance that treatment centres, both nationally and internationally, maintain a standard schedule of documentation that allows for data pooling and a better understanding of the course of the syndromic craniosynostosis during growth as well as the effect of surgery on it. Therefore, the conclusions will have to be interpreted with caution.

### Poor oral habits and malocclusions after usage of orthodontic pacifiers: an observational study on 3–5 years old children [^7feb8707]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of pacifiers is accepted during the first year of life, because it decreases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, due to its influences on autonomic and cardiovascular control; in addition, it could help to calm the children and improve his/her psychological development. Also other non-nutritive habits such as thumbsucking or fingersucking are often implemented by infants/children to pacify and comfort themselves, as sucking is a natural instinct for a baby, and it is the baby's first coordinated muscular activity. However, from the craniofacial development point of view, the use of a conventional pacifier for a long time (over 2 years) and with high frequency (a "daily use", as recently stated by Ling et al.) has been associated with some alterations of the occlusion, such as anterior open bite and posterior crossbite.

For this reason, the so-called orthodontic pacifiers have been introduced into the market, designed with a flattened nipple to simulate mothers' nipple anatomy, to maintain the necessary pressure of tongue on the palatal vault and to obtain a more acceptable lip seal, allowing its physiological development and reducing the side effects related to utilising conventional pacifiers. In fact, the use of such pacifiers would rise to replicate the patterns of muscle contraction, tongue position and nasal breathing similar to the ones occurring during breastfeeding, whereby they would not interfere with the growth and development of the face and occlusion.

The first systematic literature review on the differences between conventional and orthodontic pacifiers, was not able to draw any conclusion due to the low level of available studies, requesting more data on this field. That systematic review did not include parameters such as frequency and duration of pacifier usage. Another recent systematic review including five trials about the comparison between orthodontic and conventional pacifiers concludes that a proper definition for a functional or orthodontic pacifier is missing, and that functional orthodontic pacifiers seem to cause less anterior open bite than conventional ones, while the no statistical difference implies the absence of an association between the prevalence of posterior crossbite and the use of orthodontic pacifiers. Thus, the main conclusion stated the insufficiency of currently available evidence to support this hypothesis that the usage of orthodontic pacifiers is able to prevent malocclusion traits when compared to conventional ones, and that new data on orthodontic pacifiers effects are necessary in literature to substantiate the argument.

### Guideline for care of patients with the diagnoses of craniosynostosis: working group on craniosynostosis [^9ef12862]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Basic Question 2: What Orthodontic Care Is Indicated in Syndromic Craniosynostosis?

In view of the many dentofacial deformities (see above under question 1), extensive orthodontic care and guiding, including space management and eruption guidance, should start at a young age.

The general standard for current-day orthognathic treatment is both pre- and postoperative orthodontic treatment. The orthodontic-surgical intervention must be planned carefully, also on account of the skeletal malalignment of the jaws. It is not clear whether distraction osteogenesis to resolve airway problems, exophthalmia, or other objective problems could lead to further midface growth inhibition. The degree of mandibular growth is not clear. As long as the face has not fully grown, it is not possible to reach the ultimate goal on occlusion level. Insufficient information is available on the stability of the Le Fort III distraction osteogenesis (see facial deformities). Orthognathic surgery after reaching the skeletal age of 18 years is usually indicated to obtain normal alignment of the jaws and occlusion.

The following factors should be taken into account when planning treatment: patient's emotional age, mental age, and the related degree of cooperation. There is no research available on the retention phase after orthodontic treatment in syndromic craniosynostosis patients. It is not likely that this would be different from that in patients without syndromic craniosynostosis. From a study, in nonsyndromic craniosynostosis patients it appeared that retention is necessary after orthodontic treatment.

### Gummy smile: mercado-rosso classification system and dynamic restructuring with hyaluronic acid [^aea531c7]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study is presenting the clinical experience of the authors regarding GS classification and a comprehensive therapeutic approach with hyaluronic acid (HA) dermal fillers.

Classification of gummy smile

The smile can be classified according to different parameters (Table 1). For example, depending on the lips raising direction and the muscle group involved in the smile, it is classified into three categories: The cuspid smile, the complex smile, and the commissure smile or Mona Lisa smile.

Table 1
Different classification system of the smile. Adapted from Rubin and Londoño and Botero

*Also called Mona Lisa smile

Therapeutic strategies of the gummy smile

Attending its etiology, GS correction comprises different therapeutic strategies. Sometimes, if GS is due to gingival hyperplasia o altered passive eruption, orthodontic treatment using temporary anchorage devices or crown lengthening procedures should be assessed. For example, orthognathic surgery is indicated in those cases of vertical maxillary excess caused by excessive maxillary growth.

Apart from those described above, in the literature we find other surgical GS treatments such as muscle resection and lip re-positioning.

These interventional procedures have provided good results, but they are costly, time-consuming, and their incidence of complications is high, or simply, they are not acceptable for the patients as shown in Table 2.

### Does soccer headgear reduce the incidence of sport-related concussion? A cluster, randomised controlled trial of adolescent athletes [^8bfca3e7]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Data collection

Participants completed a self-report questionnaire prior to the season to collect information regarding their sex, date of birth, grade in school, history of SRCs and the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 3rd edition (SCAT3) Concussion Symptom and Symptom Severity Scale. Licensed athletic trainers (ATs) working with each team were responsible for inseason data collection and reported the type of headgear worn for each practice and competition as well as the onset of all SRC and non-SRC injuries electronically through REDCap. ATs and the coaching staffs recorded the number of soccer practice and competition athletic exposures (AEs) for each participant for the entire season.

ATs determined the onset, mechanism, injury characteristics and diagnosis of all SRC and non-SRC injuries by taking a history of the injured participant and performing the appropriate physical examination no later than 72 hours post injury. ATs recorded the incidence of any suspected SRC using the definition provided by the National Athletic Trainers' Association Position Statement: Management of Sport Concussionof an SRC as a 'trauma induced alteration in mental status that may or may not involve loss of consciousness'. When appropriate, injured participants were referred to their primary care physician for further evaluation and treatment.

Participants recovering from an SRC were allowed to return to full unrestricted participation in accordance with consensus-based guidelines. ATs (who were not blinded to group) monitored all participants who sustained an SRC, from the date of the onset of the injury, and recorded all missed exposures. Injured participants had to be cleared by a licensed medical provider (AT or physician) before being allowed to return to soccer. This clinician either was or may have been aware of the player's helmet use/non-use status.

Participant compliance and dropout

Enrolled participants (n = 94 males and n = 17 females) who decided to drop out prior to the start of the regular season were not included in the analyses. For participants who remained in the study, protocol compliance was monitored by the school AT. If a participant in the HG group did not wear their headgear for an Soccer Athletic Exposure (SAE), their participation was recorded as taking place without headgear. If a NoHG participant wanted to start wearing headgear on their own, they were allowed to do so and the AT recorded the type of headgear worn for each practice and game during the season. Participants were clearly aware of whether they were in the headgear or no headgear group.

### Tips and tricks for continuous positive airway pressure / noninvasive ventilation mask adjustments [^18a69f0b]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Homemade adaptation of two masks. (A) A rigid cloth was sewed between the top and the back of the headgear of an oronasal mask to avoid the forward mask sliding. Oronasal mask AirFit F20 S + small headgear of the oronasal mask AirFit F10 (ResMed). (B) A headgear extension of a nasal mask (nonny nasal mask, AG Industries) was added to extend the headgear, on the top of the head, of the current colored well appreciated nasal mask of the child (Wisp Giraffe nasal mask, Philips Respironics).

Other adaptations may be made to improve the ease of putting on and removing the headgear. Some parents have replaced magnetic fasteners with snap fasteners to make it easier to put on and take off the mask as well as eliminate the risks of possible magnetic interference with medical implants (Figure S1A). This strategy could also be useful to reinforce the headgear scratches which tend rapidly to damage over time.

Interestingly, another customization of the mask can be very helpful to prevent localized pain due to the pressure support of the headgear. Indeed, several children may complain of pain on the occiput area of the head due to the headgear support or on the junction between the headgear and the frame (rigid structure) of the mask. The use of pads glued directly over the headgear has proved its efficiency to relieve the pain (Figure S1B).

Strategies may also be used to help the patients with weak upper arms or limited arm elevation to close or open easily their masks by attaching a long cord to the bottom sides of the headgear to allow them to easily pull the headgear clips close to the fastener parts of the frame to close the mask, or to pull the headgear downwards to open it.

(C) Customized nasal mask combining a normal infant cap, the mask bubble and tubing of the Soft baby mask, and the headgear parts of the FlexiTrunk mask.

Older children may also present issues with their mask. In particular, the headgear may not be always adapted to the size of the head, especially in children with craniofacial abnormalities, or on the contrary for children with small heads. Some adaptations can be made using parts of different masks. However, homemade adaptation may be generally necessary and very effective. A 7‐year‐old child with a neuromuscular disease was ventilated using an oronasal mask because of facial hypotonia causing major mouth leaks with a nasal mask. The child was well adapted to the oronasal mask, but important leaks started to appear because of the sliding of the top headgear on the forehead. We advised the parents to sew a piece of rigid cloth between the top and the back of the headgear to prevent the sliding of the headgear (Figure 2A). Consequently, the mask was perfectly adapted to the child. Another 6‐year‐old boy was perfectly happy with his nasal mask except that the headgear became slightly small on the top of the head. A headgear extension was, therefore, added on the top of the head, using an extension available for another nasal mask, to allow the child to use his colored well appreciated nasal mask (Figure 2B).

### Guideline for care of patients with the diagnoses of craniosynostosis: working group on craniosynostosis [^4e13a430]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Recommendations

Oral hygiene must be monitored more intensively in comparison with the normal population.

Regular orthodontic monitoring is necessary in view of delayed dental development and abnormal eruption patterns (1 to 4 times a year).

In case of surgical intervention, coordinated orthodontic-surgical treatment is an integral part of the comprehensive management of syndromic craniosynostosis (surgical aspects are dealt with in detail in Chapter 7).

Immediately after surgery/distraction osteogenesis, orthodontic retention is indicated to stabilize the result and prevent relapse.

Provided the oral hygiene allows for this, permanent retention is achieved by means of retention wires and in addition a retention device that stabilizes the dental arches in relation to each other.

To ensure stability of the combined orthodontic-surgical interventions, orthodontic and facial orthopedic monitoring of the development into adulthood is indicated by means of standard protocol. Evaluation at least 2 years after treatment is required.

Instruction: Orthodontic Management. Monitoring in a Multidisciplinary Setting

To ensure stability of the combined orthodontic-surgical interventions, orthodontic and facial orthopedic monitoring of the development into adulthood is indicated, to be scheduled in relation to the characteristic developmental stages of the head and dentition. It is recommended to follow the schedule below (this is the recommended minimum set of records).

### Presurgical and postsurgical orthodontics in patients with cleft lip and palate [^8ccc9a55]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with cleft lip and palate (CLP) usually have skeletal Class III malocclusion with maxillary deficiency due to the cleft itself and fibrous scar tissue formation caused by the reconstructive surgery. In adult CLP patients with excessive jaw discrepancies, orthognathic surgery is often indicated to correct their functional and esthetic problems. However, CLP patients have different inherent structures that may require a strategic approach compared with noncleft Class III patients. Main differences in skeletal and dental findings of lateral cephalograms between CLP and noncleft Class III surgical patients are to be demonstrated. Furthermore, a strategic approach with various mechanics in the presurgical orthodontic stage will be applied to suit the distinct characteristic of the case. Successful clinical outcome was critically dependent on the close communication among the related specialists.

### Poor oral habits and malocclusions after usage of orthodontic pacifiers: an observational study on 3–5 years old children [^c129aa76]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This observational study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of poor oral habits and malocclusions among children after using an orthodontic type of pacifier. The sample (198 children, ranging between 3 and 5 years of age) is undoubtedly the most extensive report among the published literature, recording the data of children who have exclusively used an orthodontic pacifier. Thus, the collected data can be generalized for the population of children who use orthodontic pacifiers. In addition, previously, no study has looked into whether or how orthodontic pacifier sucking is interrelated with poor oral habits, mouth breathing and tongue thrust swallow.

In the present sample, the great part of children (78.28% of the whole sample) gladly started utilizing orthodontic pacifier during their first 3 months of life (78.79% of the whole sample), adopting it regularly throughout the night, in their first year of age (89.39% of the whole sample). Thus, the present data can confirm that orthodontic pacifier was generally well accepted by children, as this fact has already been reported in various literatures. In addition, the collected data of the present study revealed that the 91.41% of the parent/guardians had been properly informed right from the beginning about the advantages of orthodontic pacifiers over the conventional types and also the risks related to its prolonged usage. This also has been outlined that a great number of children were given their pacifiers during the night (89.39% of the whole sample), following the recommendations of pacifier usage, i.e. that it should be used while the infant is sleeping and not reinserted if the child drops it during sleep (today, the recommended usage would be for sleeping and for less than 4–6 h per day). These data are in close agreement with the fact that an orthodontic pacifier is adopted by those mothers who are adequately informed concerning the risks of using conventional pacifiers. The present data also indicate that no significant correlation was detected between the duration of the pacifier sucking and the prevalence of recurrent otitis, as recurrent otitis was recorded only for 20 children out of 198 (10.10%). Differently from another previous report, which observed that pacifier sucking for a period exceeding 10 months, increases the risk of recurrent otitis.

### Orthodontic and orthopaedic treatment for anterior open bite in children [^02a98976]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Anterior open bite occurs when there is a lack of vertical overlap of the upper and lower incisors. The aetiology is multifactorial including: oral habits, unfavourable growth patterns, enlarged lymphatic tissue with mouth breathing. Several treatments have been proposed to correct this malocclusion, but interventions are not supported by strong scientific evidence.

Objectives

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate orthodontic and orthopaedic treatments to correct anterior open bite in children.

Search Methods

The following databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 14 February 2014); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)(The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 1); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 14 February 2014); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 14 February 2014); LILACS via BIREME Virtual Health Library (1982 to 14 February 2014); BBO via BIREME Virtual Health Library (1980 to 14 February 2014); and SciELO (1997 to 14 February 2014). We searched for ongoing trials via ClinicalTrials.gov (to 14 February 2014). Chinese journals were handsearched and the bibliographies of papers were retrieved.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of orthodontic or orthopaedic treatments or both to correct anterior open bite in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of all reports identified. Risk ratios (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for dichotomous data. The continuous data were expressed as described by the author.

Main Results

Three randomised controlled trials were included comparing: effects of Frankel's function regulator-4 (FR-4) with lip-seal training versus no treatment; repelling-magnet splints versus bite-blocks; and palatal crib associated with high-pull chincup versus no treatment. The study comparing repelling-magnet splints versus bite-blocks could not be analysed because the authors interrupted the treatment earlier than planned due to side effects in four of ten patients.FR-4 associated with lip-seal training (RR = 0.02 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.38)) and removable palatal crib associated with high-pull chincup (RR = 0.23 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.48)) were able to correct anterior open bite. No study described: randomisation process, sample size calculation, there was not blinding in the cephalometric analysis and the two studies evaluated two interventions at the same time. These results should be therefore viewed with caution.

Authors' Conclusions

There is weak evidence that the interventions FR-4 with lip-seal training and palatal crib associated with high-pull chincup are able to correct anterior open bite. Given that the trials included have potential bias, these results must be viewed with caution. Recommendations for clinical practice cannot be made based only on the results of these trials. More randomised controlled trials are needed to elucidate the interventions for treating anterior open bite.

### Three-dimensional cephalometric analysis: the changes in condylar position pre-and post-orthognathic surgery with skeletal class III malocclusion [^f2d36a28]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The assessment of the cranio-facial structures forms a major part of the orthognathic diagnosis. Cephalometrics has established itself as one of the pillars of comprehensive orthodontic-orthognathic diagnosis and it also aids in treatment planning and follow up of the patients undergoing orthodontic-orthognathic treatment. Cephalometrics helps in the study of skeletal, dental, and soft tissue structures of the craniofacial region, helps in the classification of the skeletal and dental anomalies and establishes the facial type and also in predicting the growth-related changes and changes associated with the surgical treatment.

Traditionally skeletal and soft tissue changes following the orthognathic surgery have been assessed in 2 dimensions by superimposing the pre and the postoperative cephalographs on the stable structures of the face such as the anterior cranial base or by comparing the linear and the angular cephalometric measurement. Quantifying the surgical changes using three dimensional images follows the same method as traditional 2 dimensional analysis with the addition of the third dimension (the depth) which augments the amount of information obtained from the facial image. Recent advancement in imaging technology and computerized 3D computed tomography (CT) images has simplified the process of 3D planning by incorporating a computer assisted surgical procedure which has improved in the precision of the orthognathic surgery.

Skeletal class III malocclusion is considered as one of the easiest to identify but most difficult to treat, that is the reason it is also called as complex and intractable orthodontic disorders. It exhibits as the maxillary retrusion, mandibular protrusion or a combination of both with a concave facial profile. Facial asymmetry has been detected in 40% of patients with skeletal class III malocclusion. Asymmetrical surgical movement of the jaw can change the postoperative position of the mandibular condyle.

The prevalence of skeletal class III malocclusion is relatively high in the Chinese population than other ethnic group. Prevalence of class III malocclusion in Caucasians ranges from 0.8% to 4.0% and rises up to 12% to 13% in Chinese and Japanese populations. It not only affects the oral function such as chewing and deglutition but also affects the overall facial esthetics and tends to get worse as the age increases. Several distinct cephalometric features have been reported in class III patients, such as a short anterior cranial base length, acute cranial base angle, a short and retrusive maxilla, proclined maxillary incisors, retroclined mandibular incisors, an excessive lower anterior face height and obtuse gonial angle.

### Reliability and reproducibility of CBCT assessment of craniomaxillary changes before and after treatment for class III growing patients-a cautious or critical approach [^e25544e6]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Errors may arise in 4 subsequent steps of the data processing procedure: a) model reorientation, b) voxel-based superimposition, c) landmark identification (localization), and d) quantitative measurement. Firstly, even if the head for CBCT scans were consistently positioned according to the protocol, scan data with slight variations in head position would still occur due to such factors as varying body positions and neck curvatures. This could result in inter-observer variability in cranial base registration.

In this research, proper automated voxel registration need these two CBCT scanings approximated as far as possible, Two CBCTS with significant differences cannot be performed voxel registrationand. And different operators, using the same patient scans, the same references for registration, same software may or may not achieve proper registration. However, as the subjects' craniofacial characteristics were basically symmetrical, the method error could be minimized by model reorientation. Secondly, the voxel-based superimposition was semi-automated, requiring observers to select the relevant area before the computer executed the superimposition automatically. The error in this process was contingent upon the area chosen by the observers. If there was a discrepancy in the region selected on the pre- and post-treatment models during the initial superimposition, it could introduce errors into the superimposition results. To address this issue, we refrained from finalizing the superimposition until the results were consistent. Thirdly, two sources of error were identified during the landmark identification process in this study: a) Although it was comparatively straightforward to delineate landmarks in the 3D virtual surface models, the determination of the optimal slice or region for the localization of the selected landmarks posed a significant challenge; b) The three spatial planes are intrinsically interconnected. An alteration in the slice position within one plane will inevitably lead to the displacement of the reference line in another plane. Consequently, a certain level of proficiency on the part of the observers was indispensable, and in preparation for this, training was conducted utilizing an additional 30 sets of scan data for the observers. In the current investigation, despite the three observers possessing distinct professional backgrounds, this appeared to exert a minimal influence on the variance in measurement errors. The training and calibration of the observers or assessors is of paramount importance and cannot be overstated in scholarly inquiries. Additional exploration is necessitated to delve into other variables that are pertinent to the precision and repeatability of three-dimensional (3D) measurements, including parameters such as voxel size, scanning duration, and the extent of the scanning range. Within the scope of this research, a voxel resolution of 0.3 mm was employed, which contrasts with previous CBCT studies that have utilized resolutions ranging from 0.5 mm to as large as 3 mm. Recent scholarly contributions have suggested that diminutive voxel sizes are indicative of enhanced measurement accuracy and reduced measurement discrepancies.

### International consensus statement on the diagnosis, multidisciplinary management and lifelong care of individuals with achondroplasia [^f82db069]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Orthodontics and maxillofacial surgery in achondroplasia — A multidisciplinary check-up of children with achondroplasia should be scheduled at 5–6 years of age, including a specialist in orthodontics together with the breathing specialist and the ENT surgeon, and assessment by a specialist in orthodontics is important in children with achondroplasia given poor maxillary arch growth. Consider maxillary orthodontic expansion and maxillary non-surgical protraction to increase upper airway volume if, after pharyngeal surgery, there is residual OSA in individuals with achondroplasia. Orthognathic surgical care might be considered after the completion of bone growth in individuals with achondroplasia through Le Fort I or Le Fort III osteotomy; this procedure can be influenced by functional, aesthetic or sleep-related issues, and clear discussion with the child and family prior to this procedure should occur as facial expression is often altered.

### Braces have changed, from metal to Tooth-Colored to clear… [^4e674e39]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Your dentist tells you that you need braces, bringing back not-so-fond memories of kids being called "metal mouth. " Take heart. Braces have evolved and new alternatives in both look and materials are available. The FDA is responsible for reviewing these devices for safety and effectiveness and, as appropriate, granting marketing authorization for the devices before they can be sold. Q: Do I have to have a mouth full of metal. A: Your dentist or orthodontist will need to make that determination based on your dental exam. Traditional braces can be composed of metal, plastic, or ceramic brackets and can be colored to match the color of your teeth. And if you're feeling expressive, the rubber bands connecting the brackets come in different colors. Additionally, there are now alternatives called dental aligners that are clear and removable. However, they may not work for everyone's teeth. Ask your dentist or orthodontist if they are right for you. Q: How do traditional braces work.

A: Braces move teeth by applying pressure and usually consist of small metal, ceramic, or plastic brackets cemented to your teeth, connected by a wire, and held to the brackets by rubber bands. The wire is regularly tightened by the dentist or orthodontist, gradually shifting your teeth and jaw. Q: How do clear aligners work. A: Aligners are made of clear plastic material and are worn over your teeth to straighten them. You'll get a series of custom-made aligners and wear each one for 1–2 weeks, as directed by your dentist or orthodontist. This stage of treatment can take anywhere from six to 18 months. In the next stage of treatment, you will wear a retainer, also as directed by your dentist or orthodontist. This way, your teeth are gradually moved into the correct position according to your personal treatment plan. Q: Now my orthodontist says I need to wear a retainer. What's that for.

A: Retainers, worn nightly after you're done with the braces, help maintain tooth position so the bone in the tooth can solidify in the new position. Q: Are there certain types of food I should avoid eating when I have braces. A: Yes. You should avoid eating anything chewy or sticky, like gummy bears or chewing gum, and should try not to eat hard candies or popcorn, as these can damage the braces and prolong the time you must wear them.

### Dentoalveolar effects of early orthodontic treatment in patients with cleft lip and palate [^7d6b0d91]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The role of the orthodontist is central in the interdisciplinary management of orofacial clefts. Therapeutic intervention usually starts during the neonatal period with treatment of displaced alveolar segments, and follows throughout the deciduous and mixed dentition phases with the management of the skeletal and dental components of the developing dentition. Most of the patients will receive orthodontic therapy during adolescence, and sometimes into adulthood.

The continuous and often progressive nature of cleft-related orthodontic problems over the stages of growth and dental eruption makes it difficult to use routine orthodontic approaches. Treatment recommendations can be found for nearly every age; however, no clear-cut guidelines for optimal timing or method of intervention have been developed.

Many indices have been proposed to measure clinical outcomes related to different aspects of anatomical form and function in parts affected by the clefting process, usually reflecting specific interests of different disciplines. The primary purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of orthodontic treatment for maxillary hypoplasia on cleft patients starting the therapy at different ages. The sample of children was subclassified according to the age the interceptive orthodontic treatment was initiated.

The MHB system was selected from systems for assessing the severity of malocclusions since: it can be applied to any cleft type at any age, making its use easy in many different study samples; while the rest of indices utilize ordinal or categorical scales, the MHB follows a continuous 32-point scale before the age of 6, and a 40-point scale after that age. The large scoring range improves the level of sensitivity in the differentiation of the severity between the categories, and it tends to make the data more likely to be normally distributed, allowing the powerful, parametric statistical analysis.

In addition, MHB is the sole index that does not require calibration; it is simple and objective, showing similar rates of reliability among trained and nontrained operators. Moreover, a recent systematic review evaluating indices to assess malocclusion in CLP patients based on the WHO criteria, recommended the MHB system as the index of choice.

### Poor oral habits and malocclusions after usage of orthodontic pacifiers: an observational study on 3–5 years old children [^ab9da6d8]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

With regard to the prevalence of malocclusions, in the present study, all the various types of malocclusions hypothetically correlated to poor oral habits were summarized together in a unique variable (i.e. "malocclusions"). The logistic regression failed to evidence any correlation between orthodontic pacifier sucking and the presence of malocclusions in the present sample, as only the gender and the breastfeeding variables were significantly related to the prevalence of malocclusion (Table 2). Also, the duration of using orthodontic pacifier was not associated to the prevalence of malocclusions. This could be considered an interesting finding, as malocclusion in the deciduous dentition represents a risk factor for the necessary orthodontic treatment of permanent dentition.

In the present sample, 36 children out of 198 (18.18% of the sample) showed a posterior crossbite (28 children showed unilateral crossbite, and 6 children showed bilateral crossbite). The prevalence of posterior crossbite in children using conventional pacifiers varies from 12.8 to 88.9%, as evaluated in a recent systematic review. But in a sample of 55 children using orthodontic pacifiers, Lima et al. reported only 4 cases out of 55 having posterior crossbite (7.27%). To explain the difference with the present sample, we should consider that Lima et al. recorded a very low prevalence of crossbite (6 children out of 55, i.e. less than 10% of the sample) even among children using conventional pacifiers. Thus, the results observed from Lima et al. could be associated not only to the type of pacifier, but probably to the lower mean age of children, that was 28.2 ± 1.9 months (with an initial age range for selection of subjects indicated as 12–24 months) in their sample, while in the present study the age of the children ranged between 3 and 5 years. Furthermore, Lima et al. excluded subjects with enlarged adenoids or respiratory problems, with history of finger sucking, lip sucking, lip biting and lingual interposition, while in the present sample these exclusion criteria were not adopted. Thus, the percentage observed in the present sample appear more generalizable to the population of children adopting orthodontic pacifiers.

### Comparison between head rotation and standard techniques for I-gel ™ insertion: a randomized controlled trial [^7557550e]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In the standard technique group, i-gel insertion was performed by the operator according to the manufacturer's instructions. The i-gel was introduced into the oral cavity along the hard palate in the sniffing position with the head unrotated. Pushing posteriorly, the i-gel was gently advanced along the hard palate, soft palate, and oropharynx to the hypopharynx until resistance was experienced. In the head rotation group, the heads of patients were rotated to the left to the maximum before inserting i-gel from the right side of the tongue, which was allowed to descend downward due to gravity. Further, it was gently advanced until the i-gel reached the soft palate and oropharynx, indicating it had reached the level of the tongue base. Thereafter, the head was returned to a neutral position. Subsequently, the i-gel was advanced further into the hypopharynx until resistance was encountered.

If advancement of the i-gel was impeded in both groups before reaching the hypopharynx, the i-gel was withdrawn and reinserted. If insertion failed despite this second attempt, it was recorded as a 'failure using the allocated technique', and the operator made a third attempt using the opposite insertion technique. A research assistant assessed successful i-gel placement based on a square-wave capnogram and the absence of an audible leak at a peak airway pressure ≥ 10 cmH 2 O. If deemed improperly placed despite various manipulations such as slight advancement or withdrawal of the i-gel, neck extension, or flexion, the insertion attempt was considered a failure. Each attempt was limited to a maximum of 60 s. The research assistant recorded the number of attempts and the time required to achieve successful placement.

### Dentoalveolar effects of early orthodontic treatment in patients with cleft lip and palate [^85615166]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Orthodontic Treatments

Orthodontic treatment includes maxillary expansion to correct the reduced transverse dimension, maxillary protraction to reduce maxillary retrusion, and incisor alignment and proclination to resolve crowding, rotations, and anterior crossbites.

Transverse expansion of the maxilla was obtained through the quad-helix appliance (0.038 inches/0.965 mm Blue Elgiloy), soldered to bands on the maxillary primary second molars or permanent first molars (Fig. 3). The appliance was initially activated to provide a force of 200 g per side; subsequent reactivations were done extraorally at 6-week intervals.

FIGURE 3
Intraoral view of a quad helix appliance.

To achieve maxillary protraction, a posteroanterior orthopedic force carried out by a Delaire facial mask connected to an intraoral double arch appliance was applied. Two heavy (700 and 350 g on each side) elastics were attached from the soldered intraoral hooks in the cuspid area to the support bar of the facemask. The direction of the forward force was 15° downward in relation to the occlusal plane. Patients were instructed to wear the facemask for 12 hours per day, including at night.

Maxillary incisor rotation, lingual inclination, and anterior cross-bite were variously corrected by using partial fixed and removable orthodontic appliances.

Statistical Methods

The data was evaluated for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables at T0, and for variations from T0 to T1 either in the overall group of patients and in subgroups A and B. Differences between types of cleft at T0 were established through the analysis of variance and Tukey post-hoc tests.

Paired t tests were used to investigate the overall treatment effect by comparing the longitudinal changes in T0 and T1.

The following statistical comparisons were carried out with the independent t test: starting form: differences between the subgroup A and the subgroup B at T0; and treatment effects: T0-T1 changes in the subgroup A versus T0–T1 changes in the subgroup B.

Data were analyzed with the IBM-SPSS version 20 statistical software. Statistical significance was tested at P < 0.05. The power of the study was calculated on the basis of the difference between T0 and T1 in the treated group for a relevant variable (intercanine distance) as reported in a previous longitudinal investigation of similar nature and on the basis of the standard deviation of this difference. The power exceeded 0.80 at an α level of 0.05.

### Unilateral cleft lip and palate: long-term results of the malek technique [^7dde5bb8]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A facial cleft can be labial, labio-maxillary (unilateral or bilateral), labio-maxillary-palatal (unilateral or bilateral), or isolated palatal. 1 Depending on the type of cleft and the age of the child, feeding, speech, ear-nose-throat (ENT), dental, orthodontic, aesthetic, and psychological problems will be present.

Unilateral cleft of the lip and palate (uCLP) is the most common type and represents 37% to 50% of all cases of clefts. Clefts are twice as frequent in Asia as in Europe, and half as frequent among the black population. Their incidence seems to be higher in poor social conditions.

In developed countries, handling of a cleft starts at the time it is diagnosed, ideally before birth, and ends when the child is fully grown. A multidisciplinary team of experienced specialists is a necessity in order to handle the diverse problems of children born with a cleft and to follow them through each developmental stage. The objective of the team is to bring together specialists in rehabilitation in order to optimize the care and the treatment in all fields: facial aesthetics, orthodontics, ENT, speech, and psychological.

### Guideline for care of patients with the diagnoses of craniosynostosis: working group on craniosynostosis [^1e0c3188]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

In the literature, the roles of the different specialties are not always discussed. The ACPA does not even mention specialties, but it does mention the necessary specialist knowledge and skills.

Roles of the specialists mentioned are the following:
Plastic surgeon: operative correction of cranial/facial deformities, including outer ear/hands.
Neurosurgeon: trepanning with/without reconstruction; analysis and therapy of brain malformations.
Oral and maxillofacial surgeon, surgical correction of the maxilla and mandible: if necessary surgical correction of the face with plastic surgery
Otolaryngology/audiology/speech therapy, hearing: speech and breathing analysis and treatment.
Orthodontist: collecting data for monitoring craniofacial growth, assisting in the decision about the treatment modality, orthodontic treatment in accordance with surgical requirements, participation in perioperative care and retention, and evaluation of treatment results,
Dentist/prothetist/dental hygienist: dental care (including position of the teeth) and shape of the jaw, possibly with occlusion images –,
Pediatrician: analysis of general health, growth and development in children,–
Ophthalmology, eye direction, and eye function (visual acuity, strabismus, fundoscopy).
Genetics, analysis of congenital defects and heredity: gene/chromosome analysis,
Anesthesiologist, perioperative monitoring of vital signs, anesthetics, and pain management,
Radiologist assesses the imaging tests and helps select the optimal treatment
Psychology/social work: psychometric/psychologic screening and treatment/guidance, social, and financial family counseling.
Nurse practitioner, care coordinator, guiding the patient and parents, dietary guidance, monitoring of growth and development,

Aims of treatment within a multidisciplinary structure:
Better (protocol based) care and coordination (eg, improvement of quality by concentration of care),–
Lesser burden for the patients/parents,
Higher satisfaction of the patients/parents,
More efficient utilization of resources,
Better information provision,
Conduct a survey to evaluate the patient's satisfaction

Furthermore, an important aim for the craniofacial team should be:
To organize meetings for parents, patients, relatives, other health care professionals, and the community in a broader sense to enhance understanding of craniofacial deformities
To organize or support parents' associations

Conclusions

Considerations

Pedagogical care is a valuable tool to prepare the child and his or her parents for the surgical procedures/treatments (see chapter 18).

### Achieving differential facial changes with Le fort III distraction osteogenesis: the use of nasal passenger grafts, cerclage hinges, and segmental movements [^a0140bef]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In traditional Le Fort III distraction, the transport segment is advanced en bloc without addressing differences in the relative retrusion of the facial structure. The authors describe three methods for correcting these asymmetries with differential facial advancement.

Methods

Eight patients (age range, 4 to 20 years) with asymmetric facial hypoplasia were treated by Le Fort III midface distraction using an external device. Two patients with nasal bone hypoplasia exceeding midface retrusion were treated with nasal passenger grafts at the time of osteotomy. Two patients with asymmetric rotational midface deformities underwent wire cerclage swing advancement of the affected side to achieve differential advancement. Four patients with central nasomaxillary retrusion exceeding zygomatic retrusion underwent segmental Le Fort III osteotomy with simultaneous zygoma repositioning and Le Fort II distraction.

Results

Differential midface advancement was achieved in all patients. Midface distraction and nasal passenger grafts resolved obstructive sleep apnea, improved globe protection, and improved fit of prescription glasses. After Le Fort III swing advancement, the centric relation and malar asymmetry were corrected with differential advances of 10 and 15 mm compared with the unaffected side. In the segmental osteotomy Le Fort III group, the central face was distracted independently of the zygoma repositioning, thus correcting the shortened retruded central midface without distorting the orbitomalar relationship and improving airway obstruction, anterior open bite, short nose, and proptosis.

Conclusions

Midface distraction techniques have evolved to include the principles of segmentation, graft augmentation, and controlled rotation. The benefits of gradual distraction can be realized without compromising the aesthetic and functional result.

### A new method to orient 3-dimensional computed tomography models to the natural head position: a clinical feasibility study [^2f4865a0]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical feasibility of a new method to orient 3-dimensional (3D) computed tomography models to the natural head position (NHP). This method uses a small and inexpensive digital orientation device to record NHP in 3 dimensions. This device consists of a digital orientation sensor attached to the patient via a facebow and an individualized bite jig. The study was designed to answer 2 questions: 1) whether the weight of the new device can negatively influence the NHP and 2) whether the new method is as accurate as the gold standard.

Patients and Methods

Fifteen patients with craniomaxillofacial deformities were included in the study. Each patient's NHP is recorded 3 times. The first NHP was recorded with a laser scanning method without the presence of the digital orientation device. The second NHP was recorded with the digital orientation device. Simultaneously, the third NHP was also recorded with the laser scanning method. Each recorded NHP measurement was then transferred to the patient's 3D computed tomography facial model, resulting in 3 different orientations for each patient: the orientation generated via the laser scanning method without the presence of the digital orientation sensor and facebow (orientation 1), the orientation generated by use of the laser scanning method with the presence of the digital orientation sensor and facebow (orientation 2), and the orientation generated with the digital orientation device (orientation 3). Comparisons are then made between orientations 1 and 2 and between orientations 2 and 3, respectively. Statistical analyses are performed.

Results

The results show that in each pair, the difference (Δ) between the 2 measurements is not statistically significantly different from 0°. In addition, in the first pair, the Bland-Altman lower and upper limits of the Δ between the 2 measurements are within 1.5° in pitch and within a subdegree in roll and yaw. In the second pair, the limits of the Δ in all 3 dimensions are within 0.5°.

Conclusion

Our technique can accurately record NHP in 3 dimensions and precisely transfer it to a 3D model. In addition, the extra weight of the digital orientation sensor and facebow has minimal influence on the self-balanced NHP establishment.

### Indications to the use of condylar repositioning devices in the surgical treatment of dental-skeletal class III [^64a5882c]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this report was to compare the clinical and radiographic findings observed at the 12-month follow-up in 2 groups of 15 patients who underwent Le Fort I and bilateral sagittal split osteotomy for the correction of dental-skeletal Class III. In the first group, the condylar positioning devices were used, whereas in the second group, an alternative method was used for the intraoperative assessment of mandibular repositioning.

Materials and Methods

All of the patients of our study in the immediate presurgical period were without temporomandibular joint disorders and with a normal anatomic relationship between condyle and fossae. The condyle position and morphology were examined at the 12-month follow-up through cephalometric measurements and the postsurgical findings in both groups were compared with those observed in the presurgical period.

Results

In all of the 30 patients in our study, no relapse or postsurgical temporomandibular joint disturbance was observed at the 12-month follow-up. Variations in condyle position of more than 2 mm or 2 degrees were not observed in the 15 patients treated with condylar positioning devices. Changes in condyle position between 2 and 4 mm and 2 degrees and 4 degrees were observed in 6 of the 15 patients treated without the devices.

Conclusions

The use of condylar positioning devices can be avoided in patients with dental-skeletal Class III without presurgical temporomandibular dysfunction. The manual positioning of the mandibular condyle is easier, but it requires the utmost care and an experienced operator.

### Guideline for care of patients with the diagnoses of craniosynostosis: working group on craniosynostosis [^82951e5d]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The definitive sagittal correction is performed as soon as sufficient coordination of the dental arches has been reached at the age from 18 to 20 years.

Orthodontic-surgical management requires careful three-dimensional cephalometric planning in consultation with the surgeon. Presurgical orthodontic treatment is aimed at alignment of the dental arches and preparing for surgery. A rigid or semirigid dental anchoring construction is needed if surgery is performed in combination with distraction osteogenesis. In internal distraction osteogenesis, traction both at dental and skeletal level is needed to guarantee maximum stability, security, and optimal vector control during the active phase (± 1 month) and retention phase (± 3 months) of the distraction osteogenesis. Bone anchoring is a must, traction at dental level only is advised against in all cases. During the internal distraction osteogenesis, (extra) internal traction can be used such as a face mask. In all patients, postoperative stabilization should be achieved using intermaxillary elastic bands and/or a face mask. Orthognathic surgery is needed (also on account of the characteristic open bite) to achieve the optimal end result, that is, normal alignment of the jaws and occlusion. On the other hand, psychosocial problems and (low) level of cognitive functioning may dictate compensating orthodontic management only.

Provided the oral hygiene allows for this, permanent retention is achieved by means of retention wires and in addition a retention device that stabilizes the dental arches in relation to each other. Regular monitoring is essential and evaluation should take place at least 2 years after treatment.

There is no solid evidence that orthodontic management and counseling of patients with syndromic craniosynostosis should be teamwork. Still, in view of the complex multidisciplinary nature of the problems this would seem obvious; the necessity of teamwork has been accepted worldwide for conditions such as cleft, to name one. From the perspectives of the patient and parents/care takers, however, the burden will be heavy as usually multiple stages of active orthodontic therapy are indicated, and treatment consequently will continue over several years. A patient and parents/care takers will have to visit the treatment center at least 10 times a year. Thus, a balance must be found between a limited number of centers for the orthodontic management of craniofacial deformities and good geographical distribution nationwide.

### Reliability and reproducibility of CBCT assessment of craniomaxillary changes before and after treatment for class III growing patients-a cautious or critical approach [^e4609a07]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Corresponding pairs of pre- and post-treatment CBCT scans of 27 children, aged 8–11 years before treatment, who had received protraction therapy for their Class III malocclusion at the Department of Orthodontics of the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital were included in this study. All patients or their parents gave consent to participate in this study, after hearing a thorough explanation of the research objectives and procedures. The two scans were taken on average 24 to 26 months apart. The scan was included in the analysis based on: cervical vertebral maturation (CS1-CS3); clear and legible 3D images; Class III malocclusion The Exclusion criteria were: discernible craniofacial asymmetry; discernible mandibular asymmetry; temporomandibular joint disorders; history of maxillofacial trauma or surgery in the region; some systemic disease; and previous orthodontic treatment. The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Commission of the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital.

The CBCT imaging parameters were configured as follows: 120 kVp, 18.54 mA, a field of view measuring 23 × 17 cm, a voxel size of 0.3 mm, and a scanning duration of 8.9 s. The acquired data were subsequently exported in DICOM format and imported into a 3D imaging software application, namely InvivoDental software version 5.1.3 (manufactured by Anatomage Inc. San Jose, USA), where a three-dimensional model of the patient was generated within a 3D coordinate framework. The spatial positioning and orientation of the digital 3D model within this framework were contingent on the patient's head posture during CBCT acquisition. Within the"section"module, the orientation of the 3D virtual model was facilitated by utilizing axial, coronal, and sagittal perspectives on the left side of the screen, while on the right side, the model was positioned: in the lateral view, structures such as the orbits, external auditory canals, and other relevant features were aligned to achieve maximum overlap, and the Frankfurt horizontal plane was orientationally adjusted parallel to the ground Fig. 1.

### Poor oral habits and malocclusions after usage of orthodontic pacifiers: an observational study on 3–5 years old children [^40385d26]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pacifier sucking habit has been associated in the literature with alterations of dental occlusion, and it could be a predisposing factor for other poor oral habits among children. Orthodontic pacifiers have been introduced in the market aiming to reduce these disadvantages caused by the conventional type of pacifiers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of poor oral habits and malocclusions, after usage of orthodontic pacifiers in children with primary dentition.

Methods

A sample of 198 pre-school children, aged 3–5 years, (96 males and 102 females) who had exclusively used an orthodontic pacifier were included in order to assess the level of poor oral habits and the absence/presence of dental malocclusion. Firstly, children's parents/legal guardians were given a validated questionnaire, then the children were clinically examined at a dental clinic.

Results

Most of the children (79.79%) had started using the orthodontic pacifier within the first 3 months of life, and the 43.49% of them continued using it over a period of 2 years. The recorded percentage for those who had used it throughout sleep was 89.39%. Mouth breathing during the night was reported for 36.04% of the children. Tongue thrust swallow affected 16.16% of the sample. The 5.56% of the data indicated the presence of fingersucking/thumbsucking habit. The noted percentages for children with lip biting, lingual interposition between teeth at rest and those with nail biting, were 5.56, 12.63 and 15.15%, respectively. The regression revealed a significant contribution between early start of using an orthodontic pacifier with the prevalence of fingersucking/thumbsucking (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04–0.47, p = 0.0004).

This also reported a noticeable increase of the malocclusion prevalence among the female gender (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.42–5.31), as well as those who were not exclusively breastfed (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.17–4.37).

Conclusions

Orthodontic pacifiers does not favor the development of poor oral habits, even if it has been used for a period of 2 years in children with primary dentition. Children who begin to use orthodontic pacifier between 0 and 3 months, are less likely to acquire fingersucking/thumbsucking habit. The use of an orthodontic pacifier appears not to be correlated with the prevalence of malocclusion in primary dentition, differently from what stated in literature about the conventional type of pacifier.

### Clinical guideline for the evaluation, management and long-term care of obstructive sleep apnea in adults [^92ba412b]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Oral appliances (OA) for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) — evaluation, fitting, risks, and follow-up: Patients should undergo a thorough dental examination to assess candidacy for an OA including dental history, complete intra-oral examination, soft tissue, periodontal and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) assessment, appraisal for wear from nocturnal bruxism, and evaluation of occlusion; dental records should be reviewed and dental radiographs or a panorex survey may be obtained to assess pathology. Although a cephalometric evaluation is not always required for patients who will use an OA, appropriately trained professionals should perform cephalometric examinations when they are deemed necessary (Option), and oral appliances should be fitted by qualified dental personnel trained and experienced in oral health, the TMJ, dental occlusion, and associated structures. Candidates for a mandibular repositioning appliance (MRA) require adequate healthy teeth, no important TMJ disorder, adequate jaw range of motion, and adequate manual dexterity and motivation to insert and remove the OA, as determined by a qualified dental professional (Consensus); tongue retaining devices (TRDs) may be used at any phase but may be useful when the patient lacks prerequisites for MRAs (Consensus). Intolerance and improper use are potential problems; OAs may aggravate TMJ disease and may cause dental malposition and discomfort, and OAs can be rendered ineffective by patient alteration of the device (Option). For patients with OSA, desired outcomes include resolution of clinical signs and symptoms and normalization of the apnea-hypopnea index and oxyhemoglobin saturation (Standard); general OSA outcomes should be monitored shortly after initiation and then as frequently as needed (Consensus); and to ensure satisfactory benefit patients should undergo PSG or an attended cardiorespiratory (type 3) sleep study with the oral appliance in place after final adjustments if it have been performed (Guideline).
