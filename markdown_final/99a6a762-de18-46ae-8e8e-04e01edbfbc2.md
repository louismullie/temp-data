## Question

Cognitive improvement after shunt for nph

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cognitive function improves after shunt surgery for normal pressure hydrocephalus and how confident we can be in that conclusion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality randomized evidence. Then, I should verify what meta-analyses and systematic reviews say across broader cohorts. Next, I will examine prospective cohorts and controlled designs to check for practice effects. After that, I need to assess durability and long-term outcomes. I will then review predictors of cognitive response, including biomarkers and imaging. Finally, I should consider the magnitude and clinical meaningfulness of any changes and synthesize a cautious, clinically useful answer with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the highest-quality evidence. The 2024 Cochrane review of randomized trials found that CSF shunting probably improves gait and disability at less than 6 months, but the evidence for cognitive improvement is very uncertain, with a pooled standardized mean difference of 0.35 and a 95% CI crossing zero, indicating no definitive benefit for cognition in RCTs to date [^111vyaKm]. Wait, let me verify the most recent randomized data. The 2025 NEJM double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients selected for gait response to CSF drainage showed significant improvement in gait velocity and balance at 3 months but no significant improvement in MoCA, reinforcing that cognition is the least responsive domain in rigorously controlled settings [^117JvR5t].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from RCTs alone. I should review broader syntheses. Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prospective, within-subject studies report statistically significant improvements across several cognitive domains after shunting, including global cognition on MMSE, learning and memory on RAVLT, psychomotor speed on Trail Making Test A, and some executive measures like phonemic fluency, though heterogeneity is high and executive function findings are less consistent [^113gAdWk] [^1132Kby4] [^115babf9]. I need to ensure we account for practice effects; controlled studies with healthy comparators or retest designs show that improvements in mental tracking speed and sustained attention exceed practice effects, supporting a true treatment signal in selected domains, albeit smaller and less reliable than gait gains [^111tMjRv] [^115CXyzC].

> Next, I should review durability and long-term outcomes. Long-term cohorts show that while gait improvement is often sustained, cognitive gains tend to wane over time. At 5 years, only about 40% maintain favorable health-related quality of life, and among long-term survivors, fewer than 10% show sustained improvement on formal cognitive tests, with age, comorbidity, and competing neurodegeneration eroding benefit [^112qy9UM]. But wait, what if shunt-responsive patients still do well? Even in shunt-responsive iNPH, long-term dementia risk remains substantial, with 80% experiencing cognitive decline and 46% meeting criteria for dementia at a median 4.8-year follow-up, underscoring that shunting does not prevent later neurodegeneration in many patients [^116mvjFE].

> I will now examine predictors of cognitive response, because selection likely explains variability. Let me consider Alzheimer's pathology first. Patients with higher CSF phosphorylated tau, indicating concomitant AD, show transient or minimal cognitive gains that fade by 1–3 years, whereas those with low p-tau demonstrate sustained improvement; cortical biopsy studies likewise show attenuated cognitive and global response when moderate-to-severe AD pathology is present [^112fSyA2] [^117CxNuJ] [^113Q6QjS]. I should double-check other biomarkers. Higher preoperative Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and favorable changes in toxic Aβ conformers after CSF diversion correlate with better cognitive outcomes, suggesting that less AD-like biology portends more durable benefit, though replication is needed [^116SyeAD] [^115bwTXf]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought MRI volumetrics might predict cognitive response, but I need to correct that; preoperative ventricular or brain volumes do not reliably predict shunt response, whereas DTI metrics of white matter integrity and advanced MRI-based models show promise for predicting gait and possibly cognitive outcomes, though cognition prediction remains less robust than gait [^111cJFvZ] [^1172gRrq] [^114TmcC2].

> Let me think about the magnitude and clinical meaningfulness of cognitive change. In RCTs, MoCA changes are small and not statistically significant, whereas in uncontrolled series, MMSE improvements of roughly 1–3 points are common but often reflect ceiling effects in higher-functioning patients; more sensitive batteries like RAVLT and Trail Making A show larger, clinically detectable gains in memory and processing speed in appropriately selected patients [^117JvR5t] [^115CXyzC] [^113gAdWk]. I should confirm that these gains translate to function. Prospective cohorts using comprehensive neuropsychological testing demonstrate improvements across memory, executive function, attention, and psychomotor speed at 3–6 months, but patients remain below age-matched norms, indicating partial rather than complete restoration [^115GE3xP] [^114Ku8zV].

> Synthesis and clinical implications: I need to ensure the conclusion matches the totality of evidence. Cognitive improvement after shunting in iNPH is real but modest, less consistent and smaller than gait improvement, and highly dependent on patient selection and comorbid neurodegeneration. High-quality RCTs have not yet demonstrated significant cognitive benefit, whereas observational and meta-analytic data suggest improvements in global cognition, memory, and psychomotor speed in a subset, with durability limited by age and competing pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease [^111vyaKm] [^117JvR5t] [^113gAdWk] [^116mvjFE]. Clinically, I should counsel that gait and disability are most likely to improve and that cognitive gains, if they occur, are typically partial and may not be sustained beyond 1–3 years in many patients. Careful preoperative prognostic testing, including CSF biomarkers and, where appropriate, extended lumbar drainage with serial cognitive assessments, can help identify those most likely to benefit cognitively, while MRI-based tools may refine prognosis but are not yet definitive for cognition [^115NRgYQ] [^111zBJjm] [^116SyeAD] [^114TmcC2].

---

Cognitive improvement after shunt surgery for NPH is **modest and variable**, with about 30–50% of patients showing measurable gains in memory, attention, and executive function at 3–12 months [^112qy9UM] [^114NakFB]. Improvements are typically **partial and rarely normalize**, and executive function is the least likely domain to improve [^114KXJfD] [^114NakFB]. Younger age, shorter symptom duration, and absence of significant comorbid neurodegenerative pathology predict better cognitive outcomes [^112cshwB] [^113Q6QjS] [^117CxNuJ]. Long-term durability is limited, with many patients declining again by 3–5 years due to aging and comorbidities [^112qy9UM] [^112vTc27]. Overall, **cognition improves less and less reliably than gait**, and patient selection is critical for optimizing cognitive outcomes [^111vyaKm] [^116QhRUK].

---

## Extent and pattern of cognitive improvement

- **Global cognitive function**: Meta-analyses report significant improvements in global cognitive measures (e.g. MMSE), but effect sizes are modest and heterogeneous [^113gAdWk] [^1132Kby4].

- **Memory**: Verbal learning and memory (e.g. RAVLT) show consistent improvements in both total and delayed recall after shunting [^113gAdWk] [^1132Kby4].

- **Executive function**: Evidence for executive function improvement is weaker and inconsistent; phonemic verbal fluency improves, but higher-order executive tasks often do not [^114KXJfD] [^115babf9].

- **Psychomotor speed**: Trail Making Test A shows reliable improvements, indicating gains in processing speed [^113gAdWk] [^1132Kby4].

---

## Factors influencing cognitive improvement

Several factors influence the likelihood and magnitude of **cognitive improvement** after shunt surgery:

| **Factor** | **Influence on cognitive improvement** |
|-|-|
| Age | Younger patients have better cognitive outcomes; older age limits improvement [^notfound] |
| Symptom duration | Shorter preoperative symptom duration predicts better cognitive response [^112cshwB] |
| Comorbid neurodegenerative pathology | Presence of Alzheimer's or other neurodegenerative disease reduces cognitive improvement [^113Q6QjS] [^117CxNuJ] |
| Preoperative cognitive severity | Patients with more severe baseline deficits may show greater relative improvement, though absolute levels often remain below normal [^115GE3xP] [^114NakFB] |
| Shunt type and settings | Programmable valves and individualized pressure settings may optimize outcomes, though evidence is mixed [^112U1PnZ] |

---

## Durability of cognitive improvement

Short-term improvement is common at 3–12 months, but **long-term durability is limited**. Many patients decline again by 3–5 years due to aging and comorbidities, and only about 40% maintain favorable cognitive outcomes at 5 years [^112qy9UM]. Sustained benefit is less likely than for gait, which shows more durable improvement [^111KMbSd].

---

## Comparison with gait and urinary outcomes

Cognitive improvement is **less consistent and less robust than gait improvement**, which occurs in ~80% of patients and is the most reliable outcome after shunting [^111vyaKm] [^1135ESTi]. Urinary symptoms improve in ~50–70% but are less predictable than gait [^11279X4P].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Patient selection**: Careful selection using clinical, imaging, and CSF drainage tests improves the likelihood of cognitive benefit [^113daniD] [^114TmcC2].

- **Expectation management**: Patients and families should be counseled that cognitive gains are modest, partial, and may not be sustained long term [^117JvR5t] [^116mvjFE].

- **Long-term follow-up**: Regular monitoring is essential to detect late decline and manage comorbidities that limit durability [^111KMbSd].

---

Cognitive improvement after shunt surgery for NPH is **modest and variable**, with the most reliable gains in memory and psychomotor speed and limited durability over time. Patient selection and comorbidity burden strongly influence outcomes, and expectations should be managed accordingly [^113gAdWk] [^111vyaKm].

### Symptoms and signs did not predict outcome after surgery: a prospective study of 143 patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^116AQ9jo]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The clinical picture of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) comprises disturbed gait and balance, cognitive impairment and urinary incontinence, treatable by CSF shunting. In modern studies, around 80% of treated patients experience improved symptoms. In spite of extensive research into a wide range of radiological, biochemical and hydrodynamic markers, to date no specific test can adequately diagnose iNPH or predict which patients will benefit from shunt surgery. Reliable tests for the prediction of outcomes are warranted.

Concerning symptoms and signs, several studies have suggested that either the presence of the complete triad or a clinical picture with a predominant gait disturbance, are prognostically favorable. Agerskov et al. showed that the sign of shuffling gait was predictive of improvement post-shunting. Earlier studies have been small or limited with regard to studied symptomatology. The POiNT (Prediction of Outcome in iNPH) study was designed to evaluate the predictive value of clinical, CSF and MRI markers on outcome after shunt surgery, and this paper aims to explore the predictive value of a broad panel of symptoms and signs typical for iNPH using an outcome measure specifically developed for iNPH patients.

### Cerebrospinal fluid transcripts may predict shunt surgery responses in normal pressure hydrocephalus [^111Mo6ud]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Molecular biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases are critical for advancing diagnosis and therapy. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a neurological disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, gait impairment, urinary incontinence and cognitive decline. In contrast to most other neurodegenerative disorders, NPH symptoms can be improved by the placement of a ventricular shunt that drains excess CSF. A major challenge in NPH management is the identification of patients who benefit from shunt surgery. Here, we perform genome-wide RNA sequencing of extracellular vesicles in CSF of 42 NPH patients, and we identify genes and pathways whose expression levels correlate with gait, urinary or cognitive symptom improvement after shunt surgery. We describe a machine learning algorithm trained on these gene expression profiles to predict shunt surgery response with high accuracy. The transcriptomic signatures we identified may have important implications for improving NPH diagnosis and treatment and for understanding disease aetiology.

### The effect of shunt surgery on neuropsychological performance in normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1132Kby4]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The aim of the current review was to determine the effect of shunt surgery on neuropsychological test performance in patients with NPH. Twenty-three studies were eligible for inclusion within one or more meta-analyses. Meta-analyses were conducted on average pre-operative and average "difference" scores for seven neuropsychological tests. Statistically significant estimated average difference scores were observed for all tests in the direction of improvement following shunt surgery. However, detailed examination of the results suggested robust evidence for improved MMSE, RAVLT total verbal recall, RAVLT delayed verbal recall, phonemic verbal fluency and TMT-A only. Meta-regressions revealed no significant effects of age, time-to-retest or sex on average MMSE difference score.

Memory

Post-shunt improvement in memory is frequently reported in patients with NPH. Significant improvement has been found for visual recall, spatial memory, and in various subtests of the Wechsler Memory Scale. However, the RAVLT appears to be highly sensitive to cognitive improvement in NPH. We found robust evidence for improvement in the total and delayed verbal recall subtests and significant improvement has also been documented in RAVLT retention score.

### Predicting cognitive improvement in normal pressure hydrocephalus patients using preoperative neuropsychological testing and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers [^113daniD]. Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Though it is well known that normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) patients can cognitively improve after ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS), one of the major dilemmas in NPH is the ability to prospectively predict which patients will improve.

Objective

To prospectively assess preoperative predictors of postshunt cognitive improvement.

Methods

This was a prospective observational cohort including 52 consecutive patients with approximately 1-yr follow-up. Patients underwent neuropsychological testing at baseline, postlumbar drainage, and postshunt. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and cortical biopsies were also collected to examine their relationship with postshunt cognitive improvement.

Results

Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test-L (RAVLT-L) was the only neuropsychological test to demonstrate statistically significant improvement both postlumbar drain and postshunt. Improvement on the RAVLT-L postlumbar drain predicted improvement on the RAVLT-L postshunt. Patients with biopsies demonstrating Aβ+ Tau+ had lower ventricular CSF Aβ42 and higher lumbar CSF pTau compared to Aβ- Tau- patients. A receiver operating curve analysis using lumbar pTau predicted Aβ+ Tau+ biopsy status but was not related to neuropsychological test outcome.

Conclusion

The RAVLT can be a useful preoperative predictor of postoperative cognitive improvement, and thus, we recommend using the RAVLT to evaluate NPH patients. CSF biomarkers could not be related to neuropsychological test outcome. Future research in a larger patient sample will help determine the prospective utility of CSF biomarkers in the evaluation of NPH patients.

### Improvement in social function and health-related quality of life after shunt surgery for idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus [^115rX6gH]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the impact of shunt surgery on the activity, participation, autonomy, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) as well as the effect on caregiver burden.

Methods

Thirty-seven patients (median age 70 years, range 50–89 years) with iNPH were evaluated before and 6 months after surgery. Symptoms and signs were assessed by the iNPH scale, activities of daily living (ADL) with the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS), autonomy and participation with Impact on Participation and Autonomy (IPA), and caregiver burden with the Caregiver Burden Scale (CBS). HRQOL was evaluated with the EQ-5D (EuroQol Group-5 Dimension health survey).

Results

Twenty-four patients (65%) improved clinically (iNPH scale score) and 31 (86%) improved their HRQOL after surgery, almost to the same level as found in the normal population. The patients became more independent in physical and cognitive activities, and participation and autonomy improved. The caregiver burden was decreased among caregivers to male patients but remained unchanged on the overall group level.

Conclusions

After shunt surgery, patients with iNPH showed improvement in most aspects of social life, they became more independent, and their quality of life returned to nearly normal.

### Normal pressure hydrocephalus combined with quadruple misfolded proteinopathy: an autopsy case report and a short review of literature [^112Y8QME]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Second, we believe that at least a subset of patients with comorbid NPH and proteinopathies may partially benefit from timely shunt surgery. The effectiveness and adverse events of shunt surgery in NPH patients has long been a subject of controversy. This is particularly true for NPH patients with complex comorbidities. A comparative study found that the long-term efficacy of CSF shunt surgery in NPH patients is nearly 75%, with approximately 93% of these patients showing initial improvement in gait. In another retrospective study, it was found that in patients with complex NPH comorbid with other neurodegenerative diseases, the cognitive improvement following shunt surgery was less significant compared to patients with classic NPH. It has been reported that the results of cortical brain biopsies and the presence of ADNC are strongly associated with the outcome of CSF shunting. Moreover, multiple studies have reported that gait improvement in NPH patients after shunt surgery is greater than the improvement in cognitive function. The patient's response to treatment in this case was also consistent with other reports about NPH combined with neurodegeneration, that is she partially benefited from lumbar puncture, but symptoms eventually worsened over time. Patients with the double diagnosis share common clinical features of both NPH and neurodegeneration, including the efficacy of shunt surgery. Shunt surgery may achieve its therapeutic effect by clearing solute neurotoxic proteins in the brain. Symptoms in these patients may ultimately worsen due to the inability to clear aggregated and deposited abnormal proteins. Therefore, the intrinsic link between NPH and proteinopathies may partly explain why shunt surgery is sometimes ineffective and why cognitive improvement is often limited. Based on the treatment response in this case, we advocate using the tap test to predict the effectiveness of shunt surgery, and timely surgical intervention may significantly improve the patient's quality of life.

### Placebo-controlled effectiveness of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus shunting: a randomized pilot trial [^117LFnJY]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations and Generalizability

Although this trial succeeded in demonstrating the feasibility and possible outcomes of a controlled iNPH trial, this pilot study demonstrated several weaknesses that helped us to design a larger clinical trial now initiated. A key vulnerability in the feasibility of a clinical trial is the potential for low enrollment with low patient diversity. Of the potential trial candidates who were screened before CSF testing, 85% failed criteria, most often being excluded because of poor cognitive function, high initial gait velocity, or concurrent treatment with anticoagulants. After review of these excluding factors, in future enrollment, cognitive decline will be accepted if it does not interfere with standard institutional consent criteria or interfere with ability to cooperate and communicate for the testing. Similarly, other comorbidities will be accepted if they are judged to not interfere with the testing process. Because patients with iNPH with comorbidities are accepted in general practice, their inclusion in the forthcoming larger clinical trial will help optimize enrollment, and patient selection will be more closely aligned with general practice.

A recognized barrier to enrollment in clinical trials is refusal by patients to consent to participate. Although the 57% rate of consent observed in this pilot study is encouraging, the main patient concern identified was the potential of a 4-month treatment delay. After review, the potential treatment delay has now been shortened to 3 months. The study group consensus is that this should not affect the study aims but may allow for increased willingness to participate in the upcoming clinical trial. Finally, changes to the study design for the future, larger multicenter clinical trial will allow recruitment from a larger iNPH patient population that will also include an outreach awareness program to reach caregivers and patients in diverse communities, to facilitate an increase in the diversity of participation.

The results of this small pilot study demonstrate the feasibility of a unique study design and have resulted in key methodological changes in measurement and recruitment that will optimize the success of the larger forthcoming clinical trial. This National Institute of Neurological Disorder supported trial titled "Placebo-controlled Effectiveness of iNPH Shunting Trial" (U01NS122764), with 20 centers in the United States, Canada, England, and Sweden, has been initiated. Importantly, evaluation of CSF content, MR imaging, extended neurocognitive, and other gait features are also included in this new clinical trial to investigate their role in diagnosis and shunt-treatment prognosis.

### Shunting for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^111vyaKm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) occurs when the brain ventricles expand, causing a triad of gait, cognitive, and urinary impairment. It can occur after a clear brain injury such as trauma, but can also occur without a clear cause (termed idiopathic, or iNPH). Non-randomised studies have shown a benefit from surgically diverting ventricular fluid to an area of lower pressure by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-shunting in iNPH, but historically there have been limited randomised controlled trial (RCT) data to confirm this.

Objectives

To determine the effect of CSF-shunting versus no CSF-shunting in people with iNPH and the frequency of adverse effects of CSF-shunting in iNPH.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 15 February 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included only RCTs of people who had symptoms of gait, cognitive, or urinary impairment with communicating hydrocephalus (Evans index of > 0.3) and normal CSF pressure. Control groups included those with no CSF shunts or those with CSF shunts that were in 'inactive' mode.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Where necessary, we contacted study authors requesting data not provided in the papers. We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included four RCTs, of which three were combined in a meta-analysis. The four RCTs included 140 participants (73 with immediate CSF-shunting and 67 controls who had delayed CSF-shunting) with an average age of 75 years. Risk of bias was low in all parallel-group outcomes evaluated apart from gait speed, cognitive function (general cognition and Symbol Digit Test) (some concerns) and adverse events, which were not blind-assessed. CSF-shunting probably improves gait speed at less than six months post-surgery (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.99; 3 studies, 116 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). CSF-shunting may improve qualitative gait function at less than six months post-surgery by an uncertain amount (1 study, 88 participants; low-certainty evidence). CSF-shunting probably results in a large reduction of disability at less than six months post-surgery (risk ratio 2.08, 95% CI 1.31 to 3.31; 3 studies, 118 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CSF-shunting on cognitive function at less than six months post-CSF-shunt surgery (SMD 0.35, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.74; 2 studies, 104 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is also very uncertain about the effect of CSF-shunt surgery on adverse events (1 study, 88 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no data regarding the effect of CSF-shunting on quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

We found moderate-certainty evidence that CSF-shunting likely improves gait speed and disability in iNPH in the relative short term. The evidence is very uncertain regarding cognition and adverse events. There were no longer-term RCT data for any of our prespecified outcomes. More studies are required to improve the certainty of these findings. In addition, more information is required regarding patient ethnicity and the effect of CSF-shunting on quality of life.

### Advancing treatment strategies for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review on studies comparing ventricular and lumbo-peritoneal shunts [^115CkWBK]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Treatment efficacy across studies

This review provides evidence for a similar efficacy of both LPS and VPS shunts in improving iNPH symptoms. All six included studies demonstrated the efficacy of both procedures in relieving gait, urinary, and cognitive disturbances.

Among the 3 out of 6 studies focusing on clinical outcome, Xie et al. noted a comparable cognitive recovery at MMSE and functional independence measure (FIM) scores in both groups; Nakajima et al. observed a mean mRS improvement from 2.46 to 1.93 within one year regardless of shunt type; and, similarly, Miyajima et al. reported mRS improvements in 63% of LPS and 69% of VPS patients.

Likewise, the prospective analysis by Kobayashi et al. compared a cohort of 51 newly diagnosed iNPH patients treated with LPS with 107 cases from a post-hoc analysis of the SIPHONI-2 trial treated with VPS revealed no apparent differences in mRS score, any iNPHGS sub-score or total score between the two groups. In addition, the analysis identified that greater preoperative symptom severity, particularly severe gait disturbance and poor functional status, was significantly associated with poorer postoperative outcomes, whereas disease duration was not. Notably, the tap test was effective in predicting postoperative gait improvement. A 2024 meta-analysis of 4,811 iNPH patients found symptom improvement in 70–75% of cases with either VP or LP shunts. The study confirmed that LPS is non-inferior to VPS in terms of gait, cognitive, and continence improvements, with no significant difference in long-term outcomes over the past 15–20 years. This reassures that choosing LPS does not compromise symptomatic results, a conclusion supported by multiple studies.

### Review of theories into the pathogenesis of normal pressure hydrocephalus [^117M4Uit]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Figure 1
Demonstration of radiographic features of NPH. (A) Axial CT head demonstrating Evans index of 0.44; (B) Coronal CT head demonstrating acute callosal angle of 40.4° with DESH; (C) Sagittal CT head demonstrating cingulate sulcus sign (white arrows). DESH, disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus; NPH, normal pressure hydrocephalus.

Confirmatory testing includes lumbar puncture (LP), with normal opening pressures (5–18 mm Hg), with an improvement in symptoms following large volume LPs (tap test) highly suggestive of the diagnosis.

The definitive treatment for NPH patients is CSF diversion via shunt placement, with subsequent symptomatic improvement noted in up to 84% of patients. This improvement in clinical symptoms from shunting, particularly gait and cognitive symptoms, allows for differentiation from other progressive conditions with similar presentations, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Binswanger's disease. These clinical improvements can be sustained for years following shunt placement, with gait demonstrating the most marked and sustained symptomatic improvement for 75%–87% of patients. Even for NPH patients requiring shunt revision for shunt malfunction or infection, 74%–93% of patients in the literature have demonstrated long-term improvements in symptomatology following revision surgery.

The underlying pathophysiology of NPH has been of great interest over the years, with various theories presented to account for the underpinnings of its peculiar clinical presentation. While various theories have been proposed since Adams et al's findings to account for the symptomatology and pathophysiology of NPH, a definitive theory of pathogenesis is still lacking. We believe that this stumbling block in understanding the pathophysiology of NPH stems from the larger issue that the existing paradigm of the Monro-Kellie pressure-volume model, from which our fundamental understanding of hydrocephalus is derived, insufficiently accounts for many of the clinical and experimental characteristics associated with different forms of hydrocephalus. There are a myriad of biological processes implicated in NPH, ranging from arteriosclerosis, and impaired blood flow, to impairments in the glymphatic pathway, to disturbances in the distribution of intracranial pulsatility. In this manuscript, we review the various underlying pathophysiological mechanisms underlying NPH and attempt to amalgamate these mechanisms to account for the clinical and radiographic manifestations of this condition.

### 5-year health-related quality of life outcome in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^111wzHm1]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations and generalisability

The study did not find any specific parameters that would predict an unfavorable HRQoL outcome. Neither can it be answered whether a specific patient should undergo CSF shunting. In addition to those parameters evaluated at 12-month follow-up, proxy-rated HRQoL measure, long-term follow-up of cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms and performance of activities of daily living would have strengthened the study. Self-assessment on the background of cognitive impairment should always be interpreted with reasonable caution. The samples from the general population were cross-sectional. A prospective 15D follow-up of the general population would have given a more detailed view of the impact of age on HRQoL, unfortunately to our knowledge, such a study has not been performed.

### Beyond early motor response: longitudinal cognitive and gait assessments after extended lumbar drainage in normal pressure hydrocephalus [^111zBJjm]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, ELD applied to patients with suspect iNPH is an effective diagnostic tool to evaluate motor and cognitive response, which allows to distinguish between RSP and nRSP. It is furthermore crucial to apply both motor and cognitive tests and to repeat at least twice the same assessment after CSF drainage: in this study, we showed that treatment response has a dynamic nature, highlighted by the differences found in the performances between the two post‐ELD evaluations, pointing to a key role to extended follow‐up in this population. Indeed, ELD can be considered a short‐term shunt, and most patients usually show improvements also up to 2 weeks after the procedure, whereas after TT the effects usually disappear rapidly. Future studies based on the same time points as our current study could help in better characterize the differences between these two approaches.

### Shunts in normal-pressure hydrocephalus: do we place too many or too few? [^114SKE9i]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Object

The average 65-year-old patient with moderate dementia can look forward to only 1.4 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), that is, longevity times quality of life. Some of these patients suffer from normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) and respond dramatically to shunt insertion. Currently, however, NPH cannot be diagnosed with certainty. The authors constructed a Markov decision analysis model to predict the outcome in patients with NPH treated with and without shunts.

Methods

Transition probabilities and health utilities were obtained from a review of the literature. A sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation were applied to test outcomes over a wide range of parameters. Using shunt response and complication rates from the literature, the average patient receiving a shunt would gain an additional 1.7 QALYs as a result of automatic shunt insertion. Even if 50% of patients receiving a shunt have complications, the shunt response rate would need to be less than 5% for empirical shunt insertion to do more harm than good. Authors of most studies have reported far better statistics.

Conclusions

In summary, many more patients with suspected NPH should be considered for shunt insertion.

### Flow-regulated versus differential pressure-regulated shunt valves for adult patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus [^117Nkud3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Since 1965 many ventriculo-peritoneal shunt systems have been inserted worldwide to treat hydrocephalus. The most frequent indication in adults is normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a condition that can be difficult to diagnose precisely. Surgical intervention with flow-regulated and differential pressure-regulated ventriculo-peritoneal shunts remains controversial. Knowledge about the benefits and harms of these interventions is limited.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to summarize the evidence on benefits and harms of flow-regulated versus differential pressure-regulated shunt valves for adult patients with NPH, based on reported findings of randomised clinical trials.

The ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register; MEDLINE (from 1950) (Ovid SP); EMBASE (from 1980) (Ovid SP); CINAHL (from 1980) (EBSCOhost); PsycINFO (from 1806) (Ovid SP); LILACS (from 1982) (BIREME); ClinicalTrials.gov; Umin Japan Trial Register; WHO portal; The Cochrane Library's Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL); ISI Web of Knowledge Conference Proceedings; Index to Theses; and Australasian Digital Theses were searched until May 16, 2012. The search terms used were NPH, "normal pressure hydrocephalus", iNPH, idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, sNPH, and "secondary normal pressure hydrocephalus".

Selection Criteria

We planned to include randomised clinical trials comparing flow-regulated versus differential pressure-regulated shunt valves.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors with expert knowledge within the field independently reviewed studies for eligibility, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data.

Main Results

No randomised clinical trials comparing flow-regulated versus differential pressure-regulated shunt valves were found.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence from randomised clinical trials indicates that flow-regulated and differential pressure-regulated shunt valves differ with regard to clinical outcome, shunt failure, or intervention risks. Randomised clinical trials are needed that take into account the large number of VP shunts implanted each year in patients with NPH.

### Preoperative phosphorylated tau concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid can predict cognitive function three years after shunt surgery in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^117CxNuJ]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

RESULTS

After adjusting for age, significant differences were found between the high (11 patients) and low (24 patients) p-Tau groups in total Tau and p-Tau CSF levels (i.e. before surgical intervention; Table 1); however, cognitive function, mRS score, FAB, iNPHGS, and comorbidities, were not significantly different between the two groups.

Cognitive function

Following shunting, the MMSE score was improved after three years (p = 0.005) in the low p-Tau group (Fig. 2, Table 2). The FAB score was also improved at one-month follow-up (p = 0.027), and remained significantly improved for one year (p = 0.004). While the improvement in FAB score decreased slightly at three years post-treatment (p = 0.224), both cognitive functions were improved compared with prior to treatment. In the high p-Tau group, the MMSE and FAB scores had not improved. Further, they tended to decline to below the preoperative values after three years, although this decrease was not statistically significant. A statistically significant difference between groups was found three years after the shunt treatment for both MMSE (p = 0.040) and FAB (p = 0.02) scores.

Fig.2
Comparison of MMSE performance in the low and high p-Tau groups. MMSE performance progress in individual patients from before shunting to three years after shunting is shown for the low (< 30 pg/mL, n = 24) and high (≥ 30 pg/mL, n = 11) p-Tau groups. The black line shows the average value in each group. A temporary improvement was observed in the high p-Tau group, while the improvement in the low p-Tau group was maintained throughout follow-up.

### The effect of shunt surgery on neuropsychological performance in normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114sUF4g]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is characterized by a build-up of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain despite apparently normal CSF pressure at lumbar puncture. Idiopathic NPH (iNPH) typically occurs in later life and without any obvious cause. Symptoms include gait disturbance, urinary incontinence and progressive dementia. Dementia-related symptoms are characterised by deficits in memory, visuospatial abilities, psychomotor speed and executive function.

The effect of shunt treatment on cognitive performance in patients with NPH is controversial. While CSF drainage is generally considered to relieve problems with gait and incontinence, cognitive impairment is reported to be the least likely symptom to improve. Rates of cognitive improvement range from 0 to 80% of patients in a given series. However, methodological limitations have been identified which could explain the variability observed between studies. These include unclear patient selection criteria, inconsistent follow up intervals and use of subjective measures of improvement. Additionally, due to the lack of standardized clinical guidelines for assessing cognitive function in this patient group, assessment methods often vary between centres with functional grading scales, clinical rating scales, and neuropsychological testing being employed. Studies that have focused on neuropsychological test performance generally show a beneficial effect of shunt surgery on cognitive function. However, again, the pattern of post-operative neuropsychological improvement varies widely between studies [e.g.,].

Understanding the neuropsychology of NPH may be useful for differential diagnosis as well as interpretation of outcome following treatment. We combined data from the most frequently used neuropsychological tests in an attempt to determine the effect of shunt surgery on neuropsychological performance in patients with NPH. We included studies using neuropsychological tests to assess cognition before and after shunt surgery. We conducted meta-analyses on pre- and post-operative scores for each test. Additionally, we conducted exploratory analyses to investigate effects of moderator variables on cognitive outcome.

### Preoperative phosphorylated tau concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid can predict cognitive function three years after shunt surgery in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^113bwbnk]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Increased p-Tau concentrations in the CSF reflect AD pathology. CSF shunting in iNPH patients with coexisting AD is believed to have smaller and shorter-lasting therapeutic effects than in patients without comorbidity. Thus, the efficacy of shunt intervention in patients with iNPH is debated. We aimed to examine whether the cognitive improvements due to shunt treatment were sustained for three years in patients diagnosed with iNPH based on symptom examination and imaging findings, particularly in iNPH patients with AD.

### Early shunt surgery improves survival in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^114WNdfB]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The study sample of in total 102 iNPH patients scheduled for shunt surgery in 2004–2012 and their 3‐month postoperative outcome has been described in detail previously [7]. An overview is presented in Figure 1.

FIGURE 1
Overview of the study sample and treatment groups

Diagnosis of iNPH

All patients were evaluated at the same clinic by the same routine clinical work‐up including brain imaging with magnetic resonance imaging and/or computed tomography and examination by a physician, a neuropsychologist and a physiotherapist. Severity of symptoms was assessed using a validated iNPH scale where tests for gait, balance, cognitive abilities and urinary symptoms yield a composite score of 0–100 [8]. Additionally, the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) were recorded. Ancillary tests, such as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tap test or infusion tests, were performed when considered clinically indicated. The diagnosis of iNPH was made in accordance with the international guidelines [9]. The decision to refer for shunt surgery was made in routine multidisciplinary conferences; the date of this decision is the baseline date in this study.

Baseline characteristics for both groups, and data from the second preoperative investigations performed only in the iNPH Delayed group, are shown in Table 1. Patients in iNPH Delayed were older, and hypertension was more common in this group. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding any other baseline characteristics.

TABLE 1
Baseline data, median follow‐up times and complication rates

Clinical course

All but one patient underwent shunt surgery; one patient in iNPH Delayed died before surgery was performed, after 14 months' wait. The number and types of postoperative complications were recorded. Complications were classified as minor or major. Minor complications were defined as complications that did not cause significant disability and did not require additional surgeries: postural headaches, smaller subdural effusions or hygromas which resolved after adjustment of the shunt valve. Major complications were defined as complications that required additional surgery or caused significant disability: larger subdural haematomas, obstruction or infection of the shunt catheter, stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage or postoperative epilepsy.

### Good outcome in patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus and factors indicating poor prognosis [^113K6kuZ]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Object

The authors set out to describe the outcome in a subgroup of patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) in whom prognostic factors were poor. This subgroup of patients who had received shunts was selected according to strict criteria.

Methods

From a cohort of 56 patients with NPH in whom shunts were placed, the authors selected a subgroup with four of the factors traditionally considered to indicate poor prognosis: idiopathic type, cortical atrophy, longstanding symptoms, and presence of dementia in addition to old age. Twelve patients met the inclusion criteria. After receiving shunts, 92% of the patients showed clinical improvement on the NPH scale; gait improved in 100% of patients, sphincter control in 90%, and dementia in 33%. Improvement was significant for gait and sphincter control, general NPH score, and most daily life activity scales. No significant differences regarding clinical, cognitive, or functional changes following surgery were found in comparison with the rest of patients (the good prognosis subgroup).

Conclusions

The clinical condition of patients with NPH who present with traditionally accepted markers of poor prognosis can improve after surgery, especially as regards gait and sphincter control. The authors assert that the presence of these markers should not be considered to be an absolute criterion for ruling out shunt surgery in cases of NPH syndrome.

### Postshunt cognitive and functional improvement in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^111tMjRv]. Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Improvement in gait after shunt placement has been well documented in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH); however, controversy remains regarding the extent and pattern of postsurgical cognitive changes. Conflicting findings may be explained by variability in both test selection and follow-up intervals across studies. Furthermore, most investigations lack a control group, making it difficult to disentangle practice effects from a true treatment effect.

Objective

To examine postshunt changes in a sample of well-characterized iNPH participants compared with a group of age- and education-matched healthy control subjects.

Methods

We identified 12 participants with iNPH undergoing shunt placement and 9 control participants. All participants were evaluated with comprehensive neuropsychological testing and standardized gait assessment at baseline and were followed up for 6 months.

Results

Repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed a significant group- (iNPH and control) by-time (baseline and 6 months) interaction for Trailmaking Test B: (P < .003) and Symbol Digit Modalities (P < .02), with greater improvement in iNPH participants relative to control subjects. In addition, the iNPH group showed greater improvement in gait (P < .001) and caregivers reported improved activities of daily living (P < .01) and reduced caregiver distress (P < .01).

Conclusion

This study demonstrates improvements in mental tracking speed and sustained attention 6 months after shunt placement in iNPH. The present investigation is the first study to use a controlled design to show that cognitive improvement in iNPH is independent of practice effects. Furthermore, these findings indicate functional and quality-of-life improvements for both the shunt responder and their caregiver.

### Functional and magnetic resonance imaging correlates of corpus callosum in normal pressure hydrocephalus before and after shunting [^1146UJsG]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is associated with corpus callosum abnormalities.

Objectives

To study the clinical and neuropsychological effect of callosal thinning in 18 patients with idiopathic NPH and to investigate the postsurgical callosal changes in 14 patients.

Methods

Global corpus callosum size and seven callosal subdivisions were measured. Neuropsychological assessment included an extensive battery assessing memory, psychomotor speed, visuospatial and frontal lobe functioning.

Results

After surgery, patients showed improvements in memory, visuospatial and frontal lobe functions, and psychomotor speed. Two frontal corpus callosum areas, the genu and the rostral body, were the regions most related to the clinical and neuropsychological dysfunction. After surgery, total corpus callosum and four of the seven subdivisions presented a significant increase in size, which was related to poorer neuropsychological and clinical outcome.

Conclusion

The postsurgical corpus callosum increase might be the result of decompression, re-expansion and increase of interstitial fluid, although it may also be caused by differences in shape due to cerebral reorganisation.

### Preoperative phosphorylated tau concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid can predict cognitive function three years after shunt surgery in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^115vmUoR]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence. Independence in everyday life and improvements in cognitive functions in patients with iNPH can be achieved through shunt treatment. In Japan, an iNPH guideline was published ahead of the Western world in 2004, and revised in 2011. This guideline noted that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt intervention in patients with possible iNPH on MRI resulted in an improvement in the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score in > 80% of the patients within a year. Additional improvements were also observed in the following symptoms: gait disturbance with a wide short-stepped gait; cognitive impairment resulting in decreased psychomotor speed; urinary urgency; overactive bladder manifesting mainly as urinary incontinence; ventricular enlargement; narrowing of the high convexity in the subarachnoid space; and disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid-space hydrocephalus (DESH) with CSF retention in the subarachnoid space under the sylvian fissure. These positive results support the use of the diagnosis techniques recommended in the iNPH guideline. CSF shunting is currently approved as the only treatment method for iNPH with evidence of efficacy; however, the long-term effects of shunt intervention are still in question. Additionally, the treatment outcome can be affected by the presence of various complications in the elderly.

Idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a reversible syndrome of gait impairment, dementia, and incontinence that affects persons over 65 years of age.(1) Currently, the only effective treatment is surgical implantation of a shunt(2); however, the need for pharmacologic adjunctive treatments was noted at the 2005 NIH workshop on hydrocephalus.(3.)

### Neurocognitive effects of CSF biomarkers in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients undergoing VP shunt placement [^116SyeAD]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus is an increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative condition among the elderly, characterized by the Hakim triad. Accurate diagnosis and prognosis are essential since the symptoms can be reversible with appropriate treatment, such as VP-shunt surgery. This study investigates the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, particularly Tau, Phospho-tau, the beta-amyloid ratio (Aβ42/Aβ40), and neurocognitive outcomes post-surgery. Eighty patients diagnosed with iNPH who underwent shunt placement between November 2021 and July 2023 were included. A comprehensive neuropsychological test battery was administered before, one hour after, and one day after lumbar puncture, and six weeks and three months post-surgery. CSF samples were analyzed for tau, phospho-tau and the beta-amyloid ratio. Neuropsychological tests assessed various cognitive functions, including executive functions, psychomotor speed, language, and memory. Patients with a higher beta-amyloid ratio showed significant cognitive improvement post-surgery. Neuropsychological tests, such as the DemTect and Trail Making Test A & B indicated enhanced performance over time, particularly at the three-month follow-up. Conversely, the MMSE did not show significant improvement. The data suggest that the beta-amyloid ratio is a potential prognostic marker for positive neurocognitive outcomes following VP-shunt surgery. The beta-amyloid ratio (Aß42/Aß40) may represent a valuable prognostic biomarker for predicting cognitive improvement after VP-shunt surgery. Patients with higher ratios exhibited better neurocognitive outcomes, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive neuropsychological assessments. These findings support the potential of personalized treatment strategies based on biomarker analysis to optimize patient selection and improve outcomes for iNPH patients undergoing VP-shunt surgery.

### The effect of shunt surgery on neuropsychological performance in normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115babf9]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We found evidence for improved performance in global cognitive function, verbal learning and memory and psychomotor speed following shunt surgery. However, we did not find strong evidence for improvement in tests of executive function based on the available data. To clarify these findings, we suggest that there is a need to assess high-level executive functions in patients with NPH before and after shunt surgery. Additionally, longer-term monitoring of patients is required to determine the extent to which cognitive functions may improve. The MMSE, the RAVLT, phonemic verbal fluency and trail making test A may be useful for assessment of cognitive outcome following treatment for NPH.

### Systematic volumetric analysis predicts response to CSF drainage and outcome to shunt surgery in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^112iUCUu]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study investigated the role of systematic volumetric analysis for the diagnosis of INPH shunt candidates as assessed by their response to CSF drainage and prediction of neurological outcomes after shunt placement. We achieved a high diagnostic accuracy of 0.94 in discriminating CSF drainage responders from non-responders in a cohort of probable INPH patients. The volumetric analysis also showed promising performance in predicting the gait and cognitive outcomes after shunt placement, with high correlations with the ground truth (r = 0.80–0.93).

Compared to the existing volumetric studies in INPH, our automated segmentation pipeline parcellates the brain into 283 structures, and the fine elements can be grouped into different granularity levels according to their ontological relationship, tailored to different studies. Our results demonstrated that the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy increased as the granularity level increased, illustrating the importance of fine segmentation. Another unique advantage is that our atlas definition was not only limited to GM and WM but also the ventricle and sulcal regions, e.g. 12 ventricular ROIs and 18 sulcal ROIs (Supplementary Table S1). This can be particularly useful for INPH studies, as the pattern of CSF distribution is an important marker of INPH. Note that image acquisition protocols slightly differed among patients, but it was unlikely to affect the results, as the segmentation pipeline has shown to be robust against protocols and highly reproducible in our previous studies.

### Practice guideline: idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: response to shunting and predictors of response: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^1135ESTi]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus — clinical response to shunting: Using the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change, plus carer interview (CIBIC-Plus), shunted patients had better global ratings than controls, with median CIBIC-Plus rating 2 vs 6 and significant differences in global outcomes and gait; specifically, 14 of 18 shunted patients improved while 9 of 14 controls worsened, and 89% of shunted patients improved on gait. In a randomized study using the modified Rankin Scale, improvement ≥ 1 point at 3 months occurred in 32 of 49 immediate-shunt vs 2 of 44 delayed patients, yielding a difference 61% [95% CI 42%–68%], p < 0.0001. Overall, shunting is described as possibly effective with a 96% chance of subjective improvement and an 83% chance of improvement on the timed walk test at 6 months, with serious adverse events 11% and subjective improvement reported by 95% vs 19% of controls; among objective measures, only gait improved significantly.

### Poor cognitive outcome in shunt-responsive idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^116mvjFE]. Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) causes cognitive decline that can be alleviated by shunting, but long-term outcome studies are scarce.

Objective

To elucidate the long-term cognitive condition of shunt-responsive iNPH patients.

Methods

The follow-up data (Kuopio University Hospital NPH Registry) of 146 patients diagnosed with iNPH by clinical and radiological examination, 24-hour intraventricular pressure monitoring, frontal cortical biopsy, and response to the shunt were analyzed for signs of dementia. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and specified memory disorder criteria were used. Median follow-up was 4.8 years.

Results

At the end of follow-up, 117 (80%) of the 146 iNPH patients had cognitive decline and 67 (46%) had clinical dementia. The most common clinical diagnoses were Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia. In multivariate analysis of the 146 iNPH patients, memory deficit as a first symptom before shunt (odds ratio [OR] 18.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9–175), male sex (OR 3.29; 95% CI 1.11–9.73), age (OR 1.17 year; 95% CI 1.07–1.28), and follow-up time (OR 1.20 year; 95% CI 1.02–1.40) predicted dementia. Interestingly, 8 (5%) iNPH patients had dementia without any signs of other neurodegenerative diseases in clinical, neuroradiological, or brain biopsy evaluation. These patients initially presented a full triad of symptoms, with gait disturbance being the most frequent initial symptom followed by deterioration in cognition.

Conclusion

The novel findings were (a) a significant risk of dementia in iNPH initially responsive to cerebrospinal fluid shunt, (b) cognitive impairment most commonly due to iNPH-related dementia followed by concurrent degenerative brain disease, and (c) a subgroup with dementia related to iNPH without comorbidities.

### Neuropsychological effects of shunt treatment in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^115GE3xP]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To prospectively evaluate the effects of shunting on the neuropsychological performance of patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH), to compare their performance with that of healthy individuals, and to estimate the predictive utility of putatively important factors.

Methods

A consecutive series of 47 patients with INPH underwent neurological, radiological, and neuropsychological examinations before and 3 months after shunt surgery. The same neuropsychological tests, measuring simple and target reaction times, dexterity, memory and learning, working memory, and aspects of executive functioning, were also administered to 159 healthy individuals.

Results

Performance on all neuropsychological tests, except Simple Reaction Time and Digit Span, significantly improved after surgery, with more severe functional deficits showing greatest improvement. Age, education, duration, vascular comorbidity, sex, and onset symptom all failed to predict the neuropsychological effects of treatment. Despite improvement 3 months after shunt surgery, INPH patients were still outperformed by healthy individuals.

Conclusion

Most of the wide range of neuropsychological functions that are affected by INPH are markedly improved by shunt treatment, but not completely restored.

### Safety and effectiveness of the assessment and treatment of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus in the adult hydrocephalus clinical research network [^111i1bmJ]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to describe the processes and outcomes associated with patients at five sites in the Adult Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network (AHCRN) who had undergone evaluation and treatment for suspected idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) and had 1-year postoperative follow-up.

Methods

Subjects with possible iNPH who had been prospectively enrolled in the AHCRN registry between November 19, 2014, and December 31, 2018, were evaluated by CSF drainage via either lumbar puncture or external lumbar drainage, consistent with recommendations of the international iNPH guidelines. Standardized clinical evaluations of gait, cognition, urinary symptoms, depression, and functional outcomes were conducted at baseline, before and after CSF drainage, and at 4-month intervals after shunt surgery. Complications of CSF drainage and shunt surgery were recorded.

Results

Seventy-four percent (424/570) of patients with possible iNPH had CSF drainage, and 46% of them (193/424) underwent shunt surgery. The mean change in gait velocity with CSF drainage was 0.18 m/sec in patients who underwent shunt surgery versus 0.08 m/sec in patients who did not. For shunt surgery patients, gait velocity increased by 54% from 0.67 m/sec before CSF drainage to 0.96 m/sec 8–12 months after surgery, and 80% of patients had an increase of at least 0.1 m/sec by the first postoperative visit. Evaluation of cognition, urinary symptoms, depression, and functional outcomes also revealed improvement after shunt surgery. Of 193 patients who had undergone shunt surgery, 176 (91%) had no complications and 17 (9%) had 28 complications. Eleven patients (6%) had 14 serious complications that resulted in the need for surgery or an extended hospital stay. The 30-day reoperation rate was 3%.

Conclusions

Using criteria recommended by the international iNPH guidelines, the authors found that evaluation and treatment of iNPH are safe and effective. Testing with CSF drainage and treatment with shunt surgery are associated with a high rate of sustained improvement and a low rate of complications for iNPH in the 1st year after shunt surgery. Patients who had undergone shunt surgery for iNPH experienced improvement in gait, cognitive function, bladder symptoms, depression, and functional outcome measures. Gait velocity, which is an easily measured, objective, continuous variable, should be used as a standard outcome measure to test a patient's response to CSF drainage and shunt surgery in iNPH.

### The computerized general neuropsychological INPH test revealed improvement in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus after shunt surgery [^114Ku8zV]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The Computerized General Neuropsychological INPH Test (CoGNIT) provides the clinician and the researcher with standardized and accessible cognitive assessments in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH). CoGNIT includes tests of memory, executive functions, attention, manual dexterity, and psychomotor speed. Investigations of the validity and reliability of CoGNIT have been published previously. The aim of this study was to evaluate CoGNIT's sensitivity to cognitive change after shunt surgery in patients with INPH.

Methods

Forty-one patients with INPH (median Mini-Mental State Examination score 26) were given CoGNIT preoperatively and at a postoperative follow-up 4 months after shunt surgery. Scores were compared to those of 44 healthy elderly control volunteers. CoGNIT was administered by either a nurse or an occupational therapist.

Results

Improvement after shunt surgery was seen in all cognitive domains: memory (10-word list test, p < 0.01); executive functions (Stroop incongruent color and word test, p < 0.01); attention (2-choice reaction test, p < 0.01); psychomotor speed (Stroop congruent color and word test, p < 0.01); and manual dexterity (4-finger tapping, p < 0.01). No improvement was seen in the Mini-Mental State Examination score. Preoperative INPH test scores were significantly impaired compared to healthy control subjects (p < 0.001 for all tests).

Conclusions

In this study the feasibility for CoGNIT to detect a preoperative impairment and postoperative improvement in INPH was demonstrated. CoGNIT has the potential to become a valuable tool in clinical and research work. Clinical trial registration no.: NCT01618500 (clinicaltrials.gov).

### Angiotensin I converting enzyme polymorphism effects in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus syndrome before and after surgery [^114znHXB]. Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Previous reports have suggested an association between the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), cardiovascular disease, and cognitive performance. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is considered to be an example of reversible dementia although the clinical improvement after shunting varies from subject to subject. An association has been suggested between vascular risk factors and the development of NPH. The ACE plays a major role in vascular pathology and physiology. In the present study we investigated the distribution of an ACE gene insertion/deletion polymorphism in 112 patients diagnosed with NPH and in 124 controls. We also evaluated the role of this genetic polymorphism in cognitive functioning before and following surgery in a subgroup of 72 patients. No differences in genetic or allele distributions were found between patients and healthy subjects, but among patients, carriers of D/D or D/I genotypes obtained less cognitive benefit following shunt surgery, especially on measures of memory and frontal function. Our data support previous findings in other conditions indicating that possession of at least one D allele is associated with poorer cognitive performance.

### Normal pressure hydrocephalus: long-term outcome after shunt surgery [^111KMbSd]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Background/Objective

Little is known about the long-term clinical course and management of patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) treated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed records of 55 patients diagnosed with idiopathic NPH (INPH) and treated with CSF shunts, all of whom were followed for more than 3 years after the original shunt surgery. At each annual follow-up visit, the patient was assessed by Folstein Mini Mental State Examination, detailed clinical evaluation of gait and assessment of headache, cognition, gait or urination, as assessed by the patient and relatives.

Results

The mean duration of follow-up was 5.9 ± 2.5 years. There was an overall sustained improvement among all symptoms. Gait showed the highest maintenance of improvement over baseline (83% at 3 years and 87% at the last analysed follow-up of 7 years), cognition showed intermediary improvement (84% and 86%, respectively), and urinary incontinence showed the least improvement (84% and 80%, respectively). Fifty-three percent of patients required shunt revisions. Indications for revision included shunt malfunction (87%), infection (10%) and change of shunt configuration (3%). Overall, 74% revisions resulted in clinical improvement.

Conclusions

Clinical improvement of patients with NPH can be sustained for 5–7 years in some patients with NPH, even if shunt revision surgery is needed multiple times. With earlier diagnosis and treatment of NPH and the increasing lifespan of the ageing population, the need for long-term follow-up after shunt surgery for NPH may be greater than it was in the past. Monitoring, identification and treatment of shunt obstruction is a key management principle.

### Frequency of Alzheimer's disease pathology at autopsy in patients with clinical normal pressure hydrocephalus [^111MuHjp]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is considered to be potentially treatable with the placement of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt. However, the procedure has been reported to have variable success, particularly with respect to improving the cognitive impairment in NPH. The presence of neurologic comorbidities, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), may contribute to shunt responsiveness. Uncovering the extent to which AD and NPH co-occur has implications for diagnosis and treatment of NPH. Autopsy studies of patients with NPH during their lifetime would elucidate the frequency of such comorbidities.

Methods

A search of the Sun Health Research Institute Brain Donation Program database was conducted between January 1, 1997 and April 1, 2009 to identify all cases with neuropathologic evidence of dementia as well as those of clinically diagnosed NPH. We reviewed the medical records and brain findings of each NPH case.

Results

Of the 761 cases autopsied over the study interval, 563 were found to have neuropathologic evidence meeting criteria for a dementing illness. Of 563 cases, AD was found exclusively in 313 (56%), and 94 suffered from secondary diagnosis of dementia. Nine of 761 cases were identified with a clinical diagnosis of NPH, which were among the 563 cases with neuropathology of dementing illness at autopsy, representing 1.6% (9/563) of the cases. On review of brain autopsy reports of these nine patients, eight (89%) were found to have AD and one (11%) had progressive supranuclear palsy. Review of the medical records of the nine NPH cases revealed the following clinical comorbidities: five suffered from AD, one from Parkinson's Disease, one from mild cognitive impairment, and one from seizure disorder.

Conclusions

Given the findings of the present study, we support the AD-NPH theory and posit that AD is a common pathologic comorbidity in the setting of NPH and may preclude cognitive improvement postshunt placement. This may influence the selection of cases for shunting in the future.

### The effect of shunt surgery on neuropsychological performance in normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113gAdWk]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

We conducted a systematic review of the literature and used meta-analytic techniques to evaluate the impact of shunt surgery on neuropsychological performance in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Twenty-three studies with 1059 patients were identified for review using PubMed, Web of Science, Google scholar and manual searching. Inclusion criteria were prospective, within-subject investigations of cognitive outcome using neuropsychological assessment before and after shunt surgery in patients with NPH. There were statistically significant effects of shunt surgery on cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination; MMSE), learning and memory (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test; RAVLT, total and delayed subtests), executive function (backwards digit span, phonemic verbal fluency, trail making test B) and psychomotor speed (trail making test A) all in the direction of improvement following shunt surgery, but with considerable heterogeneity across all measures. A more detailed examination of the data suggested robust evidence for improved MMSE, RAVLT total, RAVLT delayed, phonemic verbal fluency and trail making test A only. Meta-regressions revealed no statistically significant effect of age, sex or follow-up interval on improvement in the MMSE. Our results suggest that shunt surgery is most sensitive for improving global cognition, learning and memory and psychomotor speed in patients with NPH.

### Survival in treated idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^1117QCbr]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this registry study of 979 iNPH patients who underwent surgery in Sweden, mortality is increased 1.8 times compared to the general population. Preoperative symptom severity is linked to mortality, especially for gait and cognition (MMSE). Postoperative improvement in gait or in functional independence (mRS) is associated with longer survival. The survival of iNPH patients who improve in both the gait scale and in the modified Rankin Scale is similar to that of controls from the general population, indicating that shunt surgery for iNPH besides improving the symptoms and signs can normalize survival.

### Symptoms and signs did not predict outcome after surgery: a prospective study of 143 patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^116YpHcj]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study confirms that the recorded clinical signs, symptoms, and impairments in the adopted clinical tests are characteristic findings in iNPH, based on that most of them improved after shunt surgery. However, our clinical data did not enable predictions of whether or not patients would respond to shunt surgery, indicating that the phenotype is unrelated to the reversibility of the iNPH state and should mainly support the diagnosis. Absence of specific signs should not be used to exclude patients from treatment.

### Clinical improvement after shunt surgery in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus can Be quantified by diffusion tensor imaging [^1172gRrq]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

White matter changes assessed by DTI typically reflect tract functionality. This study aimed to investigate DTI parameter alterations in important regions pre- and postshunt implantation in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), alongside assessing the relationship between DTI parameters and clinical improvement.

Materials and Methods

Patients with probable iNPH underwent prospective preoperative MRI and comprehensive clinical work-up between 2017–2022. Patients with clinical symptoms of iNPH, positive result on a lumbar infusion test, and/or gait improvement after 120-hour lumbar drainage were diagnosed with iNPH and underwent shunt-placement surgery. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity values for individual regions of interest were extracted from preoperative and postoperative MRI. These values were correlated with the clinical picture of individual patients.

Results

A total of 32 patients (73.59 ± 4.59years) with definite iNPH were analyzed. Preoperative DTI characteristics of internal capsule and corona radiata correlated with the 1-year improvement in the Dutch Gait Scale postoperatively (all P < .036). Cognitive domain improvement after surgery in memory and psychomotor speed correlated with preoperative DTI values of cingulate gyrus (P = .050), uncinate fasciculus (P = .029), superior longitudinal fasciculus (P = .020), or corpus callosum (P < .045).

Conclusions

DTI characteristics of white matter regions reflect clinical improvement after shunt surgery in patients with iNPH. They tend to improve toward physiologic DTI values, thus further accentuating the benefit of shunt surgery in both clinical and radiologic pictures.

### CSF tap test in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: still a necessary prognostic test? [^115NRgYQ]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) — the leading cause of reversible dementia in aging — is characterized by gait, cognitive and urinary impairments with ventriculomegaly at brain imaging. Difficulty of diagnosing iNPH with routine neurological and neuroradiological assessments explains why only 8% of patients receive disease-specific treatment. INPH symptoms are unspecific and frequently found in other neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or vascular dementia, which frequently occur as comorbidities. Moreover, the treatment for iNPH relies on invasive shunt placement, thus requiring careful cost/benefit evaluation, especially in older populations. These considerations highlight the importance of improving the diagnostic procedure to identify appropriate candidates for invasive shunt surgery from those with neurological disorders mimicking iNPH, or from iNPH patients with comorbidities that can interfere with reversibility. In this regard, a better understanding of the factors that underlie or hamper symptom reversibility is of primary importance.

Among the predictors of shunt surgery outcome, the cerebrospinal fluid tap test (CSFTT) has high positive predictive value and is routinely used as prognostic test. Nonetheless, the CSFTT is an invasive procedure with contraindications and patient discomfort. Moreover, the factors underlying symptom reversibility after CSFTT are not clear yet. Few studies have investigated clinical and neuroradiological correlates of CSFTT response, including cognitive scores, apathy, gait phenotype and brain morphology, with non-conclusive results and without taking into account more advanced neuroimaging markers, such as white matter (WM) microstructure or brain functional connectivity. Although the pathophysiology of iNPH is not clear yet, different mechanisms have been proposed including periventricular axonal neurodegeneration and small vessel damage. Moreover, alterations of large-scale brain functional organization have been observed, with particular involvement of the default mode network (DMN), and partial functional normalization after CSFTT suggesting a role in determining outcome. Integrating advanced neuroimaging methods probing iNPH pathophysiological mechanisms may identify reversible mechanisms that will eventually improve the diagnostic procedure and contribute to the prediction of CSFTT outcome, shading new light on the factors underlying short-term symptom reversibility.

### Sex disparities in normal pressure hydrocephalus diagnosis and urinary outcomes [^1121zL2n]. Urogynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is characterized by dementia, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence (UI). While gait and cognitive impairments trigger a focused workup, UI is often excused by female patients and doctors as normal aging in women.

Objectives

The objectives of this study were﻿ to evaluate sex differences in time from UI documentation to iNPH diagnosis and describe differences in postoperative UI outcomes following ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement.

Study Design

This was﻿ a single-center, retrospective study of patients treated for iNPH who presented with the complete triad of symptoms. The primary outcome was the time from UI documentation to iNPH diagnosis compared between sexes with a 2-tailed Student t test. Sex differences in diagnostic timing and 3-month postoperative outcomes (gait, cognition, and UI) were analyzed with χ2 tests.

Results

Eighty-two patients (38 male and 44 female) were included in the analysis. Females experienced a longer time to diagnosis than males (40.3 vs 16.8 mo; P = 0.001). Following surgery, no significant sex differences were observed in gait (P = 0.32), cognitive (P = 0.17), or UI improvement (P = 0.11), but females had lower rates of complete UI resolution (13.6% vs 36.8%; P = 0.020). In females, but not males, 3-month UI improvement (12.5 vs 46.8 mo; P = 0.02) and resolution (1.7 vs 35.4 mo; P = 0.002) correlated with shorter time to diagnosis.

Conclusions

Females with UI face a longer time to iNPH diagnosis and lower rates of complete symptom resolution. Increased awareness of iNPH in this population is essential for timely screening and improved outcomes.

### Diagnosis and management of idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus: a prospective study in 151 patients [^1172V8ni]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Object

The diagnosis and management of idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) remains controversial, particularly in selecting patients for shunt insertion. The use of clinical criteria coupled with imaging studies has limited effectiveness in predicting shunt success. The goal of this prospective study was to assess the usefulness of clinical criteria together with brain imaging studies, resistance testing, and external lumbar drainage (ELD) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in determining which patients would most likely benefit from shunt surgery.

Methods

One hundred fifty-one patients considered at risk for idiopathic NPH were prospectively studied according to a fixed management protocol. The clinical criterion for idiopathic NPH included ventriculomegaly demonstrated on computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging studies combined with gait disturbance, incontinence, and dementia. Subsequently, all patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic NPH underwent a lumbar tap for the measurement of CSF resistance. Following this procedure, patients were admitted to the hospital neurosurgical service for a 3-day ELD of CSF. Video assessment of gait and neuropsychological testing was conducted before and after drainage. A shunt procedure was then offered to patients who had experienced clinical improvement from ELD. Shunt outcome was assessed at 1 year postsurgery.

Conclusions

Data in this report affirm that gait improvement immediately following ELD is the best prognostic indicator of a positive shunt outcome, with an accuracy of prediction greater than 90%. Furthermore, bolus resistance testing is useful as a prognostic tool, does not require hospitalization, can be performed in an outpatient setting, and has an overall accuracy of 72% in predicting successful ELD outcome. Equally important is the finding that improvement with shunt surgery is independent of age up to the ninth decade of life in patients who improved on ELD.

### 5-year health-related quality of life outcome in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^112vTc27]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is severely impaired in persons with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). The HRQoL improves in a number of patients after the placement of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt, but long-term follow-up of HRQoL is rare.

Methods

Extended follow-up (60 months) of a prospective cohort study involving 189 patients with iNPH who underwent shunt surgery. Preoperative variables were used to predict favorable HRQoL outcome (improvement or non-deterioration) measured by the 15D instrument 5 years after shunting.

Results

Out of the 189 initially enrolled study participants, 88 had completed 5-year HRQoL follow-up (46%), 64 had died (34%), and 37 (20%) failed to complete the HRQoL follow-up but were alive at the end of the study. After initial post-operative HRQoL improvement, HRQoL deteriorated so that 37/88 participants (42%) had a favorable HRQoL outcome 5 years after shunting. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis indicated that younger age (adjusted OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77–0.95; p < 0.005), lower body mass index (adjusted OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77–0.98; p < 0.05) and better Mini-Mental State Examination performance (adjusted OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01–1.32; p < 0.05) before surgery predicted favorable 5-year outcome.

Conclusions

This extended follow-up showed that the self-evaluated HRQoL outcome is associated with iNPH patients' pre-operative cognitive status, overweight and age. The post-operative deterioration may reflect the natural progression of iNPH, but also derive from aging and comorbidities. It indicates a need for long-term follow-up.

### Preoperative biomarkers in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus showing a favorable shunt surgery outcome [^114TwPce]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) is known to be a potentially treatable neurologic condition. The neurocognitive outcomes after surgery, however, have been variable. It is important to define preoperative characteristics of patients that predicts the shunting outcome. We aimed to compare baseline differences between shunt-responsive and unresponsive patients after 1year from surgery in order to identify preoperative predictors showing favorable clinical outcomes.

Methods

Among 69 candidates, 31 patients with probable INPH completed the study. Patients were divided into two groups, responsive group (n = 17) and unresponsive group (n = 14), according to the clinical outcomes on INPH grading scale and modified Rankin score (MRS). Preoperative cerebrospinal (CSF) Aß, tau levels, MRI findings, and clinical characteristics were compared between the groups. Correlations between shunt responsiveness and preoperative characteristics were also assessed.

Results

After 1year from shunt, gait problem was the most likely to improve. Shunt-responsive group showed lower CSF p-tau/Aß, fewer lacunes, and higher incidence of disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space (DESH) signs on MRIs compared to those in unresponsive group. Favorable outcome was related with positive DESH sign and fewer lacunes.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that biomarkers representing non-INPH related pathology including Alzheimer's disease and small vessel disease might show less favorable clinical outcomes after 1year from surgery.

### Advancing treatment strategies for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review on studies comparing ventricular and lumbo-peritoneal shunts [^117BxVBj]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Additionally, all studies but for 1 reported the use of programmable valves for both LPS and VPS group, of which only 1 reported specific values of pressure-settings exclusively limited to the LPS group, with a mean of 13.5 ± 3.9 cm H 2 O.

Finally, Kobayashi et al. in 2022 confirmed comparable results between the two surgical techniques as regard to long-term improvement in gait, cognitive performance, and urinary function. Additionally, these authors explored risk factors for unfavorable outcomes, showing that hypertension and longer disease duration negatively impacted the outcomes in both groups.

Taken together, these findings demonstrate that LPS and VPS are associated with similar rates of clinical improvement. However, LPS apparently shows a lower complication rate, making it a viable option in patients at higher risk of procedural complications for VPS.

Quantitative analysis (meta-analysis)

Due to data limitations, a meta-analysis was feasible only for outcomes reported in 4 out of 6 of the included studies. According to the global clinical outcome improvement, defined as a progression in at least one clinical domain (gait, cognition, urinary) at 6-month follow-up, LPS and VPS showed comparable outcomes (OR = 0.912; 95%CI:0.719–1.158; p = 0.4; I² = 0%).

In particular, a gait control improvement was the most frequently reported good outcome, with no significant difference between LPS and VPS (OR = 0.898; 95%CI:0.521–1.547; p = 0.7; I² = 0% — Fig. 3).

### The effect of shunt surgery on neuropsychological performance in normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114KXJfD]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Executive function

It is unclear whether executive function improves following shunt surgery. Some studies report significant improvement in the backwards digit span test, whilst others report no change. Similarly, improvements in the Stroop test have been observed in some studies, but not in others. A ceiling effect has been suggested to underlie the absence of improved executive function. However, studies have found performance in tests of executive function to be disproportionately impaired in NPH patients at baseline, and suggested that lack of improvement reflects an irreversible frontal executive impairment.

Only one of three tests of executive function in our meta-analyses showed robust evidence for improvement (phonemic verbal fluency). The remaining two (backwards digit span and TMT-B) had weaker significance levels, and supporting studies did not indicate agreement in the direction of improvement. We performed meta-analyses using average pre-operative scores to investigate whether instances of lack of improvement were due to ceiling effects. The estimated average pre-operative score for backwards digit span was 2.92 digits. Median score in this test by 159 healthy controls in a study by Hellstrom et al. was 4 digits. Estimated average pre-operative score for TMT-B was 293.03 s. Normative data provided by Tombaugh suggests individuals aged 70–74 complete this test in 109.95 s (less time indicates better performance). Estimated average pre-operative scores for both tests indicated that, on average, patients were impaired in these tests compared to age-matched normative data. This suggests that ceiling effects cannot explain the lack of robust evidence for improvement in these tests following shunt. Nevertheless, robust evidence for improvement was observed for phonemic verbal fluency. However, phonemic verbal fluency is simplistic compared to executive tests with strategic or problem solving aspects. Therefore, improvement in this test likely reflects improved attentional capacity rather than higher level executive function. Overall, given the tests we could include in the analyses, our results do not provide strong evidence for improvement in executive function following shunt surgery, tentatively supporting the hypothesis that executive impairment in NPH may reflect irreversible damage to fronto-subcortical connectivity. However, further investigation using more sensitive tests of executive function are needed as improvements in this domain have been found.

Psychomotor speed

We found good evidence for improvement in psychomotor speed, as measured by the TMT-A. Due to lack of data, we were unable to include other tests of psychomotor speed, although improvements have also been documented in the Grooved pegboard test, the Purdue pegboard test, and the Line-tracing test.

### Normal pressure hydrocephalus: how often does the diagnosis hold water? [^1115rjmC]. Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine our community's incidence of clinically suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), the rate of shunting for NPH, and short- and long-term outcomes of shunting.

Methods

A retrospective query of the Mayo Clinic medical records linkage system was conducted to identify residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, undergoing an invasive diagnostic procedure for evaluation of suspected NPH from 1995 through 2003. Among patients with shunts, early- and long-term outcomes were determined via a review of available medical records.

Results

Forty-one patients underwent an invasive diagnostic procedure for evaluation of suspected NPH; 13 ultimately received shunts, representing an incidence of 1.19/100,000/year. The incidence of sustained definite improvements at 3 years after shunting was only 0.36/100,000/year. Definite gait improvement was documented in 75% at 3–6 months after shunt placement, although it dropped to 50% at 1 year and to 33% at 3 years. Only 1 of 8 patients with cognitive impairment and 1 of 6 patients with urinary incontinence had definite improvement in these symptoms at 3 years. No patient with moderate to severe postural instability experienced sustained definite improvement in any symptom. Complications occurred in 33% of patients including one perioperative death. Additional or alternative neurologic diagnoses later surfaced in 5 of 12 patients.

Conclusions

In this community, NPH is relatively rare with an incidence approximating that of progressive supranuclear palsy in this population. Whereas early gait improvement was common, only one-third of patients enjoyed continued improvement by 3 years; cognition or urinary incontinence was even less responsive long term. Baseline postural instability predicted poor outcome. Clinicians should balance potential benefits of shunting against the known risks.

### Beyond early motor response: longitudinal cognitive and gait assessments after extended lumbar drainage in normal pressure hydrocephalus [^115MDZ7u]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a multifactorial progressive disease affecting cognition, gait, and urinary continence, potentially reversible, or at least improvable, by a prompt surgical intervention. Given its potential surgical improvement, it is crucial to determine who will benefit of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. To date, although several procedures are considered useful to diagnose iNPH, there is no agreement concerning the best timing of the clinical assessment or the role played by formal cognitive testing.

Methods

Thirty participants with suspected iNPH were assessed at baseline, 2, and 15days after 24-h extended lumbar drainage (ELD). Timed Up and Go test (TUG), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) were administered in order to quantify motor and cognitive performances. The TUG was used to assess clinical response to ELD.

Results

Our sample showed significant differences between baseline assessment and follow-ups in the majority of tests. Although some enhancements in performances appeared in the first post-ELD assessment, both treatment responders and non-responders showed better performances in the delayed assessment. Post hoc comparison found significant differences in each time point between the two groups.

Conclusions

These results emphasize the key role of performing multiple assessments post CSF drainage, as response can be more prominent in a delayed rather than an early phase.

### Rapidly progressive dementia and ataxia in an elderly man [^112hXVrM]. Practical Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

A particular variety of chronic communicating hydrocephalus in the elderly has been called 'normal pressure', because the CSF pressure at a random single lumbar puncture is normal. It causes major diagnostic difficulties in elderly demented patients who are also off-balance and incontinent, as this particular triad of neurological problems, together with an enlarged ventricular system can be due to a neurodegenerative disease with cerebral atrophy, rather than to normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).

Could this patient's problems be due to (communicating) hydrocephalus, as suggested by the brain MRI report, and could it be of the normal pressure variety? While his clinical syndrome (dementia+ataxia) is consistent with NPH, most patients with dementia and ataxia do not have NPH, even if they have the third component of the NPH triad (incontinence). Studies that simply document gait disturbance, dementia, incontinence and ventriculomegaly probably overestimate the prevalence of NPH, which is probably equal to that of progressive supranuclear palsy. Typically, NPH patients have subcortical/frontal cognitive dysfunction, most affected being memory, executive function, attention and psychomotor speed. The neuropsychological profile can improve after shunt insertion. However, other studies have found that while gait mght improve initially, incontinence and cognitive features do not improve following shunt insertion, suggesting a high degree of overdiagnosis. There is no definitive test for NPH. There are several supplemental tests to assist diagnosis, including the 'CSF tap test' (large-volume lumbar puncture), external CSF drainage by spinal drainage and CSF outflow determination with CSF infusion compliance studies. However, these tests have variable sensitivities and specificities. The CSF tap test has a low sensitivity 26–61%. Clinical response to CSF removal by spinal catheter has a higher sensitivity 50–100%, specificity 60–100% and positive predictive value 80–100%. However, it is an invasive procedure, requires expert management, and has a high complication rate.

The rate of progression in this patient, over weeks, seems too rapid for NPH, which usually evolves over months to years. So if there really is communicating hydrocephalus, but is not of the normal pressure variety, what else could be causing it? One would have to think of infective or neoplastic causes.

### Placebo-controlled effectiveness of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus shunting: a randomized pilot trial [^113WYK38]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Change in gait velocity was chosen as the primary outcome measure because it is widely used to select patients for shunt surgery as a response to CSF drainage, and has recently been confirmed to be a robust outcome measure for iNPH. The primary outcome finding was the trend to improved gait velocity by 0.28 m/s in the open shunt group compared with 0.04 m/s in the placebo group at 4 months (P = .07). It is recognized that gait changes in iNPH are not limited to velocity and a more complete evaluation of the effect of shunting on motor deficits will also include evaluation of other factors, especially balance. In addition, bladder control was improved in the open shunt group compared with Placebo. Our results are similar to 2 single-center studies. A University of Gothenburg study (n = 14) showed a 30% improvement in gait performance at 3 months in patients with open shunts vs 0.4% in those with ligated shunts. A Queen Square study (n = 14) reported a 43% improvement in gait velocity at 3 months in patients with a shunt opening pressure of 5 cmH 2 O vs 0% in those with a shunt opening pressure of 20 cmH 2 O. Unlike these studies, the method and measurement in this pilot are designed to facilitate a larger patient recruitment, and uses a noninvasive and a more complete, well-blinded placebo.

Other outcome measures, such as those of cognitive function and general functional scales, did not demonstrate significant change. The cognitive decline commonly found in iNPH is generally recognized to be more variable in degree and response to shunting. Although additional enrollment may allow demonstration of cognitive changes, the cognitive screening tools used in the study may be insufficient. A more complete neuropsychological testing battery will be used in a forthcoming study.

### Advancing treatment strategies for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review on studies comparing ventricular and lumbo-peritoneal shunts [^112U1PnZ]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Insights from these studies reaffirm the efficacy of shunt surgery in managing iNPH, with both VPS and LPS offering comparable improvements in functional and cognitive outcome. The analysis of the comparative studies included in this review did not show the presence of a standardized protocol for shunt selection, but the decision is mainly based on patient's preferences and the physician's judgment. Overall, although both techniques appear viable and may carry different profiles in terms of outcomes and complications, the current evidence remains inconclusive regarding their relative superiority. This highlights the need for a well-designed and adequately powered randomized controlled trial to directly compare the two approaches and provide clearer guidance for clinical decision-making.

### Intracranial compartment volumes in normal pressure hydrocephalus: volumetric assessment versus outcome [^111cJFvZ]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Although enlargement of the cerebral ventricles plays a central role in the diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), there are no reports on the use of volumetric assessment to distinguish between patients who respond to ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery and those who do not. The purpose of this study is to explore the association between preoperative intracranial compartment volumes and postoperative improvement.

Methods

Twenty-six patients (17 men; mean age, 75 years [range, 54–87 years]) with a clinical or radiologic suspicion of NPH were included in the study. Gait, cognition, and bladder function were evaluated by clinical rating. MR imaging of the brain was acquired at 0.5 T and 1.5 T. Total intracranial volume, ventricular volume, brain volume, and pericerebral CSF volume were determined by volumetric assessment. Four imaging variables were determined: ventricular volume ratio, brain volume ratio, pericerebral CSF volume ratio, and the ratio of ventricular volume to pericerebral CSF volume. All patients underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery.

Results

Clinical follow-up was assessed 1 year after shunt surgery. No difference in the mean ventricular volume ratio, the mean brain volume ratio, the mean pericerebral CSF volume ratio, and the mean ratio between ventricular and pericerebral CSF volume was found between subjects who improved on gait or cognition or bladder function and those who did not.

Conclusion

Volumetric assessment has no predictive value in differentiating between NPH patients who respond to ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery and those who do not.

The following constitutes key background information on idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus:

- Definition: INPH is a neurological disorder characterized by an imbalance in the production and absorption of CSF, leading to ventriculomegaly without elevated CSF pressure.
- Pathophysiology: INPH is caused by altered CSF dynamics, with inadequate CSF re-absorption or insufficient volume buffering reserve being key factors.
- Epidemiology: The incidence of INPH in Spain is estimated at 120 per 100,000 person-years in adults aged > 70 years.
- Disease course: Clinical manifestations include headaches increasing in frequency and severity, visual darkening, pulsating tinnitus, as well as dizziness, neck pain, back pain, and cognitive impairment.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of INPH can be unpredictable. While symptoms typically progress over time, the rate and severity of progression can vary among patients.

Neuropathology in iNPH and shunt response: A Class III cohort of 39 iNPH patients using a composite NPH score reported that those with moderate to severe neuropathologic findings of Alzheimer disease were less likely to improve 2 or more points after shunting (2 of 8) than those with no Alzheimer pathology (6 of 9) (p = 0.014). However, the guideline states that in suspected iNPH there is insufficient evidence to determine whether patients with moderate to severe neuropathologic findings of Alzheimer disease respond less favorably to shunting than those without Alzheimer pathology (1 Class III cohort).

Normal-Pressure Hydrocephalus

Normal-pressure hydrocephalus is a subtype of hydrocephalus that shows symptomatic ventriculomegaly without elevated ICP readings. Variable degrees of clinical improvement are observed after placement of programmable ventricular shunts. Although the causes of NPH are not fully understood, recent work using magnetic resonance elastography measured abnormal viscoelastic properties in patients with NPH compared with age-matched controls. The authors used the rheological spring-pot viscoelastic model, which has two key parameters. The shear modulus parameter (m) is a measure of global brain stiffness and was decreased in patients with NPH. The second parameter (a) is low in simple gels and increased in biologic tissue with three-dimensional structures, such as nervous tissue. Patients with NPH had lower a values compared with controls, which is consistent with the greater ventricular compliance and the lower-pressure shunt settings needed for patients with NPH. After shunting, repeat magnetic resonance elastography showed near normalization of a but no effect on global brain stiffness, m.

Delayed glymphatic clearance has been directly measured in patients with NPH. Following lumbar intrathecal gadobutrol injection as a CSF tracer, Ringstad et al. completed serial MRI over 24 h in patients diagnosed with NPH (n = 15). ICP was also monitored. All patients were kept in a supine position during the study period because glymphatic clearance is position dependent. They observed (1) delayed glymphatic clearance of intrathecal Gad, (2) retrograde filling of the ventricular system, and (3) transependymal enhancement. Entorhinal cortex atrophy and medial temporal lobe atrophy were increased in patients with NPH compared with controls.

On the basis of animal studies showing the role of the glymphatic system in clearing macromolecules, such as soluble amyloid, from the brain, the reduced glymphatic clearance may contribute to a buildup of neurotoxic molecules, such as amyloid and tau proteins, in patients with NPH. These findings may account for the delayed cognitive and functional decline commonly seen in shunted patients with NPH after a honeymoon period of clinical improvement. Because AQP4 expression at astrocytic end-feet lining brain blood vessels is fundamental for normal glymphatic clearance, Hasan-Olive et al. conducted studies of AQP4 in brain biopsy specimens from reference (n = 12) patients and patients with NPH (n = 30). Electron microscopy using immunogold cytochemistry found that the perivascular density of AQP4 within astrocytic end-feet was reduced in NPH patients vs. controls.

### Beyond early motor response: longitudinal cognitive and gait assessments after extended lumbar drainage in normal pressure hydrocephalus [^115Nk771]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is the most common form of adult hydrocephalus, characterized by cognitive deficits, gait disturbances, and urinary incontinence (Hakim's triad). In particular, motor impairment is usually the first sign to appear, featuring equilibrium and gait disturbances. The locomotion pattern is characterized by a low gait velocity, due to a diminished stride length, a diminished foot‐to‐floor clearance during swing phase, and a typical disruption of dynamic equilibrium, showing a broad‐based gait and an outward rotation of the feet. Concerning cognitive impairment, defined as a subcortical cognitive decline, given the involvement of this component of the brain, it emerged that deficits are extensive and involve attention, executive functions, memory, verbal fluency, working memory, psychomotor speed, and visuospatial functions.

As this is a potentially reversible condition, diagnostic accuracy is of paramount importance. Unfortunately, up to date, the gold standard for the diagnosis of iNPH is shunt response, which is also the treatment. According to the literature, the response to shunt surgery varies between case series from 29% up to 90%: this disparity in reported results reflects the difficulty in selecting suitable patients for shunt surgery as many pathologies mimic the symptoms of iNPH. Existing iNPH guidelines, such as the latest Japanese iNPH guidelines, present several tests that can be used to help diagnose iNPH and quantify disability, for example, tap test (TT), infusion test (IT), extended lumbar drainage (ELD), and intracranial pressure monitoring (ICPM). Regrettably, all these procedures are invasive and might also have some negative effects on patient's performance — for example, back pain.

Outcomes at the 4-Month Primary End Point

The change in gait velocity and secondary outcome measures at 4 months after shunt surgery in the placebo and open shunt groups compared with presurgical baseline are shown in Table 2 and Figure 3. Mean gait velocity increased by 0.28 m/s (± 0.28) in the open shunt group compared with 0.04 m/s (± 0.17) in the placebo group. Modeling of treatment effect found a statistical trend (P = .07) of a benefit of active shunting. The change in MoCA score showed no treatment difference. However, the Overactive Bladder Short Form symptom bother questionnaire showed significant improvement in the open shunt group (P = .007; significant at the 0.05 level after accounting for multiple secondary effectiveness outcomes).

### Neurocognitive effects of CSF biomarkers in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients undergoing VP shunt placement [^114HGGPQ]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations and conclusion

The authors acknowledge that the follow-up period was limited to three months post-surgery, which may not capture long-term cognitive outcomes and the potential for symptom recurrence. Longer follow-up periods are needed to fully understand the durability of the observed cognitive improvements.

The use of the beta-amyloid ratio as a prognostic tool opens new avenues for personalized medicine in iNPH. By stratifying patients based on their beta-amyloid ratio, clinicians can better predict which patients are likely to benefit most from VP-shunt surgery. This approach can improve patient outcomes, reduce unnecessary procedures, and optimize healthcare resources.

Another important limitation is the lack of postoperative CSF biomarker data. While preoperative levels of Aβ42/Aβ40, tau, and phospho-tau were assessed, no postoperative measurements were taken. As a result, we were unable to evaluate the dynamic changes of these biomarkers after shunt placement or their direct relationship to cognitive recovery. Future studies incorporating postoperative CSF sampling will be essential to further elucidate the role of biomarker trajectories in predicting and monitoring treatment response in iNPH.

Future research should focus on long-term follow-up studies to understand the durability of cognitive improvements and the potential for symptom recurrence. Additionally, investigating the interaction between other CSF biomarkers and the beta-amyloid ratio could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology of iNPH and its treatment outcomes.

DISCUSSION

Whether shunt treatment for iNPH is economically justified is a matter of debate. According to the Laupacis standards, for the treatment to be cost-effective, a treated group needs to maintain the mRS score for 18 months after ventriculoperitoneal shunt, and 21 months after LP shunt surgery, with grade 1 evidence. For this requirement to be realized, the treatment effect of shunt intervention for patients with iNPH should be maintained for at least two years. According to Kazui and colleagues, attenuation of cognitive impairment is a major factor contributing to the caregiver analysis through Zarit burden interviews. The diagnosis of iNPH remains challenging, especially at early stages, when presenting symptoms that largely overlap with those of other neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, cognitive function is affected most strongly by AD comorbidity, leading to a poor response to shunting intervention. Therefore, we consider the identification of AD comorbidity to be crucial for successful shunt intervention in iNPH.

While a diagnosis of iNPH is typically based on symptom evaluation and radiographic findings, identifying patients who are more likely to respond to specific treatments by adding a CSF biomarker adjunctive diagnostic test can increase the effectiveness of our limited medical resources. To develop such a test in the present study, we categorized patients with iNPH based on biochemical analyses of CSF collected before shunt intervention, and then retrospectively tracked cognitive function, gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and mRS performance for three years after the surgery. Group analyses showed that the duration of shunt-induced improvements in these functions was shorter in the high p-Tau group compared with the low p-Tau group. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a correlation between preoperative p-Tau CSF levels (determined using the xMAP Luminex platform) and three-year prognosis after shunt intervention in patients with iNPH. We used MMSE, FAB, mRS, and iNPHGS scores as cognitive outcome measures. Notably, the results of cognitive function evaluation with the MMSE and FAB differed from those obtained with the iNPHGS. This difference is likely attributable to the iNPHGS including multiple subjective elements.

### A randomized trial of shunting for idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus [^117JvR5t]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus is a neurologic disorder characterized by impaired gait, balance, cognition, and bladder control in older adults. The disorder is treated with shunt surgery, but the effectiveness of shunting is unclear.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving participants selected for shunt surgery on the basis of gait-velocity improvement with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage. Participants were randomly assigned to an open-shunt valve setting (opening pressure, 110 mm of water) or a placebo valve setting (opening pressure, > 400 mm of water) of a noninvasively adjustable shunt. The primary outcome was the change in gait velocity 3 months after surgery. Secondary outcomes were the change at 3 months in the Tinetti scale total score (range, 0 to 28; lower scores indicate worse gait and balance), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score (range, 0 to 30; lower scores indicate worse cognition), and Overactive Bladder Questionnaire score (range, 0 to 100; higher scores indicate worse urinary incontinence).

Results

A total of 99 participants underwent randomization and received the assigned intervention. At 3 months, gait velocity had increased in the open-shunt group (mean [± SD] change, 0.23 ± 0.23 m per second; assessed in 49 participants) and was unchanged in the placebo group (mean change, 0.03 ± 0.23 m per second; assessed in 49 participants), resulting in a treatment difference of 0.21 m per second (95% confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.31; P < 0.001). A significantly greater improvement in the open-shunt group than the placebo group was seen for the Tinetti scale score (mean change, 2.9 points vs. 0.5 points; P = 0.003) but not the MoCA score (1.3 points vs. 0.3 points) or the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire score (-3.3 points vs. -1.5 points). The results regarding adverse events were mixed, with more participants in the placebo group reporting falls (46% vs. 24%), an equal percentage having cerebral bleeding (2% in both groups), and more participants in the open-shunt group having subdural bleeding (12% vs. 2%) and positional headaches (59% vs. 28%).

Conclusions

Among participants with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus who had a response to temporary CSF drainage, shunting resulted in significant improvements at 3 months in gait velocity and a measure of gait and balance but not in measures of cognition or incontinence.

In summary, the results of our study indicate that CSVD is prevalent in patients with iNPH and is associated with more severe symptoms, although its presence may not affect shunt outcomes. Future studies are necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms linking CSVD and iNPH, as well as to determine the potential benefits of managing CSVD in improving gait and cognitive function in patients with iNPH, in addition to shunt surgery. It is essential to conduct large‐scale and longitudinal studies to confirm our findings.

### Is the placement of shunts in patients with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus worth the risk? Results of a study based on continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure [^117VMLfN]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Object

Data from many studies have demonstrated that shunt insertion in patients with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is associated with high morbidity and a lack of significant improvement; however, the use of strict diagnostic and treatment protocols can improve the results of surgery in these patients. The primary aim in this prospective study was to analyze the results of shunt placement in 43 patients with idiopathic NPH. A secondary aim was to determine the relationship between several clinical and neuroimaging factors, and patient outcome after surgery.

Methods

Thirty men and 13 women with a mean age of 71.1 ± 6.9 years participated in this study. All patients underwent clinical, neuropsychological, and radiological assessment before and 6 months after surgery. In all patients continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure was performed using a fiberoptic extradural sensor. In 31 patients cerebrospinal fluid dynamics were also determined. Eighty-six percent of patients showed clinical improvement after shunt insertion, 11.6% showed no change, and 2.3% exhibited some worsening. Gait improved in 81.4% of the patients, sphincter control in 69.8%, and cognitive dysfunction in 39.5%. There was no treatment-related death. Early or late postsurgical complications occurred in six patients (14%), although all of these complications were minor or were satisfactorily resolved. The complete clinical triad, cortical sulci size, and periventricular lucencies were related to outcome, whereas patient age, symptom duration, ventricular dilation, and the degree of presurgical dementia were unrelated to outcome.

Conclusions

Given the correct diagnosis, shunt insertion can produce marked improvement in patients with idiopathic NPH syndrome, causing few deaths and few clinically relevant complications.

### Long-term outcome in patients with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus [^112qy9UM]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the outcome of patients with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus at 6 months and 5 years after shunt surgery.

Methods

Seventy-five patients (mean age, 72.5 6 9 yr), with normal pressure hydrocephalus symptoms were included. Fifty-four patients with positive lumbar infusion and/or cerebrospinal fluid tap tests received a cerebrospinal fluid shunt, whereas 21 patients with negative test results did not undergo operation. Walk, reaction time, memory, and identical forms tests were used as baseline (before surgery) tests and were repeated at short- (6.1 6 4.6 mo) and long-term (5.5 6 1.4 yr) follow-up evaluations. Activities of daily life functions were assessed using the Barthel index.

Results

At the 6-month follow-up examination, 83% of the operated patients improved in gait, 65% improved in reaction time, 46% improved in memory, and 31% improved in identical forms tests; 96% found themselves subjectively improved. Because of unrelated mortality (37%) and declining general health from comorbidity, only 27 patients were available for the 5-year follow-up evaluation. Twenty-three of these patients had been treated with a shunt and had a remaining improvement in close to 40% in gait and reaction time, whereas fewer than 10% had an improvement in cognitive tests. Fifty-six percent reported subjective improvement compared with preoperative findings. More patients (64%) improved if younger than 75 years; for patients older than 75 years, only 11% of the patients improved. The Barthel index was higher (P < 0.05) in improved patients.

Conclusion

Patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus benefit from shunt surgery for at least 5 years. High mortality rate, comorbidity, and old age hamper good long-term outcome and emphasize the importance of patient selection.

RESULTS

Patient Recruitment and Study Population

Of 240 patients screened between May, 2018, and March, 2020, 37 (15%) were eligible based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of eligible patients, 21/37 (57%) consented and 18 were recruited and participated in the study (Figure 2). The most frequent reasons for exclusion were baseline velocity ≥ 1 m/s (19%), use of anticoagulation (20%), cognitive impairment (27%), and Parkinson's disease (6%). The primary concern expressed by eligible patients who declined participation in the study was the possibility of a 4-month delay before active shunting.

Patient Characteristics

Demographics, severity of symptoms, comorbidities, ventricular size, and presence of comorbidities are described in Table 1. There were no significant differences between the placebo and open shunt groups. In addition, the severity of the iNPH condition, measured as baseline function (Supplemental Digital Content 2,) and ventricular size, was similar between the 2 groups.

### Preoperative phosphorylated tau concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid can predict cognitive function three years after shunt surgery in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^112fSyA2]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Background:

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is commonly treated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting. However, the long-term efficacy of shunt intervention in the presence of comorbid Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is debated.

Objective:

To identify AD-associated CSF biomarkers predictive of shunting surgery outcomes in patients with iNPH.

Methods:

Preoperative levels of total and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) were measured in 40 patients with iNPH divided into low (< 30 pg/mL) and high (≥ 30 pg/mL) p-Tau groups and followed up for three years after lumboperitoneal shunting. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Frontal Assessment Battery, and iNPH Grading Scale scores were compared between the age-adjusted low (n = 24; mean age 75.7 years [SD 5.3]) and high (n = 11; mean age 76.0 years [SD 5.6]) p-Tau groups.

Results:

Cognitive function improved early in the low p-Tau group and was maintained thereafter (p = 0.005). In contrast, the high p-Tau group showed a gradual decline to baseline levels by the third postoperative year (p = 0.040). Although the p-Tau concentration did not correlate with the preoperative MMSE score, a negative correlation appeared and strengthened during follow-up (R 2 = 0.352, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the low p-Tau group showed rapid and sustained mRS grade improvement, whereas mRS performance gradually declined in the high p-Tau group.

Conclusions:

Preoperative CSF p-Tau concentration predicted some aspects of cognitive function after shunt intervention in patients with iNPH. The therapeutic effects of shunt treatment were shorter-lasting in patients with coexisting AD pathology.

### Systematic volumetric analysis predicts response to CSF drainage and outcome to shunt surgery in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^117NmyTr]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Patients

Patient data were retrospectively collected between the years of 2009 and 2016. All research protocols were approved by the local Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients in this study. Two patient cohorts were included in this study:
Probable INPH were included to test the diagnostic accuracy of separating responders to CSF drainage from non-responders. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) a diagnosis of probable INPH based on routine radiological reports, characteristic gait, and cognitive symptoms; (ii) completion of gait assessments before and within 2 h after the CSF drainage test via LVLP; and (iii) completion of MRI scans between 1 and 3 months prior to the test. Patients with obstructive hydrocephalus, congenital hydrocephalus, or secondary hydrocephalus were excluded. One hundred four patients were selected according to these criteria, with their demographic and clinical information summarized in Table 1. Thirty-five among them were identified as responders who presented an improvement on the timed up and go (TUG) test by 30% or Tinetti gait assessment by 5 or more points within 2 h after drainage compared to pre-drainage assessments.
A separate cohort of INPH patients was used to test the prognostic accuracy of post-surgical outcomes because we did not have follow-up neurological tests of the responders from the previous cohort. We selected patients who completed Tinetti and/or Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) tests before shunting and within 1 year after shunting and had MRI scans between 0 and 10 months prior to shunting. The exact interval between the tests and shunt surgery and between surgery and MRI scans are provided in Table 2. Forty-seven patients who had complete Tinetti records and 37 patients who had complete MMSE records were included (Table 2).

### The effect of shunt surgery on neuropsychological performance in normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115CXyzC]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Global cognitive functioning

We found robust evidence for improved performance on the MMSE. This test is commonly used to assess cognitive function in NPH, although results vary with some studies finding significant improvements, and others finding no change. A ceiling effect may explain why some studies find no change on the MMSE. High functioning patients can perform well on this test while specific cognitive deficits may be missed unless detailed neuropsychological testing is conducted. Indeed, in their study, Iddon et al. split patients according to their pre-operative MMSE scores. Patients who scored in the dementing range of the MMSE at baseline (< 24 points) improved to the normal range post-operatively. However, no significant difference was observed between baseline and outcome scores for patients who did not score in the dementing range at baseline. Therefore, it is important that cognitive assessments include a battery of neuropsychological tests in addition to the MMSE.

Practice effects

Studies with test–retest control groups provide evidence that improvements following shunt surgery are due to treatment effects rather than practice effects. Katzen et al. found greater improvement in measures of mental tracking speed and sustained attention in shunted iNPH patients than in healthy controls who had undergone repeated testing. Saito et al. found evidence for improvements in executive function following shunt which were not ascribable to practice effects. Furthermore, Solana et al. investigated the effect of testing–retesting in patients with NPH using a battery of neuropsychological tests administered over four consecutive days. No learning effect was observed for any of the tests and it was concluded that improvements following shunt reflect a true treatment effect.

### The diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^116Zmnjo]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) is a syndrome that is characterized by gait impairment, cognitive decline and urinary incontinence, and is associated with ventriculomegaly in the absence of elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. There is significant variation in the clinical presentation and progression of this disorder, and its diagnosis often represents a challenge for neurologists and neurosurgeons. Various supplemental tests, including the CSF tap test, external CSF drainage via spinal catheter, and CSF outflow resistance determination, can improve the accuracy of predicting a response to surgical treatment. CSF shunting provides significant symptom improvement in the majority of appropriately evaluated patients. In 2005, an international study group published evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of INPH. This review will highlight the clinical presentation, radiographic findings, supplemental prognostic tests, differential diagnosis, surgical treatment and outcomes of INPH.

### Symptoms and signs did not predict outcome after surgery: a prospective study of 143 patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^116yPdfy]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Here, we made a substantial effort to identify clinical variables of predictive value. Our study included well over 100 patients, it was prospective and consecutive, and involved the registration of around 30 different symptoms and signs, comorbidities and BMI. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study of its kind so far addressing this question.

It has been a major challenge for previous research to predict outcomes after shunt treatment in NPH and to identify the approximate 20% of patients not improved by shunt surgery. Available CSF dynamic or drainage tests all show low negative predictive values and the use of CSF and MRI biomarkers have, so far, not improved the identification of non-responders, which is why better predictive markers are highly warranted. Since the diagnosis of iNPH is based on recognition of the typical clinical syndrome in combination with radiological markers, the use of symptoms and signs for prediction is both practical and appealing.

In our sample of diagnosed and operated iNPH patients, none of the preoperative clinical tests could aid in telling apart patients who later benefitted from shunt surgery from those who did not: comparisons of clinical baseline data between improved and non-improved patients revealed no preoperative differences. The odds ratios for improvement were non-significant for all those baseline variables. Only the anamnestic information of memory impairment being the dominating subjective complaint, was found to have a predictive value, with a lower improvement rate of 44% in that group of 18 patients, compared to 73% in the whole cohort. These 18 patients do not stand out from the remaining cohort of 125 patients with regard to clinical baseline variables: their age was similar, p = 0.58, and they had a median MMSE of 25; IQR 20–27, without significant difference from the remaining cohort, p = 0.21. Neither was any significant difference seen in their preoperative total iNPH scale score, p = 0.54, nor in the neuropsychology or gait domain score of the iNPH scale, p = 0.11 and p = 0.31. Impairment was seen in all four symptom domains of the iNPH scale at baseline in ten of those 18 patients, three domains in four, two domains in three patients, and in one impairment was seen only in the neuropsychology domain.

MRI aqueductal cerebrospinal fluid flow in suspected iNPH — predictive value for shunt response: In a Class II study of 49 suspected NPH patients selected by clinical picture and imaging (with large-volume LP in 36), shunting was followed by improved gait in 86%, improved continence in 69%, and improved cognitive function in 44%, and elevated aqueductal flow rate did not predict response although all patients with rates > 33 mL/min did improve. In a Class III cohort stratified by intracranial pressure, values greater than approximately 10 mm/s were considered elevated and, of 33 with active or compensated hydrocephalus, 29 had elevated velocities with 28 of these improving with shunting, while of the 4 with normal aqueductal velocity, 3 improved. Another Class III study using a cutoff flow rate of 24 mL/min reported MRI sensitivity 46% and specificity 95% for iNPH, and a third study stratifying aqueductal CSF stroke volume as low (≤ 50 μL), medium (51–100 μL), and high (≥ 101 μL) found no relationship between this measure and shunt response. Overall, patients with suspected iNPH who have high-velocity aqueductal flow on MRI and an abnormal CSF-IT are possibly more likely to respond to shunting (1 Class II study and 2 Class III studies).

### Timing of surgical treatment for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: association between treatment delay and reduced short-term benefit [^112cshwB]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE A growing body of evidence suggests that longer durations of preoperative symptoms may correlate with worse postoperative outcomes following cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion for treatment of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). The aim of this study is to determine whether the duration of preoperative symptoms alters postoperative outcomes in patients treated for iNPH. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective review of 393 cases of iNPH involving patients treated with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting. The duration of symptoms prior to the operative intervention was recorded. The following outcome variables were assessed at baseline, 6 months postoperatively, and at last follow-up: gait performance, urinary continence, and cognition. RESULTS The patients' median age at shunt placement was 74 years. Increased symptom duration was significantly associated with worse gait outcomes (relative risk (RR) 1.055 per year of symptoms, p = 0.037), and an overall absence of improvement in any of the classic triad symptomology (RR 1.053 per year of symptoms, p = 0.033) at 6 months postoperatively. Additionally, there were trends toward significance for symptom duration increasing the risk of having no 6-month postoperative improvement in urinary incontinence (RR 1.049 per year of symptoms, p = 0.069) or cognitive symptoms (RR 1.051 per year of symptoms, p = 0.069). However, no statistically significant differences were noted in these outcomes at last follow-up (median 31 months). Age stratification by decade revealed that prolonging symptom duration was significantly associated with lower Mini-Mental Status Examination scores in patients aged 60–70 years, and lack of cognitive improvement in patients aged 70–80 years. CONCLUSIONS Patients with iNPH with longer duration of preoperative symptoms may not receive the same short-term benefits of surgical intervention as patients with shorter duration of preoperative symptoms. However, with longer follow-up, the patients generally reached the same end point. Therefore, when managing patients with iNPH, it may take longer to see the benefits of CSF shunting when patients present with a longer duration of preoperative symptoms.

In the same year, Chankaew et al. reported a cohort of NPH patients undergoing both LPS and VPS, noting comparable improvements in the classical clinical triad across both groups. Moreover, this study highlighted a high prevalence of swallowing and speech problems in these patients, demonstrating significant improvements after shunt surgery in both groups. Importantly, this study found correlations between bulbar dysfunction and classical NPH symptoms, suggesting that the former should be also considered as a core symptom in diagnosis and management of NPH.

Additionally, Kanno et al. (2017) observed in DTI imaging improvements in fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the corona radiata, suggesting recovery of white matter integrity and reduction of the ventricular-dilation induced stress in shunt-responsive patients. On the other hand, non-responsive patients did not exhibit significant FA changes. They also observed that changes in FA and mean diffusivity (MD) were more evident in VPS patients, reflecting its higher association with a potential cerebral recovery. All in all, however, this study showed a global clinical improvement both in LPS and VPS patients measured as enhancing in iNPH grading and reduction ventricular size.

Nakajima et al. in 2018 also supported these findings, reporting an improvement in mRS scale of 63% for LPS and 69% for VPS patients at one year follow-up. An additional analysis also showed similar improvements in gait, cognition, and urinary function between the two groups, although the frequency of shunt revisions was higher in LPS group (7% vs. 1%).

Similarly, in 2021, Xie et al. compared two cohorts of 38 patients treated with LPS and VPS, respectively, showing no significant difference in symptoms relief based on Kiefer's Hydrocephalus Score (KHS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). They observed an overall response rate (ORR) of 75% for LPS and 77% for VPS at six months follow-up. Furthermore, they noted significantly fewer complication rates in LPS group (20% versus 33% in VPS), especially due to the absence of ventricular puncture.

### Preoperative phosphorylated tau concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid can predict cognitive function three years after shunt surgery in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^114KzAsd]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is commonly treated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting. However, the long-term efficacy of shunt intervention in the presence of comorbid Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is debated.

Objective

To identify AD-associated CSF biomarkers predictive of shunting surgery outcomes in patients with iNPH.

Methods

Preoperative levels of total and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) were measured in 40 patients with iNPH divided into low (< 30 pg/mL) and high (≥ 30 pg/mL) p-Tau groups and followed up for three years after lumboperitoneal shunting. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Frontal Assessment Battery, and iNPH Grading Scale scores were compared between the age-adjusted low (n = 24; mean age 75.7 years [SD 5.3]) and high (n = 11; mean age 76.0 years [SD 5.6]) p-Tau groups.

Results

Cognitive function improved early in the low p-Tau group and was maintained thereafter (p = 0.005). In contrast, the high p-Tau group showed a gradual decline to baseline levels by the third postoperative year (p = 0.040). Although the p-Tau concentration did not correlate with the preoperative MMSE score, a negative correlation appeared and strengthened during follow-up (R2 = 0.352, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the low p-Tau group showed rapid and sustained mRS grade improvement, whereas mRS performance gradually declined in the high p-Tau group.

Conclusions

Preoperative CSF p-Tau concentration predicted some aspects of cognitive function after shunt intervention in patients with iNPH. The therapeutic effects of shunt treatment were shorter-lasting in patients with coexisting AD pathology.

### Shunt surgery in patients with hydrocephalus and white matter changes [^112V3rs2]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Object

Patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) often present with impaired gait and cognition together with ventricular enlargement and normal intracranial pressure. Many have vascular risk factors as well as periventricular and deep white matter changes on MR imaging. Abnormal CSF dynamics, that is, high resistance to outflow or improvement after CSF drainage, indicate good effects of shunt surgery. The authors examined whether the worst-case iNPH patients with extensive vascular white matter disease and normal CSF dynamics would benefit from shunt surgery. These patients also fulfilled the criteria for Binswanger disease. Therefore, a randomized controlled double-blind study was performed.

Methods

Fourteen consecutive patients fulfilling the above criteria were randomized to receive either open or closed shunts. At 3 months after surgery, the patients with initially ligated shunts had their shunts opened. Clinical evaluation consisting of 7 quantitative psychometric and 6 continuous gait tests was performed preoperatively and 3 and 6 months after surgery.

Results

Patients randomized to receive open shunts had improved motor (30% increase) and psychometric (23% increase) scores 3 months after shunt placement. There were no significant changes between the 3- and 6-month follow-up in these same patients. Conversely, those with initially ligated shunts were unchanged during the first 3-month period, although they improved in both motor (28%) and cognitive (18%) functions following removal of the ligature.

Conclusions

Patients with enlarged ventricles, hydrocephalic symptoms, and extensive vascular white matter changes benefit from shunt surgery.

### Lack of shunt response in suspected idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus with Alzheimer disease pathology [^113Q6QjS]. Annals of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

To determine the impact of cortical Alzheimer disease pathology on shunt responsiveness in individuals treated for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), 37 patients clinically diagnosed with iNPH participated in a prospective study in which performance on neurologic, psychometric, and gait measures before and 4 months after shunting was correlated with amyloid β plaques, neuritic plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles observed in cortical biopsies obtained during shunt insertion. No complications resulted from biopsy acquisition. Moderate to severe pathology was associated with worse baseline cognitive performance and diminished postoperative improvement on NPH symptom severity scales, gait measures, and cognitive instruments compared to patients lacking pathology.

### The effect of shunt surgery on neuropsychological performance in normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114NakFB]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Extent and duration of improvement

Although cognitive improvement has been observed in patients with NPH following shunt surgery, patients remain impaired in neuropsychological tests compared to age-matched controls. Shunted patients have shown to perform significantly poorer than healthy controls in tests of psychomotor speed, memory and executive function at both three and 12 months post-shunt. We investigated outcome between three and 12 months post-shunt, however, from the available data, we were unable to assess outcome at longer durations. To determine the extent of cognitive recovery, longer-term monitoring of patients is required using multiple post-operative assessments as improvements have been documented as late 5 years post-shunt.

### Practice guideline: idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: response to shunting and predictors of response: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^116QhRUK]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus — research priorities: The question of the efficacy of ventricular shunting for iNPH is important, and well-designed clinical trials of ventricular shunting in patients with iNPH are clearly needed, including a control intervention, randomized assignment, treatment masking, more objective outcome measures, and a sufficiently long observation period to document the duration of any benefit. Stratification of patients on the basis of possible Alzheimer disease (AD) using advanced neuroimaging or CSF markers may provide additional insights, as may evaluation of other comorbidities and functional status. It was estimated that 8,340 patients with iNPH underwent shunting in the United States from 2003 to 2009. Because this procedure is frequently performed in countries such as the United States and newer types of shunts are more expensive, it is important to know whether shunting is effective, and properly performed studies of diagnosis, predictors, and treatment are essential.

### Beyond early motor response: longitudinal cognitive and gait assessments after extended lumbar drainage in normal pressure hydrocephalus [^113JVNRg]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a multifactorial progressive disease affecting cognition, gait, and urinary continence, potentially reversible, or at least improvable, by a prompt surgical intervention. Given its potential surgical improvement, it is crucial to determine who will benefit of a ventriculo‐peritoneal shunt. To date, although several procedures are considered useful to diagnose iNPH, there is no agreement concerning the best timing of the clinical assessment or the role played by formal cognitive testing.

Methods

Thirty participants with suspected iNPH were assessed at baseline, 2, and 15 days after 24‐h extended lumbar drainage (ELD). Timed Up and Go test (TUG), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) were administered in order to quantify motor and cognitive performances. The TUG was used to assess clinical response to ELD.

Results

Our sample showed significant differences between baseline assessment and follow‐ups in the majority of tests. Although some enhancements in performances appeared in the first post‐ELD assessment, both treatment responders and non‐responders showed better performances in the delayed assessment. Post hoc comparison found significant differences in each time point between the two groups.

Conclusions

These results emphasize the key role of performing multiple assessments post CSF drainage, as response can be more prominent in a delayed rather than an early phase.

### Alterations of glymphatic system before and after shunt surgery in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a longitudinal study [^114AzddZ]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

The brain glymphatic function of iNPH patients is impaired, but it can be improved after shunt surgery and has a positive effect on the recovery of cognitive function. Clinically, monitoring brain glymphatic function would assist in predicting and evaluating the potential effects of shunt surgery, thereby enabling accurate patient screening for those who may benefit from surgical intervention.

### Shunting for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) [^114LxvJ9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Since the condition was first described in 1965, the syndrome of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) has conventionally been managed by placement of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of shunting procedures in promoting stability or improvement in the neurological symptoms and signs of NPH.

Search Strategy

The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 26 June 2001 using the terms 'shunt' and 'normal pressure hydrocephalus'.

Selection Criteria

Studies included for analysis were those involving the placement of a CSF shunt for the treatment of NPH as part of a randomized controlled trial.

Data Collection and Analysis

No data matching the selection criteria were found.

Main Results

No randomized controlled trials of shunt placement versus no shunt were found.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is no evidence to indicate whether placement of a shunt is effective in the management of NPH.

### Practice guideline: idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: response to shunting and predictors of response: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^117VYjsm]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus — predictors of shunt response: There is evidence that improvement in gait following external lumbar drainage (ELD), MRI-measured high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) velocity through the aqueduct, and abnormal intracranial CSF hydrodynamics may predict a good response to shunting, but publications of a lower evidence class indicate that these measures are not predictive. These procedures are associated with significant cost and potential complications, and, in the case of CSF-ITs, the equipment required is not widely available (particularly in the United States). Identification of Alzheimer pathology at the time of shunting would predict a poor outcome.

### The effect of shunt surgery on neuropsychological performance in normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113J9nkH]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The within-study variances of the average differences were calculated using the reported standard deviations and the numbers of patients. For studies that did not give average difference scores directly, we calculated variances of the average pre-operative and post-operative scores in the same way and allowed for a correlation between these two scores when calculating within-study variances of their difference; this is important because scores from the same patients will generally be positively correlated. We assumed a moderate correlation of 0.6 between the average pre-operative and post-operative scores. Our conclusions were robust when assuming alternative correlations of 0.4 and 0.8 (results not shown).

Due to the small numbers of patients comprising the studies, the approximations that underlie the random-effects model are not especially precise. This is evident when, for example, studies' statements about the statistical significance of their difference scores are not necessarily reflected in the forest plots. Therefore, we carefully assess whether the results are robust below.

Random-effects meta-analyses were also performed using average pre-operative scores to investigate whether instances of lack of improvement were due to ceiling effects. Finally, three random-effects meta-regression models were fitted using the average difference in MMSE as outcome data to assess the evidence that three covariates may be useful predictors of cognitive change.

We did not use any statistical method to assess publication bias. Whilst recognising this as an important issue for meta-analyses, not all studies contribute outcome data to all meta-analyses. Hence the sample sizes are inadequate to assess this issue formally. Furthermore, it is plausible to assume an absence of publication bias in our systematic review. This is because publication bias is usually thought to occur because studies indicating a treatment effect are more likely to be published but our studies do not compare treatment groups in this way.

### CSF galanin and cognition after shunt surgery in normal pressure hydrocephalus [^113xAto4]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

"Normal" pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is associated with injury to neurotransmitter and neuropeptide systems that recovers after surgery. This could be linked to changes in galanin, a neuropeptide with inhibitory effects on basal forebrain cognitive function.

Objective

To examine changes in CSF galanin concentrations in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus undergoing shunt surgery, and to investigate the relation between these changes and cognitive functioning.

Methods

Eight patients underwent surgery for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus. Lumbar CSF galanin determinations, cognitive status, and clinical status were quantified before operation and six months after. Cognition was assessed by an extensive battery of tests measuring attention, memory, speed of mental processing, visuospatial function, and frontal lobe function.

Results

CSF galanin concentration decreased after surgery. This reduction correlated with improved clinical and cognitive functioning, specifically with attention and visuomotor speed, visuoconstructive and frontal functioning, and clinical status according to the NPH scale, including the sphincter and cognitive components.

Conclusions

The cognitive and clinical improvement after shunt implantation correlated with CSF galanin levels, suggesting that the distribution or function of this agent involves cerebral structures that have some potential for recovery. In this study, galanin was related to several cognitive functions that may be associated with the fronto-subcortical deficits underlying cognitive dysfunction in normal pressure hydrocephalus.

### Practice guideline: idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: response to shunting and predictors of response: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^114Zyrrd]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) — efficacy of ventricular shunting: The 3 identified studies with higher than Class IV evidence were consistent with a benefit of ventricular shunting for iNPH, but there is a decrease of response after 6 months, and fewer than half of patients were considered to be improved in all presenting iNPH symptoms after 18 months. Although the vast majority of other published studies has reported clinical improvement of iNPH after ventricular shunting, none to date has been designed to provide high-level evidence of efficacy, and the use of ventricular shunting for iNPH is based largely on uncontrolled observational studies of clinical response.

### MRI-based prediction of clinical improvement after ventricular shunt placement for normal pressure hydrocephalus: development and evaluation of an integrated multisequence machine learning algorithm [^114TmcC2]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) are sometimes refractory to shunt placement, with limited ability to predict improvement for individual patients. We evaluated an MRI-based artificial intelligence method to predict postshunt NPH symptom improvement.

Materials and Methods

Patients with NPH who underwent MRI before shunt placement at a single center (2014–2021) were identified. Twelve-month postshunt improvement in mRS, incontinence, gait, and cognition were retrospectively abstracted from clinical documentation. 3D deep residual neural networks were built on skull-stripped T2-weighted and FLAIR images. Predictions based on both sequences were fused by additional network layers. Patients from 2014–2019 were used for parameter optimization, while those from 2020–2021 were used for testing. Models were validated on an external validation data set from a second institution (n = 33).

Results

Of 249 patients, n = 201 and n = 185 were included in the T2-based and FLAIR-based models according to imaging availability. The combination of T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences offered the best performance in mRS and gait improvement predictions relative to models trained on imaging acquired by using only 1 sequence, with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) values of 0.7395 [0.5765–0.9024] for mRS and 0.8816 [0.8030–0.9602] for gait. For urinary incontinence and cognition, combined model performances on predicting outcomes were similar to FLAIR-only performance, with AUROC values of 0.7874 [0.6845–0.8903] and 0.7230 [0.5600–0.8859].

Conclusions

Application of a combined algorithm by using both T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences offered the best image-based prediction of postshunt symptom improvement, particularly for gait and overall function in terms of mRS.

### Three-day CSF drainage barely reduces ventricular size in normal pressure hydrocephalus [^116fR4uD]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

External lumbar drainage (ELD) of CSF is a test to determine the suitability of a shunt for patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), but its effect on ventricular volume is not known. This study investigates the effect of 3-day ELD of 500 mL on ventricular size and clinical features in patients with idiopathic NPH.

Methods

Fifteen patients were investigated in a 1.5-T MRI scanner before and after ELD. Ventricular volume was measured manually. Clinical features involved motor and cognitive functions, testing primarily gait and attention. Reduction in ventricular volume was correlated to total drain volume and clinical parameters. Statistical tests were nonparametric, and p < 0.05 was required for significance.

Results

Drain volume was 415 mL (median 470 mL, range 160–510 mL). Ventricular size was reduced in all patients, averaging 3.7 mL (SD 2.2 mL, p < 0.001), which corresponded to a 4.2% contraction. The ratio of volume contraction to drain volume was only 0.9%. Seven patients improved in gait and 6 in attention. Ventricular reduction and total drain volume correlated neither with improvement nor with each other. The 7 patients with the largest drain volumes (close to 500 mL), had ventricular changes varying from 1.3 to 7.5 mL.

Conclusions

Clinical improvement occurs in patients with NPH after ELD despite unaltered ventricles, suggesting that ventricular size is of little relevance for postshunt improvement or determining shunt function. The clinical effect provided by ELD, mimicking shunting, is probably related to the recurring CSF extractions rather than to the cumulative effect of the drainage on ventricular volume.

### The effect of shunt surgery on neuropsychological performance in normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117HZddV]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Predicting improvement

Since shunt surgery is an invasive procedure and patients are often elderly, it is important to identify factors which predict positive outcome following treatment. We found no significant effects of age, sex, or time between shunt and reassessment on outcome in the MMSE. However, this was an exploratory analysis and effects may be observed using other measures of cognitive or functional outcome.

### Placebo-controlled effectiveness of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus shunting: a randomized pilot trial [^113yzxdX]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was maximum gait velocity over 3 trials for a 10-m walk. Baseline gait velocity was measured within 6 week before surgery and at 4, 8, and 12 months after surgery. Quality control of this measure was ensured by site training and central gait laboratory review of gait test videos. Secondary outcome measures, including the MoCA, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire, Short Form, Beck Depression Inventory-second edition, Lawton Activities of Daily Living/Independent Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire, and modified Rankin Score scores, were administered at similar intervals. All outcome assessments were performed by trained, blinded evaluators. Adverse events collected included surgical complications, falls, and decreased cognitive function, and were monitored by an independent data and safety monitoring board.

Analysis

All effectiveness outcomes were assessed using an analysis of covariance, where a linear regression model was fit with 4-month gait velocity as the dependent outcome variable and assigned treatment arm as a predictor along with baseline gait velocity. Effectiveness evaluations used two-sided testing with type I error of 0.05. Significance assessment for the 2 prespecified secondary outcomes of effectiveness was controlled for multiple comparisons. The effect of delayed shunting (ie, differences between treatment arms in observed improvement after 4 to 8 months of active shunting) was evaluated using linear mixed models for outcome data over time. Complications were analyzed as binary outcomes.

### The effect of shunt surgery on neuropsychological performance in normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1145zim3]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Limitations and methodological considerations

We have not attempted to formally assess the risk of bias because of the difficult nature of determining what constitutes study quality in this area and so leave it to the reader to assess study quality if they wish to consider this issue.

Methodological differences across studies complicate interpretation of results. Variability within tests used meant that our analyses were limited to seven neuropsychological tests when others may show improvement following shunt surgery. Furthermore, higher level executive functions could not be assessed with the restricted set of tests used to date. Additionally, time between shunt and reassessment varied with 3, 6 and 12 month delays being used. Consistency here is pertinent as different patterns of improvement may be seen at different intervals. Improvement may be observed more readily at shorter intervals due to immediate effect of the shunt, whereas initial improvement may be missed at longer intervals due to effects of comorbid disorders or increasing age.

### Change of amyloid-β 1–42 toxic conformer ratio after cerebrospinal fluid diversion predicts long-term cognitive outcome in patients with idiopathic normal Pressure hydrocephalus [^115bwTXf]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Background:

Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) contributes to poor shunt responses. Amyloid-β 1–42 (Aβ 42) toxic conformer was recently identified with features of rapid oligomerization, strong neurotoxicity and synaptotoxicity.

Objective:

This observational study points to Aβ 42 toxic conformer as a biomarker for AD pathology and for poor postoperative prognosis in patients with iNPH.

Methods:

The first cohort consisted of patients with AD (n = 17) and iNPH (n = 17), and cognitively normal individuals (CN, n = 12). The second cohort, consisted of 51 patients with iNPH, was divided into two groups according to phosphorylated Tau (pTau) level (low- and high-pTau groups); the low-pTau group was further subdivided according to one-year postoperative change in Aβ 42 toxic conformer ratio (%) [Aβ42 toxic conformer/Aβ42×100] (decreased- and increased-conformer subgroups). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure pTau, Aβ 42, and Aβ 42 toxic conformer in cerebrospinal fluid. Outcomes were evaluated using neuropsychological tests one- and two-years postoperatively.

Results:

In the first cohort, Aβ 42 toxic conformer ratio in the iNPH group (10.8%) was significantly higher than that in the CN group (6.3%) and significantly lower than that in the AD group (17.2%). In the second cohort, the high-pTau group showed cognitive decline two-years postoperatively compared to baseline. However, the low-pTau group showed favorable outcomes one-year postoperatively; furthermore, the increased-conformer subgroup showed cognitive decline two-years postoperatively while the decreased-conformer subgroup maintained the improvement.

Conclusions:

Change in Aβ 42 toxic conformer ratio predicts long-term cognitive outcome in iNPH, even in the low-pTau group.
