## Question

Biosensors in hypertension.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about biosensors in hypertension, including definitions, types, mechanisms, clinical applications, benefits, limitations, and a practical, guideline-aligned implementation framework. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "biosensors" encompass in the hypertension domain. Then, I should categorize the main biosensor modalities and their operating principles. Next, I will examine clinical applications and the strength of evidence, followed by benefits and limitations. After that, I should align recommendations with current guidelines and propose an implementation framework. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically grounded conclusion and highlight research gaps and future directions.

> Let me first confirm the scope so I don't conflate terms. In this context, biosensors include both physiologic signal–based wearable or implantable devices that estimate blood pressure or related hemodynamics and biomarker-based sensors that detect circulating analytes relevant to hypertension pathophysiology; I should explicitly separate cuff-based validated home monitors from cuffless wearables and from implantable hemodynamic sensors, because their validation standards and clinical roles differ substantially [^116RaynD] [^115ssfZJ] [^111hz5D6].

> I will now examine the main categories and mechanisms. Cuffless wearable BP monitors typically rely on photoplethysmography, pulse transit time, or bioimpedance to estimate BP; PPG captures microvascular volume changes and is convenient but still maturing, PTT leverages the inverse relationship between pulse wave velocity and BP, and bioimpedance systems attempt to estimate vascular properties without cuffs; critically, many require calibration and have not met standardized validation criteria yet, so I need to be careful not to overstate their readiness for clinical decision-making [^113zma8J] [^1143pTKt] [^113QpogL]. Implantable hemodynamic biosensors, such as pulmonary artery pressure sensors adapted from heart failure care, provide direct pressure telemetry and have shown feasibility for remote hemodynamic monitoring, though evidence specific to hypertension management remains limited and invasive risks must be weighed [^112Rs66V]. Biomarker biosensors target circulating analytes like natriuretic peptides, microRNAs, or inflammatory markers; while promising for early detection and phenotyping, most are investigational and face sensitivity, specificity, and clinical integration challenges [^111hz5D6].

> Next, I should review clinical applications and the evidentiary strength. For diagnosis, validated home BP monitoring improves detection of white-coat and masked hypertension and refines risk stratification compared with office BP; however, I must emphasize that this applies to validated cuff-based devices, not cuffless wearables, which are not recommended for diagnostic use by major guidelines pending robust validation [^114X5meK] [^114B6giR] [^112pV6jv]. For monitoring and treatment adjustment, remote HBPM programs with clinician oversight improve control rates and can be integrated into telehealth workflows; again, device validation and structured protocols are key to realizing benefits [^116vGvRM] [^115bhXCG]. For risk stratification, continuous or frequent out-of-office BP profiles enable assessment of BP variability phenotypes linked to cardiovascular events, but I should confirm that most wearable-derived BPV metrics still require validation against outcome data before routine clinical adoption [^113oi6hi] [^116cvzjU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cuffless devices. I initially thought emerging wearables could immediately replace cuff-based methods for diagnosis, but wait, I need to verify guideline positions; both the 2023 ESH and the 2025 AHA/ACC/AANP guidelines explicitly advise against using cuffless devices for diagnosis or management until they demonstrate greater precision and reliability, so I should correct that assumption and frame cuffless technologies as investigational adjuncts rather than replacements [^114B6giR] [^112pV6jv] [^114zqEpA]. That said, some wrist-worn cuff-based devices and research prototypes show promise for frequent self-measurement, but limited public accuracy data and the need for recalibration temper enthusiasm; I should double-check that any device used clinically is validated to ISO standards and listed on reputable registries [^116vxpDC] [^117KtipH].

> I will now examine benefits. Compared with intermittent office readings, validated out-of-office monitoring improves diagnostic accuracy for hypertension phenotypes, enhances patient engagement, and can reduce measurement burden when automated data transfer is available; continuous or frequent monitoring also opens the door to assessing short-term and circadian BP variability, which may carry prognostic information beyond mean BP, though clinical utility is still being defined [^115ssfZJ] [^113oi6hi] [^116cvzjU]. Let me consider operational advantages too: telemonitoring with validated HBPM can streamline follow-up, support medication titration, and enable anticipatory guidance, but I should confirm that programs include education, feedback, and clinician review to sustain adherence and outcomes [^116vGvRM] [^115bhXCG].

> But wait, what about limitations and barriers. Accuracy and validation remain the foremost issues; thousands of devices lack independent validation, and many cuffless technologies fail to meet established protocols, risking misdiagnosis and inappropriate therapy; I need to ensure any device used clinically is validated against ISO standards and appears on accredited device lists [^117KtipH] [^112bsJEV]. Calibration drift, population variability, and algorithmic opacity in machine learning–based estimations further complicate adoption; equity and access disparities in device uptake and digital literacy also threaten to widen care gaps if not addressed proactively [^113QpogL] [^115xFKz7]. I should also note that while implantables offer direct hemodynamics, they require invasive placement and long-term safety data in hypertension cohorts are limited, so patient selection and shared decision-making are essential [^112Rs66V].

> Next, I should review guideline-aligned recommendations to anchor practice. Major guidelines converge on prioritizing validated cuff-based home or ambulatory BP monitoring for diagnosis and management, with explicit cautions against cuffless devices for clinical decision-making until validation standards are met; they also emphasize device validation, standardized measurement protocols, and integration with clinician oversight and telehealth workflows [^115ssfZJ] [^114B6giR] [^112pV6jv]. I need to ensure that any implementation plan aligns with these guardrails and documents device validation status transparently for patients and clinicians [^113SQoXx].

> Let me outline a practical implementation framework while keeping these constraints in mind. First, device selection should be limited to validated cuff-based monitors with automated data transfer; I should double-check validation against ISO standards and prefer devices with cloud connectivity to reduce transcription errors and support asynchronous review [^113SQoXx] [^117KtipH]. Second, patient education on proper cuff placement, rest-period timing, and measurement frequency is critical; I should confirm that programs provide written instructions and reinforce technique at follow-up to minimize user error [^111u5RNv]. Third, data integration into the EHR with clinician alerts for out-of-range values and structured review at visits improves clinical response and sustained use; telehealth visits can be leveraged for timely titration and behavioral support [^116vGvRM] [^115bhXCG]. Fourth, quality assurance should include periodic device accuracy checks, review of adherence to measurement schedules, and feedback to patients on trends and targets to close the loop on learning and behavior change [^117KtipH].

> I should also consider special populations and contexts. For older adults or those with limited digital literacy, simplified devices with large displays and minimal setup, or caregiver-assisted models, may improve uptake; for high-risk phenotypes such as nocturnal hypertension or resistant hypertension, validated HBPM with nocturnal capabilities or ABPM remains appropriate while wearable research continues; and in resource-limited settings, community-based validated HBPM programs can expand access while maintaining quality [^114tPFAx] [^111rNvYw]. Hold on, I should verify that any deviation from standard cuff-based methods is framed as research or adjunctive, not a substitute, to avoid inadvertently propagating unvalidated practice [^114B6giR].

> Let me synthesize the current state. Biosensors in hypertension span validated cuff-based home monitors, investigational cuffless wearables, implantable hemodynamic sensors, and biomarker assays; only validated cuff-based HBPM and ABPM are ready for routine clinical use, while cuffless technologies remain promising but unproven for diagnosis or therapeutic decision-making pending rigorous validation and outcome-linked evidence [^115ssfZJ] [^112pV6jv]. The most defensible near-term strategy is to scale validated HBPM with telehealth support, embed standardized protocols, and monitor emerging biosensor evidence for future integration once accuracy, clinical utility, and equity considerations are adequately addressed [^116vGvRM] [^112DwB5b].

> Finally, I need to ensure I identify research gaps and future directions. Standardized validation protocols tailored to cuffless technologies, studies linking wearable-derived BP variability metrics to hard outcomes, and head-to-head comparisons with ABPM are urgently needed; biomarker biosensors require multiplexed, clinically actionable panels and integration with decision support; and implementation science should address workflow integration, reimbursement, and equity to translate innovation into population-level BP control gains [^113QpogL] [^113oi6hi]. I should double-check that any pilot programs document outcomes, usability, and cost-effectiveness to build the evidence base for broader adoption [^notfound].

---

## Clinical applications of biosensors in hypertension

Biosensors have been applied in various clinical scenarios, including:

- **Early detection and diagnosis**: Continuous monitoring enables detection of masked hypertension, white-coat hypertension, and nocturnal hypertension, improving diagnostic accuracy [^114L36W8] [^114X5meK].

- **Personalized treatment**: Real-time data allows individualized therapy adjustments, optimizing medication timing and dosage to improve BP control [^1155NfFE].

- **Remote patient monitoring**: Biosensors facilitate telemedicine, enabling healthcare providers to monitor patients remotely, improve adherence, and reduce clinical inertia [^116vGvRM] [^116yGaGX].

- **Risk stratification**: Continuous monitoring of BP variability and nocturnal patterns aids in identifying high-risk patients and guiding interventions [^116cvzjU].

---

## Advantages of biosensors in hypertension management

Biosensors offer several advantages over traditional BP measurement methods:

- **Continuous monitoring**: Provides a comprehensive BP profile, capturing variability and nocturnal patterns missed by intermittent measurements [^114X5meK].

- **Non-invasive and minimally invasive options**: PPG and PTT devices offer non-invasive monitoring, while implantable sensors provide high accuracy with minimal patient discomfort [^116QBjoc].

- **Improved patient adherence**: Convenience and real-time feedback enhance patient engagement and adherence to treatment [^116ZJmwL].

- **Early detection of complications**: Continuous monitoring enables early identification of hypertensive crises and target organ damage, facilitating timely interventions [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite their potential, biosensors face several limitations and challenges:

- **Accuracy and validation**: Many biosensors, particularly cuffless devices, lack standardized validation protocols, raising concerns about measurement accuracy and reliability [^113QpogL] [^117KtipH].

- **Calibration and drift**: Continuous monitoring devices often require frequent calibration and are susceptible to signal drift, affecting accuracy over time [^113QpogL].

- **Clinical integration**: Incorporating biosensor data into clinical workflows and electronic health records remains a challenge, requiring robust data management systems [^111kzhSZ] [^116RaynD].

- **Cost and accessibility**: High costs and limited access, particularly in low-resource settings, hinder widespread adoption [^114X5meK] [^1152rBrn].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **validated, cuff-based devices** for hypertension diagnosis and management [^113SQoXx]. The European Society of Hypertension (ESH) and the American Heart Association (AHA) **recommend against using cuffless devices** for clinical decision-making until they demonstrate greater precision and reliability [^114B6giR] [^112pV6jv]. However, they acknowledge the **potential of biosensors** and encourage continued research and development [^113QpogL] [^112pV6jv].

---

## Future directions and research opportunities

Future research should focus on:

- **Standardization and validation**: Developing standardized protocols for biosensor validation to ensure accuracy and reliability [^1152rBrn].

- **Integration with AI and machine learning**: Leveraging AI to enhance data analysis, predict hypertensive events, and personalize treatment strategies [^112SRJ3y] [^117NreAr].

- **Miniaturization and wearable technology**: Advancing miniaturized, wearable devices for continuous, non-invasive monitoring [^1155NfFE].

- **Equitable access**: Addressing disparities in access to biosensor technologies through policy initiatives and cost-effective solutions [^115xFKz7] [^113Snstz].

---

Biosensors are poised to **revolutionize hypertension management** by enabling continuous, non-invasive monitoring and real-time data for personalized therapy. While challenges remain, ongoing research and development are expected to overcome these limitations, paving the way for widespread clinical adoption.

### Controversy in hypertension: pro-side of the argument using artificial intelligence for hypertension diagnosis and management [^115bJZdv]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension presents the largest modifiable public health challenge due to its high prevalence, its intimate relationship to cardiovascular diseases, and its complex pathogenesis and pathophysiology. Low awareness of blood pressure elevation and suboptimal hypertension diagnosis serve as the major hurdles in effective hypertension management. Advances in artificial intelligence in hypertension have permitted the integrative analysis of large data sets including omics, clinical (with novel sensor and wearable technologies), health-related, social, behavioral, and environmental sources, and hold transformative potential in achieving large-scale, data-driven approaches toward personalized diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management. However, although the emerging artificial intelligence science may advance the concept of precision hypertension in discovery, drug targeting and development, patient care, and management, its clinical adoption at scale today is lacking. Recognizing that clinical implementation of artificial intelligence-based solutions need evidence generation, this opinion statement examines a clinician-centric perspective of the state-of-art in using artificial intelligence in the management of hypertension and puts forward recommendations toward equitable precision hypertension care.

### Digital hypertension-what we need for the high-quality management of hypertension in the new era [^114DSG2q]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Digital technologies are playing an increasing role in hypertension management. Digital hypertension is a new field that integrates advancing technologies into hypertension management. This research area encompasses various aspects of digital transformation technologies, including the development of novel blood pressure (BP) measurement devices-whether cuffless or cuff-based sensors-the transmission of large-scale time-series BP data, cloud-based computing and analysis of BP indices, presentation of the results, and feedback systems for both patients and physicians. A key component of this approach is novel blood pressure (BP) monitoring devices. This article summarizes the latest information and discussions about "held at the 2024 Japan Society of Hypertension scientific meeting. Novel BP monitoring includes cuffless devices that estimate BP, but cuffless devices require achieving accuracy without the need for calibration using conventional cuff-based devices. New BP monitoring devices can provide information on novel biomarkers beyond BP and may improve risk assessment and outcomes. Integration of BP data with omics and clinical information should enable personalized hypertension management. Key data gaps relating to novel BP monitoring devices are accuracy/validation in different settings/populations, association between BP metrics and hard clinical outcomes, and measurement/interpretation of BP variability data. Human- and health system-related factors also need to be addressed or overcome before these devices can be successfully integrated into routine clinical practice. If these things can be achieved, new BP monitoring technologies could transform hypertension management and play a pivotal role in the future of remote healthcare. This article summarizes the latest information and discussions about digital hypertension from the Digital Hypertension symposium that took place during the 2024 Japan Society of Hypertension scientific meeting.

### Efficiency of remote monitoring and guidance in blood pressure management: a randomized controlled trial: the role of remote monitoring in improving hypertension management [^1138sWKM]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a cardiovascular syndrome characterised by elevated systemic arterial pressure, which damages the structure and function of vital organs, including the heart, brain, and kidneys, ultimately leading to their failure. Hypertension is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality worldwide. According to a 2019 report, hypertension is the leading cause of death among women and the second leading cause among men, and is responsible for approximately 11 million deaths globally. Despite effective treatments, hypertension management and control remain inadequate, with poor patient compliance and clinical inertia being common problems. Digital health technologies such as remote monitoring, wearables, and mobile health platforms are increasingly becoming important tools in hypertension management.

Medical workers often monitor patients' blood pressure (BP) in the following three ways. 1) Usual care primarily involves repeated office BP (OBP) measurements, which remain the most common approach for long-term management of hypertension. However, continuous monitoring of a patient's BP is not feasible. Additionally, the clinical setting may induce tension and anxiety in patients, potentially leading to 'white coat hypertension' (WCH). This ultimately leads to misdiagnosis and overtreatment. The European Society of Hypertension guidelines recommend that patients with suspected WCH undergo home or ambulatory BP monitoring to confirm the diagnosis. 2) Self-monitoring can reflect the BP level in patients'daily lives better than OBP, but measurement errors can occur in different brands and models of BP monitors. Some patients may be unable to correctly operate the BP monitor or understand the readings. However, studies have indicated that isolated self-monitoring in itself did not improve BP control but was effective when combined with other interventions. 3) Remote monitoring enables patients to track their BP at home in a regular and quantitative manner. After each measurement, BP data is automatically uploaded, and in cases of abnormal BP, an immediate telephone follow-up is conducted to check for hypertension-related symptoms. Based on this consultation, the patient is advised to promptly seek medical care or adjust their medications.

XIII. BEHAVIOURAL INTERVENTIONS, DIGITAL HEALTH AND WEARABLES

What is known and what is new?

Behavioural intervention is an effective approach for the treatment of CVD. A recent large-scale systematic review, including 150 RCTs identified the clinically supervised Patient Self-Management Support, frequently based on Wagner's Chronic Care Model, the most dominant intervention method. Importantly, many chronic illnesses share the same modifiable behavioural lifestyle risk factors.

Behavioural habits known to modulate cardiovascular risk and BP control include oral hygiene practices as both dental care access and periodontitis are independently linked to hypertension and target organ damage. This relationship is independent of socioeconomic status.

The use of digital technologies for prevention and/or treatment of health conditions, termed digital health interventions, is an emerging and promising approach to support people with hypertension.

Recent studies showed clinically modest but significant effects of digital interventions to reduce SBP, improve medication adherence and lifestyle behavioural changes longer term.

Use of personalization through digital health (e.g. electronic health records or mobile devices to support health practices) interventions can, especially aid in the delivery of timely precision medicine strategies and be delivered directly by the healthcare practitioner and/or digitally, through the utilization of end-user manual inputs and/or digital system-derived inputs.

Providing a dynamic and adaptive hypertensive digital intervention into the future that can adjust its responses when the individual changes (in real-time) should better facilitate behaviour change outcomes. Additionally, antihypertensive digital interventions that can minimize the amount of manual end-user input may also increase patient adherence, especially through the consistent use of validated digital wearables to support and maintain lifestyle modifications. There is, however, a need to ensure that any digital BP device has its accuracy validated, and we caution the use of unvalidated devices.

Importantly, digital health approaches should not supplant the role of clinicians but are tools that clinicians and patients can use to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical objectives. Digital health platforms enable the efficient exchange of clinical data and clinician–patient interactions to achieve effective lifestyle modifications.

International perspective

Behaviour change techniques are included in the medical curriculum for healthcare providers in many countries reinforcing the importance of chronic illnesses burden control through effective population-based intervention programs.

The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention websites contain a large compendium of local and global studies centred on the benefits of behavioural interventions upon modifiable risk factors for chronic disease prevalence and outcomes.

Results

HBPM offers significant advantages, such as improved patient adherence, more accurate blood pressure data, and better long-term hypertension control. However, challenges remain, including standardization issues, variability in device accuracy, and integration with digital health systems. Emerging technologies, such as AI-driven analytics and smartphone-connected devices, are expected to enhance HBPM in the near future.

Conclusions

HBPM represents a transformative approach to hypertension management, with emerging wearable and AI-enhanced technologies poised to revolutionize blood pressure monitoring, though wider clinical adoption requires improved standardization and validation protocols.

### Management of hypertension in the digital era: small wearable monitoring devices for remote blood pressure monitoring [^113kFsq1]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Excessive morning BP surge has been associated with increased stroke risk, cerebral hemorrhage, and a variety of forms of target organ damage. – In addition, both nocturnal hypertension and a nondipper/riser pattern identified on ABPM have been shown to increase the risk of target organ damage and cardiovascular events. – This means that accurate detection of perturbations in the BP profile and any associated triggers is important to reduce cardiovascular risk and the occurrence of adverse cardiovascular events. Wearable devices with beat-by-beat monitoring and sensors to determine environmental conditions are ideally suited to fulfill this role as part of the overall management of patients with hypertension.

Pathophysiological mechanism of PH

PH exhibits significant heterogeneity and can be categorized into five types based on etiology and prognosis, including PAH, PH due to left heart disease, PH due to lung diseases or hypoxia, chronic thromboembolic PH, and PH due to other factors. The key pathophysiological changes include vascular remodeling, perivascular inflammation, and microthrombus formation. Understanding the classification and pathophysiological mechanisms of PH is crucial for developing targeted biomarkers that facilitate early diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and personalized therapy. It also propels the advancement of related biosensing technologies.

### Innovations in blood pressure measurement and reporting technology: international society of hypertension position paper endorsed by the World Hypertension League, European Society of Hypertension, Asian pacific society of hypertension, and latin American society of hypertension [^116RaynD]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) is a key contributor to the lifetime risk of preclinical organ damage and cardiovascular disease. Traditional clinic-based BP readings are typically measured infrequently and under standardized/resting conditions and therefore do not capture BP values during normal everyday activity. Therefore, current hypertension guidelines emphasize the importance of incorporating out-of-office BP measurement into strategies for hypertension diagnosis and management. However, conventional home and ambulatory BP monitoring devices use the upper-arm cuff oscillometric method and only provide intermittent BP readings under static conditions or in a limited number of situations. New innovations include technologies for BP estimation based on processing of sensor signals supported by artificial intelligence tools, technologies for remote monitoring, reporting and storage of BP data, and technologies for BP data interpretation and patient interaction designed to improve hypertension management ("digital therapeutics"). The number and volume of data relating to new devices/technologies is increasing rapidly and will continue to grow. This International Society of Hypertension position paper describes the new devices/technologies, presents evidence relating to new BP measurement techniques and related indices, highlights standard for the validation of new devices/technologies, discusses the reliability and utility of novel BP monitoring devices, the association of these metrics with clinical outcomes, and the use of digital therapeutics. It also highlights the challenges and evidence gaps that need to be overcome before these new technologies can be considered as a user-friendly and accurate source of novel BP data to inform clinical hypertension management strategies.

### Management of hypertension in the digital era: small wearable monitoring devices for remote blood pressure monitoring [^1126DtnY]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Out-of-office blood pressure measurement is an essential part of diagnosing and managing hypertension. In the era of advanced digital health information technology, the approach to achieving this is shifting from traditional methods (ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring) to wearable devices and technology. Wearable blood pressure monitors allow frequent blood pressure measurements (ideally continuous beat-by-beat monitoring of blood pressure) with minimal stress on the patient. It is expected that wearable devices will dramatically change the quality of detection and management of hypertension by increasing the number of measurements in different situations, allowing accurate detection of phenotypes that have a negative impact on cardiovascular prognosis, such as masked hypertension and abnormal blood pressure variability. Frequent blood pressure measurements and the addition of new features such as monitoring of environmental conditions allows interpretation of blood pressure data in the context of daily stressors and different situations. This new digital approach to hypertension contributes to anticipation medicine, which refers to strategies designed to identify increasing risk and predict the onset of cardiovascular events based on a series of data collected over time, allowing proactive interventions to reduce risk. To achieve this, further research and validation is required to develop wearable blood pressure monitoring devices that provide the same accuracy as current approaches and can effectively contribute to personalized medicine.

### Artificial intelligence to improve blood pressure control: a state-of-the-art review [^112SRJ3y]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension remains a major global health challenge, contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming hypertension care by enhancing blood pressure (BP) measurement, risk assessment, and personalized treatment. AI-powered technologies have the potential to enable accurate non-invasive BP monitoring and facilitate tailored lifestyle modifications, enhancing adherence and outcomes. ML models can also predict hypertension risk based on demographic, lifestyle, and clinical data, enabling earlier intervention and prevention strategies. However, challenges such as the lack of standardized validation protocols and potential biases in AI systems may widen health disparities. Future research must prioritize rigorous validation across diverse populations and ensure algorithm transparency. By leveraging AI responsibly, we can revolutionize hypertension management, enhance health equity, and improve cardiovascular outcomes.

### Advances and applications of biosensors in pulmonary hypertension [^116ain58]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

PH is a condition characterized by increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries due to various factors, leading to increased strain on the right side of the heart, which can ultimately result in heart failure and death. According to the latest diagnostic criteria, PH is defined by a mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 20 mmHg measured during a right heart catheterization. In addition, a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) greater than 2.0 Wood units is also used for diagnosis and prognosis. Currently, at least 1% of the world's population is affected by PH, and the incidence rate continues to rise annually, with a high mortality rate. Early identification and management are crucial for improving patient prognosis, but early diagnosis is challenging, and many patients are in the advanced stages of the disease at the time of diagnosis. Therefore, finding new diagnostic methods has become one of the hot topics in PH research.

Biosensors are analytical tools that combine biological recognition materials with transducers, and their working principle is based on the interaction between the biological recognition elements and target molecules. When target molecules bind to the biological recognition elements, certain physical or chemical changes occur, leading to changes in the signal. The transducer then converts this signal into an electrical signal or other measurable signals, and the results are obtained after information processing. According to their structure and working principles, biosensors include electrochemical biosensors, optical biosensors, microfluidic biosensors, and wireless biosensors. In recent years, with the use of nanomaterials, the sensitivity, selectivity, and detection speed of biosensors have been continuously improved, showing great potential in disease diagnosis and monitoring.

Early diagnosis and real-time monitoring of PH have always been clinical challenges. Traditional diagnostic methods such as echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, and blood tests have certain limitations. Biosensors offer rapid, convenient, and non-invasive detection methods, making them significant for the early diagnosis and treatment monitoring of PH. In this article, we review the pathophysiological mechanisms of PH and related biomarkers. Additionally, we summarize the applications and recent advancements of biosensors in PH, as well as the existing difficulties and challenges, aiming to provide better insights for clinicians and researchers and to promote the further development of related technologies.

### A heart-to-heart with chatGPT: AI applications in hypertension [^117DDdhJ]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a major global health concern, contributing to cardiovascular disease, stroke, and kidney failure and affecting approximately 1.28 billion people worldwide. Despite increases in awareness and treatment rates, questions remain in the management of hypertension and its complications. For example, what are the most effective antihypertensive medications for specific patient populations (e.g. elderly, individuals with kidney disease)? What are the optimal thresholds for starting and stopping antihypertensive agents? How should treatment goals be individualized based on patient factors like cardiovascular risk and age? These challenges remain despite decades of dedicated hypertension research because, in large part, of the heterogeneity in disease phenotype, with contributing factors including age, sex, body mass index, lipid profiles, personal habits (e.g. stress, smoking, physical activity, etc.), socioeconomic status, environment, and genetics. Further complicating the matter is that hypertension often co-occurs with other health conditions like diabetes or kidney disease, making it difficult to isolate the effects of hypertension alone.

With its inherent complexity, hypertension is an ideal field where artificial intelligence (AI) can make a breakthrough. AI is particularly adept in identifying patterns and regularity in a dataset, allowing it to make predictions or classifications based on the observed patterns in the data. Essentially, it's the underlying structure or relationship within data that an AI algorithm can learn and use to make informed decisions. As such, AI is increasingly impacting our daily lives, in commerce, entertainment, finance, law, and education, as well as in medicine. Indeed, as we will discuss below, AI has emerged as a transformative force in hypertension research, diagnosis, treatment, and patient care. AI-driven technologies have enhanced diagnostic accuracy, streamlined treatment plans, and improved patient outcomes. This article explores the impact of AI on hypertension, detailing its role in predictive analytics, personalized medicine, remote monitoring, and clinical decision support.

### Wearable technology and the cardiovascular system: the future of patient assessment [^112c8VSk]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2023). High credibility.

The past decade has seen a dramatic rise in consumer technologies able to monitor a variety of cardiovascular parameters. Such devices initially recorded markers of exercise, but now include physiological and health-care focused measurements. The public are keen to adopt these devices in the belief that they are useful to identify and monitor cardiovascular disease. Clinicians are therefore often presented with health app data accompanied by a diverse range of concerns and queries. Herein, we assess whether these devices are accurate, their outputs validated, and whether they are suitable for professionals to make management decisions. We review underpinning methods and technologies and explore the evidence supporting the use of these devices as diagnostic and monitoring tools in hypertension, arrhythmia, heart failure, coronary artery disease, pulmonary hypertension, and valvular heart disease. Used correctly, they might improve health care and support research.

### Advances and applications of biosensors in pulmonary hypertension [^113pcdWK]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a serious disease characterized by elevated pulmonary artery pressure, with its prevalence and incidence continuously increasing, posing a threat to the lives of many patients worldwide. Due to the complex etiology of PH and the lack of specificity in clinical manifestations, there is currently a lack of effective and specific methods for early diagnosis in clinical practice. Biosensors hold significant promise for the early detection, therapeutic monitoring, prognostic evaluation, and personalized treatment of PH, owing to their rapid, sensitive, and highly selective characteristics. The rapid development of various types of biosensors, such as electrochemical biosensors, optical biosensors, microfluidic biosensors, and wireless biosensors, combined with the use of nanomaterials, makes the rapid and accurate detection of PH-related biomarkers possible. Despite the broad application prospects of biosensors in the field of PH, challenges remain in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and regulation. This article reviews the main pathophysiological mechanisms and commonly used biomarkers of PH, the types and principles of biosensors, and summarizes the progress of biosensors in PH research as well as the current challenges, in order to promote further in-depth research and the development of biosensor technology, thereby improving the diagnosis and treatment effects of PH. Clinical trial number: Not applicable.

Wireless wearable biosensors

Wireless wearable biosensors offer innovative solutions for PH management, with their core value lying in real-time monitoring of physiological parameters. This capability provides objective data for assessing patients' activity capacity and cardiovascular function, aiding clinical judgment in disease severity evaluation, treatment efficacy monitoring, and personalized therapeutic decision-making. These devices can non-invasively monitor multiple physiological indicators including heart rate, heart rate variability, respiratory rate, arterial oxygen saturation, thoracic fluid content, and blood pressure. When integrated with accelerometers and inertial measurement units (IMUs), they can record activity metrics such as step count, exercise intensity, and duration. These devices can be positioned at various body locations (wrist, hip, thigh, chest) to capture diverse mobility data. Research demonstrates that remote 6MWT using chest-worn accelerometers combined with heart rate monitoring are feasible and safe, enabling objective assessment of exercise tolerance in PH patients while providing supplementary approaches for telemedicine and therapeutic research. Although current smart wearables show potential in cardiovascular disease management, technical and clinical integration challenges remain. With advancements in sensor and computational technologies, future development should focus on refining evaluation frameworks and regulatory policies to enhance clinical adoption, promote telemedicine advancement, and reduce healthcare costs.

### Management of hypertension in the digital era: small wearable monitoring devices for remote blood pressure monitoring [^117PjX9A]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

While it is clear that wearable BP technologies have the potential to provide the types of data likely to be useful in developing cardiovascular risk reduction strategies, additional research is needed to determine whether more frequent and continuous monitoring using small wearable devices provides prognostic information that can be used to reduce cardiovascular event rates in clinical practice.

In conclusion, currently available data indicate that digital management of hypertension and wearable BP monitoring technology are the way of the future. These approaches make the aim of reducing, or even eliminating, the occurrence of cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension a realistic possibility. Using these approaches, it is possible to assess all types of BPV simultaneously, enabling a paradigm shift from BP management based on dots to seamless individualized anticipation medication for zero cardiovascular events. Smartphone apps are not yet useful in this setting, and none have currently been approved by the US FDA or European Commission. However, recent research shows that wearable devices produced by companies specializing in BP monitoring technology are validated and reliable, opening the way for their use in clinical practice. Wrist-worn wearable devices have also been shown to perform well against current out-of-office BP measurement approaches. Initial data suggest that wearable technology could also be useful for detecting arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation.

The next important question is how best to incorporate the new technologies into clinical practice for both physicians and patients. Lower levels of technology literacy in some older patients may limit the usefulness of these approaches in an important subset of the population with hypertension, and this is something that needs to be considered as part of device development and implementation. Nevertheless, wearable BP monitoring technology is a promising and exciting field. Both current and future developments will ensure that wearable technologies become user-friendly, reliable, accurate, and flexible to provide real-time data to facilitate risk factor modification for the prevention of cardiovascular events.

### Digital hypertension towards to the anticipation medicine [^113nXWjJ]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

"Digital Hypertension" is a new research field proposed by the Japanese Society of Hypertension that integrates digital technology into hypertension management and proactively promotes research activities. This novel approach includes the development of new technologies for better BP management, such as sensors for detecting environmental factors that affect BP, information processing, and machine learning. To facilitate "Digital Hypertension", a more sophisticated BP monitoring system capable of measuring an individual's BP more frequently in various situations would be required. With the use of these technologies, hypertension management could shift from the current "dots" management based on office BP readings during clinic visits to a "line" management system based on seamless home BP or individual BP data taken by a wearable BP monitoring device. DTx is the innovation to change hypertension management from "dots" to "line", completely achieved by wearable BP.

Introduction

Wearable devices are increasingly being identified as a strategy to improve the detection and management of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Moreover, the availability and use of wearable devices has increased over the past decade, especially for health monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. These devices, commonly including fitness bands and smartwatches, are electronic devices worn on or around the body, containing specialized sensors for monitoring user physiology. Wearable devices are commonly used for activity, heart rate, and sleep tracking. More sophisticated wearable devices allow electrocardiographic, and blood pressuremonitoring and can provide cost-effective methods for screening of cardiac arrhythmias, management of hypertension, and other clinical and lifestyle interventions.

While regulatory bodies and clinical societies increasingly endorse wearable device use in clinical care, we need to evaluate whether current patterns of uptake of these devices would allow their use for improving cardiovascular (CV) care at the national level and the implications of their use for health equity. First, it is critical to identify the demographic patterns of wearable device uptake and potential disparities across sociodemographic subgroups. Second, to evaluate their role as a key technology that supports health care, it is pertinent to assess the consistency of their use and whether users would be willing to share data with their clinicians (referred to as health care providers in the survey). There is limited nationally representative information on the users of wearable devices, their use practices, and their interest in sharing this information. Accordingly, in a nationally representative cross-sectional study of US adults in 2019 to 2020, we assessed the use of wearable devices across CV risk groups and evaluated patterns of use across key demographic and socioeconomic subgroups.

### Wearable blood pressure measurement devices and new approaches in hypertension management: the digital era [^111P34zf]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Out-of-office blood pressure (BP) measurement is considered an integral component of the diagnostic algorithm and management of hypertension. In the era of digitalization, a great deal of wearable BP measuring devices has been developed. These digital blood pressure monitors allow frequent BP measurements with minimal annoyance to the patient while they do promise radical changes regarding the diagnostic accuracy, as the importance of making an accurate diagnosis of hypertension has become evident. By increasing the number of BP measurements in different conditions, these monitors allow accurate identification of different clinical phenotypes, such as masked hypertension and pathological BP variability, that seem to have a negative impact on cardiovascular prognosis. Frequent measurements of BP and the incorporation of new features in BP variability, both enable well-rounded interpretation of BP data in the context of real-life settings. This article is a review of all different technologies and wearable BP monitoring devices.

### Transforming hypertension diagnosis and management in the era of artificial intelligence: a 2023 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) workshop report [^117NreAr]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is among the most important risk factors for cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and dementia. The artificial intelligence (AI) field is advancing quickly, and there has been little discussion on how AI could be leveraged for improving the diagnosis and management of hypertension. AI technologies, including machine learning tools, could alter the way we diagnose and manage hypertension, with potential impacts for improving individual and population health. The development of successful AI tools in public health and health care systems requires diverse types of expertise with collaborative relationships between clinicians, engineers, and data scientists. Unbiased data sources, management, and analyses remain a foundational challenge. From a diagnostic standpoint, machine learning tools may improve the measurement of blood pressure and be useful in the prediction of incident hypertension. To advance the management of hypertension, machine learning tools may be useful to find personalized treatments for patients using analytics to predict response to antihypertension medications and the risk for hypertension-related complications. However, there are real-world implementation challenges to using AI tools in hypertension. Herein, we summarize key findings from a diverse group of stakeholders who participated in a workshop held by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in March 2023. Workshop participants presented information on communication gaps between clinical medicine, data science, and engineering in health care; novel approaches to estimating BP, hypertension risk, and BP control; and real-world implementation challenges and issues.

### Lancet commission on hypertension group position statement on the global improvement of accuracy standards for devices that measure blood pressure [^117KtipH]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The Lancet Commission on Hypertension identified that a key action to address the worldwide burden of high blood pressure (BP) was to improve the quality of BP measurements by using BP devices that have been validated for accuracy. Currently, there are over 3000 commercially available BP devices, but many do not have published data on accuracy testing according to established scientific standards. This problem is enabled through weak or absent regulations that allow clearance of devices for commercial use without formal validation. In addition, new BP technologies have emerged (e.g. cuffless sensors) for which there is no scientific consensus regarding BP measurement accuracy standards. Altogether, these issues contribute to the widespread availability of clinic and home BP devices with limited or uncertain accuracy, leading to inappropriate hypertension diagnosis, management and drug treatment on a global scale. The most significant problems relating to the accuracy of BP devices can be resolved by the regulatory requirement for mandatory independent validation of BP devices according to the universally-accepted International Organisation for Standardization Standard. This is a primary recommendation for which there is an urgent international need. Other key recommendations are development of validation standards specifically for new BP technologies and online lists of accurate devices that are accessible to consumers and health professionals. Recommendations are aligned with WHO policies on medical devices and universal healthcare. Adherence to recommendations would increase the global availability of accurate BP devices and result in better diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, thus decreasing the worldwide burden from high BP.

### Advances and applications of biosensors in pulmonary hypertension [^112Rs66V]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Implantable hemodynamic biosensors

Biosensors have been less studied in PH but show great potential. Implantable hemodynamic sensors, which integrate electrochemical sensors with wireless sensing technology, hold great promise in the management of PH. By detecting parameters such as blood flow velocity, pressure, and vascular resistance, these sensors can assist physicians in assessing changes in patient conditions, monitoring therapeutic effects, and adjusting treatment plans more precisely. This allows for the optimization of drug dosages to achieve better symptom control and disease management. Implantable monitoring devices have been used in patients with chronic heart failure, post-cardiac surgery, and after implantation of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), and are being considered for use in patients with PH.

The CardioMEMS™ HF system is an implantable hemodynamic monitor that was previously used only in NYHA Class III heart failure patients and has shown good safety. The CardioMEMS device is a percutaneously delivered pressure sensor placed in the branch of the pulmonary artery and continuously monitored remotely via a wireless detection system for pulmonary artery pressure. The sensor collects hemodynamic data, including pulmonary artery pressure waveforms, heart rate, and systolic, diastolic, and mean pulmonary artery pressures, which can be securely transmitted to the doctor's clinic, hospital, or patient's home. The hemodynamic parameters measured by the CardioMEMS system are correlated with the distance of the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), indicating that these parameters can serve as early indicators of treatment response. By providing daily cardiovascular measurement data through the CardioMEMS system, doctors can remotely monitor disease progression, guide treatment, and detect or prevent early decompensation. Although the CardioMEMS device is not specifically designed for PH, it is valuable for real-time monitoring of pulmonary artery pressure in PH patients, especially when estimating cardiac output. However, before it can be widely used to guide the treatment of patients with severe PH and right heart failure, larger clinical trials are needed.

EMERGING NEW BLOOD PRESSURE DEVICE METHODS AND TECHNOLOGIES

Clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hypertension have been developed based on evidence from auscultation or oscillometric arm cuff BP devices, which remain the recommended standard for clinical practice. These methods rely on analysis of haemodynamic signals in the brachial artery, which were originally believed to be a good estimate of the central aortic pressure load as the most clinically relevant BP. In reality, cuff BP devices vary greatly as to whether the measurements represent central aortic or even brachial BP, and there may be large individual variation in the SBP at the central aorta compared with the brachial artery (e.g. difference > 30 mmHg). There are a variety of devices available that purport to measure central aortic BP, as distinct from standard cuff BP. However, beyond recommendations of professional societies, there are no regulatory standards to assess performance of these devices.

There is also a burgeoning of new BP measurement technologies that seek to measure BP in entirely different ways than cuff BP. These include different types of cuffless sensors at various arterial sites (e.g. chest, face, upper arm, wrist, finger) with continuous or 'snapshot' monitoring of BP using a variety of direct or indirect recording and signal processing methods (e.g. reflectance pulse oximetry, radio frequency sensors, microstructure strain gauge fibres, opto-electronic, applanation tonometry, pulse transit time, smartphone applications) over durations that may extend to weeks or months, and may incorporate software programs with clinical decision-support functionality. Some of these methods are not user-friendly and many still rely on calibration to a conventional cuff-based BP measurement, which are limiting features. Nonetheless, this is an evolving field with major opportunities to improve hypertension evaluation and control, and also to advance systems of healthcare delivery by merging with electronic medical records. However, these diverse technologies also pose new regulatory challenges in providing suitable oversight regarding clinical performance, accuracy, safety and utility.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^114X5meK]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring — comparative advantages, limitations, and roles: Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) enable identification of white-coat and masked hypertension, and should be regarded as complementary rather than absolute alternatives. HBPM is much cheaper and more available and provides multiple measurements over several days or longer, but typical HBPM devices do not capture routine daily activities or sleep, although techniques are being developed for nocturnal BP. ABPM advantages include stronger prognostic evidence, night-time readings, measurement in real-life settings, additional prognostic BP phenotypes, and abundant information including short-term BP variability, but devices can be expensive/limited in availability and uncomfortable. HBPM advantages include identification of white-coat/masked hypertension, low cost and wide availability, home-setting measurement, patient engagement, and easy repetition over longer periods to assess day-to-day BP variability, but only static BP is available, with potential measurement error and no nocturnal readings.

### Hypertension as a hemodynamic disease: the role of impedance cardiography in diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic decision making [^116J3ePu]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular disease, affecting approximately 60 million Americans. Despite the importance of this condition, only the minority of patients are appropriately identified and treated to reach recommended blood pressure (BP) goals. Although historically defined as an elevation of BP alone, hypertension is characterized by abnormalities of cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, and arterial compliance. These hemodynamic aspects of hypertension have implications for diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment. Impedance cardiography (ICG) has emerged as a unique and highly accurate noninvasive tool that is used to assess hemodynamic parameters. Measurement of the various hemodynamic components using ICG in those with hypertension allows more complete characterization of the condition, a greater ability to identify those at highest risk, and allows more effectively targeted drug management. This article reviews the importance of hemodynamic factors in hypertension and the evolving role of ICG technology in the assessment and management of this important cardiovascular condition.

### Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to diagnose and manage hypertension [^111GSPCw]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and Perspectives

Forty years of research consolidated ambulatory BP monitoring as the technique of choice to measure BP. What from a clinical viewpoint matters most is the level of the 24-hour and the nighttime BP. Other BP indexes derived from 24-hour ambulatory BP recordings, such as the night-to-day BP ratio, dipping status, the morning BP surge,24-hour pulse pressure, the double-product, and BP variability, add little to risk stratification on top of the 24-hour and nighttime BP level. A starting research line is the development of a standardized validation protocol for wearable BP monitoring devices. The wearable devices are cuffless and more comfortable for patients but represent a challenge for validation, for which experts in the field must develop standardized protocols producing repeatable results allowing inter-device comparisons.

### Innovative remote management solutions for the control of hypertension [^117Vb1dG]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

We stand at a critical juncture in the delivery of health care for hypertension. Blood pressure control rates have stagnated, and traditional health care is failing. Fortunately, hypertension is exceptionally well-suited to remote management, and innovative digital solutions are proliferating. Early strategies arose with the spread of digital medicine, long before the COVID-19 pandemic forced lasting changes to the way medicine is practiced. Highlighting one contemporary example, this review explores salient features of remote management hypertensive programs, including: an automated algorithm to guide clinical decisions, home (as opposed to office) blood pressure measurements, an interdisciplinary care team, and robust information technology and analytics. Dozens of emerging hypertension management solutions are contributing to a highly fragmented and competitive landscape. Beyond viability, profit and scalability are critical. We explore the challenges impeding large-scale acceptance of these programs and conclude with a hopeful look to the future when remote hypertension care will have dramatic impact on global cardiovascular health.

### Machine learning and artificial intelligence for research on hypertension [^116vGBrC]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension continues to be the leading modifiable risk factor for mortality globally, contributing significantly to cardiovascular disease. According to the World Health Organization, hypertension affects an estimated 1.28 billion adults globally, yet nearly half of these individuals are unaware of their condition, and many remain untreated or inadequately managed1. The American Heart Association (AHA) 2017 Hypertension Guidelines define hypertension as blood pressure (BP) ≥ 130/80 mmHg and recommend a target BP of < 130–140/80 mmHg for most adults. Effective management of hypertension is crucial in reducing morbidity and mortality, and current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of early detection, lifestyle modifications, and pharmacological treatment to mitigate long-term health risks. With the recent development and advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), the landscape for hypertension care and research is evolving at an accelerating pace to improve health outcomes worldwide.

### Management of hypertension in the digital era: small wearable monitoring devices for remote blood pressure monitoring [^115eaBHD]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Out-of-office blood pressure (BP) determined using ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and/or home BP monitoring (HBPM) is recommended for the diagnosis of hypertension in major international guidelines. – Home and/or ambulatory BP readings have been shown to provide better prognostic information about target organ damage and cardiovascular risk than measurement of office BP. – However, current approaches to ABPM and HBPM also have a number of well-known limitations, including patient comfort, sleep disturbance, availability, and cost. –

Newer information and communication technology (ICT)-based strategies provide options and solutions for self-monitoring of BP. These are designed to make it easier for patients to continuously monitor BP in a way that maximizes adherence. This approach has the potential to facilitate what has been defined as perfect 24-hour BP control: average 24-hour BP < 130/80 mm Hg; normal circadian BP rhythm (including adequate dipping of nocturnal BP); and adequate BP variability (BPV). However, the vast majority are unregulated and unvalidated. There is therefore a need for more scientifically based and validated approaches to wearable BP technology to allow continuous monitoring of BP in an ambulatory setting. The optimal approach would be a wearable device that allows noninvasive cuff-less, beat-by-beat BP monitoring, with simultaneous determination of environmental conditions. 31

The ultimate goal is that new information and communication technologies contribute to personalized solutions for hypertension management based on anticipation medicine with the goal of reducing cardiovascular risk (Figure 1). In addition, the availability of big data collected by wearable BP monitoring could facilitate time-series analyses and be used to inform artificial intelligence strategies to predict hypertension.

### The use of photoplethysmography for assessing hypertension [^113zma8J]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The measurement of blood pressure (BP) is critical to the treatment and management of many medical conditions. High blood pressure is associated with many chronic disease conditions, and is a major source of mortality and morbidity around the world. For outpatient care as well as general health monitoring, there is great interest in being able to accurately and frequently measure BP outside of a clinical setting, using mobile or wearable devices. One possible solution is photoplethysmography (PPG), which is most commonly used in pulse oximetry in clinical settings for measuring oxygen saturation. PPG technology is becoming more readily available, inexpensive, convenient, and easily integrated into portable devices. Recent advances include the development of smartphones and wearable devices that collect pulse oximeter signals. In this article, we review (i) the state-of-the-art and the literature related to PPG signals collected by pulse oximeters, (ii) various theoretical approaches that have been adopted in PPG BP measurement studies, and (iii) the potential of PPG measurement devices as a wearable application. Past studies on changes in PPG signals and BP are highlighted, and the correlation between PPG signals and BP are discussed. We also review the combined use of features extracted from PPG and other physiological signals in estimating BP. Although the technology is not yet mature, it is anticipated that in the near future, accurate, continuous BP measurements may be available from mobile and wearable devices given their vast potential.

### Recommendations for evaluating photoplethysmography-based algorithms for blood pressure assessment [^113N2dDU]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Photoplethysmography and blood pressure

Photoplethysmography (PPG) technology, while not yet the gold standard for blood pressure (BP) monitoring, offers innovative solutions to some of the limitations faced by traditional methods in managing hypertension. One of the most promising aspects of PPG is its potential to enable beat-to-beat BP monitoring, a capability not feasible with current gold-standard techniques. Traditionally, BP measurement relies on sphygmomanometers, which, though accurate, are limited to discrete measurements and can cause discomfort during use. In contrast, PPG offers a less invasive approach, allowing for continuous monitoring of BP. This makes PPG an appealing alternative for both patients and healthcare providers, as it opens up the possibility for more detailed and responsive hypertension management.

Hypertension, a condition characterized by persistently high BP, poses significant health risks if not managed effectively. Individuals with normal BP are considered normotensive, while those with lower-than-normal readings are classified as hypotensive. Managing these conditions requires accurate and timely monitoring, a challenge that PPG technology aims to address with its ability to offer continuous, real-time data through both contactand contactlesssensors.

The PPG waveform, a visual representation of blood volume changes within the microvascular tissue bed, provides essential insights into cardiovascular health. PPG devices, capable of both contact and contactless measurements, can estimate BP and other cardiovascular parameters. Contact PPG devices include not only wearable technologies like smartwatches and fitness trackers, which require direct skin contact using a light source and photodetector to collect data, but also textile-based sensors. These textile sensors are integrated into everyday clothing, offering a unique approach to BP monitoring by maintaining direct contact in a more comfortable and flexible manner. This innovation has recently gained attention for its non-invasiveness and convenience, allowing for continuous BP monitoring during daily activities. As the field of PPG technology evolves, the development of contactless methods opens new possibilities for even more unobtrusive health monitoring.

### Blood pressure and its variability: classic and novel measurement techniques [^113oi6hi]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Current hypertension guidelines recommend using the average values of several blood pressure (BP) readings obtained both in and out of the office for the diagnosis and management of hypertension. In-office BP measurement using an upper-arm cuff constitutes the evidence-based reference method for current BP classification and treatment targets. However, out-of-office BP evaluation using 24h ambulatory or home BP monitoring is recommended by all major medical associations for obtaining further insights into the BP profile of an individual and how it relates to their daily activities. Importantly, the highly variable nature of office and out-of-office BP readings has been widely acknowledged, including the association of BP variability with cardiovascular outcomes. However, to date, the implications of BP variability on cardiovascular outcomes have largely been ignored, with limited application in clinical practice. Novel cuffless wearable technologies might provide a detailed assessment of the 24h BP profile and behaviour over weeks or months. These devices offer many advantages for researchers and patients compared with traditional BP monitors, but their accuracy and utility remain uncertain. In this Review, we outline and compare conventional and novel methods and techniques for assessing average BP levels and BP variability, and reflect on the utility and potential of these methods for improving the treatment and management of patients with hypertension.

### Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to diagnose and manage hypertension [^115cp4kL]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

This review portrays how ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring was established and recommended as the method of choice for the assessment of BP and for the rational use of antihypertensive drugs. To establish much-needed diagnostic ambulatory BP thresholds, initial statistical approaches evolved into longitudinal studies of patients and populations, which demonstrated that cardiovascular complications are more closely associated with 24-hour and nighttime BP than with office BP. Studies cross-classifying individuals based on ambulatory and office BP thresholds identified white-coat hypertension, an elevated office BP in the presence of ambulatory normotension as a low-risk condition, whereas its counterpart, masked hypertension, carries a hazard almost as high as ambulatory combined with office hypertension. What clinically matters most is the level of the 24-hour and the nighttime BP, while other BP indexes derived from 24-hour ambulatory BP recordings, on top of the 24-hour and nighttime BP level, add little to risk stratification or hypertension management. Ambulatory BP monitoring is cost-effective. Ambulatory and home BP monitoring are complimentary approaches. Their interchangeability provides great versatility in the clinical implementation of out-of-office BP measurement. We are still waiting for evidence from randomized clinical trials to prove that out-of-office BP monitoring is superior to office BP in adjusting antihypertensive drug treatment and in the prevention of cardiovascular complications. A starting research line, the development of a standardized validation protocol for wearable BP monitoring devices, might facilitate the clinical applicability of ambulatory BP monitoring.

### Lancet commission on hypertension group position statement on the global improvement of accuracy standards for devices that measure blood pressure [^111QSsoh]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Measurement of BP is a fundamental medical test performed daily on many millions of people worldwide, and health professionals together with consumers should have confidence in the accuracy of the BP devices that they use for screening, diagnosis and management of hypertension. On the contrary, due to a host of well known problems, the global marketplace has been inundated with BP devices that are either known to be inaccurate or are of unknown accuracy. This can have serious implications for being able to achieve best-practice care of people related to BP control. The problem also threatens to be compounded by widespread introduction of new technology purporting to measure BP. Fortunately, most identified problems could be resolved by the mandatory requirement for independent validation of BP devices according to the recently developed ISO Standard. Other key needs are the development of specific standards for the validation of new BP technologies and accredited online lists of BP devices that are accessible to health professionals and consumers. An executive team of the Lancet Commission on Hypertension Group is currently working towards implementation of the recommendations provided in this position statement. Adherence to these recommendations would align with WHO policy to result in more accurate diagnosis and treatment of hypertension and a decrease in the worldwide burden from high BP.

### Advances and applications of biosensors in pulmonary hypertension [^1157qZpa]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The medial layer is primarily composed of smooth muscle cells, whose proliferation and hypertrophy can lead to an increase in the thickness of the media, thereby affecting the compliance and resistance of pulmonary blood vessels. The excessive proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) is associated with various factors, including the increase of HIF, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and growth factors. Under high-pressure conditions, these cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to adapt to hypoxia, inflammation, and other intra- and extra-cellular stresses, providing energy for cell proliferation, which is related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, the phenotypic switch of smooth muscle cells, from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype, may lead to an increase in the synthesis of ECM, thereby causing medial fibrosis.

The adventitia primarily composed of connective tissue, serves as a signaling center for inflammatory cells. Here, the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the proliferation and migration of fibroblasts jointly drive the process of vascular remodeling. The release of pro-inflammatory factors, adhesion molecules, and chemokines promotes the aggregation of inflammatory cells, which in turn release cytokines that further exacerbate vascular remodeling. The increased expression of growth factors promotes the proliferation of fibroblasts, which secrete various ECM components, ultimately leading to vascular fibrosis.

### Cuffless blood pressure measuring devices: review and statement by the European Society of Hypertension working group on blood pressure monitoring and cardiovascular variability [^113QpogL]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Many cuffless blood pressure (BP) measuring devices are currently on the market claiming that they provide accurate BP measurements. These technologies have considerable potential to improve the awareness, treatment, and management of hypertension. However, recent guidelines by the European Society of Hypertension do not recommend cuffless devices for the diagnosis and management of hypertension.

Objective

This statement by the European Society of Hypertension Working Group on BP Monitoring and Cardiovascular Variability presents the types of cuffless BP technologies, issues in their validation, and recommendations for clinical practice.

Statements

Cuffless BP monitors constitute a wide and heterogeneous group of novel technologies and devices with different intended uses. Cuffless BP devices have specific accuracy issues, which render the established validation protocols for cuff BP devices inadequate for their validation. In 2014, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers published a standard for the validation of cuffless BP devices, and the International Organization for Standardization is currently developing another standard. The validation of cuffless devices should address issues related to the need of individual cuff calibration, the stability of measurements post calibration, the ability to track BP changes, and the implementation of machine learning technology. Clinical field investigations may also be considered and issues regarding the clinical implementation of cuffless BP readings should be investigated.

Conclusion

Cuffless BP devices have considerable potential for changing the diagnosis and management of hypertension. However, fundamental questions regarding their accuracy, performance, and implementation need to be carefully addressed before they can be recommended for clinical use.

### Artificial intelligence in cardiovascular pharmacotherapy: applications and perspectives [^116Wz3dZ]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Evidence for AI in cardiovascular pharmacotherapy

Hypertension

Hypertension remains one of the most undertreated cardiovascular (CV) risk factors. Despite the wide range of available therapeutic options, many patients continue to have inadequate blood pressure (BP) control, putting them at increased risk of adverse events. In this field, AI can be useful in supporting diagnosis as well as improving risk stratification and prognosis. Leveraging recent advances in wearable technologies for cuffless BP monitoring, AI-enabled devices hold significant promise for transforming remote hypertension management (see Supplementary Chapter S1). However, due to current limitations in measurement accuracy and lack of standardization, traditional BP monitoring remains the recommended method for routine clinical assessment.

In hypertension pharmacotherapy, AI-based models have the potential to personalize treatment by predicting the likelihood of achieving target BP. Herzog et al. developed a DNN using data from 16 917 newly diagnosed hypertensive patients to predict the most effective antihypertensive treatment combinations after 1 year. The model achieved a modest performance, outperforming physician practice. However, this model lacked external validation, and the population used to train the model mostly included white patients, limiting the external validity of this tool.

### Management of hypertension in the digital era: small wearable monitoring devices for remote blood pressure monitoring [^112h1563]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

One example of putting remote management of hypertension into practice occurred during the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake, which occurred on March 11, 2011. The Disaster Cardiovascular Prevention Network used a web-based HBPM system in a town devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. This enabled strict control of home BP to be achieved and seasonal variations in BP to be minimized over the months and years after the disaster and suggests that such an approach could be successfully applied for routine monitoring of BP in the wider community.

Anticipation medicine refers to approaches designed to identify increasing risk and predict the onset of cardiovascular events based on a series of data collected over time, allowing proactive interventions to reduce risk and eliminate events. Combining this with precision medicine, defined as customization of healthcare, with medical decisions, treatments and management tailored for each individual patient, offers the possibility of effectively managing hypertension to reduce cardiovascular risk. Effective utilization of digital platforms and solutions utilizing real-time data, such as that provided by wearable technologies, combined with artificial intelligence is another area with potential. Using data from 18 258 individuals, machine learning methods were able to develop a highly precise model to predict the development of hypertension in a general population. This could be used to identify individuals at risk of developing hypertension and allow early intervention with tools such as lifestyle modification to prevent future hypertension development. Another artificial intelligence-based prediction model using multi-input multi-output deep neural networks based on time-series BP data and related contextual information showed that this approach has the potential to predict both mean BP and BPV. Given that abnormal BPV is a known risk factor for CVD, the ability to predict BP over periods of 4 weeks using this model could have important clinical implications, although this remains to be determined.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^1127HoVU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) implementation — HBPM may be a more practical tool than ABPM in the United States but device calibration and evidence gaps pose challenges. HBPM may be a more practical tool than ABPM to diagnose and manage hypertension. An ongoing challenge is that most home BP monitors lack calibration and may give inaccurate results. Devices instead are simply cleared for sale by the US Food and Drug Administration 510(k) mechanism. Due to significant heterogeneity in previously conducted trials, additional studies are needed to substantiate the benefits of HBPM in clinical settings.

### The role of home blood pressure measurement in managing hypertension: an evidence-based review [^112QbTTw]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

This article reviews the current literature regarding the role of home measurement of blood pressure (BP) in the management of hypertension. Subjects with hypertension can use simple automated devices to measure their own BP at home. The results can be accurate and reliable, and because multiple readings allow a mean value to be calculated, a better estimate of the underlying BP level is obtained. Home measurement of BP gives results which are equivalent to the accepted 'gold standard' measure of ambulatory BP values, whilst using a simpler and much less expensive technique which is therefore more widely available. Both methods are better than conventional office measurements in identifying the 'true' or underlying mean BP level and identifying falsely raised levels or 'white coat hypertension'. White coat hypertension confounds the treatment of hypertension, but may not be entirely harmless. Ambulatory BP is a better predictor of cardiovascular prognosis than clinic BP. The use of home BP measurement as an equivalent, feasible, and (apparently) more cost-effective technique to measure BP in hypertension, should enable groups of patients with a poorer prognosis to be identified and their treatment adjusted in order to improve their prognosis.

### AI, machine learning, and chatGPT in hypertension [^111u8VuA]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertension, a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and premature death, remains incompletely understood despite extensive research. Indeed, even though numerous drugs are available, achieving adequate blood pressure control remains a challenge, prompting recent interest in artificial intelligence. To promote the use of machine learning in cardiovascular medicine, this review provides a brief introduction to machine learning and reviews its notable applications in hypertension management and research, such as disease diagnosis and prognosis, treatment decisions, and omics data analysis. The challenges and limitations associated with data-driven predictive techniques are also discussed. The goal of this review is to raise awareness and encourage the hypertension research community to consider machine learning as a key component in developing innovative diagnostic and therapeutic tools for hypertension. By integrating traditional cardiovascular risk factors with genomics, socioeconomic, behavioral, and environmental factors, machine learning may aid in the development of precise risk prediction models and personalized treatment approaches for patients with hypertension.

### The role of wearable home blood pressure monitoring in detecting out-of-office control status [^113AZJKD]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and home blood pressure (HBP) monitoring is currently recommended for management of hypertension. Nonetheless, traditional HBP protocols could overlook diurnal fluctuations, which could also be linked with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. In this observational study, we studied among a group of treated hypertensive patients (N = 62, age: 52.4 ± 10.4 years) by using out-of-office ABP and wearable HBP. They received one session of 24-h ABP measurement with an oscillometric upper-arm monitor, and totally three sessions of 7-day/6-time-daily wearable HBP measurement separated in each month with HeartGuide. Controlled hypertension is defined as an average BP < 130/80 mmHg for both daytime ABP and HBP. There was substantial reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC 0.883–0.911) and good reproducibility (Cohen's kappa = 0.600) for wearable HBP measurement, especially before breakfast and after dinner. Among all patients, 27.4% had both uncontrolled HBP and ABP, 30.6% had uncontrolled HBP only, while 6.5% had uncontrolled ABP only. Female gender and increased numbers of anti-hypertensive agents are correlated with controlled hypertension. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension had a significantly higher maximal daytime blood pressure, which was previously signified as an imperial marker for cardiovascular risk. In conclusion, wearable HBP monitoring in accordance with a dedicated daily-living schedule results in good reliability and reproducibility. Patients with an uncontrolled wearable HBP should benefit from repeated HBP or ABP measurement for risk stratification.

### Advances and applications of biosensors in pulmonary hypertension [^112SCsaE]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Microthrombus formation

Microthrombosis is a distinctive pathological change in PH, associated with increased inflammation, endothelial cell injury, hemodynamic alterations, and activation of the coagulation system. The release of inflammatory factors can damage the endothelium and activate the coagulation system, leading to microthrombosis. Endothelial cell injury and dysfunction result in reduced production of vasodilators such as NO, while the production of constrictor factors like ET-1 increases, promoting vasoconstriction and thrombosis. In the context of PH, increased PVR and slowed blood flow provide favorable conditions for thrombus formation. The activation of the coagulation system includes platelet activation and increased coagulation factors. Increased platelet activity may be related to chronic hypoxia, endothelial cell injury, and the action of inflammatory factors. Furthermore, the release of granule contents (such as ADP, serotonin, TxA2, and PDGF) from activated platelets can further promote platelet aggregation. Inflammatory responses, endothelial injury, and vascular dynamics changes can all lead to an increase in coagulation factors, especially factor VIII and fibrinogen.

The molecular mechanisms of PH involve multiple complex pathways, primarily including the interaction of cytokines, growth factors, and transcription factors, which collectively lead to vascular remodeling and perivascular inflammation, and may even result in microthrombus formation. With the continuous understanding of the molecular mechanisms of PH, biosensors that specifically target the molecular mechanisms of PH have become an important diagnostic and detection measure, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment.

### Recommendations for evaluating photoplethysmography-based algorithms for blood pressure assessment [^116QBjoc]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive optical technique that measures changes in blood volume in the microvascular tissue bed of the body. While it shows potential as a clinical tool for blood pressure (BP) assessment and hypertension management, several sources of error can affect its performance. One such source is the PPG-based algorithm, which can lead to measurement bias and inaccuracy. Here, we review seven widely used measures to assess PPG-based algorithm performance and recommend implementing standardized error evaluation steps in their development. This standardization can reduce bias and improve the reliability and accuracy of PPG-based BP estimation, leading to better health outcomes for patients managing hypertension.

### Diagnosis and management of resistant hypertension: state of the art [^117JSpAX]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2018). Medium credibility.

Resistant hypertension is defined as a lack of ambulatory blood pressure response to optimized medical treatment after exclusion of secondary hypertension in patients who are fully adherent to antihypertensive therapy. Patients with resistant hypertension are at high risk of complications, particularly cardiovascular events, and optimization of medical treatment remains the cornerstone of their management. Such optimization should be based on simple algorithms and include the use of aldosterone antagonists. The available data from clinical trials do not support the use of device-based approaches such as renal denervation, baroreflex activation therapy or arteriovenous anastomosis for the treatment of resistant hypertension in the majority of patients. Therefore, device treatment remains a last-resort for patients with truly resistant hypertension in the context of clinical research in highly skilled tertiary referral centres. Future research should focus on improving understanding of the intrinsic (physiological and psychological factors) and extrinsic (environmental stressors) mechanisms that contribute to a lack of response to blood-pressure-lowering drugs in adherent patients. The use of biomarkers to identify patients with early target organ damage and new technologies, such as renal nerve stimulation, to predict blood pressure responses to renal denervation could aid the selection of patients who might benefit from device therapies.

### Advances and applications of biosensors in pulmonary hypertension [^111kyWm4]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Breath biosensors

Breath sensors, which utilizes various biosensors to detect gaseous biomarkers such as exhaled volatile organic compounds (VOCs), is one of the most promising non-invasive diagnostic methods. The pathological physiological processes and detectable VOCs in exhaled breath have been proposed as non-invasive biomarkers for PH, indicating the potential of breath analysis in the field of PH. Breath analysis utilizes sensors to detect and analyze these gaseous biomarkers. Sensors can recognize specific gas molecules and produce measurable signal changes based on their interactions with gas molecules, such as adsorption and chemical reactions. In breath analysis, it is typically not a single VOC that plays a role but rather a pattern of VOCs (breath print) associated with specific disease states. The collected sensor data usually requires analysis by statistical and machine learning algorithms to identify and differentiate the characteristic gas patterns of different diseases. PH has been shown to be detectable and classifiable through breath analysis and sensor arrays. The use of nanomaterials enhances the sensitivity and selectivity of sensors due to their high surface area-to-volume ratio and tunable physicochemical properties, enabling the sensors to more effectively detect low concentrations of gaseous biomarkers.

Electronic nose (e-Nose) technology, which mimics the natural olfactory system, uses sensor arrays and pattern recognition algorithms to identify specific gas patterns, which is of great assistance for disease diagnosis. However, e-Nose technology is generally used as an auxiliary diagnostic tool, and its results often need to be combined with clinical symptoms and other diagnostic tests to ensure accuracy and reliability. Currently, the application scope of e-Nose technology is continuously expanding, and with in-depth research, it may be used for the detection of PH in the future.

### Advances and applications of biosensors in pulmonary hypertension [^112MpciR]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Prospects and challenges

The rapid development of biosensors has been widely applied to various diseases, including PH. The types of biosensors currently used for PH include electrochemical biosensors, optical biosensors, microfluidic biosensors, and wireless biosensors. Despite this, core diagnostic indicators for PH, such as pulmonary artery pressure and PVR, still lack biomarkers that are both highly specific and sensitive. Currently, BNP and NT-proBNP are widely used to evaluate right heart function, risk stratification for PAH, and predict prognosis, but they still have limitations, such as being significantly affected by age and renal function. The development of biosensors for PH faces challenges from both the disease itself, including the lack of specific biomarkers for PH, and from the biosensors themselves, including improving detection sensitivity and specificity, ensuring long-term stability and reliability, reducing costs, simplifying data processing, enhancing patient acceptance, and meeting regulatory approval requirements.

Therefore, developing new biomarkers and improving sensing technology are important research directions for the future. miRNAs have great potential in the early diagnosis of PH due to their high specificity and stability. The use of nanomaterials can greatly enhance the sensitivity of biosensors. Multimodal sensors can detect multiple biomarkers or physiological parameters simultaneously, providing more comprehensive diagnostic information for diseases. The application of artificial intelligence technology can improve the accuracy and efficiency of data analysis for biosensors. In future research on sensors for PH, the research direction will focus on utilizing nanomaterials to achieve miniaturization and integrated design of sensors, developing multimodal sensors, and combining artificial intelligence algorithms for data analysis to detect sensitive and accurate PH-related miRNAs.

### Future possibilities for artificial intelligence in the practical management of hypertension [^113vSjz7]. Hypertension Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The use of artificial intelligence in numerous prediction and classification tasks, including clinical research and healthcare management, is becoming increasingly more common. This review describes the current status and a future possibility for artificial intelligence in blood pressure management, that is, the possibility of accurately predicting and estimating blood pressure using large-scale data, such as personal health records and electronic medical records. Individual blood pressure continuously changes because of lifestyle habits and the environment. This review focuses on two topics regarding controlling changing blood pressure: a novel blood pressure measurement system and blood pressure analysis using artificial intelligence. Regarding the novel blood pressure measurement system, we compare the conventional cuff-less method with the analysis of pulse waves using artificial intelligence for blood pressure estimation. Then, we describe the prediction of future blood pressure values using machine learning and deep learning. In addition, we summarize factor analysis using "explainable AI" to solve a black-box problem of artificial intelligence. Overall, we show that artificial intelligence is advantageous for hypertension management and can be used to establish clinical evidence for the practical management of hypertension.

### Latest hypertension research to inform clinical practice in Asia [^111T2vcD]. Hypertension Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the challenges associated with the coronavirus pandemic, the last 2 years have been active periods for hypertension research and initiatives in Asia. There are new hypertension guidelines from the World Health Organization that can be interpreted and applied locally. This is also the case for data from the latest Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis, which showed that greater reductions in systolic blood pressure (BP) are associated with lower risks of cardiovascular events. The randomized controlled Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive study and the Salt Substitute and Stroke Study provide local data to inform practice. Other initiatives to help reduce high salt intake in Asia are also underway. Both drug-resistant and nocturnal hypertension are appropriate areas of focus in Asia, and there are an increasing number of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options for these conditions. Digital therapeutics to promote uptake and implementation of lifestyle interventions are showing promise, and other digital-based strategies such as telemedicine, wearable BP monitors to detect beat-by-beat BP and artificial intelligence will no doubt become integral parts of future strategies to reduce the burden of hypertension and hypertension-related disease. A number of initiatives from the Hypertension Cardiovascular Outcome Prevention and Evidence in Asia Network and Japanese Society of hypertension are underway, and there is good reason for optimism regarding the ongoing and future management of hypertension in Asia based on these and the active research activities in the region.

### Improving blood pressure management and control with out-of-office blood pressure monitoring [^111rNvYw]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Out-of-office blood pressure (BP) monitoring is a critical component of modern hypertension diagnosis and management. Measuring BP outside of clinic reduces the stress response that contributes to white coat hypertension and also allows for the identification of masked hypertension, yielding more accurate cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment and improved CVD prevention. Home BP monitoring and 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring outperform office BP in predicting CVD outcomes and are cost-effective aspects to cardiovascular health promotion by preventing unnecessary treatment, reducing clinic visits, and lowering event-related costs. Despite these advantages, routine implementation remains limited due to patient, provider, and system-level barriers, including validated device access, workflow integration, patient-provider communication tools, and adherence. Efforts to minimize or eliminate these barriers are crucial to CVD prevention. Evidence is also needed to support alternative out-of-office BP measurement strategies, including community-based strategies, such as BP assessment by school nurses, pharmacists, or community health workers. The utility of these modalities in diagnosing and managing children with hypertension are greatly needed as the long-term prognostic data in this population are sparse. Expanding adoption and evidence for out-of-office monitoring is essential to optimize hypertension care and CVD risk reduction.

### Blood pressure variability in clinical practice: past, present and the future [^116cvzjU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Recent advances in wearable technology through convenient and cuffless systems will enable continuous, noninvasive monitoring of blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and heart rhythm on both longitudinal 24‐hour measurement scales and high‐frequency beat‐to‐beat BP variability and synchronous heart rate variability and changes in underlying heart rhythm. Clinically, BP variability is classified into 4 main types on the basis of the duration of monitoring time: very‐short‐term (beat to beat), short‐term (within 24 hours), medium‐term (within days), and long‐term (over months and years). BP variability is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease, cognitive decline, and mental illness. The diagnostic and therapeutic value of measuring and controlling BP variability may offer critical targets in addition to lowering mean BP in hypertensive populations.

### Advances and applications of biosensors in pulmonary hypertension [^113ucWZS]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

MicroRNA biosensors

In the context of PH, the expression patterns of specific miRNAs are altered, and these changes can serve as diagnostic markers for the disease. Therefore, sensitive and accurate detection of PH-related miRNAs is of great significance for the early diagnosis of PH. The miRNA biosensor utilizes CRISPR/Cas-based molecular recognition or nanomaterial-enhanced signal amplification technologies, employing complementary nucleic acid probes to specifically capture target miRNA and convert it into fluorescent/electrochemical signals for highly sensitive detection. miRNA electrochemical biosensors utilize specific miRNAs as biomarkers, which means they can target specific genetic signatures, thereby reducing false positives and false negatives, and enhancing the accuracy of diagnosis. Additionally, the stability of miRNAs is an advantage in their use as biomarkers, as stable biomarkers contribute to the reliability of detection results. Although the detection of miRNA is challenging due to their small size, high sequence similarity, and low abundance in biological fluids, the development of sensing technologies and the use of nanomaterials are expected to enable miRNA sensors to play a greater role in precision medicine and early disease diagnosis.

### Vascular, cardiac and renal target organ damage associated to arterial hypertension: which noninvasive tools for detection? [^1118o8wQ]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Arterial hypertension is a systemic condition characterized by elevated blood pressure in the vascular system. Despite the great effort of scientific community to sensitize population to the problem, enforcing the preventive and treatment measures, this condition continues to be responsible for a large portion of global mortality, as it represents one of the major modifiable risk factors of cardiovascular disease. The significant and substantial clinical implications of high blood pressure on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are explained by the effect of hypertension on specific organs, particularly sensitive to the effects of changes in blood pressure, resulting cardiac remodeling, cerebrovascular disease, renal failure, atherosclerotic vascular disease, and retinopathy, hence the term "target organ damage". The aim of this review is to give an overview of several noninvasive tools useful in the detection of organ damage related to arterial hypertension.

### Cuffless blood pressure monitoring: promises and challenges [^114L36W8]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Current BP measurements are on the basis of traditional BP cuff approaches. Ambulatory BP monitoring, at 15- to 30-minute intervals usually over 24 hours, provides sufficiently continuous readings that are superior to the office-based snapshot, but this system is not suitable for frequent repeated use. A true continuous BP measurement that could collect BP passively and frequently would require a cuffless method that could be worn by the patient, with the data stored electronically much the same way that heart rate and heart rhythm are already done routinely. Ideally, BP should be measured continuously and frequently during diverse activities during both daytime and nighttime in the same subject by means of novel devices. There is increasing excitement for newer methods to measure BP on the basis of sensors and algorithm development. As new devices are refined and their accuracy is improved, it will be possible to better assess masked hypertension, nocturnal hypertension, and the severity and variability of BP. In this review, we discuss the progression in the field, particularly in the last 5 years, ending with sensor-based approaches that incorporate machine learning algorithms to personalized medicine.

### Home blood pressure-centered approach-from digital health to medical practice: HOPE Asia network consensus statement 2023 [^116sYuSQ]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Recent innovations in digital technology have enabled the simultaneous accumulation, and the linking and analysis of time-series big data relating to several factors that influence blood pressure (BP), including biological indicators, physical activity, and environmental information. Various approaches can be used to monitor BP: in the office/clinic; at home; 24-h ambulatory recording; or with wearable and cuffless devices. Of these, home BP monitoring is a reliable and convenient method, and is recommended for hypertension management by current national and international guidelines. This recommendation is based on evidence showing that home BP is an important predictor of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and kidney disease in patients with hypertension. In addition, lifetime personalized health record (PHR)-based home BP with telemonitoring combined with co-interventions has been shown to lower BP more effectively than the traditional approach based on office BP. Thus, home BP represents a key metric for personalized anticipation medicine, from digital healthcare to digital medicine. This paper summarizes the latest evidence on home BP monitoring and proposes a Hypertension Cardiovascular Outcome Prevention and Evidence in Asia (HOPE Asia) Network consensus on a home BP-centered approach to the management of hypertension.

### Hypertension Canada statement on the use of cuffless blood pressure monitoring devices in clinical practice [^116Q7hZf]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cuffless blood pressure (BP) devices are an emerging technology marketed as providing frequent, nonintrusive and reliable BP measurements. With the increasing interest in these devices, it is important for Hypertension Canada to provide a statement regarding the current place of cuffless BP measurements in hypertension management.

Methods

An overview of the technology in cuffless BP devices, the potential with this technology and the challenges related to determining the accuracy of these devices.

Results

Cuffless BP monitoring is an emerging field where various technologies are applied to measure BP without the use of a brachial cuff. None of the devices currently sold have been validated in static and dynamic conditions using a recognized validation standard. Important issues persist in regard to the accuracy and the place of these devices in clinical practice. Current data only support using validated cuff-based devices for the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Presently, readings from cuffless devices that are used for diagnosis or clinical management need to be confirmed using measurements obtained from a clinically validated BP device.

Conclusions

Cuffless BP devices are a developing technology designed to track BP in most daily life activities. However, many steps remain before they should be used in clinical practice.

### Remote blood pressure monitoring: a comprehensive review [^113cgKza]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Remote blood pressure (BP) monitoring, or blood pressure measurement outside of a clinical setting, has been an evolving approach to monitor BP outside of a clinical setting, allowing for a better understanding of day-to-day fluctuations in BP. This technology at home allows for detection of instantaneous fluctuations in BP that could be predictive of cardiovascular disease events. It also holds potential for more accurate diagnosis of hypertension and improved titration of antihypertensive medications. Home BP monitoring has traditionally focused on cuffed devices, but new technologies based on cuffless, wearable devices are emerging. These have novel applications clinically for continuous and intermittent blood pressure measurement. Although there are validation protocols for cuff-based devices, these do not always apply to cuffless devices, and both types require unique assessments for accurate BP measurements. Nevertheless, remote BP monitoring, including evolving cuffless devices, represents an intriguing prospect for monitoring BP and characterizing changes in patients' BP overtime. However, the overall clinical importance and application of instantaneous BP measurements remains unknown. The purpose of this review is to describe the current state of remote BP monitoring and evolving technologies in this field.

### The 2020 "WHO technical specifications for automated non-invasive blood pressure measuring devices with cuff" [^1152rBrn]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Development of Technical Specifications for BP-Measuring Devices

Multiple nongovernmental organizations have identified improving the quality of BP measurements by using BP devices that have been validated for accuracy as a key action needed to address the worldwide burden of high BP. – These organizations highlight the urgent need for an endorsed, global validation protocol to guide device accuracy testing and for restricted/limited marketing of unvalidated BP measurement devices. Other key recommendations include developing validation standards to address the unique aspects of new BP technologies (such as cuffless BP estimating devices) and providing online resources to identify accuracy-validated devices that are accessible to both consumers and health professionals.

Concerns around the lack of accurate, good-quality BP devices, especially in LMICs, were expressed by key stakeholders at a workshop on BP measurement during the Fourth WHO Global Forum on Medical Devices hosted by the Government of India in 2018.

WHO undertook a technical consultation and expert review in June 2019 with invited members who had relevant expertise across diverse skills, namely scientific, technical, advocacy, and implementation science, and who represented organizational sectors such as government and nongovernment, as well as professional societies from different world regions. The objective of the consultation and technical review was to outline the key performance characteristics and technical specifications for noninvasive BP measurement devices that are essential for accurate BP measurement and the successful diagnosis and management of hypertension.

### Advances and applications of biosensors in pulmonary hypertension [^113zMfBY]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 4
The basic principle of biosensors. The commonly used detection samples for biosensors mainly include cells, tissues, and body fluids. The target substances in the samples bind with the biorecognition elements of the sensor, such as enzymes, antibodies, and nucleic acids, to produce physical or chemical reactions. Then, the sensor's transducer converts these reactions into measurable signals, such as electrical or optical signals. Finally, after data processing, the detection of the target substances is achieved

The common electrochemical conduction modes of electrochemical biosensors include amperometry, potentiometry, field-effect transistor (FET), and impedancemetry. Amperometry detects the oxidation or reduction of electroactive analytes by measuring the current flowing through the working electrode at a constant potential, with the current size being proportional to the concentration of the analyte. Potentiometry detects changes in ion concentration by measuring the potential difference between two electrodes, often using ion-selective electrodes (ISEs). The potential change is proportional to the logarithm of ion concentration, following the Nernst equation. FETs detect changes in ion concentration by utilizing changes in the gate voltage of FETs, such as ion-sensitive field-effect transistors (ISFETs). Impedimetry, also known as conductometric sensors, detects the impact of biorecognition events on charge transfer at the electrode surface by measuring the impedance changes of the alternating current signal between electrodes. The design and application of electrochemical biosensors depend on selecting the appropriate biological recognition elements and electrochemical conduction modes to achieve high sensitivity and high selectivity detection of specific analytes.

Biomarkers for PH applicable to biosensor development

In the clinical diagnosis of PH, there is a lack of specific indicators for early diagnosis (Table 1). Genes such as BMPR2, ATP13A3, EIF2AK4, KCNK3, ENG, and KDR are all related to the pathogenesis of PH, and the detection of these genes by RNA biosensors is of great significance for the early diagnosis of PH. Additionally, the detection of biomarkers related to the classification and pathophysiological mechanisms of PH can be used to assist in diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and prognosis prediction. The biosensors currently under research mainly detect biomarkers related to these pathophysiological mechanisms. These biomarkers can be categorized into different types based on their functions, including cardiac stress markers, inflammation markers, vascular dysfunction markers, coagulation and platelet activation markers, and markers of tissue hypoxia and organ injury.

Table 1
Classification of common biomarkers for PH

Cardiac stress markers including natriuretic peptides and cardiac troponins, which can be used for the early diagnosis of PH. Natriuretic peptides consist of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which play a central role in reflecting cardiac wall stress and injury. Cardiac troponins, including cardiac troponin T (TnT) and cardiac troponin I (TnI), are markers of cardiac injury, and their elevation is related to increased pressure load on the heart. Inflammatory markers, primarily cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP), are elevated and associated with the progression of PH. Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and various interleukins, together with CRP, play a significant role in the development and progression of PH.

### Thin, soft, wearable system for continuous wireless monitoring of artery blood pressure [^1155NfFE]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Continuous BP monitoring is of vital importance for patients with chronic hypertension and can provide pre-diagnosis for initial patients. One typical application of the TSMS would be providing medical instructions for patients with sustained hypertension. Sustained hypertension patients with long-term intaking antihypertensive medication may appear normal BP when measuring in hospital. However, the antihypertensive drug might not control the BP effectively throughout the entire day and night, during which heart and kidney damage might be caused by the sharp BP fluctuation. In this case, continuous monitoring of BP at home can provide efficient advice for doctors to adjust the timing and dosage of the medication. Besides, patients with masked hypertension or borderline hypertension, whose BP is unstable and shows a wide dynamic range, may be misdiagnosed due to a normal clinical BP presented. Therefore, continuous BP monitoring plays a crucial role in developing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for patients with masked or borderline hypertension. However, current wearable BP monitoring systems suffer from either bulky signal processing systems (ultrasound-based and bioimpedance-based) or cumbersome recalibration processes (ultrasound based and tonometry based), both of which have greatly hampered their uses in totally wearable/portable formats. Moreover, the unreliable interfacial contact between the device and artery will introduce extra noise signals to pulse wave, such as sliding noise caused by loose contact and occasional error, which will greatly reduce signal quality, and thus leading to poor measurement accuracy.

Pulse Transit Time

Pulse transit time is the interval of the pulse wave propagation between 2 arterial sites, is inversely proportional to BP, and has been shown to provide a good estimate of BP. – Limitations of this approach include the ability to accurately estimate both SBP and DBP, and the influence of changes in arterial elasticity with age. Pulse transit time-based approaches to continuous BP monitoring often use an ECG provide and a finger photoplethysmography sensor, and can also provide information on heart rate.

A device consisting of a finger photoplethysmography and 3 ECG leads connected to a watch-like device has been validated against the European Society of Hypertension International Protocol revision 2010 for the validation of BP measuring devices in adults. This is promising, but the device still needs to be tested outside laboratory conditions to provide its ability to continuously and reliably record 24-hour BP under real-life conditions. A device where the ECG and photoplethysmography signal detection systems are incorporated into a single wearable patch seems to have potential for real-time BP monitoring and would be convenient for patients.

Another approach to measuring pulse transit time used an array of 2×2 bioimpedance sensors placed on the wrist and eliminates the need for ECG. This allowed continuous and accurate measurement of BP in a way that was comfortable for patients. Use of a bioimpedance system for BP monitoring was also investigated in another study. A wrist device with 4 bioimpedance sensors on the wrist in a horizontal structure showed good detection ratios for pulse wave velocity, and the estimated BP showed low root-mean-squared-errors of 7.47 ± 2.15 mm Hg (SBP) and 5.17 ± 1.81 mm Hg (DBP) compared with standard measurements. This suggests that such an approach is feasible for wearable BP devices, with refinement to reduce the estimated BP errors with the latter device.

### Nocturnal blood pressure: pathophysiology, measurement and clinical implications. position paper of the European Society of Hypertension [^114tPFAx]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Wearables and multiparametric sleep monitoring

Wearable devices designed for the consumer market, able to measure and monitor several health-related variables are now widespread, owing to the stunning technological progress which led to considerable miniaturization of sensors and reduction of costs. Some of these devices provide BP estimates, also during sleep. This expanding field is driven by the medical technology and nonmedical technology industry. When addressing their application to nocturnal BP monitoring, the key question in this regard is: what would the desirable attributes for wearable technologies aimed at monitoring nocturnal/asleep BP be? One crucial attribute is noninvasiveness and no disturbance of sleep quality, ensuring that the monitoring process does not interfere with the physiological parameter it seeks to measure (e.g. causing arousals). Indeed, minimal intrusion is vital to avoid disrupting the measurement procedure. Ideally, these technologies should provide frequent measurements, acknowledging the continuous nature of BP rather than relying on intermittent readings. From this point of view, cuffless BP monitoring devices are particularly promising, as they eliminate cuff-related intrusion and disturbance to physiological parameters, and may even allow for continuous monitoring in some cases.

On top of all requirements, however, these monitors must ensure acceptable accuracy. Cuff-based measurements rely on surrogate signals like sounds or oscillations closely related to the pressure in the underlying artery. Conversely, most cuffless devices rely on mathematical models integrating several physiological parameters, rather than measuring the forces more directly related to BP. To ensure acceptable accuracy, cuffless devices should demonstrate comparable accuracy to gold-standard, cuff-based devices and be validated in accordance to internationally recognized protocols and recommendations, focusing not only on their accuracy in quantify BP levels, but also on their ability to reliably track BP changes over time.

Thus, while various techniques are available, not all of them can reliably derive nocturnal BP: Table 2 summarizes the different methods adopted and their advantages and disadvantages in relation to nocturnal (asleep) BP measurement.

Systematic reviews showed that fully automated blood pressure measurement accuracy is closer to daytime ambulatory blood pressure measurement accuracy but that "research quality" (i.e., "standard") measurement could also be acceptable, and another systematic review showed that fully automated readings were similar whether staff were present in the room (attended) or the patient was left alone during the rest and measurements (unattended). Other considerations included that the benefits of accurate blood pressure data outweighed the potential harm of any adverse events or inconvenience, which was small, and patient values and preferences were somewhat varied; thus, the Work Group decided upon a "Weak for" for these recommendations.

Wearable BP Monitoring Concept and Cardiovascular Risk

A wide variety of factors can influence BP at any time, highlighting the value of a wearable option that allows determination of associations between BP readings and potential triggers, such as environmental factors, physical activity, and psychological stress.

Resonance Hypothesis of BPV, 24-Hour BP Profiles, and BP Surge

The synergistic resonance theory proposes that each form of BPV (beat-by-beat, diurnal, day-by-day, seasonal and yearly) has the potential to create dynamic surges in BP, which could coincide with peak BP and different external triggers (eg, temperature, mental stress, sleep apnea, exercise) to precipitate cardiovascular events (Figure 2), especially in patients with arterial stiffness who are less able to absorb BP surges in the peripheral arteries. Therefore, there are a variety of factors and triggers that contribute to the 24-hour BP profile and BP surges for each individual (Figure 3). There is also wide interindividual variation in daytime BP values, and in the response to stressful situations. In addition, actisensitivity (the slope of the regression line of ambulatory BP against the log of physical activity) in patients with hypertension varies by season, with higher trigger-specific surge in BP during exercise in winter compared with summer.

Synergistically accumulated trigger-specific blood pressure (BP) surges and diurnal variation. HTN indicates hypertension.

In general, BP tends to be higher in the morning and lower at night. Variations from the normal physiological pattern include excessive morning BP surge, no decrease in BP at night (nondipper pattern), and increased nighttime BP (nocturnal hypertension, or riser pattern). Nocturnal hypertension is particularly associated with a salt-sensitive hypertension phenotype, as often seen in individuals of Asian ethnicity, and may be associated with sleep apnea.

### Perfect 24-h management of hypertension: clinical relevance and perspectives [^113yXxSn]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Out-of-office blood pressure (BP) measured by home BP monitoring, or ambulatory BP monitoring, was demonstrated to be superior to office BP for the prediction of cardiovascular events. The J-HOP study of a nationwide Japanese cohort demonstrated that morning home BP is the best stroke predictor. In the prospective HONEST study of > 21000 hypertensives, on-treatment morning home BP was shown to be a strong predictor both of future coronary artery disease and stroke events. In subjects whose office BP was maintained at ⩾150mmHg, there was no increase in cardiovascular events when their morning systolic BP was well-controlled at < 125mmHg. Since Asians show greater morning BP surges, it is particularly important for Asians to achieve 'perfect 24-hr BP control', that is, the 24-h BP level, nocturnal BP dipping and BP variability including morning surge. The morning BP surge and the extremes of disrupted circadian rhythm (riser and extreme dipper patterns) are independent risks for stroke in hypertensives. A morning BP-guided approach is thus the first step toward perfect 24-h BP control, followed by the control of nocturnal hypertension. In the resonance hypothesis, the synergistic resonance of BP variability phenotypes would produce an extraordinary large 'dynamic BP surge' that can trigger a cardiovascular event, especially in high-risk patients with systemic hemodynamic atherothrombotic syndrome, a vicious cycle of exaggerated BP variability and vascular disease. In the future, information and communications technology and artificial intelligence technology with the innovation of wearable continuous surge BP monitoring will contribute to 'anticipation medicine' with the goal of zero cardiovascular events.

Blood Pressure (BP)

BP is the outward force by which blood pushes against the artery walls as it moves around the body. BP is described as the systolic over the diastolic BP (maximum over minimum) measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg). Hypertension (elevated BP levels) affect more than 1 billion people globally and is the leading modifiable risk factor for preventable death. The most commonly used method of BP assessment incorporates a cuff sphygmomanometer to assess brachial arterial BP level which can be incorporated into automatic oscillometric devices with a brachial cuff.

Some wrist-worn devices (e.g. Omron HeartGuide) incorporate a cuff to measure BP at the wrist, but limited data on their accuracy is publicly available.

Cuffless wearables are emerging but often require user calibration prior to use. BP measurements can then be derived from the time it takes for an arterial pulse wave to reach the periphery (pulse transit time) using ECG or pulse wave analysis using PPG in which the change in blood volume with each heart beat is assessed. The amplitude of the PPG signal can provide information about the strength of the pulse, with consistently elevated amplitude in signal being an indication of hypertension. The devices reviewed in Table 1 do not measure BP, but information about cuffless wearables for blood pressure monitoring can be found elsewhere.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 studies (n = 974) was performed in 2022. 81% of devices in the analyses used PPG to estimate BP against a reference device. The authors defined devices with a mean bias of < 5 mmHg as valid as a consensus. Eight devices showed a mean bias of < 5 mmHg for SBP and DBP compared with a reference device, three of which were commercially available (B-Pro, Somnotouch-NIBP and T2-Mart). Differences were not observed between the wearables and reference devices for SBP (pooled mean difference = 3.42 mmHg, 95% CI: −2.17, 9.01) and DBP (pooled mean difference = 1.16 mmHg, 95% CI: −1.26, 3.58), however, confidence intervals around the estimates was wide. Recent data have cast doubt about the accuracy of some these devices, and cuffless-based technology, and our own data have shown limited agreement between cuffless and cuff-based ambulatory BP monitoring.

Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of a bidirectional text monitoring program focused on BP control and medication adherence with and without social support in adults with hypertension. Design, Setting, and Participants. Of the 206 patients with a final BP measurement at 4 months, BP was controlled in 49% of patients in the RM arm, 31% of patients in the SS arm, and 40% of patients in the UC arm; these rates did not differ significantly between the intervention arms and the UC group. Patients in both the RM and SS arms were mailed an electronic BP cuff. An adult size, extra-large cuff was provided upon patient request. Patients received 3 text prompts per week to take and submit their BP measurements, and 1 text each week asking them about their medication adherence for the past week.

Secondary analyses assessed achievement of BP control by trial arm using χ² tests and repeated the analyses for systolic BP with diastolic BP at the 4-month visit. In addition, we tracked BP measurements by arm from the EHR that were obtained through UC for up to 8 months after the end of the trial. We also compared self-reported BP monitoring and medication adherence by trial arm at baseline and at the end-of-study visit based on patient survey responses. Systolic and diastolic BPs were compared using multivariable linear regression, and BP control was evaluated using χ² tests, with a 2-sided P <. 02 considered significant. The mean percentage of expected BP measurements received for patients in the RM and SS arms was compared against the UC arm using an independent t test with a 2-sided P <. 05 considered significant.

Self-Measured Blood Pressure Monitoring Strong scientific evidence shows that self-measured blood pressure monitoring, also known as home blood pressure monitoring, plus clinical support helps people with hypertension lower their blood pressure. SMBP monitoring is the regular measurement of blood pressure by the patient outside the clinical setting, either at home or elsewhere. SMBP requires the use of a home blood pressure measurement device by the patient to measure blood pressure at different points in time. SMBP plus clinical support can improve access to care and quality of care for people with hypertension while making blood pressure control more convenient and accessible across the population. Clinical support includes regular one-on-one counseling, web-based or telephonic support tools, and educational classes.

The SMBP Forum was an opportunity for clinical, public health, and community-based partners to exchange best and promising practices, identify solutions to common obstacles, and share resources to accelerate SMBP monitoring uptake. Past forum recordings, slides, and other resources can be found on the SMBP Forum Confluence page.
