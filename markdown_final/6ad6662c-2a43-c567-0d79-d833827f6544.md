## Question

A 54-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with severe acute pancreatitis. On day 7 of admission, he develops a fever of 39°C, tachycardia, and increasing abdominal pain. Laboratory tests show a rising white blood cell count and elevated C-reactive protein. A contrast-enhanced CT scan reveals a large peripancreatic fluid collection with areas of suspected necrosis. The surgical team is considering starting broad-spectrum antibiotics but is uncertain whether the collection is infected.

According to current guidelines, what is the recommended role of CT-guided fine needle aspiration of the peripancreatic fluid collection in this patient, and how should the results influence management?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of CT-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) in suspected infected pancreatic necrosis at day 7 of severe acute pancreatitis, and how results should influence management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the diagnostic challenge at this time point. Then, I should verify what contemporary high-credibility guidelines say about FNA. Next, I will examine the rationale for avoiding routine FNA, including false negatives and procedural risks. After that, I should review alternative diagnostic clues that justify empiric therapy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation and clarify when, if ever, FNA is still reasonable.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and why infection is suspected. At day 7, new fever, tachycardia, rising WBC, and elevated CRP in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis raise concern for infected necrosis, which peaks in incidence around weeks 2–4 and carries substantially higher mortality than sterile necrosis, especially when organ failure is present [^a0e3da1b] [^ba458ef7] [^812a8550].

> Wait, let me verify the current guideline stance on FNA. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on the same message: do not routinely perform CT-guided FNA for suspected infected necrosis. The 2024 ACG guideline explicitly suggests against FNA in suspected infected pancreatic necrosis, and the 2020 AGA Clinical Practice Update advises that CT-guided FNA is unnecessary in the vast majority of cases, with ESGE recommending against routine FNA and reserving it only when clinical and imaging signs are unclear [^aae75d18] [^b9b6b008] [^65081487].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review why guidelines discourage FNA. The main reasons are a meaningful false-negative rate (about 20–25%), the risk of converting a sterile collection into an infected one, and the fact that results rarely change immediate management when clinical and imaging suspicion is high, particularly when gas is present on CT or the patient is deteriorating [^5bb225e8] [^829ca8d1] [^65081487].

> I need to check what to rely on instead of FNA. Gas within a peripancreatic necrotic collection on contrast-enhanced CT is a highly specific sign of infection and, when present, justifies empiric antibiotics and consideration of source control without FNA; clinical deterioration with sepsis, bacteremia, or persistent SIRS likewise supports treating as infected necrosis, recognizing that clinical signs alone are sensitive but nonspecific early on [^81c67975] [^65546ac0] [^90152b04].

> Let me consider the management implications if infection is suspected. I should confirm that antibiotics with good penetration into necrotic tissue are indicated when infection is strongly suspected or proven, with carbapenems, fluoroquinolones plus metronidazole, or broad-spectrum cephalosporins plus metronidazole as reasonable choices; routine antifungals are not recommended initially, and antibiotics should be de-escalated or stopped if cultures are negative and the patient improves [^73b58146] [^5a1b1b3a] [^449845b1].

> Next, I should review source control and timing. If the patient is unstable or failing to improve, a step-up approach is preferred: start with image-guided percutaneous drainage or endoscopic transmural drainage, reserving minimally invasive or open necrosectomy for refractory cases; importantly, interventions are generally delayed until collections mature (often ≥ 4 weeks) unless there is uncontrolled sepsis or another urgent indication, as early surgery increases morbidity and mortality [^a1dd5572] [^86028fbc] [^2a7ff6f3].

> But wait, what if the diagnosis remains uncertain and the patient is stable? I should double-check the narrow role for FNA. FNA may still be considered selectively when clinical and imaging features are equivocal, the patient is stable, and a microbiologic result would meaningfully alter management; even then, a negative FNA does not exclude infection, so clinical vigilance remains essential and antibiotics may still be warranted if suspicion persists [^65081487] [^5bb225e8].

> I will now examine how results should influence management if FNA is performed despite the general recommendation. A positive Gram stain or culture confirms infected necrosis and should prompt targeted antibiotics and source control as indicated; a negative result in a high-suspicion scenario should not preclude treatment, given the false-negative rate and the potential for sampling error, so management should remain clinically driven [^5bb225e8] [^65546ac0].

> Let me synthesize the bottom line. At day 7 with new fever, rising inflammatory markers, and necrosis on CT, the balance of evidence and guidelines favors assuming infected necrosis and starting appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics with good necrosis penetration, while avoiding routine CT-guided FNA; reserve FNA for rare, select cases where clinical and imaging features are equivocal and a microbiologic result would change management, and proceed with step-up source control if the patient deteriorates or fails to improve [^aae75d18] [^b9b6b008] [^a1dd5572].

---

CT-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) is **not routinely recommended** for suspected infected pancreatic necrosis [^b9b6b008] because of false negatives, procedural risks, and limited impact on management [^829ca9d1]. Current guidelines advise **clinical and imaging-based diagnosis** [^65546ac0], with FNA reserved for cases where infection remains uncertain after initial evaluation or when cultures would change management [^65081487]. If infection is suspected, start broad-spectrum antibiotics with good necrosis penetration [^73b58146] and consider a step-up approach (percutaneous or endoscopic drainage, then minimally invasive necrosectomy) if the patient deteriorates or fails to improve [^a1dd5572] [^2a7ff6f3].

## Current guideline recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation regarding ct-guided fna** |
|-|-|
| American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) 2020 | - Do not perform routine CT-guided FNA for suspected infected pancreatic necrosis [^b9b6b008] [^4317b80e] <br/> - Reserve FNA for cases with diagnostic uncertainty or when results would alter management [^65081487] |
| American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2024 | - Suggests against FNA in suspected infected pancreatic necrosis [^aae75d18] [^0f9a6578] <br/> - Emphasizes clinical and imaging-based diagnosis [^65546ac0] |
| European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) 2018 | - Recommends against routine FNA of pancreatic collections [^65081487] <br/> - Use FNA only when clinical and imaging signs are unclear [^65081487] |

---

## Rationale for avoiding routine fna

- **False negatives**: FNA has a significant false-negative rate (20–25%) [^5bb225e8], risking missed infections and delayed therapy [^829ca9d1].
- **Procedural risks**: FNA carries risks of bleeding, infection, and organ injury [^notfound].
- **Limited impact**: Results rarely change management when clinical and imaging features strongly suggest infection [^notfound].

---

## Alternative diagnostic approach

Current practice relies on **clinical and imaging criteria** to diagnose infected necrosis:

- **Clinical signs**: Fever, leukocytosis, rising CRP, and clinical deterioration [^65546ac0] [^a0e3da1b].
- **Imaging signs**: Gas bubbles within necrotic collections on contrast-enhanced CT are highly specific for infection [^81c67975] [^7a6f190e].
- **Biomarkers**: Procalcitonin (PCT) may help identify infection, though it is not specific [^90152b04] [^0e70446a].

---

## Role of fna in specific scenarios

FNA may be considered when:

- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: Clinical and imaging findings are inconclusive [^65081487].
- **Management change**: Results would alter antibiotic therapy or intervention planning [^notfound].
- **Research purposes**: To obtain microbiological data for study or epidemiology [^notfound].

---

## Impact of fna results on management

Positive FNA (culture or Gram stain) confirms infection and supports **targeted antibiotics** [^1e702c45] and source control (drainage or necrosectomy) [^a1dd5572]. Negative FNA does not exclude infection; if suspicion remains high, **continue antibiotics** and reassess clinically and radiologically [^5bb225e8].

---

## Current management approach

When infection is suspected, **start broad-spectrum antibiotics** with good necrosis penetration (e.g. carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, metronidazole) [^73b58146] [^5a1b1b3a]. If the patient deteriorates or fails to improve, use a step-up approach: percutaneous or endoscopic drainage, then minimally invasive necrosectomy if needed [^a1dd5572] [^2a7ff6f3].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Routine FNA**: Not recommended for suspected infected pancreatic necrosis [^b9b6b008] [^65081487].
- **Reserve FNA**: For diagnostic uncertainty or when results would change management [^65081487].
- **Clinical/imaging diagnosis**: Preferred approach based on clinical and CT findings [^65546ac0] [^81c67975].
- **Antibiotics**: Start broad-spectrum therapy when infection is suspected [^73b58146] [^5a1b1b3a].
- **Step-up approach**: Use if patient deteriorates or fails to improve [^a1dd5572] [^2a7ff6f3].

---

CT-guided FNA is **not routinely recommended** for suspected infected pancreatic necrosis; use clinical and imaging criteria to guide diagnosis and reserve FNA for select cases. If infection is suspected, start appropriate antibiotics and escalate to drainage or necrosectomy only if the patient fails to improve.

### The role of antimicrobial therapy in severe acute pancreatitis [^eedf5c82]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The role of antimicrobial therapy in patients with severe acute pancreatitis is to treat secondary pancreatic infections to prevent systemic sepsis and death. Infected pancreatic necrosis is diagnosed using image-directed fine needle aspiration with culture and Gram's stain. Prophylactic antibiotics have not proven efficacious, while the precise timely detection of secondary pancreatic infections is often elusive. A high clinical index of suspicion should prompt the empiric initiation of antimicrobial therapy until culture results are available. Positive cultures should guide antimicrobial therapy, and for infected pancreatic necrosis, antibiotics should be used in conjunction with interventional techniques for source control.

How is infected necrosis managed?

Infected necrosis occurs in 40–70% of patients in the second or third week of the illness and is the leading cause of late mortality. The onset or worsening of organ failure in a septic context must raise suspicion of infected necrosis, and fine needle CT-guided aspiration should be considered. Antibiotics should be administered as soon as the results of the Gram stain are available. More conservative intervention than surgical necrosectomy now predominates. A step-up approach of percutaneous drainage followed, if necessary, by a minimally invasive surgical necrosectomy significantly reduces the rate of major complications and mortality by 29% compared with open surgery. Mouli et al. recently reported that a conservative initial approach with antimicrobial therapy with or without PCD was a successful approach for 64% of patients with infected necrosis. Moreover, postponement of a surgical necrosectomy provides an opportunity for acute collections to become walled-off and liquefied. A randomized study with a very small number of patients requiring secondary pancreatic debridement found endoscopic transgastric necrosectomy to be superior to surgical necrosectomy with respect to the overall rate of major complications or mortality (20 vs. 80%).

Background

Acute pancreatitis is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current management guidelines are sometimes equivocal, particularly in relation to the surgical treatment of severe disease. This review assesses available investigative and treatment strategies to allow the development of a formalized management approach.

Methods

A literature review of diagnosis, staging and management of acute pancreatitis was performed.

Results and Conclusion

Recent evidence has helped to clarify the roles of computed tomography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, prophylactic antibiotics, enteral feeding and fine-needle aspiration for bacteriology in the management of acute pancreatitis. Despite a relative shortage of prospective randomized trials there has been a significant change in the surgical management of acute pancreatitis over the past 20 years. This change has been away from early aggressive surgical intervention towards more conservative management, except when infected necrosis is confirmed. A formalized approach, with appropriate use of the various non-surgical and surgical options, is feasible in the management of severe acute pancreatitis.

Objective

Acute pancreatitis represents a spectrum of disease ranging from a mild, self-limited course requiring only brief hospitalization to a rapidly progressive, fulminant illness resulting in the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), with or without accompanying sepsis. The goal of this consensus statement is to provide recommendations regarding the management of the critically ill patient with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).

Data Sources and Methods

An international consensus conference was held in April 2004 to develop recommendations for the management of the critically ill patient with SAP. Evidence-based recommendations were developed by a jury of ten persons representing surgery, internal medicine, and critical care after conferring with experts and reviewing the pertinent literature to address specific questions concerning the management of patients with severe acute pancreatitis.

Data Synthesis

There were a total of 23 recommendations developed to provide guidance to critical care clinicians caring for the patient with SAP. Topics addressed were as follows. 1) When should the patient admitted with acute pancreatitis be monitored in an ICU or stepdown unit? 2) Should patients with severe acute pancreatitis receive prophylactic antibiotics? 3) What is the optimal mode and timing of nutritional support for the patient with SAP? 4) What are the indications for surgery in acute pancreatitis, what is the optimal timing for intervention, and what are the roles for less invasive approaches including percutaneous drainage and laparoscopy? 5) Under what circumstances should patients with gallstone pancreatitis undergo interventions for clearance of the bile duct? 6) Is there a role for therapy targeting the inflammatory response in the patient with SAP? Some of the recommendations included a recommendation against the routine use of prophylactic systemic antibacterial or antifungal agents in patients with necrotizing pancreatitis. The jury also recommended against pancreatic debridement or drainage for sterile necrosis, limiting debridement or drainage to those with infected pancreatic necrosis and/or abscess confirmed by radiologic evidence of gas or results or fine needle aspirate. Furthermore, the jury recommended that whenever possible, operative necrosectomy and/or drainage be delayed at least 2–3 wk to allow for demarcation of the necrotic pancreas.

Conclusions

This consensus statement provides 23 different recommendations concerning the management of patients with SAP. These recommendations differ in several ways from previous recommendations because of the release of recent data concerning the management of these patients and also because of the focus on the critically ill patient. There are a number of important questions that could not be answered using an evidence-based approach, and areas in need of further research were identified.

### The management of suspected pancreatic sepsis [^b0f43e6d]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The management of infected pancreatic necrosis is centered on image-guided fine needle aspiration followed by antibiotic therapy that is based on microbiologic culture results. The authors favor targeted antibiotic therapy rather than routine prophylactic antibiotic coverage. Prompt surgical debridement is recommended for patients who have infected necrosis who are suitable operative candidates. Newer surgical, percutaneous, and endoscopic techniques, as well as prolonged antibiotic therapy without intervention, are being evaluated as alternatives to operative debridement. Well-designed prospective trials will help to determine optimal treatment for patients who have infected pancreatic necrosis.

Spectrum of AP

The 2012 revised Atlanta Criteria defined grades of severity and types of AP. These distinctions are important to identify patients who are at risk for severe disease so that they can be carefully monitored and supported, in addition to identifying those patients who may have a protracted disease course and need invasive intervention. Mild AP is self-limiting, does not lead to organ failure, and does not have local or systemic complications. Moderately severe AP causes transient organ failure that resolves within 48 hours and/or has local complications such as fluid collections or causes exacerbation of comorbid conditions. Severe AP is defined by persistent single or multiple organ failure lasting greater than 48 hours. Two separate types of pancreatitis were redefined in 2012 as acute edematous pancreatitis and acute necrotizing pancreatitis, the latter often resulting in a significant inflammatory response and has greater potential for a superinfection.

Approximately 5% to 10% of patients develop necrotizing pancreatitis. If fluid and necrotic pancreatic or peripancreatic debris form collections within 4 weeks of presentation they are termed acute necrotic collections. After 4 weeks these collections mature, become encapsulated and are then termed walled-off pancreatic necrosis. These can be in a number of locations throughout the abdomen in various patterns and sizes (see figures 1–5). Infection of these collections often necessitates invasive intervention. In the past, tangible proof of infection via an image-guided fine needle aspiration or gas seen within the collections on CT scan was preferred to justify intervention. Protocols have been modified to forgo this step based on the suspicion of infection, particularly in patients who will likely undergo an intervention and can have cultures taken at that time.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^90152b04]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Statement (infected necrosis and antibiotics)

Antibiotics are always recommended to treat infected severe acute pancreatitis. However the diagnosis is challenging due to the clinical picture that cannot be distinguished from other infectious complications or from the inflammatory status caused by acute pancreatitis (2A).
Serum measurements of procalcitonin (PCT) may be valuable in predicting the risk of developing infected pancreatic necrosis (1B).
A CT-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for Gram stain and culture can confirm an infected severe acute pancreatitis and drive antibiotic therapy but is no longer in routine use (1B).

Discussion

Antibiotics are always recommended to treat infected acute pancreatitis. However, diagnosis of infected pancreatitis is challenging due to the clinical picture that cannot be distinguished from other infectious complications or from the inflammatory status caused by acute pancreatitis. The timing of infection in pancreatic necrosis is variable and unpredictable and peaks in the second to fourth week after the onset of pancreatitis. Clinical signs may be very sensitive yet are not specific enough.

A limited number of smaller studies evaluated C-reactive protein (CRP). Conversely, PCT has been investigated as an effective predictor for the severity of acute pancreatitis and the risk of developing infected pancreatitis. PCT is the inactive 116 amino acid propeptide of the biologically active hormone calcitonin, which was first described to have significantly increased concentrations in patients with bacterial and fungal infections.

Several studies have demonstrated that serum measurements of PCT may be valuable in predicting the risk of developing infected pancreatic necrosis.

The diagnostic tool of choice remains CT-guided FNA of the pancreatic necrotic areas. A CT-guided FNA for Gram stain and culture can guide clinicians in choosing an appropriate individualized antibiotic regimen. However, because of the high rate of false negative findings, some centers have abandoned the routine use of FNA.

The presence of gas in the retroperitoneal area is considered indicative of infected pancreatitis in the context of severe acute pancreatitis, but it is only present in a limited number of patients.

Statement (type of antibiotics)

In patients with infected necrosis, antibiotics known to penetrate pancreatic necrosis should be used (1B).
In patients with infected necrosis, the spectrum of empirical antibiotic regimen should include both aerobic and anaerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms. Routine prophylactic administration of antifungal is not recommended in patients with infected acute pancreatitis, although Candida spp. are common in patients with infected pancreatic necrosis and indicate patients with a higher risk of mortality (1B).

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^ad9a5f84]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Infected necrosis and antibiotic management in acute pancreatitis — diagnostic sampling, antimicrobial selection, and timing are outlined. There is some controversy as to whether a CT-FNA is necessary in all patients, and antibiotics can be started for suspected infection on clinical grounds even without the FNA of the pancreatic necrosis. In proven infection by blood or other body fluid cultures or by the presence of gas in the pancreatic necrosis, the need for antibiotics is clear, and antibiotics should be chosen known to penetrate the necrosis, such as carbapenems, quinolones, cephalosporins, and metronidazole. Pooling 11 studies that include 1,136 patients, there is a significant correlation between the timing of surgery and mortality, and postponing necrosectomy in stable patients with antibiotics until 30 days after initial hospital admission is associated with a decreased mortality. Routine administration of antifungal agents along with prophylactic or therapeutic antibiotics is also not needed.

D. During the second week from disease onset

1. Continue supportive care; try to get rid of excessive third space fluids if possible.

2. If the patient is septic at end of the second week or later, consider repeat CT-scan with image guided FNA and after that consider empiric antibiotics for possible infected pancreatic necrosis.

3. If infected necrosis is diagnosed, image guided percutaneous drainage of collection should be done.

4. An alternative to FNA is to put a percutaneous drain directly into the collection and take samples, however, if cultures are negative the drain should be removed as prolonged drainage may cause increased risk for infection.

5. Surgery for infected pancreatic necrosis should be avoided during the first two weeks, because necrosis is not well demarcated and surgery it is associated with high risk of hemorrhage and high mortality.

E. After the second week from disease onset

1. Same as D1 – D4, repeat CT-scan if patient deteriorates; repeat CT-scan weekly if the patient is not recovering.

2. Percutaneus drainage of infected pancreatic necrosis can be continued if the patient shows signs of recovery, some patients may even avoid surgical treatment.

3. If the patient is deteriorating despite of setting of percutaneous drainage, proceed to surgical necrosectomy, whether there is proven infection or not.

4. In patients who do not recover but are stable, surgery for pancreatic necrosis is possible, but should be postponed as late as possible, preferably later than 4 weeks after disease onset. CT-scan before surgery is recommended for localization of necrosis and to confirm the demarcation of necrosis.

### Endoscopic management of acute necrotizing pancreatitis: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) evidence-based multidisciplinary guidelines [^65081487]. Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

1: ESGE suggests using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) as the first-line imaging modality on admission when indicated and up to the 4th week from onset in the absence of contraindications. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used instead of CT in patients with contraindications to contrast-enhanced CT, and after the 4th week from onset when invasive intervention is considered because the contents (liquid vs. solid) of pancreatic collections are better characterized by MRI and evaluation of pancreatic duct integrity is possible. Weak recommendation, low quality evidence. 2: ESGE recommends against routine percutaneous fine needle aspiration (FNA) of (peri)pancreatic collections. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. FNA should be performed only if there is suspicion of infection and clinical/imaging signs are unclear. Weak recommendation, low quality evidence. 3: ESGE recommends initial goal-directed intravenous fluid therapy with Ringer's lactate (e.g. 5-10mL/kg/h) at onset. Fluid requirements should be patient-tailored and reassessed at frequent intervals. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 4: ESGE recommends against antibiotic or probiotic prophylaxis of infectious complications in acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 5: ESGE recommends invasive intervention for patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis and clinically suspected or proven infected necrosis. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence.ESGE suggests that the first intervention for infected necrosis should be delayed for 4 weeks if tolerated by the patient. Weak recommendation, low quality evidence. 6: ESGE recommends performing endoscopic or percutaneous drainage of (suspected) infected walled-off necrosis as the first interventional method, taking into account the location of the walled-off necrosis and local expertise. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 7: ESGE suggests that, in the absence of improvement following endoscopic transmural drainage of walled-off necrosis, endoscopic necrosectomy or minimally invasive surgery (if percutaneous drainage has already been performed) is to be preferred over open surgery as the next therapeutic step, taking into account the location of the walled-off necrosis and local expertise. Weak recommendation, low quality evidence. 8: ESGE recommends long-term indwelling of transluminal plastic stents in patients with disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. Lumen-apposing metal stents should be retrieved within 4 weeks to avoid stent-related adverse effects. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence.

### American Gastroenterological Association clinical practice update: management of pancreatic necrosis [^4317b80e]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update — best practice advice 1–3 states: BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Pancreatic necrosis is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach, including gastroenterologists, surgeons, interventional radiologists, and specialists in critical care medicine, infectious disease, and nutrition. In situations where clinical expertise may be limited, consideration should be given to transferring patients with significant pancreatic necrosis to an appropriate tertiary-care center. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Antimicrobial therapy is best indicated for culture-proven infection in pancreatic necrosis or when infection is strongly suspected, and routine use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection of sterile necrosis is not recommended. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: When infected necrosis is suspected, broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics with ability to penetrate pancreatic necrosis should be favored, routine use of antifungal agents is not recommended, and computed tomography–guided fine-needle aspiration for Gram stain and cultures is unnecessary in the majority of cases.

### Contemporary management of infected necrosis complicating severe acute pancreatitis [^b8bfa864]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Pancreatic necrosis complicating severe acute pancreatitis is a challenging scenario in contemporary critical care practice; it requires multidisciplinary care in a setting where there is a relatively limited evidence base to support decision making. This commentary provides a concise overview of current management of patients with infected necrosis, focusing on detection, the role of pharmacologic intervention, and the timing and nature of surgical interventions. Fine-needle aspiration of necrosis remains the mainstay for establishment of infection. Pharmacological intervention includes antibiotic therapy as an adjunct to surgical debridement/drainage and, more recently, drotrecogin alfa. Specific concerns remain regarding the suitability of drotrecogin alfa in this setting. Early surgical intervention is unhelpful; surgery is indicated when there is strong evidence for infection of necrotic tissue, with the current trend being toward 'less drastic' surgical interventions.

### Staged multidisciplinary step-up management for necrotizing pancreatitis [^3f0470c3]. The British Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Some 15 per cent of all patients with acute pancreatitis develop necrotizing pancreatitis, with potentially significant consequences for both patients and healthcare services.

Methods

This review summarizes the latest insights into the surgical and medical management of necrotizing pancreatitis. General management strategies for the treatment of complications are discussed in relation to the stage of the disease.

Results

Frequent clinical evaluation of the patient's condition remains paramount in the first 24-72h of the disease. Liberal goal-directed fluid resuscitation and early enteral nutrition should be provided. Urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is indicated when cholangitis is suspected, but it is unclear whether this is appropriate in patients with predicted severe biliary pancreatitis without cholangitis. Antibiotic prophylaxis does not prevent infection of necrosis and antibiotics are not indicated as part of initial management. Bacteriologically confirmed infections should receive targeted antibiotics. With the more conservative approach to necrotizing pancreatitis currently advocated, fine-needle aspiration culture of pancreatic or extrapancreatic necrosis will less often lead to a change in management and is therefore indicated less frequently. Optimal treatment of infected necrotizing pancreatitis consists of a staged multidisciplinary 'step-up' approach. The initial step is drainage, either percutaneous or transluminal, followed by surgical or endoscopic transluminal debridement only if needed. Debridement is delayed until the acute necrotic collection has become 'walled-off'.

Conclusion

Outcome following necrotizing pancreatitis has improved substantially in recent years as a result of a shift from early surgical debridement to a staged, minimally invasive, multidisciplinary, step-up approach.

FIGURE 1
The classification of AP.

There are 2 different manifestations of NP. Some cases have pure fluid collections without any solid or nonliquified components around the pancreas arising within 4 weeks of the diagnosis of AP, which are referred to as acute peripancreatic fluid collections. If acute peripancreatic fluid collection is not eliminated after treatment, it may develop into a cyst with a well-defined enhanced wall after 4 weeks, which is known as pancreatic pseudocyst. Other cases that have fluid collections containing necrotic materials are considered acute necrotic collection (ANC). Similarly, if acute necrotic collection does not improve after 4 weeks, it will develop into a well-circumscribed area of mixed fluid-solid collection, called walled-off necrosis.

These collections may be presented within the pancreatic parenchyma, adjacent to it, or both, and then extended to the retroperitoneal cavity. They can be sterile or infected. One week after AP onset, the necrotic tissue may be infected, but the degree of necrosis is not positively related to the chance of infection. The identification of infection is clinically important because it determines the timing of antibiotic administration. Air bubbles found in the pancreas or the peripancreatic surrounding tissues in computed tomography (CT) and positive bacterial culture report from fine-needle aspiration or radiological drainage or surgical removal from pancreatic tissue may be strongly considered as infection status. While sterile necrosis is associated with a 5% to 10% mortality rate, the mortality rate increases to 20% to 30% when necrosis becomes infected. – Thus, early recognition and institution of appropriate therapy are necessary.

The treatment of AP in the early phase is to control systemic inflammatory response syndrome and prevent organ failure and most of these are medical treatments. After the second week, we have to pay attention to local complications of infection. If there is an infection, intervention therapy is currently recommended 4 weeks later, when the necrotic area becomes more obvious. An incremental approach (step-up approach) should be adopted. Image-guided percutaneous drainage technique is considered first, and surgical debridement is the last rescue procedure. However, if there was severe retroperitoneal edema, retroperitoneal bleeding, retroperitoneal fluid accumulation, ascites, ileus, spastic intestinal obstruction, or gastrointestinal (GI) tract bleeding present which resulted in intra-abdominal hypertension and the abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) and that had no response to medical therapy, we had to deal with them immediately by surgical laparotomy.

In this study, we reported and analyzed our experience with surgical intervention strategies for the NP patients with ACS.

Infections and the use of antibiotics

A quarter of patients with acute pancreatitis develop infectious complication. Patients with severe acute pancreatitis are more susceptible to develop infections. Patients with organ dysfunctions have higher incidence of bacterial translocation. They also have impaired immune system. The majority of infections are extrapancreatic such as bacteremia and pneumonia. The half of these infections develop within the first week post admission. Diagnosis of infected pancreatic necrosis is usually done significantly later, the peak incidence is between the third and fourth week from the onset of symptoms. However, the actual contamination of necrosis happens probably much earlier. Organ failure, early bacteremia and the extent of pancreatic necrosis are associated with increased risk of infected necrosis. Diagnosis of infected pancreatic necrosis is challenging. Clinical signs of sepsis are too unspecific for definitive diagnosis and CT-scan shows gas bubbles in the necrotic collection in less than ten percent of patients. Fine needle aspiration with bacterial culture has a substantial rate (20–25%) of false negative results, and thus, is not reliable to rule out infection.

Prophylactic antibiotics have been studied in many randomized trials with conflicting results and according to several meta-analyses and systematic reviews there is no evidence that patients benefit from prophylactic antibiotics. However, there has been a nonsignificant trend for lower mortality and reduced number of infections, especially extrapancreatic infections in patients treated with prophylactic antibiotics. The randomized trials have been conducted with small samples sizes and some studies included a substantial number of patients with mild pancreatitis with minimal risk of mortality and low risk of infectious complications. Although trials have not provided evidence that prophylactic antibiotic are effective they have not proved that they are not effective. Taken together the limitations of the trials and the fact that patients with organ failure are susceptible to infections, we believe that the use of prophylactic antibiotic in patients with severe pancreatitis is justified. High incidence of infections in patients with severe pancreatitis and worse survival in patients who develop infection supports this policy. Indication for initiation of prophylactic antibiotics should be based on clinical judgment. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), signs of organ dysfunction, presence of IAH, hyperglycemia, low plasma calcium or high creatinine could be helpful in predicting severe disease.

### The role of endoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory pancreatic fluid collections [^829ca8d1]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

Infected pancreatic necrosis — clinical indicators and diagnostic approach note that infected necrosis may not initially be distinguishable clinically from sterile necrosis, but the distinction usually becomes clinically apparent 2 to 4 weeks after the onset of disease when the incidence of infected necrosis peaks. Signs include new-onset or persistent sepsis, clinical deterioration despite adequate support and an alternative source of infection, or gas bubbles within the pancreatic fluid collection (PFC) on radiologic imaging. Endoscopic ultrasound–guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is generally not recommended to determine whether a PFC is infected because it is associated with a high false-negative rate and may contaminate a previously sterile fluid collection, and a study that intervened on clinical suspicion without FNA was accurate in > 90% of cases.

Computed tomography (CT)-guided pancreatic interventions — CT-guided percutaneous pancreatic interventions are well-established techniques, and acute peripancreatic fluid collections, postnecrotic fluid collections, and pancreatic pseudocysts are primary reasons for CT-guided catheter drainage; if significant communication exists with the distal duct system, external drainage will likely be unsuccessful and surgery or endoscopic transpapillary drainage may be required for more definitive treatment; percutaneous fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of pancreatic masses is described as a safe and accurate method, and when a clear window to the lesion is absent, a transorgan, transintestinal, and/or transvenous route may be necessary in up to 40% of the cases requiring CT guidance; although traversing the intestine is thought by some to increase infection risk, older studies have reported a low risk of significant complication.

### Position paper: timely interventions in severe acute pancreatitis are crucial for survival [^cd2730cf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

If prophylactic antibiotics are not given, empiric use of antibiotics is encouraged in patients who develop organ dysfunctions, because there is high risk of bacteremia during the first week. Patients with severe pancreatitis fulfill the criteria of severe sepsis in case of infection and there is no rapid and reliable diagnostic method available to rule out infection. Delayed administration of antibiotics has been shown to worsen survival in patients with severe sepsis with or without septic shock. After the end of the second week, empiric antibiotics may be needed for treatment of infected pancreatic necrosis if sepsis continues or the patient does not recover. Empiric antibiotics at this stage should cover potential pathogens including gram negative rods and gram positive cocci. The role of empiric antifungals is not clear. Fine needle aspiration for microbiological samples should be taken if infected necrosis is suspected, although negative samples do not rule out infection. Positive samples help in selection of antimicrobials and initiation of possible antifungal therapy. Prophylactic or empiric antibiotic should be discontinued when the patient recovers from organ dysfunctions and there is no evidence of infection.

Surgery for infected necrosis

Infected pancreatic or peripancreatic necrosis has traditionally been considered an indisputable indication for surgical debridement. Infected necrosis is a significant source of sepsis and removal of devitalized tissue is believed to be necessary for control of sepsis. However, infection usually continues after necrosectomy, especially if necrotic tissue is left in place. Before demarcation of necrosis develops, usually after 4 weeks from disease onset, it is impossible to remove all necrotic tissue without causing hemorrhage. Early surgical debridement has been associated with high risk of hemorrhage leading to increased organ dysfunction and death. If necrosectomy for infected pancreatic necrosis is done within the first two weeks the mortality rate is 75%, but gradually decreases to 5% when done later than four weeks after the onset of symptoms. Multiple organ dysfunction increases mortality risk considerably in patients with infected necrosis. The mortality rate increases in proportion to the number of failed organs. Infected pancreatic necrosis does not cause significant risk of death in absence of organ dysfunction. Because high mortality is associated with early surgery and multiple organ dysfunction, it is recommended that surgery for infected necrosis should be postponed as late as possible, preferable later than four week from disease onset. Percutaneus drainage of the liquid component of the infected acute necrotic collection may serve as a bridge to surgery. Sterile collections do not need drainage. Placement of a drain into a sterile necrotic collection can result in secondary infection, and a prolonged drainage may increase the risk further.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute pancreatitis: the position statement of the Italian association for the study of the pancreas [^b3ed69b3]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2008). Low credibility.

This medical position statement has been developed by the board of ProInf AISP (Computerized Project on Acute Pancreatitis) Study Group. The evidence and key recommendations were discussed at a dedicated meeting held in Milan on September 2007 and during this meeting the main clinical and therapeutic medical topics were extensively discussed. Each of the proposed recommendations was discussed and an initial consensus was reached. Acute pancreatitis in Italy is a disease of increasing annual incidence. The diagnosis of the disease should be established within 48hours of admission. Early identification of patients at risk of developing a severe attack of acute pancreatitis is of great importance because rapid therapeutic interventions improve outcome. The endoscopic approach seems to be most beneficial measure in patients with acute pancreatitis with jaundice and in those with cholangitis. The development of infected necrosis should be assessed using fine-needle aspiration and the sample should be cultured for germ isolation and characterization. The role of early ERCP in all patients with severe acute pancreatitis of biliary origin is still controversial. The data supporting the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infection of necrosis are conflicting. The refeeding is a crucial topic in patients who have recovered from an acute episode of mild acute pancreatitis, but there are very few studies on this issue.

### Intra-abdominal fungal infections complicating acute pancreatitis: a review [^dee7fa9e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Intra-abdominal infections of pancreatic or peripancreatic necrotic tissue complicate the clinical course of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and are associated with significant morbidity. Fungal infection of necrotic pancreatic tissue is increasingly being reported. The incidence of intra-abdominal pancreatic fungal infection (PFI) varies from 5% to 68.5%. Candida albicans is the most frequently isolated fungus in patients with necrotizing pancreatitis. Prolonged use of prophylactic antibiotics, prolonged placement of chronic indwelling devices, and minimally invasive or surgical interventions for pancreatic fluid collections further increase the risk of PFI. Computed tomography- or ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of pancreatic necrosis is a safe, reliable method for establishing pancreatic infection. Amphotericin B appears to be the most effective antifungal treatment. Drainage and debridement of infected necrosis are also critical for eradication of fungi from the poorly perfused pancreatic or peripancreatic tissues where the antifungal agents may not reach to achieve therapeutic levels. Fungal infection adversely affects the outcome of patients with SAP and is associated with increased morbidity, although the mortality rate is not increased specifically because of PFI. Although antifungal prophylaxis has been suggested for patients on broad-spectrum antibiotics, no randomized controlled trials have yet studied its efficacy in preventing PFI.

### Management of infected pancreatic necrosis in the intensive care unit: a narrative review [^1e702c45]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe acute pancreatitis is marked by organ failure and (peri)pancreatic necrosis with local complications such as infected necrosis. Infection of these necrotic collections together with organ failure remain the major causes of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) in acute pancreatitis. Appropriate treatment of infected necrosis is essential to reduce morbidity and mortality. Overall knowledge of the treatment options within a multidisciplinary team-with special attention to the appropriate use of antimicrobial therapy and invasive treatment techniques for source control-is essential in the treatment of this complex disease.

Objectives

To address the current state of microbiological diagnosis, antimicrobial treatment, and source control for infected pancreatic necrosis in the ICU.

Sources

A literature search was performed using the Medline and Cochrane libraries for articles subsequent to 2003 using the keywords: infected necrosis, pancreatitis, intensive care medicine, treatment, diagnosis and antibiotic(s).

Content

This narrative review provides an overview of key elements of diagnosis and treatment of infected pancreatic necrosis in the ICU.

Implications

In pancreatic necrosis it is essential to continuously (re)evaluate the indication for antimicrobial treatment and invasive source control. Invasive diagnostics (e.g. through fine-needle aspiration, FNA), preferably prior to the start of broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, is advocated. Antimicrobial stewardship principles apply: paying attention to altered pharmacokinetics in the critically ill, de-escalation of broad-spectrum therapy once cultures become available, and early withdrawal of antibiotics once source control has been established. This is important to prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance, especially in a group of patients who may require repeated courses of antibiotics during the prolonged course of their illness.

### Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage of infected pancreatic necrosis [^18df4815]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Therapeutic management

All the patients with acute pancreatitis received initially conservative treatment including intravenous fluids, nutritional support and prophylactic antibiotics in selected cases. Radiological or surgical intervention was postponed as long as possible to allow maximal demarcation and liquefaction of the devitalized pancreatic and peripancreatic tissues. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) for recognition of pancreatic infection is not practiced routinely in our institution and the necessity of intervention was based on clinical, radiological and laboratory grounds.

The indication for PCD in this series was a deteriorating clinical condition of the patient with persistent fever, increasing C-reactive protein level (CRP) and leucocytosis or presence of peripancreatic gas on CT scans. The site and technique of percutaneous catheter drainage was chosen based on the location, size and extent of the peripancreatic collections. The route of access was planned by means of transabdominal ultrasonography, and the free-hand technique was used for placement of the catheters into the liquid area of the necrosis in most cases. Our preferred approach was retroperitoneal through the left lumbar access with the path located between the left kidney and the descending colon (Fig. 1). When this route was not feasible, the drainage was alternatively performed using the anterior transperitoneal access through the gastrocolic ligament or other transperitoneal access in selected cases. The collections located in the right perirenal space were approached retroperitoneally through the right lumbar access between the kidney and the ascending colon. Tandem trocar technique was used for placement of the catheters that were 12F in size or smaller. Larger catheters were inserted using the Seldinger technique. The catheters of more than 16F in diameter were used preferably for replacement and required prior instrumental dilatation of the access path. One catheter was used for each access site and the drains were left for gravidity drainage and irrigated with saline at least once a day. The catheters were upsized or additional drainage was established in patients with persistent local sepsis. The procedures were performed under local anesthesia, and general anesthesia was used for patient's comfort in selected cases. After the drainage procedure, antibiotic therapy was modified according to the susceptibility report and continued for at least 7 days. The indication for crossover to surgical debridement was lack of improvement despite of percutaneous drainage with large-bore catheters or complications requiring surgery. Up to 2009, open necrosectomy was performed after failure of percutaneous drainage. Thereafter, minimally invasive retroperitoneal necrosectomy was attempted preferably in patients with percutaneous drainage previously established through the left lumbar access. Our technique of minimally invasive retroperitoneal pancreatic necrosectomy using single-port access has been reported elsewhere. The process of patient selection and therapeutic management for infected pancreatic necrosis in this series is illustrated in Fig. 2.

### Walled-off pancreatic necrosis: where are we? [^df8b1562]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

When and which pancreatic necrosis should be drained? The recommendation of the recently revised guidelines of the International Association of Pancreatology, the American Pancreatic Association and the American Gastroenterological Association state that there is no need of intervention in asymptomatic patients without infected necrosis, regardless of its size, location, and extension. In case of infected (confirmed on CT scan or EUS liquid aspiration), but asymptomatic necrosis, it is advisable to delay any surgical, radiologic or endoscopic approach for more than four weeks in order to facilitate the formation of WOPN with liquefication of the contents. Infected and symptomatic necrosis requires immediate drainage in order to avoid fatal complications. In these cases, minimally invasive methods of necrosectomy should be preferred to open surgery. The above-mentioned guidelines suggest that it is not indicated to perform routine percutaneous or endoscopic fine needle aspiration (FNA) of pancreatic and peripancreatic collections for the detection of infection. Infection in these cases should be assessed clinically. In any case, infection can be confirmed by FNA, and this can be useful for bacterial culture and to assess the best antibiotic therapy.

Can there be a restitutio ad integrum of the pancreatic parenchyma after WOPN drainage? In daily clinical practice it is assumed that exocrine and endocrine pancreatic functions recover completely after a mild episode of acute pancreatitis. The grade of pancreatic exocrine and endocrine insufficiency depends on the extension of the necrosis, and is strictly related to the severity of the attack of acute pancreatitis.

It is known that vital pancreatic tissue can be lost during surgical debridement of pancreatic necrosis. Actually there often is a poor demarcation between the necrotic areas and the remnant vital pancreatic parenchyma. But can surgery be avoided? Uomo et al fund that endocrine and exocrine functions recover completely in the vast majority of patients, if these undergo conservative treatment, avoiding surgery. But how can we decide which patients should be treated conservatively? And if needed, which is the best way to clean the pancreatic necrosis, especially if infected, in order to induce less traumatism to the pancreas? Surgery with open necrosectomy (an anterior or retroperitoneal approach) is associated with longer convalescence, higher morbidity, development of abdominal wall hernias, external fistulae and has increased costs, often influenced by the need of re-interventions.

### American Gastroenterological Association clinical practice update: management of pancreatic necrosis [^a1dd5572]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update is to review the available evidence and expert recommendations regarding the clinical care of patients with pancreatic necrosis and to offer concise best practice advice for the optimal management of patients with this highly morbid condition.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. This review is framed around the 15 best practice advice points agreed upon by the authors, which reflect landmark and recent published articles in this field. This expert review also reflects the experiences of the authors, who are advanced endoscopists or hepatopancreatobiliary surgeons with extensive experience in managing and teaching others to care for patients with pancreatic necrosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Pancreatic necrosis is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach, including gastroenterologists, surgeons, interventional radiologists, and specialists in critical care medicine, infectious disease, and nutrition. In situations where clinical expertise may be limited, consideration should be given to transferring patients with significant pancreatic necrosis to an appropriate tertiary-care center. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Antimicrobial therapy is best indicated for culture-proven infection in pancreatic necrosis or when infection is strongly suspected (ie, gas in the collection, bacteremia, sepsis, or clinical deterioration). Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection of sterile necrosis is not recommended. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: When infected necrosis is suspected, broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics with ability to penetrate pancreatic necrosis should be favored (eg, carbapenems, quinolones, and metronidazole). Routine use of antifungal agents is not recommended. Computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration for Gram stain and cultures is unnecessary in the majority of cases. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: In patients with pancreatic necrosis, enteral feeding should be initiated early to decrease the risk of infected necrosis. A trial of oral nutrition is recommended immediately in patients in whom there is absence of nausea and vomiting and no signs of severe ileus or gastrointestinal luminal obstruction. When oral nutrition is not feasible, enteral nutrition by either nasogastric/duodenal or nasojejunal tube should be initiated as soon as possible. Total parenteral nutrition should be considered only in cases where oral or enteral feeds are not feasible or tolerated. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Drainage and/or debridement of pancreatic necrosis is indicated in patients with infected necrosis. Drainage and/or debridement may be required in patients with sterile pancreatic necrosis and persistent unwellness marked by abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and nutritional failure or with associated complications, including gastrointestinal luminal obstruction; biliary obstruction; recurrent acute pancreatitis; fistulas; or persistent systemic inflammatory response syndrome. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Pancreatic debridement should be avoided in the early, acute period (first 2 weeks), as it has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Debridement should be optimally delayed for 4 weeks and performed earlier only when there is an organized collection and a strong indication. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Percutaneous drainage and transmural endoscopic drainage are both appropriate first-line, nonsurgical approaches in managing patients with walled-off pancreatic necrosis (WON). Endoscopic therapy through transmural drainage of WON may be preferred, as it avoids the risk of forming a pancreatocutaneous fistula. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Percutaneous drainage of pancreatic necrosis should be considered in patients with infected or symptomatic necrotic collections in the early, acute period (< 2 weeks), and in those with WON who are too ill to undergo endoscopic or surgical intervention. Percutaneous drainage should be strongly considered as an adjunct to endoscopic drainage for WON with deep extension into the paracolic gutters and pelvis or for salvage therapy after endoscopic or surgical debridement with residual necrosis burden. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Self-expanding metal stents in the form of lumen-apposing metal stents appear to be superior to plastic stents for endoscopic transmural drainage of necrosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: The use of direct endoscopic necrosectomy should be reserved for those patients with limited necrosis who do not adequately respond to endoscopic transmural drainage using large-bore, self-expanding metal stents/lumen-apposing metal stents alone or plastic stents combined with irrigation. Direct endoscopic necrosectomy is a therapeutic option in patients with large amounts of infected necrosis, but should be performed at referral centers with the necessary endoscopic expertise and interventional radiology and surgical backup. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Minimally invasive operative approaches to the debridement of acute necrotizing pancreatitis are preferred to open surgical necrosectomy when possible, given lower morbidity. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Multiple minimally invasive surgical techniques are feasible and effective, including videoscopic-assisted retroperitoneal debridement, laparoscopic transgastric debridement, and open transgastric debridement. Selection of approach is best determined by pattern of disease, physiology of the patient, experience and expertise of the multidisciplinary team, and available resources. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Open operative debridement maintains a role in the modern management of acute necrotizing pancreatitis in cases not amenable to less invasive endoscopic and/or surgical procedures. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: For patients with disconnected left pancreatic remnant after acute necrotizing mid-body necrosis, definitive surgical management with distal pancreatectomy should be undertaken in patients with reasonable operative candidacy. Insufficient evidence exists to support the management of the disconnected left pancreatic remnant with long-term transenteric endoscopic stenting. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 15: A step-up approach consisting of percutaneous drainage or endoscopic transmural drainage using either plastic stents and irrigation or self-expanding metal stents/lumen-apposing metal stents alone, followed by direct endoscopic necrosectomy, and then surgical debridement is reasonable, although approaches may vary based on the available clinical expertise.

### Management of severe acute pancreatitis [^2a7ff6f3]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

The risks, measurements of severity, and management of severe acute pancreatitis and its complications have evolved rapidly over the past decade. Evidence suggests that initial goal directed therapy, nutritional support, and vigilance for pancreatic complications are best practice. Patients can develop pancreatic fluid collections including acute pancreatic fluid collections, pancreatic pseudocysts, acute necrotic collections, and walled-off necrosis. Several randomized controlled trials and cohort studies have recently highlighted the advantage of managing these conditions with a progressive approach, with initial draining for infection followed by less invasive techniques. Surgery is no longer an early intervention and may not be needed. Instead, interventional radiologic and endoscopic methods seem to be safer with at least as good survival outcomes. Newly developed evidence based quality indicators are available to assess and improve performance. Development and clinical testing of drugs to target the mechanisms of disease are necessary for further advancements.

### Albumin infusion may decrease the mortality of hypoalbuminemia patients with severe acute pancreatitis: a retrospective cohort study [^a90f14cb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Definitions

Sepsis is defined as systemic inflammatory response syndrome caused by definite or suspected infection. Infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN) was defined by at least one of the following findings: presence of gas bubbles in the pancreas and/or in the peripancreatic tissue on a CT examination, a positive smear staining or culture result of samples obtained by imaging-guided fine needle aspiration, and/or during the first intervention (either by drainage or by surgery). Shock was defined as a systolic blood pressure < 90mmHg. Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) was defined as a sustained intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) > 20 mmHg with evidence of organ dysfunction. The outcomes also included the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, length of hospital stay, and total hospital costs, which were all defined during the whole hospitalization.

Outcomes

In this study, the primary outcome was in-hospital mortality of SAP. The secondary outcomes included sepsis, IPN, shock, ACS, persistent organ failure, the rate of mechanical ventilation and hemofiltration, length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay and total hospital costs.

### Open necrosectomy is feasible as a last resort in selected cases with infected pancreatic necrosis: a case series and systematic literature review [^7a6f190e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Imaging signs such as gas in peripancreatic collections with or without a rapid accumulation on serial imaging are accurate predictors of IPN in the majority of patients. The diagnosis of IPN, indeed, can be suspected by the patient's clinical course, by the presence of gas within the heterogeneous or homogeneous collection seen on contrast enhancement CT or when percutaneous, image-guided, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is positive for bacteria and/or fungi on Gram stain and culture. Some studies on small series of patients with IPN confirmed the results of our systematic review showing that the pathogens usually recognized on bacterial culture were oral commensal bacteria or highly virulent enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella, or Enterococcus spp, and that, less commonly, patients were found to be infected with multiple pathogens.

### Percutaneous treatment of a patient with infected necrotizing pancreatitis [^e3cda6f5]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

Background

A 50-year-old man with an acute episode of alcohol-induced chronic edematous pancreatitis and an inflammatory stenosis of the biliary tract was treated by implantation of a plastic endoprosthesis at a rural hospital in Germany. Because of his worsening condition, the patient was referred to the intensive care unit of the University Hospital, Regensburg, Germany. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed complete necrosis of the body and tail of the pancreas, formation of large retrogastric and paraduodenal fluid collections, and fluid along Gerota's fascia, as well as in the paracolic gutters. Antibiotic treatment was adjusted according to the results of microbiological testing after diagnostic puncture of the necrotic cavity.

Investigations

CT scan, CT-guided fine-needle aspiration and fluoroscopy.

Diagnosis

Infected acute necrotizing pancreatitis.

Management

Interventional treatment using large-bore percutaneous catheters to perform percutaneous necrosectomy, fragmentation of necrotic pancreatic tissue with a snare catheter and dormia basket, and aspiration. Parenteral nutrition and antibiotics were also administered.

### Severe acute pancreatitis after EUS-FNA of a pancreatic cyst: a rare, but serious complication [^6ac08772]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

As a consequence of improved quality of abdominal imaging techniques in the last decades, discovery of pancreatic cystic lesions has become more common. The clinical significance of these lesions is often unclear and poses a diagnostic dilemma. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is a subject of debate regarding its role in the diagnostic evaluation of pancreatic masses and cysts. Although risks associated with the procedure are low, consequences can be serious and even life-threatening. We report a case of a previously healthy 59-year-old woman who suffered severe acute pancreatitis after EUS-FNA of a pancreatic cyst, requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Development of infected pancreatic necrosis and, successively, bowel ischaemia, led to multiple organ failure. Despite maximal antibiotic and surgical treatment the patient succumbed to refractory septic shock. The fatal outcome of this case illustrates the importance of balanced decision-making in the diagnostic approach of pancreatic cystic lesions.

### American Gastroenterological Association clinical practice update: management of pancreatic necrosis [^d7935a7f]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Pancreatic necrosis — antimicrobial prophylaxis and diagnostic sampling — evidence indicates that in patients with severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis, the administration of prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics has no impact on rates of developing infected necrosis, systemic complications, mortality, or need for surgical intervention. In addition, there is a lack of evidence to support prophylactic use of antifungal therapy in patients with pancreatic necrosis, and thus routine administration is not recommended. Computed tomography–guided percutaneous biopsies of necrotic collections with samples sent for Gram stain and cultures can be performed to confirm the presence of infection; however, this is unnecessary in the vast majority of cases.

### Open necrosectomy in acute pancreatitis-obsolete or still useful? [^917b953e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Positive bacterial culture from fine-needle aspiration or drainage of pancreatic necrosis or gas on CT scan in necrotic collection was considered a preoperative verification of infected pancreatic necrosis. Preoperative suspicion of infected pancreatic necrosis was based on clinicians' judgment. Usually, clinicians' suspicion arose in the event of elevated infectious laboratory parameters, new onset fever, or new onset organ failure at a later stage of the disease. If infected pancreatic necrosis was suspected, but could not be confirmed preoperatively, the microbiological samples taken from the pancreatic necrosis at the index operation determined whether or not the patient had infected pancreatic necrosis.

The method of choice at our center was mainly open necrosectomy. Although some endoscopic procedures and selected patients were treated with only percutaneous drainage of necrosis, these patients were not included in this study. Step-up methodology was implemented increasingly towards the latter part of the study period. Patients without preceding drainage were deteriorating, had a verified or suspected intra-abdominal emergency (e.g. bowel perforation or ischemia), were treated with open abdomen, did not have a safe percutaneous drainage route to the necrotic collection, or had widespread necrosis. The decision for surgical debridement was made by a multidisciplinary team with anaesthesiologists and presiding acute-care gastrointestinal surgeons.

A disconnected left pancreatic remnant on CT scan was defined according to Sandrasegaran et al. meaning a large intrapancreatic non-enhancement combined with a viable segment of the distal body or tail of the pancreas. Data on all reoperations within 6 months of the index operation and endoscopic interventions up to 1 year were collected. If the patient survived to discharge, information on survival was retrieved from the Finnish Civil Registry. The STROBE statement was followed.

Acute pancreatitis — role of antibiotics: We suggest against prophylactic antibiotics in patients with severe acute pancreatitis (AP) (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). While antibiotics should not be used in patients with sterile necrosis, antibiotics are an important part of treatment in infected necrosis. In patients with infected necrosis, antibiotics known to penetrate pancreatic necrosis should be used largely to delay surgical, endoscopic, and radiologic drainage beyond 4 weeks, and some patients may avoid drainage altogether because the infection may completely resolve with antibiotics. Routine administration of antifungal agents along with prophylactic or therapeutic antibiotics is not needed. When cultures are negative and no source of infection is identified, antibiotics should be discontinued.

### Treatment of necrotizing pancreatitis: redefining the role of surgery [^e6b88524]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Early surgical intervention in necrotizing pancreatitis (NP) is associated with high mortality. Guidelines recommend fine needle aspiration (FNA) in patients with NP and signs of sepsis. Because infection of necrosis is considered an indication for surgery, operations are often performed early. We changed treatment toward a conservative approach with FNA in selected cases only, thereby reducing the rate of necrosectomy.

Methods

Retrospectively analyzed patients, all operated on for FNA-proven infection of pancreatic necrosis (n = 20, group 1) were compared to patients subjected to conservative treatment (n = 24, group 2) who were followed prospectively.

Results

Prognostic scores did not differ between the two groups, indicating comparable severity: the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score was 19.8 ± 1.7 versus 16 ± 2.2; the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 8.7 ± 1.4 versus 6.9 ± 1.0, the C-reactive protein (CRP) level on day 3 was 243 ± 21 versus 291 ± 21, and the CTSI (CT severity index) was 7.8 ± 0.5 versus 7.9 ± 0.4 (p = ns). Ten patients in group 2 underwent operation because of severe extrapancreatic complications. Mortality differed significantly (45% in group 1 vs. 8.3% in group 2; p = 0.01).

Conclusions

A highly conservative approach avoiding open necrosectomy in NP results in significantly lower mortality than previous serial FNA and consecutive indication for surgery in case of proven infection. Open surgery in NP should be reserved for concomitant intra-abdominal complications.

### Antibiotic therapy for prophylaxis against infection of pancreatic necrosis in acute pancreatitis [^2c47b869]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Acute pancreatitis is a common acute abdominal emergency which lacks specific therapy. In severe attacks, areas of the pancreas may become necrotic. The mortality risk rises to > 40% if sterile necrosis becomes superinfected, usually with gut derived aerobic organisms. Experimental and clinical studies indicate a window of opportunity of 1–2 weeks, when superinfection, and thus high-risk surgical debridement, may be prevented by administering systemic antibiotics to 'sterilise' tissues adjacent to necrotic areas. There are theoretical risks of encouraging antibacterial resistance and opportunistic fungal infections.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic antibiotic therapy in patients with severe acute pancreatitis who have developed pancreatic necrosis.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched. We also examined other sources including Conference Abstracts (published and unpublished data).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCT) were sought using the search strategy detailed below. No linguistic limitations were applied. RCTs were selected in which antibacterial therapy was evaluated in patients with severe acute pancreatitis associated with pancreatic necrosis proven by intravenous contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). No linguistic limitations were applied. Searching was undertaken initially in November 2001 and updated in March 2003.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers extracted data from trial publications independently, concerning rates for the primary end-points: with respect to: all cause mortality and rates of infection of pancreatic necrosis (proven by microbiological examination of fine needle aspirate or operative specimens). In addition, secondary end-points included peri-pancreatic sepsis, remote sepsis (respiratory, urinary, central venous line sources), operative rates, length of hospital stay, adverse events including the incidence of drug resistant microorganisms and opportunistic fungal infection.

Main Results

It was possible to evaluate mortality in all four included studies, and it demonstrated a survival advantage for antibiotic therapy (Odds ratio 0.32, p = 0.02). Pancreatic sepsis (infected necrosis) was also measurable in all four studies and showed an advantage for therapy (Odds ratio 0.51, p = 0.04). Extra-pancreatic infection could be evaluated in three studies, but showed no significant advantage for therapy (Odds ratio 0.47, p = 0.05). Operative treatment data was available in three studies, but surgery rates were not significantly reduced (Odds ratio 0.55, p = 0.08). Fungal infections showed no strongly increased preponderance with therapy (Odds ratio 0.83, p = 0.7), but there were no data on infection with resistant organisms. Length of hospital stay could only be evaluated in two studies and was not significantly different. Sub-group analyses planned for the influence on outcome measures of the antibiotic regimen, the time of commencement of therapy in relation to symptom onset and/or hospitalisation, duration of therapy, and aetiology could not be performed as no data were available.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Despite variations in drug agent, case mix, duration of treatment and methodological quality (especially the lack of double blinded studies), there was strong evidence that intravenous antibiotic prophylactic therapy for 10 to 14 days decreased the risk of superinfection of necrotic tissue and mortality in patients with severe acute pancreatitis with proven pancreatic necrosis at CT. Further studies are required to confirm all of the benefits suggested (in particular the need for operative debridement), to provide more adequate data on adverse effects, to address the choice of antibacterial agents and effects of varying duration of therapy, and whether outcome is related to aetiology.

### Draining sterile fluid collections in acute pancreatitis? Primum non nocere! [^13589730]. Surgical Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

With interest we read the randomized study by Zerem et al. regarding the drainage of sterile fluid collections in acute pancreatitis. The authors are to be commended for performing a randomized trial in a difficult patient population.

Nearly all international guidelines advocate conservative management of sterile fluid collections in acute pancreatitis: (a) the American Gastroenterological Association (2007): "Acute fluid collections around the pancreas in the setting of acute pancreatitis require no therapy in the absence of infection or obstruction of a surrounding hollow viscus", (b) the American College of Gastroenterology (2006): "Most peripancreatic fluid collections remain sterile and will disappear during the recovery from acute pancreatitis", and (c) the international consensus meeting on treatment of acute pancreatitis (2004): "Routine operative or percutaneous drainage of the former (… peripancreatic fluid collections and pancreatic necrosis…) is not necessary and may infect otherwise sterile tissues". Nevertheless, guidelines should be put to the test of evidence-based medicine and accordingly the authors routinely aspirated peripancreatic fluid collections in 58 patients and subsequently randomized 40 patients with sterile peripancreatic fluid collections. Group A (n = 20) received conservative management, whereas group B (n = 20) underwent prolonged percutaneous catheter drainage of sterile collections. As the primary end point the authors chose "conversion to more aggressive procedure", which included percutaneous catheter drainage and surgery. In group A, 11 patients required additional treatment (mostly percutaneous drainage, n = 8), whereas in group B three patients required surgical intervention (11/20 vs. 3/20, P = 0.02). The authors concluded that "prolonged catheter drainage is more effective for management of recurrent sterile fluid collections in acute pancreatitis than is conservative management".

We consider the primary end point of "conversion to more aggressive procedure" rather inappropriate. Why not study clinically relevant outcome measures such as mortality, organ failure, secondary infection of peripancreatic collections, length of hospital stay, or a composite of these events? Notably, it is our interpretation, in line with the definition of the author's primary outcome measure, that all patients in group B underwent an "aggressive procedure", that being percutaneous drainage! Along this line of reasoning, all 20 patients in group B had an interventional procedure versus 11 of 20 patients in group A (P = 0.001). Furthermore, the prolonged percutaneous drainage in group B led to a significant increase in infected collections (4 vs. 11, P = 0.048), that became fatal in one patient.

Data collection and definition

Demographic, clinicopathological, and CECT data were collected. Demographic data included age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and histories of smoking, drinking, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, urinary diseases, and diabetes. Clinicopathological data included: (1) etiology; (2) serum indicators within 24 h of onset, such as white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count, hematocrit, platelet count, lymphocyte count, calcium, triglyceride, creatinine, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time, thrombin time, fibrinogen, and D-dimer; (3) clinical outcomes, including severity of AP, organ failure, infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN), need for surgery, length of hospital stay, and death. IPN included confirmed or suspected infected pancreatic or peripancreatic necrosis. Confirmed infected necrosis was defined by positive cultures from pancreatic or peripancreatic necrotic tissue obtained via fine-needle aspiration, the first drainage procedure, or surgery, or by the presence of gas in fluid collections on CT. Suspected infected necrosis was defined as persistent sepsis or progressive clinical deterioration despite maximal support in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), without documented infected necrosis.

### Identification of early predictors for infected necrosis in acute pancreatitis [^2541c7e3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute pancreatitis is the most frequent non-malignant gastroenterological disorder leading to hospitalization in Western countries. It accounts for almost 280,000 hospital admissions in the US and around 55,000 in Germany per year. While the majority of patients suffers from a mild disease with an uneventful recovery, there is a severe course of acute pancreatitis in 10 to 15% of cases leading to organ or even multi-organ failure, necessity for intensive care therapy and a high mortality. Besides organ failure, approximately 5 to 20% of patients develop necrotizing pancreatitis, involving the pancreas, the surrounding fatty tissue or both. Necroses may cause further local complications such as compression of adjacent organs, increase of intraabdominal pressure or gastric outlet obstruction. Secondary infection of the necrotic tissue is a severe condition with increased morbidity and mortality requiring antibiotic treatment or even invasive interventions.

Diagnosis of an infected necrosis is still challenging and often it needs to be confirmed ultimately by microbiological analysis after fine-needle aspiration or even drainage, measures that have to be carried out judiciously because they also encompass a periprocedural risk. Established multiparameter scores such as the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score and the Ranson Score have been used for grading disease severity and prediction of mortality. However, they are cumbersome to calculate as they need a large number of parameters requiring different time points and their predictive accuracy for infected necrosis is unclear. Several routine laboratory parameters, for instance, markers for inflammation, kidney function or hematocrit, have been attempted for accurate prediction of severe acute pancreatitis, development of necrosis and mortality. Despite promising potential, these measurements have to be repeated at later time points and their usability is limited when using every single parameter alone. So far predictive factors of infected pancreatic necrosis, allowing the initiation of an early and preemptive therapy to improve the outcome of acute necrotizing pancreatitis, have not been established.

### Contemporary management of acute pancreatitis: what you need to know [^1acd0e7c]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Acute pancreatitis and management of its complications is a common consult for the acute care surgeon. With the ongoing development of both operative and endoscopic treatment modalities, management recommendations continue to evolve. We describe the current diagnostic and treatment guidelines for acute pancreatitis through the lens of acute care surgery. Topics, including optimal nutrition, timing of cholecystectomy in gallstone pancreatitis, and the management of peripancreatic fluid collections, are discussed. Although the management severe acute pancreatitis can include advanced interventional modalities including endoscopic, percutaneous, and surgical debridement, the initial management of acute pancreatitis includes fluid resuscitation, early enteral nutrition, and close monitoring with consideration of cross-sectional imaging and antibiotics in the setting of suspected superimposed infection. Several scoring systems including the Revised Atlanta Criteria, the Bedside Index for Severity in Acute Pancreatitis score, and the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grade have been devised to classify and predict the development of the severe acute pancreatitis. In biliary pancreatitis, cholecystectomy prior to discharge is recommended in mild disease and within 8 weeks of necrotizing pancreatitis, while early peripancreatic fluid collections should be managed without intervention. Underlying infection or ongoing symptoms warrant delayed intervention with technique selection dependent on local expertise, anatomic location of the fluid collection, and the specific clinical scenario. Landmark trials have shifted therapy from maximally invasive necrosectomy to more minimally invasive step-up approaches. The acute care surgeon should maintain a skill set that includes these minimally invasive techniques to successfully manage these patients. Overall, the management of acute pancreatitis for the acute care surgeon requires a strong understanding of both the clinical decisions and the options for intervention should this be necessary.

Acute necrotizing pancreatitis — epidemiology and infection-related mortality — In acute pancreatitis, 10%–20% of cases can be associated with necrosis of the pancreatic gland, peripancreatic tissue, or both, and this subset has associated mortality of up to 20%–30% if infection develops in the necrotic collection. Successful management of these patients requires expert multidisciplinary care by gastroenterologists, surgeons, interventional radiologists, and specialists in critical care medicine, infectious disease, and nutrition.

### Analysis of risk factors related to gastrointestinal fistula in patients with severe acute pancreatitis: a retrospective study of 344 cases in a single Chinese center [^5e648010]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Etiologies

The etiology was considered to be of biliary origin when biliary tract stones were detected by US, CT or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Alcohol was considered to be secondly etiological factor. For pancreatitis due to hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), a serum triglyceride (TG) level of more than 1000 mg/dL or 500–1000 mg/dL with a history of HTG was necessary, in addition to exclusion of other triggers. Lacking any of the above evidence or other direct causes, any unexplained pancreatitis, such as sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, pregnancy associated, ampullary obstruction, hyper-calcemia, drugs related and autoimmune, were defined as idiopathic AP in this study.

Clinical management protocol

Immediately after admission, all patients administrated individualized conservative therapy for SAP that included intensive monitoring, fluid resuscitation, oxygen administration, fasting, analgesia and suppression of pancreatic exocrine function by pharmacological agents, such as somatostatin. Nasoduodenal feeding tubes were placed, and feeding was initiated 48 _ 120 h after admission. EEN was defined as feeding within 48 _ 72 h after admission. Additionally, antibiotic therapies were guided by the results of culture and sensitivity. Rather than preventing infection, antibiotics were prescribed in these often critical patients with established infected necrosis or the presence of other infections (e.g. biliary tract, urinary tract, pulmonary, etc.). CECT was performed routinely for all patients within 72 h after admission or earlier when warranted by diagnostic dilemmas. IPN was diagnosed according to the positive gram stain and culture results of pancreatic or peripancreatitic necrotic tissue obtained by means of CT guided fine needle aspiration, or from the first percutaneous drainage or operation. IPN, WON and pseudocyst with complications were managed with a minimally invasive based step-up approach firstly, next step was performed if there was no clinical improvement. Nonsurgical procedures included percutaneous drainage and continuous negative pressure irrigation. Once GIF in patients with SAP was confirmed, which in most cases were already at least 2 weeks after initiating EEN. Enteral nutrition (EN) was deprived conditionally, and intra or extra-luminal drainage (applicable for the localized GIF), or enterostomy (applicable for the diffuse GIF) might be performed if necessary by the rationale of minimally invasive procedure, as well as interventional management with a step-up approach for SAP.

Results

Patient selection and characteristics

Between 2009 and 2019 a total of 2,410 patients with diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (K85.XX) were admitted to our hospital. Among them 705 received an abdominal CT-scan (OPS 3–225) and in 89 patients there was either an acute necrotic collection or walled-off necrosis that were treated by either fine needle aspiration (OPS 1–447), endoscopic or percutaneous drainage (OPS 5–529). Only fine needle aspiration was performed in 14 patients, whereas 75 individuals underwent drainage therapy. In total, 59 subjects had an infected necrosis whereas no growth of bacteria or fungi was detected in the other 30 patients (Fig. 1). In the majority of patients with infected necroses (81.4%) diagnosis was established by the first intervention. Proof of microbial infection by the second or third intervention was given 13.6% and 5.1% of the cases. Patients with infected pancreatic necrosis did not differ from those with sterile necrosis regarding age, sex, BMI, smoking status, location of necrosis, CCI, as well as the prevalence of diabetes mellitus or exocrine insufficiency (Table 1). Regarding etiology, patients with sterile necrosis were more likely to have acute on chronic pancreatitis (p = 0.028), although these numbers were rather low compared to other causes of acute pancreatitis. Alcoholic etiology tended to be more common in patients with infected necrosis (p = 0.051). APACHE II score at admission was significantly higher in infected than in sterile necrosis (p = 0.001). Regarding the size of pancreatic necrosis we classified their extent into areas of < 30%, 30–50%, and > 50% as described by Balthazar et al. (Additional file 1: Table S1). For all three categories the distribution of the necrotic areas was similar showing no differences between patients with sterile and infected necroses (p = 0.426).

### Long-term outcome of immediate versus postponed intervention in patients with infected necrotizing pancreatitis (POINTER): multicenter randomized trial [^d8eef3c3]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

As the results of this study will further enhance the use of antibiotic treatment, efforts to optimize the quality of its use should be made. A recent Dutch study evaluated antibiotic use and obtained pancreatic cultures of patients with infected necrotizing pancreatitis and found that 48% received inappropriate empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics based on the identified microorganisms. Another concern about antibiotic (over)use, which in turn has a great impact on antibiotic resistance, is that antibiotics are often not tailored to (FNA-)culture results. Furthermore, the optimal treatment duration for infected necrosis is unknown. We hypothesize that an antibiotic stewardship-driven approach, which includes recommendations on FNA and the timing and duration of antibiotic treatment, will result in similar patient outcomes and health care use as compared with current practice.

During the present long-term follow-up, after the initial 6-month period, necrosectomy was not performed in any patient, meaning that 51% of patients in the immediate-drainage group and 22% of patients in the postponed-drainage group underwent necrosectomy (P = 0.004) in the total follow-up. This is lower than the 51% to 60% rates of necrosectomy previously reported in patients with infected necrotizing pancreatitis treated with the step-up approach. However, also both these studies stated a negligibly low need for additional necrosectomy after the 6-month follow-up. Another long-term benefit of postponed drainage includes the decreased need for drainage procedures and necrosectomy. The question remains whether postponing drainage through encapsulation of the necrotic collection actually enables a more effective drainage procedure, thereby making multiple procedures and even necrosectomy redundant.

### Acute pancreatitis [^7d25e9e4]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is a common disease most frequently caused by gallstone disease or excess alcohol ingestion. Diagnosis is usually based on characteristic symptoms, often in conjunction with elevated serum pancreatic enzymes. Imaging is not always necessary, but may be performed for many reasons, such as to confirm a diagnosis of pancreatitis, rule out other causes of abdominal pain, elucidate the cause of pancreatitis, or to evaluate for complications such as necrosis or pseudocysts. Though the majority of patients will have mild, self-limiting disease, some will develop severe disease associated with organ failure. These patients are at risk to develop complications from ongoing pancreatic inflammation such as pancreatic necrosis, fluid collections, pseudocysts, and pancreatic duct disruption. Validated scoring systems can help predict the severity of pancreatitis, and thus, guide monitoring and intervention. Treatment of acute pancreatitis involves supportive care with fluid replacement, pain control, and controlled initiation of regular food intake. Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended in acute pancreatitis if there is no evidence of pancreatic infection. In patients who fail to improve, further evaluation is necessary to assess for complications that require intervention such as pseudocysts or pancreatic necrosis. Endoscopy, including ERCP and EUS, and/or cholecystectomy may be indicated in the appropriate clinical setting. Ultimately, the management of the patient with severe acute pancreatitis will require a multidisciplinary approach.

### Necrotizing pancreatitis: diagnosis, imaging, and intervention [^a1e268e5]. Radiographics (2014). Low credibility.

Acute necrotizing pancreatitis is a severe form of acute pancreatitis characterized by necrosis in and around the pancreas and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Although acute interstitial edematous pancreatitis is diagnosed primarily on the basis of signs, symptoms, and laboratory test findings, the diagnosis and severity assessment of acute necrotizing pancreatitis are based in large part on imaging findings. On the basis of the revised Atlanta classification system of 2012, necrotizing pancreatitis is subdivided anatomically into parenchymal, peripancreatic, and combined subtypes, and temporally into clinical early (within 1 week of onset) and late (> 1 week after onset) phases. Associated collections are categorized as "acute necrotic" or "walled off" and can be sterile or infected. Imaging, primarily computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, plays an essential role in the diagnosis of necrotizing pancreatitis and the identification of complications, including infection, bowel and biliary obstruction, hemorrhage, pseudoaneurysm formation, and venous thrombosis. Imaging is also used to help triage patients and guide both temporizing and definitive management. A "step-up" method for the management of necrotizing pancreatitis that makes use of imaging-guided percutaneous catheter drainage of fluid collections prior to endoscopic or surgical necrosectomy has been shown to improve clinical outcomes. The authors present an algorithmic approach to the care of patients with necrotizing pancreatitis and review the use of imaging and interventional techniques in the diagnosis and management of this pathologic condition.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^9b4deae2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Although most patients with acute pancreatitis have the mild form of the disease, about 20–30% develops a severe form, often associated with single or multiple organ dysfunction requiring intensive care. Identifying the severe form early is one of the major challenges in managing severe acute pancreatitis. Infection of the pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis occurs in about 20–40% of patients with severe acute pancreatitis, and is associated with worsening organ dysfunctions. While most patients with sterile necrosis can be managed nonoperatively, patients with infected necrosis usually require an intervention that can be percutaneous, endoscopic, or open surgical. These guidelines present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of severe acute pancreatitis from collaboration of a panel of experts meeting during the World Congress of Emergency Surgery in June 27–30, 2018 in Bertinoro, Italy. The main topics of these guidelines fall under the following topics: Diagnosis, Antibiotic treatment, Management in the Intensive Care Unit, Surgical and operative management, and Open abdomen.

### Perioperative factors determine outcome after surgery for severe acute pancreatitis [^cb5c7bbc]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

The fact that sterile necrosis is a risk factor for mortality in patients undergoing surgery is an important finding. At first sight this might be in sharp contradiction of the fact that infected pancreatic necrosis has been associated with increased mortality in several studies. It should be kept in mind that this undoubtedly is true for patients with SAP as a whole, and that this analysis included only patients who were operated on.

The findings of the present study are in line with the current concept that patients with sterile pancreatic necrosis do not need surgery, although this is still advocated by some experts in the field. Several authors have reported mortality rates below or about 10% when managing these patients non-operatively. Le Mée and colleagues reported that, in most of their patients, organ dysfunction was reversible if necrosis remained sterile. These and our results suggest that in patients with suspected infection of the pancreatic necrosis, the presence of microorganisms should be actively sought with ultrasound-guided or CT scan-guided FNA before surgical intervention is considered.

Our study could not reproduce the negative impact of early surgery on outcome after adjustment for other factors that were associated with increased mortality in univariate analysis. The often-used strategy to postpone surgery in patients with SAP is based on limited data. Mier and colleagues randomized 36 patients with SAP to early (within 48–72 hours) versus late surgery (later than 12 days). Mortality in the group that underwent early debridement was 56%, 3.4-fold that in the control group, a result that halted the trial.

This finding has also been reported by other investigators, but the definition of early surgery should be carefully considered, because the use of different time frames makes it very difficult to compare the evidence available in the literature. Fernandez-del Castillo and colleagues analyzed 64 patients operated on with a technique of closed packing, and found that mortality in patients operated on within the first six weeks after onset of the disease was not different from mortality in patients operated on later than six weeks. This study included patients with pancreatic abscesses, a disease that has a different clinical course and prognosis from that of patients who require surgery for infected pancreatic necrosis. Patient selection and the definition of early surgery make it very difficult to compare this study with ours.

Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease that is mild and self-limiting in about 80% of cases. However, severe necrotizing disease still has a mortality of up to 30%. Differentiated multimodal treatment concepts are needed for these patients, including a multidisciplinary team (intensivists, gastroenterologists, interventional radiologists, and surgeons). The primary therapy is supportive. Patients with infected pancreatic necrosis who are septic undergo interventional or surgical treatment, ideally not before the fourth week after onset of symptoms. This article reviews the pathophysiologic mechanisms of acute pancreatitis and describes clinical pathways for diagnosis and management based on the current literature and guidelines.

### Severe acute pancreatitis: nonsurgical treatment of infected necroses [^ada9db75]. Pancreas (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

In acute pancreatitis, infection of necrosis is associated with a substantial mortality of 15% to > 50% even if immediate necrosectomy, the recommended standard treatment, is performed, mainly because of the patients' critical systemic and unstable local conditions at the time of manifestation of infection. We investigated whether this dreaded complication can be managed conservatively.

Methods

We evaluated 88 consecutive patients with severe (APACHE II score, ≥ 11; Ranson score, ≥ 4) acute necrotizing pancreatitis who received ICU treatment including early antibiotic prophylaxis. Twenty-eight patients were included who developed infection of necroses, verified by fine needle aspiration, 19 ± 6 days after admission. No patient received urgent surgery; rather, in all patients, nonsurgical therapy was continued after adapting the antibiotic regimen to bacteriology. In the further course, 12 patients were excluded due to refractory local complications eventually requiring surgical treatment 36 ± 14 days after diagnosis of infection.

Results

Sixteen patients (APACHE II score: 18.1 [11–33]; Ranson score, 5.9 [4–10]) were managed with medical treatment alone. Six patients recovered without further complications; 10 patients (62%) developed single or multiple organ failure, and 2 died (mortality, 12%).

Conclusion

These data suggest that in patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis and infected necroses, surgery can be avoided without compromising prognosis and outcome.

### The role of procalcitonin in reducing antibiotics across the surgical pathway [^0e70446a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

What is the role of PCT in identifying patients with necrotic pancreatitis needing AB therapy?

Increased PCT level is associated with infection in acute pancreatitis and could guide the AB treatment (avoiding misuse).

Acute pancreatitis (AP) can be mild, moderate, or severe. While mild pancreatitis is commonly self-limited, severe pancreatitis can be associated with the development of complications such as parenchymal/peripancreatic fluid collections and necrosis. Severe AP is defined by single or multiple organ failure lasting more than 48 h, and is associated with a mortality rate as high as 25%. Acute necrotizing pancreatitis is diagnosed when more than 30% of the gland is affected by necrosis and accounts for 5% to 10% of pancreatitis cases. In the subset of patients with organ failure (severe disease) or infected necrosis the mortality rate reaches 30%. The Revised Atlanta classification is used to classify pancreatic fluid collections that develop following AP, within the pancreatic parenchyma, adjacent to it, or both; they can be sterile or infected. While sterile necrosis is associated with 5% to 10% mortality rate, it increases to 20–30% when necrosis becomes infected.

AB treatment in AP has been widely investigated, even if the disease itself is not a formal indication for AB therapy. Current guidelines do not recommend prophylactic ABs for the prevention of infectious complications in AP (IAP/APA guidelines, Grade 1B) and American College of Gastroenterology with strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence. If a source of infection is detected, empiric administration of ABs is justified. It is possible to calculate the rate of ABs use in patients with AP: pancreatic infection occurs in 5% of the patients. Adding a reported 14% to 37.4% extra pancreatic indications (such as cholangitis or pneumonia), this would justify a rate of ABs use between 20 and 40% of patients with AP. Hungarian Pancreatic Study Group (HPSG) found that 77.1% of the total study population (600) received AB therapy and 2/3 without signs of infection, only on a preventive basis.

Antimicrobial therapy in pancreatic necrosis — mortality risk and indicators of infection — Infection of pancreatic necrosis is associated with mortality rates as high as 30%. Infected necrosis should be suspected when cross-sectional imaging demonstrates gas in a pancreatic or peripancreatic collection, and other factors that may be indicative include the presence of fevers, bacteremia, worsening leukocytosis, persistent unwellness, or clinical deterioration, although many of these factors can also occur with systemic inflammatory response syndrome, ongoing pancreatitis, or cholangitis. Therefore, in the management of pancreatic necrosis much attention is given to prevention of infection, as well as treatment of suspected or confirmed infection.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^345cd7e9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Statement (indications for percutaneous/endoscopic drainage of pancreatic collections)

Clinical deterioration with signs or strong suspicion of infected necrotizing pancreatitis is an indication to perform intervention (percutaneous/endoscopic drainage)

After 4 weeks after the onset of the disease:
On-going organ failure without sign of infected necrosis
On-going gastric outlet, biliary, or intestinal obstruction due to a large walled off necrotic collection
Disconnected duct syndrome
Symptomatic or growing pseudocyst

After 8 weeks after the onset of the disease:
On-going pain and/or discomfort

(grade 1C)

Discussion

The evidence of indications is based on understanding the natural course of the disease, mechanism-based reasoning, and non-randomized studies. Interventions for necrotizing pancreatitis should preferably be done when the necrosis has become walled-off, usually after 4 weeks after the onset of the disease.

Signs or strong suspicion of infected necrosis in a symptomatic patient requires intervention, although a small number of patients have been shown to recover with antibiotics only. When a patient deteriorates a step-up approach starting with percutaneous or endoscopic drainage is indicated.

A majority of patients with sterile necrotizing pancreatitis can be managed without interventions. However, it should be noted that nearly half of patients operated due to on-going organ failure without signs of infected necrosis have a positive bacterial culture in the operative specimen. Therefore, interventions should be considered when organ dysfunctions persist for more than 4 weeks.

Walled off necrotic collections or pseudocysts may cause symptoms and/or mechanical obstruction and if they do not resolve when inflammation ceases, a step up approach is indicated. A symptomatic disconnected pancreatic duct results in a peripancreatic collection and is an indication for interventions.

Statements (indications for surgical intervention)

The following are indications for surgical intervention:
As a continuum in a step-up approach after percutaneous/endoscopic procedure with the same indications
Abdominal compartment syndrome
Acute on-going bleeding when endovascular approach is unsuccessful
Bowel ischaemia or acute necrotizing cholecystitis during acute pancreatitis
Bowel fistula extending into a peripancreatic collection

(grade 1C)

Discussion

The evidence of indications is based on understanding the natural course of the disease, mechanism-based reasoning, and non-randomized studies. When percutaneous or endoscopic strategies fail to improve the patient, further surgical strategies should be considered. Abdominal compartment syndrome should first be managed by conservative methods. Surgical decompression by laparostomy should be considered if conservative methods are insufficient.

Bleeding complications in acute severe pancreatitis may warrant surgical interventions if endovascular approach is unsuccessful. Bowel- and other extrapancreatic complications are relatively rare but may require surgical interventions.

Radiological imaging and intervention play important roles in the management of pancreatic fluid collections and pseudocysts. Computed tomography evaluation of the severity of pancreatitis and assessment of its course are now routine. Percutaneous drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts and abscesses is commonly performed as an adjunct to surgical treatment and is frequently definitive therapy. Percutaneous débridement of pancreatic necrosis has recently emerged as a viable alternative to open surgical treatment.

### Treatment of necrotizing pancreatitis [^023e3bca]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is a common and potentially lethal disease. It is associated with significant morbidity and consumes enormous health care resources. Over the last 2 decades, the treatment of acute pancreatitis has undergone fundamental changes based on new conceptual insights and evidence from clinical studies. The majority of patients with necrotizing pancreatitis have sterile necrosis, which can be successfully treated conservatively. Emphasis of conservative treatment is on supportive measures and prevention of infection of necrosis and other complications. Patients with infected necrosis generally need to undergo an intervention, which has shifted from primary open necrosectomy in an early disease stage to a step-up approach, starting with catheter drainage if needed, followed by minimally invasive surgical or endoscopic necrosectomy once peripancreatic collections have sufficiently demarcated. This review provides an overview of current standards for conservative and invasive treatment of necrotizing pancreatitis.

### Early clinical predictors of infected pancreatic necrosis: a multicentre cohort study [^d69ea64a]. Egastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Cohort design and study sample selection

This multicentre cohort of patients with AP included eight hospitals from various regions of China (Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing; Fangshan District Liangxiang Hospital, The Sixth Hospital, Beijing; The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Heilongjiang; The First People's Hospital of Longquanyi District, People's Liberation Army The General Hospital of Western Theatre Command, Sichuan; Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University, Hebei; First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Jiangxi) from January 2017 to July 2023. The diagnosis and severity of AP were based on the revised Atlanta classification. Patients admitted to hospitals within 48 hours of AP onset were included. The following patients were excluded: those under 18 years of age, those with chronic or recurrent pancreatitis and those discharged early due to personal preference.

Outcome definition

The primary outcome was the occurrence of IPN. IPN was defined as a positive culture result from samples obtained via fine-needle aspiration, drainage or surgical procedures; or the presence of gas in the pancreas and/or peripancreatic tissue on CT.

Clinical information collection

Demographic and clinical data were collected within the first 24 hours of admission for each patient from the electronic medical record system as candidate variables. These included age, sex, heart rate, respiratory rate (RR), systolic blood pressure, temperature, Glasgow Coma Scale Score, whether the patient had peritoneal irritation signs, leucocyte count, blood platelet count, haematocrit in peripheral blood, and concentrations of plasma potassium, total calcium (Ca), sodium ions, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, and serum glucose (Glu) level.

The severity of AP was evaluated using widely accepted severity scores, systemic and local complications, period of hospital and intensive care unit stay, and mortality. In addition to IPN, local complications included acute peripancreatic fluid and acute necrotic collections. Systemic complications included systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), organ failure (cardiovascular or renal) and acute respiratory distress syndrome. We also collected information on whether patients underwent endoscopic or interventional drainage treatment, or surgery for AP during their hospitalisation. Severity scores included the Beside Index for Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) Scores, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment, and Modified Marshallmeasured within the first 24 hours of admission.

### Necrotizing pancreatitis: contemporary analysis of 99 consecutive cases [^a2c824a2]. Annals of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the impact of a conservative strategy of management in patients with necrotizing pancreatitis, reserving intervention for patients with documented infection or the late complications of organized necrosis.

Summary Background Data

The role of surgery in patients with sterile pancreatic necrosis remains controversial. Although a conservative approach is being increasingly used, few studies have evaluated this strategy when applied to the entire spectrum of patients with necrotizing pancreatitis.

Methods

The authors reviewed 1,110 consecutive patients with acute pancreatitis managed at Brigham and Women's Hospital between January 1, 1995, and January 1, 2000, focusing on those with pancreatic necrosis documented by contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Fine-needle aspiration, the presence of extraintestinal gas on computed tomography, or both were used to identify infection.

Results

There were 99 (9%) patients with necrotizing pancreatitis treated, with an overall death rate of 14%. In three patients with underlying medical problems, the decision was made initially not to intervene. Of the other 62 patients without documented infection, all but 3 were managed conservatively; this group's death rate was 11%. Of these seven deaths, all were related to multiorgan failure. Five patients in this group eventually required surgery for organized necrosis, with no deaths. Of the 34 patients with infected necrosis, 31 underwent surgery and 3 underwent percutaneous drainage. Only four (12%) of these patients died, all of multiorgan failure. Of the total 11 patients who died, few if any would have been candidates for earlier surgical intervention.

Conclusions

These results suggest that conservative strategies can be applied successfully to manage most patients with necrotizing pancreatitis, although some will eventually require surgery for symptomatic organized necrosis. Few if any patients seem likely to benefit from a more aggressive strategy.

Regarding medical management for acute pancreatitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, therapeutic, ACG 2024 guidelines recommend to administer antibiotics along with debridement/necrosectomy for the treatment of infected necrosis. Use antibiotics known to penetrate pancreatic necrosis to delay surgical, endoscopic, and radiologic drainage beyond 4 weeks. Recognize that some patients may avoid drainage altogether because the infection may completely resolve with antibiotics.

The presence of infection can be presumed when there is extraluminal gas in the pancreatic and/or peripancreatic tissues on CECT or when percutaneous, image-guided, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is positive for bacteria and/or fungi on Gram stain and culture.

The following baseline and outcome variables were recorded for each patient on admission: age, gender, etiology, the coexisting condition, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, Ranson score (> 3 as high and ≤ 3 as low Ranson group), CT severity index (CTSI)-which is a 10-point scoring system derived by assessing the degree of pancreatic and peripancreatic inflammation (0 to 2 points), the presence and number of peripancreatic fluid collections (0 to 2 points), and the presence and degree of pancreatic parenchymal non-enhancement or necrosis (0 to 6 points), the extent of pancreatic necrosis, the multiple organ dysfunction score (MODS), the mortality, and the length of hospital stay. The following items were also recorded at enrollment: the CECT before study entry; leukocyte count and neutrophil percentage; blood biochemical parameters, such as: the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), amylase, procalcitonin (PCT), and HMGB1 were all evaluated. The serum HMGB1 levels were determined, and the relationships with sex, etiology, pancreatic necrosis, severity, blood biochemical parameters on admission, organ dysfunction and infection during the clinical course, and prognosis were also analyzed.

The study was approved by the ethics committees of the Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital and informed consent was obtained from each patient.

Conclusions

These guidelines present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of severe acute pancreatitis from collaboration of a panel of experts. It contains 55 statements on diagnosis, management in the ICU, surgical and operative management, open abdomen, and antibiotic treatment. For some of the statements such as severity grading, imaging, use of prophylactic antibiotics and most aspect of the management in the ICU, the evidence is strong. For others, such as laboratory diagnostics and surgical strategies, for example, the evidence is quite weak requiring further studies. With accumulating knowledge, the statements need to be regularly updated.

### Microbiologic analysis of peri-pancreatic fluid collected during EUS in patients with pancreatitis: impact on antibiotic therapy [^32e694b7]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pancreatitis is a potentially life-threatening condition frequently accompanied by peri-pancreatic fluid collections (PPFC), such as pseudocysts or pancreatic necrosis. Aspiration of PPFCs during EUS interventions for microbiologic analysis is still rarely performed in clinical routine.

Objective

To evaluate the role of routine microbiologic analysis of PPFCs and its impact on antibiotic therapy in patients with pancreatitis.

Design

Prospective, observational, multicenter study.

Setting

Four treatment centers.

Patients

A total of 44 consecutive patients who presented for endoscopic treatment of PPFCs were included.

Intervention

Concomitantly, PPFC during intervention and concomitant blood cultures were obtained.

Main Outcome Measurements

Microbiologic examination of PPFCs and blood samples.

Results

Colonization of PPFCs was found in 59% of PPFC cultures, whereas all but 2 concomitant blood cultures showed no microbial growth. Risk factors for a colonization were the presence of necrosis (P = 0.006), acute pancreatitis (P = 0.033), leukocytosis (P = 0.001), elevated C-reactive protein levels (P = 0.003), fever (P = 0.02), turbid material (P = 0.031), and longer hospital stay (P = 0.003). In 23 patients with fluid colonization despite empiric antibiotic therapy, the treatment had to be adjusted in 18 patients (78%) according to the observed antibiotic susceptibility profile.

Limitations

Contamination cannot be totally excluded.

Conclusion

The microbiologic colonization of PPFCs in patients with pancreatitis is common. Only the direct microbiologic analysis of PPFCs, but not of blood cultures, is useful to optimize an effective antibiotic therapy in patients with pancreatitis.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^812a8550]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas most commonly caused by bile stones or excessive use of alcohol. In most patients, the disease takes a mild course, where moderate fluid resuscitation, management of pain and nausea, and early oral feeding result in rapid clinical improvement.

The severe form comprising about 20–30% of the patients is a life-threatening disease with hospital mortality rates of about 15%. The most commonly used classification system for acute pancreatitis is the 2012 revision of the Atlanta classification and definitions based on international consensus. This classification identifies two phases (early and late). Severity is classified as mild, moderate, or severe. The mild form (interstitial edematous pancreatitis) has no organ failure, local or system complications, and usually resolves in the first week. If there is transient (less than 48 h) organ failure, local complications or exacerbation of co-morbid disease, it is classified as moderate. Patients with persistent (more than 48 h) organ failure have the severe form of the disease.

Infection of the pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis occurs in about 20–40% of patients with severe acute pancreatitis, and is associated with worsening organ dysfunctions. In a systematic review and meta-analysis totaling 6970 patients, the mortality rate in patients with infected necrosis and organ failure was 35.2% while concomitant sterile necrosis and organ failure was associated with a mortality of 19.8%. If the patients had infected necrosis without organ failure, the mortality was 1.4%.

According to the updated Atlanta classification 2012, the peripancreatic collections associated with necrosis are acute necrotic collection (ANC) and walled-off necrosis (WON). ANC is a collection seen during the first 4 weeks and containing variable amount of fluid and necrotic tissue involving the pancreatic parenchyma and/or peripancreatic tissues. WON is a mature, encapsulated collection of pancreatic and/or peripancreatic necrosis with a well-defined, enhancing inflammatory wall. The maturation takes usually 4 weeks or more after the onset of acute pancreatitis.

MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE AP

This patient has unfortunately progressed to moderately severe AP defined by the presence of pancreatic necrosis. After the organ failure persists > 48 hours, he has severe AP. At this point, the management will be complex. Supportive care, nasogastric enteric feeding, and a multidisciplinary approach to his care will be needed. Interventional radiology and surgical intervention will rarely be needed over the next several weeks. If infected necrosis develops, a conservative approach with antibiotics that penetrate pancreatic necrosis should be initiated. Owing to the complexity of managing patients with severe AP, complicated by pancreatic necrosis, consideration should be made to transferring this patient to a more experienced medical center.

### ACR appropriateness criteria radiologic management of infected fluid collections [^5f380506]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

The best management of infected fluid collections depends on a careful assessment of clinical and anatomic factors as well as an up-to-date review of the published literature, to be able to select from a host of multidisciplinary treatment options. This article reviews conservative, radiologic, endoscopic, and surgical options and their best application to infected fluid collections as determined by the ACR Appropriateness Criteria Expert Panel on Interventional Radiology. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every three years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals, and the application, by the panel, of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### The role of endoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory pancreatic fluid collections [^850d2aeb]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory pancreatic fluid collections (PFCs) — definitions and imaging features are outlined per the Atlanta classification revised in 2012, which categorizes inflammatory PFCs as acute peri-PFCs, pancreatic pseudocysts, acute necrotic collections, and walled-off necrosis (WON). Acute peri-PFCs occur early in pancreatitis, rarely become infected, and typically resolve spontaneously, and on imaging appear homogenous, lack a defined wall, can be multiple, and conform to normal retroperitoneal fascial planes. Pseudocysts are fluid collections arising from the pancreas and peripancreatic tissues that typically result from acute peri-PFCs and persist for more than 4 weeks; they also may develop from necrotizing pancreatitis when necrosis of the neck and body isolates a still viable segment of pancreatic parenchyma in the tail, resulting in a "disconnected duct".

### The role of endoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory pancreatic fluid collections [^1baa661b]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

Endoscopic management of pancreatic fluid collections (PFC) and walled-off pancreatic necrosis (WON) — recommendations are as follows: We recommend that endoscopic drainage of PFCs be performed only after sufficient exclusion of alternative diagnoses, such as cystic pancreatic neoplasms and pseudoaneurysm. We recommend waiting for maturation of the cyst wall of PFCs before endoscopic intervention. We recommend drainage of symptomatic pancreatic pseudocysts. We suggest drainage of rapidly enlarging pancreatic pseudocysts. We recommend drainage of all infected PFCs in patients who fail to improve with conservative management alone. We recommend drainage of symptomatic sterile necrosis lasting more than 8 weeks after the onset of acute pancreatitis. We suggest that routine FNA of PFCs is not required to diagnose infected necrosis. We recommend that endoscopic drainage be considered for initial therapy before surgical drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts. We recommend using EUS for transmural drainage of PFCs in the absence of a luminal bulge or when portal hypertension is suspected. We recommend initial endoscopic transmural and/or percutaneous drainage of WON before consideration of endoscopic transmural necrosectomy or surgical drainage. We recommend that endoscopic drainage of PFCs be performed only with the availability of surgical and interventional radiology support. We suggest using CO2 when performing transmural drainage procedures.

### American Gastroenterological Association clinical practice update: management of pancreatic necrosis [^7a93db45]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Severe acute pancreatitis with necrosis — acute and late-phase management and debridement mapping are outlined as follows: In the acute phase (< 2–4 weeks), management includes management of systemic inflammatory response, supportive care of associated organ dysfunction, nutritional optimization (enteral preferred), avoidance of prophylactic antibiotics, and if concern for infection during acute phase (i.e., retroperitoneal air), consider image-guided percutaneous drainage; intra-abdominal hypertension common; clinical abdominal compartment syndrome unusual. In the late phase (≥ 2–4 weeks), continue supportive care of organ dysfunction, continue to optimize nutrition (enteral), drainage and debridement indicated when evidence of infection (air in peripancreatic necrosis), and consider intervention on necrosis in patient with persistent nutritional failure or organ dysfunction. Approach to debridement — dependent on pattern of necrosis and institutional expertise — includes for central retrogastric collection an endoscopic transgastric or laparoscopic transgastric approach, for retrogastric with paracolic gutter extension percutaneous drainage with step-up to videoscopic retroperitoneal debridement or endoscopic debridement with addition of percutaneous drains as needed, and for retrogastric collection with extension to the right of the mesenteric vessels an endoscopic or laparoscopic transgastric approach; may need open debridement.

### Identification of early predictors for infected necrosis in acute pancreatitis [^ce2c144d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

There are limitations to our study. These are partly owed to its retrospective and monocentric design, including incomplete patient data and blood values as well as assessment of blood parameters only at time of admission. Therefore, there is a residual chance that we missed relevant parameters, especially those that show a dynamic during the course of diseases. On the contrary, our results realistically reflect the situation in clinical practice. It can be cumbersome and costly to monitor the course of multiple, potentially not routine blood parameters over a longer time. Hence, our prediction model likely presents a more feasible approach. However, it needs to be emphasized that its predictive performance has not been validated prospectively so far. A prospective trial will be necessary to confirm the validity of our model developed from the retrospectively collected data. Another limitation of our analysis is that we also included patients transferred from external hospitals. This may include that treatment of acute pancreatitis at least during the early phase was not uniform in all cases because local expertise varies in smaller district hospitals. In addition, time between actual onset of pain and hospital admission could vary leading to an inhomogeneous patient cohort regarding stage of pancreatitis. Although only individuals with microbiologically proven infection were included in our study there is a risk of false positive or negative results even after microbiologic analysis of the necrotic material which have been reported in up to 15% and 25% of cases, respectively. In addition, the number of actually infected necroses might be lower as secondary infections might occur not only after percutaneous but even after endoscopic guided drainages of pancreatic necrotic collections and repeated necrosectomies. For further clarification of microbial transmissions rates into drained necroses additional studies will be necessary. The putative low number of patients with sterile necrosis (n = 30) in this investigation resulted from the fact, that only individuals with proven negative results on microbial culture were selected, even after repeated biopsies. Due to the selection of patients who have undergone intervention we observed a larger proportion of individuals with infected necrosis than reported in previous studies. Under some circumstances a primarily conservative therapeutic strategy based on solely antibiotic treatment and drainage only if unavoidable, can be as effective as an immediate drainage therapy in terms of mortality. Because suspected infected necroses could not be captured by ICD-10 codes, we have potentially missed patients with infected pancreatic necrosis who neither underwent EUS-FNA nor drainage for our model. Last, some patients may have responded to prophylactic antibiotic treatment that was given empirically without prior microbial confirmation and therefore did not develop infected necrosis. Nevertheless, the chance that predictive performance of our model was hampered by such treatment response is rather low as an infected necrosis was detected in almost 90% of patients receiving antibiotics.

### Initially elevated arterial lactate as an independent predictor of poor outcomes in severe acute pancreatitis [^1708b1bb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Definitions

The diagnosis of AP was based on the presence of at least two of the three following criteria: characteristic abdominal pain; elevation in serum amylase and/or lipase greater than three times the upper limit of normal; and characteristic imaging findings of AP by abdominal computed tomography scan. The patient was classified as SAP based on the presence of persistent organ failure (POF) for more than 48 h (defined by modified Marshall scoring system ≥ 2). Organ failure included the cardiovascular, and/or pulmonary, and/or renal systems, accompanied by a systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg after continuous fluid resuscitation, PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 300 or the need for mechanical ventilation, serum creatinine level > 1.9 mg/dl after rehydration or hemodialysis without preexisting renal disease. The patient was classified as having a pancreatic infection based on the presence of gas collections in the pancreatic and/or peripancreatic tissues on contrast-enhanced computed tomography or based on a positive Gram stain and culture for bacteria and/or fungi from a fine-needle aspiration biopsy, percutaneous catheter drainage, and endoscopic transluminal drainage. The diagnosis of septic shock was based on Chinese guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2014, meeting the following criteria: hypotension caused by sepsis (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or drops more than 40 mmHg) after fluid therapy. The definition abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) base on the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome. Intra-abdominal pressure. IAP measured by Indirect monitoring urinary bladder pressure via Foley bladder catheter. ACS is defined as a sustained IAP > 20 mmHg that is associated with new organ dysfunction.

Outcomes

The primary outcomes in this study included death within 1 month of follow-up, septic shock, and peripancreatic infection. The secondary outcomes included abdominal compartment syndrome, pancreatic necrosis, walled-off necrosis, portal vein thrombosis, pancreatic fistula, intestinal fistula, diabetes, the rate of ventilator support, hospital stay and hospital stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Telephone and outpatient follow-up were arranged for a month following discharge.

### The role of endoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory pancreatic fluid collections [^fc25f22d]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical features and imaging of pancreatic fluid collections — Pseudocysts contain amylase-rich fluid, have essentially no solid debris, and possess a well-defined, non-epithelialized wall. Approximately 20% of individuals with acute pancreatitis will develop necrosis, with secondary infection occurring in 30% of these patients. Acute necrotic collections (ANCs) develop during the initial 4 weeks of pancreatitis and the distinction between ANCs and acute peri-PFCs typically becomes clear after 1 week. Walled-off necrosis (WON) is a collection of pancreatic and/or peripancreatic necrosis with a mature, encapsulated enhancing wall of reactive tissue and typically occurs ≥ 4 weeks after the development of necrotizing pancreatitis. Although contrast-enhanced CT often is used to assess the pancreas initially, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRCP may be superior to CT for detection of debris within fluid collections and provide information concerning integrity of the main pancreatic duct; EUS also may aid in characterization of these collections.

### Conservative management of infected necrosis complicating severe acute pancreatitis [^fc5b039f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Patients with severe necrotizing pancreatitis are at risk for infection, a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Most patients with infected pancreatic tissue require surgical intervention (necrosectomy), which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. A subset of these patients can be managed successfully with conservative management combined with prolonged courses of antibiotics.

Methods

Three cases of severe acute pancreatitis seen at our institution are described, in which the patients developed aspirate-proven pancreatic infections. The patients were nonetheless stable from a clinical standpoint and were treated with long courses of antibiotics known to penetrate the pancreas; emergent surgery was deferred.

Results

In two patients, surgery was completely avoided, with good clinical outcome. In the third patient, elective surgery was undertaken 12 wk after the episode of acute pancreatitis, to perform necrosectomy on organized pancreatic necrosis and to evaluate the patient's biliary tree. There were no postoperative complications.

Conclusions

A subset of patients with severe acute pancreatitis complicated by infection can be successfully managed with long term antibiotics and other supportive measures. High risk necrosectomy can, in some instances, be delayed or avoided entirely.

### Position paper: timely interventions in severe acute pancreatitis are crucial for survival [^d87a9bd3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment modalities of MODS are supportive including fluid replacement therapy, vasopressors, mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy when necessary. In patients with acute pancreatitis, abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) may aggravate MODS, and therefore, monitoring of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is crucial for identification of patients at risk of ACS. Development of ACS should be prevented, if possible, by conservative methods. Surgical decompression is the last but the most effective way to decrease IAP and should not be postponed too late if patient has developed ACS.

Patients with acute pancreatitis have a considerable risk for developing secondary infections including bacteremia, pneumonia and infection of pancreatic or peripancreatic necrosis. Extrapancreatic infections occur predominantly during the first week of illness, whereas pancreatic necrosis becomes infected later. The mortality is very high in patients with persistent organ failure complicated with infected pancreatic necrosis. Development of bacteremia and infected pancreatic necrosis are associated with MODS. Intestinal dysfunction plays an important role and bacterial translocation from intestine is considered the main mechanism of infection. Impaired host response systems may also predispose to clinical infections. Early enteral nutrition has been shown to reduce systemic infections, whereas the results from randomized trials with prophylactic antibiotics have been inconclusive. Surgery is considered necessary for adequate source control when pancreatic or peripancreatic infection develops. However, because surgery for pancreatic necrosis within the first 2–3 weeks from disease onset is associated with high mortality, surgery should be postponed as late as possible. Sometimes percutaneous drainage of fluid from infected acute necrotic collection may be helpful and is preferable first-line treatment for infected pancreatic necrosis during the first three weeks of illness.

### Perioperative factors determine outcome after surgery for severe acute pancreatitis [^bf325abb]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Patient management

All patients were admitted to the ICU before or after surgical treatment and were treated by the same surgical team. The use of antibiotic prophylaxis was left to the discretion of the attending ICU physician. Enteral nutrition was started as early as possible. Computed tomography (CT) scanning and FNA of the pancreatic necrosis was performed on an individual patient base, namely when the clinical condition of the patient was suggestive of infection of the pancreatic necrosis. Indications for surgery were a documented infection of pancreatic necrosis (as evidenced by positive cultures from FNA), a deterioration of the clinical condition of the patient, unresolving pancreatitis or suspected pancreatic infection without proof on FNA or CT scan. Surgical intervention consisted of necrosectomy through a midline laparotomy as described by Beger and colleagues. The pancreas was debrided using blunt dissection, and two to four large-calibre drains were inserted in the retroperitoneum. Continuous postoperative lavage of the retroperitoneum was started initially at a rate of 500–1000 ml/h, and progressively decreased, on the basis of the general condition of the patient, inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein), and the macroscopic aspect of the drain effluent.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS for Windows 11.0.1 ® (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous variables were compared by using Student's t -test or the Mann–Whitney U -test where appropriate. Categorical data were compared with the? 2 or Fisher Exact test. A double-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Parameters found to be different in survivors and non-survivors in univariate analysis with a P value of 0.25 or less were entered in a logistic regression model with mortality as the dependent variable, to identify factors available at the moment of surgery that were independently associated with mortality.

### Long-term outcome of immediate versus postponed intervention in patients with infected necrotizing pancreatitis (POINTER): multicenter randomized trial [^96612078]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis mostly runs a mild clinical course, but 20% of patients develop severe pancreatitis with necrosis. – Secondary infection of pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis puts these patients at risk of significant morbidity and 10% to 39% mortality. Several randomized studies have attempted to optimize the treatment of patients with infected necrotizing pancreatitis. – Besides antibiotic treatment, the minimally invasive step-up approach, with catheter drainage of the infected necrotic collection as the first step, followed by minimally invasive necrosectomy when needed, is the current standard treatment strategy. However, the optimal timing of drainage in infected necrotizing pancreatitis remains unknown and varies widely in current practice. –

The recent multicenter randomized POINTER trial compared immediate catheter drainage within 24 hours after diagnosing infected pancreatic necrosis with postponed catheter drainage. At 6-month follow-up, immediate drainage was not superior to postponed drainage regarding complications. In fact, the postponed-drainage approach significantly reduced the number of invasive interventions, both catheter drainage and necrosectomy. Some 19 patients (39%) assigned to the postponed-drainage group did not require any intervention because their clinical condition improved with antibiotic treatment only; 17 of these patients (35%) survived. The question remains whether these relative benefits of the postponed-drainage approach persist after the initial 6-month follow-up. Some have argued that infected (peri) pancreatic necrotic collections, which are initially treated conservatively with antibiotics, could lead to persistent complications requiring intervention and ultimately causing mortality during longer follow-up.

Therefore, the current study evaluates new events beyond the initial 6-month follow-up on long-term clinical outcomes of patients enrolled in the POINTER trial.

Antibiotics

The use of antibiotics in the initial management of AP remains a topic of significant controversy. Pancreatic or peripancreatic necrosis is initially aseptic but can progress to infected necrosis. Bacterial translocation, where bacteria migrate from the intestine to the pancreas, is known to contribute to the systemic inflammatory response in AP and is considered the primary source of infection in necrotic collections. Since infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN) results in more than twice the mortality when compared with sterile pancreatic necrosis, the question remains as to whether prophylactic antibiotics are beneficial. This question has been tough to answer due to the considerable heterogeneity in the cohorts and the numerous confounding variables that must be considered. Numerous studies looking at the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics in acute NP have been published, but with conflicting results. A meta-analysis by Bai et al (seven trials involving 467 patients) concluded that prophylactic administration of antibiotics was not statistically superior when compared with controls in the reduction of infected necrosis or mortality. Another meta-analysis by Ukai et al (six randomized controlled trials totaling 397 patients) reported mortality rates were significantly different for those who received antibiotics (7.4%), compared with controls (14.4%) (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.94). Additionally, these authors found that early prophylactic antibiotic use was associated with a reduced incidence of infected pancreatic necrosis, 16.3%, antibiotic group vs 25.1% in control (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.92). Guo et al in their 2022 meta-analysis looking at prophylactic carbapenem antibiotics in severe AP reported prophylactic carbapenem administration was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of infections (OR 0.27; p = 0.03) and complications (OR 0.48; p = 0.009). However, they did not find a statistically significant difference in the incidence of infected pancreatic or peripancreatic necrosis (OR 0.74; p = 0.24), or mortality (OR 0.69; p = 0.17). These authors concluded that current evidence of benefits is insufficient to support the use of routine prophylactic carbapenem antibiotic administration in severe AP. Nearly all trials included in this meta-analysis had several limitations, including inaccurate definitions of disease severity, poor statistical testing and overlooked differences in the route of nutrition, the antibiotic used, its dosing, and other potentially important confounding variables. In the meantime, it is safe to say that the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics in NP remains debatable. The current recommendations, given the concerns for increasing bacterial resistance, are that antibiotics should be reserved for highly suspected or confirmed infected necrosis, and in patients with biliary pancreatitis with associated acute cholecystitis or cholangitis. The diagnosis of infection in peripancreatic or pancreatic fluid collections or necrosis no longer requires fine-needle aspiration for Gram stain and cultures. In most cases, clinical suspicion and CT findings (such as gas in the necrotic collection) are sufficient to make the diagnosis. Early diagnosis of infection is further improved by using biomarkers like CRP and procalcitonin. When infection of peripancreatic or pancreatic fluid collections or necrosis is suspected, early initiation of appropriate antibiotics is crucial to reducing mortality. Antibiotics with good penetration into pancreatic tissue, covering Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, should be prioritized (e.g. carbapenems, quinolones, and metronidazole). Routine antifungal therapy is not recommended, but should be considered for patients who do not improve after several weeks of antibiotic treatment. The duration of antibiotic therapy should be minimized and tailored to the quality of source control, normalization of biomarkers, and the patient's clinical condition.

### The role of endoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory pancreatic fluid collections [^3d3a2482]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

GRADE system for rating quality of evidence for guidelines — High quality evidence is defined as "Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Moderate quality is "Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate". Low quality is "Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate". Very low quality means "Any estimate of effect is very uncertain".
