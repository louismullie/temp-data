## Question

GFR 76 and cystatin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about interpreting a GFR of 76 mL/min/1.73 m² in the context of cystatin C, including staging, risk, when to add cystatin C, how to handle discordance, and what to do next clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a creatinine-based eGFR of 76 means for CKD staging and baseline risk. Then, I should verify when guidelines recommend adding cystatin C and why. Next, I will examine how to interpret discordance between creatinine- and cystatin C–based eGFR and its prognostic implications. After that, I need to check non-GFR determinants that can bias each marker and how to adjust interpretation. Finally, I will outline practical next steps, including repeat testing, albuminuria assessment, medication review, and when to pursue measured GFR or clearance methods.

> Let me first confirm the staging implication of an eGFR of 76 mL/min/1.73 m². By CKD-EPI 2021 creatinine-based criteria, an eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² is not diagnostic of CKD unless there is evidence of kidney damage such as albuminuria, hematuria, or structural disease, so 76 sits in the "normal or mildly decreased" range and does not meet CKD criteria by eGFR alone [^1179GEKx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this is a creatinine-based estimate, and I should verify whether adding cystatin C would change classification or risk. Guidelines recommend using a combined creatinine–cystatin C equation when eGFR by creatinine is less accurate or when precision matters for decisions, and they endorse cystatin C particularly around the 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m² "gray zone" or when creatinine is unreliable due to muscle mass, diet, or acute illness, so at 76, routine cystatin C is not mandated but can be considered if clinical context raises suspicion of creatinine bias or if medication dosing hinges on accuracy [^111NBuLs] [^1119DLuQ] [^112Boerf].

> I need to check the rationale for cystatin C here. Cystatin C is less influenced by muscle mass, diet, and race than creatinine, and combined equations outperform single-marker equations for accuracy and reclassification, especially in the 45–74 mL/min/1.73 m² range; however, cystatin C has its own non-GFR determinants, so discordance can be informative rather than dismissed as "noise" [^1151ULyu] [^114EnmV1] [^114h6MDC].

> Next, I should review how to interpret discordance if cystatin C is measured and yields a substantially different eGFR. Large negative differences, where eGFRcys is at least 30% lower than eGFRcr, are common and carry higher risks of mortality, cardiovascular events, heart failure, and kidney failure; conversely, positive differences can identify lower-risk phenotypes, so the direction and magnitude of eGFRdiff cys-cr refine risk beyond a single eGFR value [^114kfbCu] [^114qqrge] [^115qWGqC].

> Wait, let me verify the practical thresholds. A difference exceeding about 15 mL/min/1.73 m² is clinically meaningful and associated with altered risks; in a patient with eGFRcr around 76, if eGFRcys were in the low 60s, that would represent a modest negative discordance, whereas values in the 50s or lower would constitute a large negative discordance with stronger prognostic implications and should prompt reassessment of kidney function and risk [^115qWGqC] [^114qqrge].

> I should double-check non-GFR determinants that could bias interpretation at an eGFR of 76. For creatinine, higher muscle mass, high protein intake, or recent exercise can raise creatinine and lower eGFRcr, while sarcopenia, low protein intake, or liver disease can lower creatinine and raise eGFRcr; for cystatin C, obesity, inflammation, smoking, corticosteroids, and thyroid disease can elevate levels and lower eGFRcys, so I need to align the marker choice with the patient's phenotype and comorbidities before concluding anything definitive [^114h6MDC] [^115X3PDa].

> Let me consider the prognostic signal embedded in cystatin C even when eGFRcr is "normal". Elevated cystatin C in people with eGFRcr ≥ 60 identifies a higher-risk subgroup with more cardiovascular events and mortality, supporting the concept that cystatin C captures subtle filtration or systemic risk not evident from creatinine alone; thus, if cystatin C is elevated when creatinine is normal, I should be more vigilant about cardiovascular risk modification and CKD surveillance even if formal CKD criteria are not met [^1137RrRP] [^1119AfVX] [^113ocXsk].

> Next, I should review what to do clinically. First, confirm persistence: repeat eGFRcr in 3–6 months to ensure the value is sustained, and check a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio because albuminuria modifies risk and staging; second, if there is clinical uncertainty about accuracy or if dosing of narrow-therapeutic-index drugs is required, obtain cystatin C and compute eGFRcr-cys; third, if discordance exceeds about 15 mL/min/1.73 m², interpret risk accordingly and consider etiologies such as sarcopenia, obesity, or inflammation; finally, if critical decisions depend on precise GFR, pursue measured GFR or a timed creatinine clearance rather than relying solely on estimates [^111cJLNg] [^115qWGqC] [^1174tCEz].

> But wait, what if the patient is older or has low muscle mass — does that change the calculus at 76? Yes, in older adults or those with sarcopenia, creatinine-based eGFR tends to overestimate true GFR, so adding cystatin C can unmask true impairment; conversely, in younger, muscular individuals, creatinine may underestimate GFR, and cystatin C can help avoid overdiagnosis, reinforcing the value of combined markers when the clinical stakes are high [^1176rR4z] [^111d6CdQ].

> In summary, an eGFRcr of 76 mL/min/1.73 m² is not diagnostic of CKD by itself and reflects mildly decreased or normal kidney function depending on context; cystatin C is not universally required at this level but should be added when accuracy matters, when creatinine is likely biased, or when discordance would alter management, because combined equations improve precision and discordance itself carries prognostic information that can guide risk stratification and follow-up planning [^111NBuLs] [^1151ULyu] [^114kfbCu].

---

An eGFR of 76 mL/min/1.73 m² is **mildly reduced** and falls within CKD stage 2 (60–89) if persistent for ≥ 3 months. Cystatin C is a useful adjunct when creatinine-based eGFR is uncertain or discordant, especially in older adults, those with low muscle mass, or when precise GFR is needed for drug dosing [^111NBuLs] [^1176rR4z]. Cystatin C is less affected by muscle mass, diet, and race, but can be influenced by inflammation, obesity, and thyroid disease [^113hyNKV] [^115X3PDa]. If eGFRcys is significantly lower than eGFRcr, it may indicate true CKD and higher cardiovascular risk; if similar or higher, CKD is less likely [^1119AfVX] [^114kfbCu]. Use the combined CKD-EPI 2021 equation for the most accurate estimate, and interpret results in clinical context with albuminuria and repeat testing [^114AqNLq] [^111cJLNg].

---

## Clinical significance of eGFR 76 mL/min/1.73 m²

An eGFR of 76 mL/min/1.73 m² is **mildly reduced** and, if persistent for ≥ 3 months, meets CKD stage 2 criteria (60–89 mL/min/1.73 m²) in the absence of other kidney damage markers. Many patients at this level are asymptomatic, but **persistent eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² increases cardiovascular risk** and may progress, so monitoring is warranted [^1119AfVX] [^111cJLNg].

---

## Role of cystatin C in estimating GFR

Cystatin C is a low–molecular weight protein produced at a constant rate by all nucleated cells; it is freely filtered and fully reabsorbed and catabolized by proximal tubules, making it a **reliable endogenous filtration marker** [^111NHckj]. It is less affected by muscle mass, diet, and race than creatinine, but can be influenced by inflammation, obesity, smoking, corticosteroids, and thyroid disease [^114h6MDC] [^115X3PDa].

## Comparison of cystatin C and creatinine-based eGFR

| **Factor** | **Creatinine-based egfr** | **Cystatin c-based egfr** |
|-|-|-|
| Influenced by muscle mass | Yes | No |
| Influenced by diet | Yes | No |
| Influenced by race | Yes | No |
| Influenced by inflammation | No | Yes |
| Influenced by obesity | No | Yes |
| Influenced by thyroid disease | No | Yes |

---

Cystatin C-based eGFR is **more accurate in older adults, those with low muscle mass, chronic illness, or acute kidney injury**, and is less biased by non-GFR determinants than creatinine [^116EABqS] [^1151ULyu].

---

## Clinical implications of discordance between eGFRcr and eGFRcys

Discordance between eGFRcr and eGFRcys is common and clinically meaningful. A **large negative difference** (eGFRcys significantly lower than eGFRcr) is associated with higher risks of mortality, cardiovascular disease, and kidney failure, whereas a **large positive difference** indicates lower risk [^114kfbCu] [^116NCGS1]. For example, in the CKD-PC meta-analysis, eGFRcys < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² with eGFRcr ≥ 60 identified individuals at higher cardiovascular and mortality risk than those with concordant eGFR ≥ 60 [^1119AfVX].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend using **creatinine-based eGFR for initial assessment** and adding cystatin C when:

- eGFRcr is 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m² without albuminuria and confirmation is needed [^114BkReJ] [^1119DLuQ].
- eGFRcr is likely inaccurate (e.g. low muscle mass, chronic illness, acute kidney injury) [^111NBuLs] [^112Boerf].
- Greater precision is needed for drug dosing or clinical decision-making [^114ipEpJ] [^111Ldp3g].

The **combined CKD-EPI 2021 creatinine–cystatin C equation** provides the most accurate eGFR and is recommended when both markers are available [^114AqNLq] [^114shjdX].

---

## Clinical management of eGFR 76 mL/min/1.73 m² with cystatin C

For an eGFR of 76 mL/min/1.73 m², **management depends on cystatin C results**:

- **eGFRcys similar to eGFRcr**: CKD is less likely; monitor and reassess periodically.
- **eGFRcys significantly lower than eGFRcr**: suggests true CKD and higher cardiovascular risk; consider further evaluation, risk stratification, and targeted interventions [^1119AfVX] [^114kfbCu].
- **eGFRcys significantly higher than eGFRcr**: suggests creatinine overestimation of CKD; reassess muscle mass, diet, and other factors influencing creatinine [^111d6CdQ].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Cystatin C is influenced by inflammation, obesity, smoking, corticosteroids, and thyroid disease; results should be interpreted in clinical context [^114h6MDC] [^115X3PDa]. Assay **standardization** is improving, but variability persists; use **calibrated assays** when possible [^115fUNiz]. Cost and limited availability may limit use, though access is expanding [^111JUZvv].

---

An eGFR of 76 mL/min/1.73 m² is mildly reduced; cystatin C helps when creatinine is unreliable or discordant. Use the **combined equation** for the most accurate estimate, and interpret results with clinical context and albuminuria to guide management [^114AqNLq] [^111cJLNg].

Kidney function monitoring using creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate estimation is a routine part of clinical practice. Emerging evidence has shown that cystatin C may improve classification of glomerular filtration rate for defining chronic kidney disease in certain clinical populations and assist in understanding the complications of chronic kidney disease. In this review and update, we summarize the overall literature on cystatin C, critically evaluate recent high-impact studies, highlight the role of cystatin C in recent kidney disease guidelines, and suggest a practical approach for clinicians to incorporate cystatin C into practice. We conclude by addressing frequently asked questions related to implementing cystatin C use in a clinical setting.

### GFR estimating equations: getting closer to the truth? [^111WVSKN]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The application of serum creatinine and cystatin C in patients with CKD has been limited to using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Criteria for choosing the best GFR estimating equation are 1) accuracy in estimating measured GFR, 2) optimal discrimination of clinical outcomes, and 3) association with CKD risk factors and outcomes similar to that of measured GFR. Notably, these criteria are often not in agreement; and while the last criterion is the most important, it has been widely overlooked. The primary problem with eGFR is that the non-GFR determinants of serum creatinine and cystatin C, as well as their surrogates (age, sex, and race), associate with CKD risk factors and outcomes. This leads to a distorted understanding of CKD, though eGFR based on serum creatinine appears to be less biased than eGFR based on cystatin C. Because of this problem, the use of eGFR should be limited to settings where knowing actual GFR is relevant and eGFR is more informative about GFR than serum creatinine or cystatin C alone. Such settings include staging CKD severity by GFR and dosing medications cleared by glomerular filtration. Alternatively, the diagnosis of CKD, the longitudinal progression of CKD, and prognostic models for CKD are settings where serum creatinine and cystatin C can be better applied and interpreted without eGFR.

Key Points

Question

Does estimation of kidney function by cystatin C level improve risk-stratification for cardiovascular disease and mortality?

Findings

In this cohort study, patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate based on serum creatinine level less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 were at low or high risk of future cardiovascular disease and death. Estimated glomerular filtration rate based on cystatin C acurately stratified risk in these individuals.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that, in the absence of cystatin C testing, estimated glomerular filtration rate inadequately distinguishes the broader risks associated with mild chronic kidney disease based on serum creatinine level.

Conclusions

The association of elevated circulating levels of cystatin C with adverse medium‐ and long‐term outcomes underscores the importance of CKD as a cardiovascular risk factor in our aging societies. However, our data also support the additional prognostic value for major CVD events and long‐term mortality of measurement of circulating cystatin C beyond allowing improved assessment of eGFR.

Commentary and clinical utility — initial assessment and confirmation of GFR state that "For the majority of adults without conditions that affect SCr levels independent of GFR, a creatinine-based estimate of GFR (eGFRcr) is a reasonable approach for initial evaluation of GFR". For patients in whom eGFRcr is unreliable, the commentary notes, "we agree with the recommendation to use a combined creatinine and cystatin C approach to estimate GFR for CKD screening or confirmation", and cites "A recent analysis of data from 4,050 adults from 12 cohorts with measured GFR".

### Understanding estimated glomerular filtration rate: implications for identifying chronic kidney disease [^1174GHm5]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can be estimated using serum markers such as serum creatinine (SCr) or cystatin C. This review presents new insights into estimated GFR based on theory, validation studies, SCr assay standardization, cystatin C, and longitudinal comparison with measured GFR.

Recent Findings

The estimation of GFR by SCr differs in health and in chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to differences in GFR range and in creatinine production between these two populations. Among populations with normal baseline GFR, there is a more rapid decline in measured GFR than in SCr-based estimated GFR. While elevated SCr is specific for CKD, other disease processes may lead to elevated cystatin C. Validation is improved by refitting equation coefficients to compare populations, recognizing the asymmetry between estimated GFR and measured GFR, and using residual plots instead of Bland-Altman plots to assess bias.

Summary

As a screening test, SCr should be interpreted as a marker of CKD probability in the context of the patient's clinical presentation. Measured GFR or creatinine clearance may be helpful in high-risk patients with normal SCr levels. GFR estimating equations should be reserved for patients with identified CKD. Standardized SCr and cystatin C assays are needed.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^111cJLNg]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

CKD detection and testing — KDOQI US commentary agrees with KDIGO practice points, noting that an analysis of over 27 million individuals across 114 international cohorts highlighted the graded and additive associations of lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher albuminuria with 10 important cardiovascular and kidney outcomes. The KDOQI Work Group agrees with the practice points that endorse both UACR and eGFR for CKD testing, with confirmatory repeat testing in those found incidentally to have elevated UACR or low eGFR, and while they agree that cystatin C should be combined with Scr to provide the most reliable estimation of GFR, if these results are readily available to impact critical medical or medication-related decision making, both Scr (cr) and cystatin C (cys) should be obtained at the same time and used to estimate the GFR (eGFRcr-cys).

Progression of kidney disease

There is no consistent definition of what constitutes renal progression in the literature. Many studies have used a doubling of serum creatinine, corresponding to an approximate halving of GFR, as an end-point defining progression, but this is insufficiently sensitive to be useful in clinical practice. Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) have defined progression as a move to a higher disease category (e.g. stage 3A [GFR 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m²] to stage 3B [GFR30–44 mL/min/1.73 m²]) confirmed by a fall in GFR of greater than or equal to 25%, an increase in albuminuria, a greater than 25% decline in GFR (e.g. a decline from 60 mL/min/1.73 m² to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m²) or a greater than 10%/year decline in GFR (e.g. a decline from 60 mL/min/1.73 m² to less than 54 mL/min/1.73 m² in one year). NICE defined progression as a decline in GFR of more than 5 mL/min/1.73 m²/year, or more than 10 mL/min/1.73 m² averaged over 5 years.

Progression is not necessarily common even amongst people with known CKD e.g. amongst people with stage 3 CKD only 1.3% progressed to stage 5 CKD (established renal failure, typically requiring dialysis or transplantation) over 5 years. Amongst community dwelling older (greater than 65 years) adults with stage 3 CKD mean GFR declines of 3.6 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year and 2.8 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year have been reported respectively in male and female subjects with diabetes and somewhat lower values amongst subjects without diabetes (1.9 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year and 1.1 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year amongst males and females respectively). In the REIN study proteinuric (greater than 1 g/24 h) non-diabetic subjects with GFRs in the approximate range 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 showed a decline of GFR of 7.0 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year with slightly lower values being observed in those receiving renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade.

### The complexity of kidney disease and diagnosing it-cystatin C, selective glomerular hypofiltration syndromes and proteome regulation [^114qy1Ya]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Knowledge of kidney function, expressed as glomerular filtration rate (GFR), is pivotal in most clinical situations. Measuring GFR involves invasive and cumbersome procedures, and estimations of GFR (eGFR) based on the plasma or serum level of endogenous marker molecules are therefore widely applied in clinical practice. Although creatinine has been used for this purpose since the late 1950s, it was not until 1979 that studies of the plasma concentration of cystatin C, then called γ‐trace, indicated that this protein might serve as an alternative to creatinine for an estimation of GFR. Early investigations of cystatin C, as a marker of GFR, suggested that a raised plasma level not only indicated a reduction in GFR but also significant changes in the human proteome in patients with kidney disease. Further studies of cystatin C have shown that the protein in many respects is superior to creatinine as a marker of GFR. In addition, recent investigations of cystatin C and kidney disease have demonstrated that mere GFR‐determination is insufficient to diagnose a significant part of kidney disorders and must be supplemented with measurements of the quality of the glomerular filtrate. These observations strongly urge the necessity to complement present recommendations for detecting kidney diseases (i.e. measurement, or estimation, of GFR, and determining the presence and level of albuminuria) with analysis of cystatin C to identify defects in the glomerular filtration process and the subsequent proteome changes in kidney disorders. This review describes those observations in the studies of cystatin C and kidney disorders, which prompt these conclusions.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^115JkMBh]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, choice of test, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize the implications of differences between eGFR by creatinine and eGFR by cystatin C, as these may be informative, in both direction and magnitude of those differences.

---

### Cystatin C is ready for clinical use [^116EABqS]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The goal of this update is to raise awareness of clinical scenarios where cystatin C has clear and immediate benefits as an alternative glomerular filtration rate (GFR) biomarker to supplement creatinine. An additional goal is to focus the estimated GFR (eGFR) controversy onto medication prescribing for agents with narrow therapeutic windows where better GFR estimation will lead to improved medical care.

Recent Findings

Equations that include cystatin C predict GFR more accurately than serum creatinine in children, adults, and older adults with larger effects among persons who are acutely ill. Numerous studies have evaluated medication dosing based on either GFR estimate; vancomycin was the most frequently studied drug and its target level and elimination were better predicted by cystatin C. Overall, approaches to medication dosing and monitoring that include cystatin C concentrations have been shown to result in a better achievement of drug trough levels. Furthermore, cystatin C offers the opportunity to avoid the race coefficient that is required for any current creatinine-based eGFR equation, which has been appropriately criticized for introducing unnecessary imprecision, assumptions and values on GFR estimation.

Summary

Hospital laboratories must make cystatin C available for clinical care to improve the safety and efficacy of medications that have narrow therapeutic windows.

### How best to estimate glomerular filtration rate? Novel filtration markers and their application [^115ZeVaX]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic kidney disease is an increasing health burden. Estimating equations using serum concentrations of creatinine and cystatin C facilitate the assessment of kidney function as reflected in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Reduced eGFR is associated with increased risk for numerous adverse outcomes and is an important aspect in many clinical situations. However, current equations are suboptimal in some clinical settings. The review focuses on approaches to improve the estimation of GFR and aims to familiarize the reader with the underlying methodological hypotheses how new markers could contribute to improve the overall performance of estimating equations.

Recent Findings

Low molecular weight proteins such as β-trace-protein and β-2-microglobulin, as well as newly discovered metabolites, show promise as new filtration markers, as they might be beneficial in populations in which creatinine or cystatin C are inaccurate. We propose that the combination of multiple novel markers, alone or in combination with creatinine, cystatin C or demographics, can potentially improve GFR estimation. For special populations such as dialysis patients, separate equations have been developed to estimate residual kidney function.

Summary

Current GFR estimating equations are an essential part of routine clinical practice but have limitations. The use of multiple markers combined in a single equation appears to be the most promising approach. Future research is required to validate proposed equations in diverse populations.

Results

There were 428 402 participants with median age of 57 (IQR, 50–63) years, 237 173 (55.4%) were women, and 191 229 (44.6%) were men. Among 76 629 older participants (median follow-up, 11.4; IQR, 10.6–12.1 years), there were 9335 deaths, 5205 CVD events (2158 CVD-associated deaths), and 46 kidney failure events. Among 351 773 younger participants (median follow-up, 11.6; IQR, 10.9–12.3 years), there were 14 776 deaths, 9328 CVD events (3117 CVD-associated deaths), and 124 kidney failure events.

Baseline Characteristics

Compared with individuals without evidence of CKD by any criterion, those with evidence of CKD G3 by both eGFRcr and eGFRcys were more likely to have baseline diabetes and hypertension and to use blood pressure– and cholesterol-lowering medications. Similarly, participants with evidence of CKD G3 by eGFRcys (Table) and eGFRcr-cys (eTable 1 in the Supplement) had a higher prevalence of baseline comorbidities and medication use compared with those with CKD G3 by eGFRcr only.

### Quantifying individual-level inaccuracy in glomerular filtration rate estimation: a cross-sectional study [^1174VWnn]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Although the population-level differences between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) are well recognized, the magnitude and potential clinical implications of individual-level differences are unknown.

Objective

To quantify the magnitude and consequences of the individual-level differences between mGFRs and eGFRs.

Design

Cross-sectional study.

Setting

Four U.S. community-based epidemiologic cohort studies with mGFR.

Patients

3223 participants in 4 studies.

Measurements

The GFRs were measured using urinary iothalamate and plasma iohexol clearance; the eGFR was calculated from serum creatinine concentration alone (eGFR CR) and with cystatin C. All GFR results are presented as mL/min/1.73 m².

Results

The participants' mean age was 59 years; 32% were Black, 55% were women, and the mean mGFR was 68. The population-level differences between mGFR and eGFR CR were small; the median difference (mGFR - eGFR) was -0.6 (95% CI, -1.2 to -0.2); however, the individual-level differences were large. At an eGFR CR of 60, 50% of mGFRs ranged from 52 to 67, 80% from 45 to 76, and 95% from 36 to 87. At an eGFR CR of 30, 50% of mGFRs ranged from 27 to 38, 80% from 23 to 44, and 95% from 17 to 54. Substantial disagreement in chronic kidney disease staging by mGFR and eGFR CR was present. Among those with eGFR CR of 45 to 59, 36% had mGFR greater than 60 whereas 20% had mGFR less than 45; among those with eGFR CR of 15 to 29, 30% had mGFR greater than 30 and 5% had mGFR less than 15. The eGFR based on cystatin C did not provide substantial improvement.

Limitation

Single measurement of mGFR and serum markers without short-term replicates.

Conclusion

A substantial individual-level discrepancy exists between the mGFR and the eGFR. Laboratories reporting eGFR should consider including the extent of this uncertainty to avoid misinterpretation of eGFR as an mGFR replacement.

### Cystatin C as a marker of glomerular filtration rate: prospects and limitations [^115WsLqg]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is much interest in cystatin C to replace or supplement serum creatinine to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Here we review the performance of cystatin C and combined creatinine-cystatin C estimating equations compared to creatinine-based estimating equations in chronic and acute kidney disease.

Recent Findings

Drift in the cystatin C assay has had a large effect on the results reported using cystatin C, but these issues are not routinely considered in evaluation of GFR-estimating equations. The recently released primary reference material for cystatin C will allow less difference among assays in the future. There does not appear to be a consistent message among published studies as to whether cystatin C-based equations are better than creatinine-based equations in the general population or those with chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well as those with reduced muscle mass or chronic illness, or acute kidney injury. Cystatin C could be used in combination with creatinine as a confirmatory test for estimated GFR from creatinine.

Summary

Cystatin C may have a role to estimate GFR in selected circumstances, and the next set of studies should be directed at developing implementation strategies for its use.

### Cystatin C as a biomarker for estimating glomerular filtration rate [^113KiU9n]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is rarely measured in clinical practice because of the complexity of the measurement. As such, kidney function is typically estimated using validated study equations, which use readily available data including age, sex, race, and serum creatinine as filtration marker. Contemporary research suggests that cystatin C may be an improved alternative to creatinine for inclusion in GFR estimating equations. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the benefits and limitations of using cystatin C as a biomarker of filtration.

Recent Findings

Cystatin C has fewer non-GFR determinants, when compared with serum creatinine. Use of serum cystatin C avoids the limitations related to both diet and muscle mass that affect serum creatinine. Cystatin C may be more accurate than serum creatinine in estimating GFR, and is more strongly associated with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events.

Summary

Cystatin C has some advantages over serum creatinine in estimating GFR. The use of cystatin C as a confirmatory biomarker in deciding medication dosages or as a confirmatory test in patients with an uncertain diagnosis of chronic kidney disease may be beneficial.

Cystatin C–based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) use and CKD risk classification indicate that "The KDIGO guideline recommends measurement of cystatin C in persons with eGFRcr of 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m2 without albuminuria", and among those with "eGFRcr of 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m2 without albuminuria and whose eGFRcys and/or eGFRcr−cys values are ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the risk for CKD complications is very low. These persons could be considered not to have CKD". The commentary endorses dual reporting: "We agree with reporting both eGFRcr and eGFRcr−cys whenever cystatin C and creatinine are ordered so that the clinician can have both values of eGFR available for decision making". Implementation considerations note, "measurement is now automated, and it can be performed on existing platforms without the need for specialized equipment", and emphasize assay standardization: "only cystatin C measurements obtained using assays traceable to higher level reference materials should be used to estimate the GFR".

### Serum cystatin C as a marker of glomerular filtration rate [^114VFrRf]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Glomerular filtration rate is widely accepted as the best overall measure of kidney function. Currently available methods to estimate glomerular filtration rate have strengths and limitations. Cystatin C is a novel endogenous filtration marker being considered as a potential replacement for serum creatinine. This review summarizes the currently available glomerular filtration rate estimating equations based on cystatin C and the literature comparing cystatin C and creatinine as filtration markers.

Recent Findings

In most cystatin C estimating equations, inclusion of age and sex did not substantially improve their performance. Equations yield different glomerular filtration rate estimates for the same level of cystatin C. Variation among equations may be due to differences among the assays or populations in the individual studies. Studies comparing cystatin C with creatinine or creatinine-based estimating equations show heterogeneous results, with some showing improved performance and others showing equivalent performance even in similar populations. These heterogeneous results may be due to inappropriate comparisons between equations developed in one population with those developed in another, or to the differences between assays or population characteristics.

Summary

Cystatin C shows promise as an alternative to serum creatinine but several important questions remain before it can be recommended for use in clinical practice.

### Association between elevated cystatin C levels and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome: a systematic review and updated meta-analysis [^112PNsvY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a sleep-breathing disorder marked by recurrent upper airway obstruction. Intermittent hypoxemia caused by frequent apnea and hypopnea during sleep in patients with OSAHS is accompanied by a series of systemic pathophysiological changes. Recently, there has been a growing global concern regarding the systemic damage inflicted by OSAHS, particularly its detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system. However, there are fewer studies on renal damage by OSAHS. The kidney, characterized by its high blood flow and perfusion rates, is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in oxygen supply, rendering it susceptible to hypoxic injury. Therefore, the kidney stands as one of the significant target organs damaged in patients with OSAHS. However, due to the atypical clinical manifestations of early renal function injury caused by OSAHS, it is challenging to detect positive results in routine examinations, resulting in misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis.

In clinical practice, the main index for evaluating the overall renal function is the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Key indicators frequently utilized to estimate GFR include serum urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels. Despite widespread use in clinical practice, these indicators suffer shortcomings and have a low detection rate for early renal function impairment. In recent years, cystatin C has been recognized as a highly sensitive indicator for evaluating changes in GFR. Canales MT et al. employed cystatin C as an assessment marker for renal impairment, highlighting a higher proportion of sleep apnea in elderly individuals with elevated cystatin C levels. Serum cystatin C has been determined as an earlier and more sensitive biomarker for detecting renal impairment. Emerging investigations have revealed a prominent link between OSAHS and elevated cystatin C levels in patients without chronic kidney disease. However, some studies indicated that elevated cystatin C was only present in patients with severe OSAHS. Therefore, meta-analysis is needed for further evaluation. This study executed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting serum/plasma cystatin C levels in patients with OSAHS across varying degrees of disease severity. The aim was to explore the link between this biomarker and OSAHS. In addition, differences in cystatin C levels between daytime and nighttime were analyzed. Further, the impact of CPAP on serum cystatin C levels in patients with OSAHS was evaluated. Overall, these findings help to provide new treatment strategies and risk assessment methods for patients with OSAHS.

Kidney function and damage markers — GFR is the most widely used index of kidney function and may be measured by observing the clearance of exogenous filtration markers (eg, inulin, iothalamate) or estimated from serum concentrations of endogenous filtration markers (eg, creatinine, cystatin C). In clinical practice, serum creatinine is most commonly used to estimate GFR; the generation of creatinine, which is principally determined by muscle mass and nutritional intake, varies by sex, race, and age, and diseases that lead to muscle wasting can reduce creatinine generation, which may lead to overestimation of the GFR. To minimize variability in serum creatinine measurements, virtually all clinical laboratories report calibrated serum creatinine values that are traceable to an isotope dilution mass spectrometry reference measure. Cystatin C, which is produced by all nucleated cells, varies less by race, sex, or body composition than creatinine, and has been proposed to be a clinically relevant alternative filtration marker, especially when used in conjunction with creatinine.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to drug dose adjustments, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider using equations combining both creatinine and cystatin C, or measured GFR where more accuracy is required for drug-related decision-making (such as dosing due to narrow therapeutic or toxic range), drug toxicity, or clinical situations where eGFR by creatinine estimates may be unreliable.

### Assessment of cystatin C level for risk stratification in adults with chronic kidney disease [^117EgdCY]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this study, categorization of CKD by eGFRcr alone included a large proportion of low-risk individuals and failed to capture a substantial proportion of individuals at higher risk for CVD and mortality. Testing using eGFRcys is more sensitive than eGFRcr and improves the specificity of diagnosis of high-risk CKD, where there are substantially higher risks of CVD and death than of kidney failure. These findings suggest that, in the absence of cystatin C testing, eGFRcr inadequately detects the broader risks associated with mild CKD.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^115X3PDa]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Cystatin C — an alternative filtration marker — is described as a small protease inhibitor protein produced by all nucleated cells that is filtered at the glomerulus and then completely reabsorbed and degraded by the proximal tubule, and it is not as affected by muscle mass as creatinine. However, cystatin C levels are affected by fat mass (higher in obesity) and may be affected by inflammation, smoking, corticosteroids, or thyroid disease, and testing is becoming more widely available though it currently is more expensive than creatinine. Prior research has found that cystatin C has a more linear association with adverse outcomes while creatinine has a U-shaped relationship, where both very low creatinine levels and high creatinine levels are associated with adverse outcomes.

Chronic kidney disease evaluation — cystatin C for confirmation and reporting states to measure cystatin C in adults with eGFRcreat 45–59 ml/min/1.73 m² who do not have markers of kidney damage if confirmation of CKD is required; if eGFRcys or eGFRcreat-cys is also < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² the diagnosis of CKD is confirmed, whereas if eGFRcys or eGFRcreat-cys is ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m² the diagnosis is not confirmed; if cystatin C is measured, use a GFR estimating equation rather than the concentration alone; clinical laboratories should measure serum cystatin C using a traceable assay, report eGFR from serum cystatin C in addition to the concentration, and report eGFRcys and eGFRcreat-cys in adults using the 2012 CKD-EPI cystatin C and 2012 CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C equations; when reporting eGFRcys and eGFRcreat-cys, values should be rounded to the nearest whole number and expressed relative to 1.73 m² in ml/min/1.73 m², and levels less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m² should be reported as "decreased".

### Association of intraindividual difference in estimated glomerular filtration rate by creatinine vs cystatin C and end-stage kidney disease and mortality [^117UDZTT]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Current practice guidelines for CKD recommend measuring cystatin C when precision of eGFR is required and suggest adding cystatin C for confirmatory testing in situations when creatinine is less accurate, such as in persons who may underproduce creatinine because they are frail. As efforts advance to improve CKD detection and monitoring and to eliminate the use of race in estimating kidney function, cystatin C will be increasingly incorporated into routine clinical care, and clinicians will commonly encounter persons with large eGFRdiff cys-cr.,

Persons with large eGFRdiff cys-cr may have different risk profiles from those with similar eGFRcys and eGFRcr values. Furthermore, the eGFRdiff cys-cr would evolve if eGFRcys and eGFRcr changed at different rates over time, thus potentially offering further prognostic information. Two prior studies have demonstrated associations of baseline eGFRdiff cys-cr with mortality risk, but the implications of changes in eGFRdiff cys-cr are unknown. Furthermore, examining kidney-specific end points, such as ESKD, among a CKD population is important for determining the prognostic utility of eGFRcys as a component of eGFRdiff cys-cr. In this study, we sought to address the following questions among a cohort of individuals with CKD: (1) is eGFRdiff cys-cr at baseline independently associated with progression to ESKD and mortality; (2) compared with baseline values, do time-updated measures of eGFRdiff cys-cr yield different associations with ESKD and mortality; and (3) are longitudinal divergences between eGFRcys and eGFRcr independently associated with progression to ESKD and mortality?

### Estimating glomerular filtration rate: is it good enough? And is it time to move on? [^114tXwSF]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim is to examine a dominant narrative in nephrology over the past decade: that measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the gold standard measure of kidney function; accurate assessment of GFR is critical and paramount; and further efforts to refine GFR estimation should continue.

Recent Findings

Studies that have simultaneously compared measured GFR and estimated GFR (using endogenous filtration markers such as creatinine, or newer ones such as cystatin C or β-trace protein) against some external metric of kidney function have failed to show that measured GFR is consistently superior, which is what one would expect if measured GFR were truly the 'gold standard'.
Summary

Compared with estimated GFR, measured GFR does not consistently predict renal-related outcomes better. Clinical decision-making almost never requires precise and accurate knowledge of a patient's static GFR value. Efforts at perfecting cross-sectional estimates of GFR may have reached a point of diminishing returns.

### Discordance in creatinine-and cystatin C-based eGFR and clinical outcomes: a meta-analysis [^114kfbCu]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) can differ according to whether creatinine or cystatin C is used for the eGFR calculation, but the prevalence and importance of these differences remain unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the prevalence of a discordance between cystatin C-based eGFR (eGFRcys) and creatinine-based eGFR (eGFRcr), identify characteristics associated with greater discordance, and evaluate associations of discordance with adverse outcomes.

Data Sources

Participants in the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC).

Study Selection

Participants with concurrent cystatin C and creatinine measurements and clinical outcome measurement.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Between April 2024 and August 2025, data were synthesized using individual-level meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary independent measurement was a large negative eGFR difference (eGFRdiff), defined as an eGFRcys that was at least 30% lower than eGFRcr. Secondary (dependent) outcomes included all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and kidney failure with replacement therapy.

Results

A total of 821 327 individuals from 23 outpatient cohorts (mean [SD] age, 59 [12] years; 48% female; 13.5% with diabetes; 40% with hypertension) and 39 639 individuals from 2 inpatient cohorts (mean [SD] age, 67 [16] years; 31% female; 30% with diabetes; 72% with hypertension) were included. Among outpatient participants, 11% had a large negative eGFRdiff (range, 3%-50%). Among inpatients, 35% had a large negative eGFRdiff. Among outpatient participants, at a mean (SD) follow-up of 11 (4) years, a large negative eGFRdiff, compared with an eGFRdiff between -30% and 30%, was associated with higher rates of all-cause mortality (28.4 vs 16.8 per 1000 person-years [PY]; hazard ratio [HR], 1.69 [95% CI, 1.57–1.82]), cardiovascular mortality (6.1 vs 3.8 per 1000 PY; HR, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.48–1.76]), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (13.3 vs 9.8 per 1000 PY; HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.27–1.44]), heart failure (13.2 vs 8.6 per 1000 PY; HR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.40–1.68]), and kidney failure with replacement therapy (2.7 vs 2.1 per 1000 PY; HR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.13–1.47]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In the CKD-PC, 11% of outpatient participants and 35% of hospitalized patients had an eGFRcys that was at least 30% lower than their eGFRcr. In the outpatient setting, presence of eGFRcys at least 30% lower than eGFRcr was associated with significantly higher rates of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, and kidney failure.

### Genetic analysis of elevated levels of creatinine and cystatin C biomarkers reveals novel genetic loci associated with kidney function [^111dFPsn]. Human Molecular Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The rising prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), affecting an estimated 37 million adults in the United States, presents a significant global health challenge. CKD is typically assessed using estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), which incorporates serum levels of biomarkers such as creatinine and cystatin C. However, these biomarkers do not directly measure kidney function; their elevation in CKD results from diminished glomerular filtration. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) based on eGFR formulas using creatinine (eGFRcre) or cystatin C (eGFRcys) have identified distinct non-overlapping loci, raising questions about whether these loci govern kidney function or biomarker metabolism. In this study, we show that GWAS on creatinine and cystatin C levels in healthy individuals reveal both nonoverlapping genetic loci impacting their metabolism as well as overlapping genetic loci associated with kidney function; whereas GWAS on elevated levels of these biomarkers uncover novel loci primarily associated with kidney function in CKD patients.

### Factors other than glomerular filtration rate affect serum cystatin C levels [^114h6MDC]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Cystatin C is an endogenous glomerular filtration marker hence its serum level is affected by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). To study what other factors might affect it blood level we performed a cross-sectional analysis of 3418 patients which included a pooled dataset of clinical trial participants and a clinical population with chronic kidney disease. The serum cystatin C and creatinine levels were related to clinical and biochemical parameters and errors-in-variables models were used to account for errors in GFR measurements. The GFR was measured as the urinary clearance of 125I-iothalamate and 51Cr-EDTA. Cystatin C was determined at a single laboratory while creatinine was standardized to reference methods and these were 2.1 ± 1.1 mg/dL and 1.8 ± 0.8 mg/L, respectively. After adjustment for GFR, cystatin C was 4.3% lower for every 20 years of age, 9.2% lower for female gender but only 1.9% lower in blacks. Diabetes was associated with 8.5% higher levels of cystatin C and 3.9% lower levels of creatinine. Higher C-reactive protein and white blood cell count and lower serum albumin were associated with higher levels of cystatin C and lower levels of creatinine. Adjustment for age, gender and race had a greater effect on the association of factors with creatinine than cystatin C. Hence, we found that cystatin C is affected by factors other than GFR which should be considered when the GFR is estimated using serum levels of cystatin C.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic kidney disease in patients infected with HIV: 2014 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1157Pteg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

ART benefits and dosing practices in CKD/ESRD — Observational data demonstrate that the survival benefits of ART extend to patients with ESRD who are receiving renal replacement therapy, but studies have consistently shown underuse of ART in HIV-infected individuals with CKD or ESRD. Incorrect dosing of antiretroviral drugs at reduced levels of kidney function is common in both inpatient and outpatient settings and is a major source of ART-associated medication errors, and higher mortality was associated with ART underexposure or incorrect ART dosing in 2 studies among HIV-infected patients with CKD. Clinicians should use estimated creatinine clearance or GFR to modify the dose of renally cleared drugs in the setting of kidney insufficiency; with the exception of abacavir, dose reductions are required for nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors when kidney function is reduced, and the necessity for differential dose adjustments of one or more components usually precludes the use of many combination products in patients with severely impaired kidney function. The US Food and Drug Administration has historically required Cockcroft–Gault–based creatinine clearance for pharmacokinetic studies in decreased kidney function, whereas KDIGO guidelines recommend CKD-EPI–based assessment of GFR using creatinine alone, cystatin C alone, or both biomarkers together.

### Metabolic abnormalities are present in adults with elevated serum cystatin C [^1112ATsH]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Although metabolic anomalies are often seen in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), their presence in more mild states is unknown. We studied 6722 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, dividing them into three mutually exclusive groups consisting of those having a normal or mildly reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula), those with normal or elevated serum cystatin C, and those with clinically relevant moderate or severely reduced eGFR (stage 3 or 4 of CKD). The prevalence of several metabolic abnormalities associated with moderate to advanced CKD was determined after standardization for age, race-ethnicity, and gender. In the absence of stage 3 or 4 CKD, patients with elevated serum cystatin C had a higher prevalence of low hemoglobin and elevated uric acid, homocysteine, phosphorus, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein than patients with a normal serum cystatin C. Our results show that in adults with normal or mildly reduced eGFR, elevated serum cystatin C is associated with an increased prevalence of metabolic abnormalities traditionally found in moderate or severe CKD. Elevated serum cystatin C may identify patients with 'preclinical' kidney disease not detected by traditional serum creatinine measurements.

### Update on cystatin C: new insights into the importance of mild kidney dysfunction [^114kUbmq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Using cystatin C, a novel serum marker of kidney function, several studies have shown that mild kidney dysfunction is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Studies have questioned, however, whether cystatin C is predominantly a measure of kidney function. This review summarizes the research literature on cystatin C.

Recent Findings

One longitudinal study in patients with diabetes found cystatin C to approximate glomerular filtration rate measures over 4 years much better than creatinine. Studies in several cohorts found cystatin C to be linearly associated with mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure risk, whereas creatinine predicted increased risk only in subjects with the worst kidney function. One study, however, found that increased age, male sex, increased height and weight, smoking, and higher C-reactive protein levels were associated with cystatin C after adjustment for creatinine clearance, which may suggest nonrenal influences on cystatin C concentrations.

Summary

Cystatin C appears to capture the association of mild kidney dysfunction with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and death. Future research needs to evaluate whether cystatin C will have an important role in clinical medicine.

### Association of intraindividual difference in estimated glomerular filtration rate by creatinine vs cystatin C and end-stage kidney disease and mortality [^114qqrge]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are differences between estimated glomerular filtration rate by cystatin C (eGFRcys) vs creatinine (eGFRcr) associated with the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and mortality among individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 4956 participants with CKD, differences between eGFRcys and eGFRcr identified high- and low-risk groups with more than 3-fold difference in ESKD risk and 5-fold difference in mortality risk. Divergence between eGFRcys and eGFRcr slopes over time was strongly associated with mortality risk.

Meaning

These findings suggest that among patients with CKD, longitudinal monitoring of both cystatin C and creatinine may be warranted to enhance risk stratification.

### Cystatin C identifies chronic kidney disease patients at higher risk for complications [^114JnGDr]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Although cystatin C is a stronger predictor of clinical outcomes associated with CKD than creatinine, the clinical role for cystatin C is unclear. We included 11,909 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and assessed risks for death, cardiovascular events, heart failure, and ESRD among persons categorized into mutually exclusive groups on the basis of the biomarkers that supported a diagnosis of CKD (eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)): creatinine only, cystatin C only, both, or neither. We used CKD-EPI equations to estimate GFR from these biomarkers. In MESA, 9% had CKD by the creatinine-based equation only, 2% had CKD by the cystatin C-based equation only, and 4% had CKD by both equations; in CHS, these percentages were 12, 4, and 13%, respectively. Compared with those without CKD, the adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for mortality in MESA were: 0.80 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.26) for CKD by creatinine only; 3.23 (95% CI 1.84 to 5.67) for CKD by cystatin C only; and 1.93 (95% CI 1.27 to 2.92) for CKD by both; in CHS, the adjusted HR were 1.09 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.21), 1.78 (95% CI 1.53 to 2.08), and 1.74 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.93), respectively. The pattern was similar for cardiovascular disease (CVD), heart failure, and kidney failure outcomes. In conclusion, among adults diagnosed with CKD using the creatinine-based CKD-EPI equation, the adverse prognosis is limited to the subset who also have CKD according to the cystatin C-based equation. Cystatin C may have a role in identifying persons with CKD who have the highest risk for complications.

### Association of intraindividual difference in estimated glomerular filtration rate by creatinine vs cystatin C and end-stage kidney disease and mortality [^112xPFDd]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Our findings suggest that monitoring of eGFRcys is critical for patients with the worst health status, as they are the most likely to have their eGFRcr biased by creatinine underproduction and thus to have more negative eGFRdiff cys-cr. Conversely, participants with positive eGFRdiff cys-cr or steeper declines in eGFRcr than eGFRcys (positive eGFRdiff cys-cr slope) were relatively healthy and had lower risks for ESKD and mortality. In these individuals, higher levels of physical activity and muscle mass may increase creatinine production, leading to underestimation of kidney function and overestimation of ESKD and mortality risk. Hypothetically, accounting for all non-GFR factors that may possibly affect creatinine more than cystatin C over time could explain the substantial differences in risk of adverse outcomes among patients with varying degrees of eGFRdiff cys-cr. However, eGFRdiff cys-cr captures a conglomerate of non-GFR factors that are associated with overall health status. Accurately measuring and quantifying all of these factors is both impractical and likely impossible in either well-designed research cohorts or in real-world clinical practice. Our findings show that obtaining a cystatin C measurement and assessing differences between eGFRcr and eGFRcys is a simple approach to distinguish risk among individuals with CKD.

### Association of intraindividual difference in estimated glomerular filtration rate by creatinine vs cystatin C and end-stage kidney disease and mortality [^115qWGqC]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cohort study found that substantial differences between eGFRcys and eGFRcr were common and that eGFRdiff cys-cr conveys important prognostic information that is currently missed when only eGFRcr is monitored over time. When eGFRcys and eGFRcr were discrepant by more than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2, risk of ESKD and mortality was associated with whether eGFRcys was lower or higher than eGFRcr. The widening of eGFRdiff cys-cr over time, which depicted divergence between the slopes of eGFRcys and eGFRcr, captured clinically important changes in health status that manifested as significant associations with mortality risk. Our results support the clinical utility in regularly obtaining measures of cystatin C in addition to creatinine throughout the longitudinal care of persons with CKD.

### Assessment of cystatin C level for risk stratification in adults with chronic kidney disease [^116vyNaY]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines recommended estimation of glomerular filtration rate based on cystatin C level (eGFRcys) testing for confirmation of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the absence of other markers of kidney damage and in circumstances when estimated glomerular filtration rate is based on serum creatinine (eGFRcr) level may be less accurate. Glomerular filtration rate decreases with age; however, muscle mass and activity are the main determinants of serum creatinine levels at fixed GFR. Older people tend to have lower muscle mass, leading to lower creatinine generation, which may result in overestimation of GFR. These competing factors lead eGFRcr to have potential discordance with eGFRcys, which may be especially pronounced in older adults. Furthermore, eGFRcys has a greater association vs eGFRcr with future risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death. However, the recommendation to conduct concordance testing for CKD with cystatin C is rarely implemented.

To examine whether the use of cystatin C as a concordance test for CKD could improve detection of high-risk CKD, we compared the estimated prevalence of CKD based on eGFRcr, eGFRcys, and parallel analysis (eGFRcr-cys) among people with an eGFRcr greater than or equal to 45 mL/min/1.73 m² and no albuminuria. We stratified the analyses by age to assess whether concordance testing had similar value in younger compared with older adults. We hypothesized that there would be substantially higher risk for adverse outcomes (including CVD, all-cause mortality, and kidney failure) in the subset of patients with CKD confirmed by eGFRcys testing.

### Cystatin C and prognosis for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in elderly persons without chronic kidney disease [^1137RrRP]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Cystatin C is an alternative measure of kidney function that may have prognostic importance among elderly persons who do not meet standard criteria for chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] ≥ 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2).

Objective

To evaluate cystatin C as a prognostic biomarker for death, cardiovascular disease, and incident chronic kidney disease among elderly persons without chronic kidney disease.

Design

Cohort study.

Setting

The Cardiovascular Health Study, a population-based cohort recruited from 4 communities in the United States.

Participants

4663 elderly persons.

Measurements

Measures of kidney function were creatinine-based estimated GFR by using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation and cystatin C concentration. Outcomes were death, cardiovascular death, noncardiovascular death, heart failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, and incident chronic kidney disease during follow-up (median, 9.3 years).

Results

At baseline, 78% of participants did not have chronic kidney disease (estimated GFR ≥ 60 mL/min per 1.73 m²) and mean cystatin C concentration, creatinine concentration, and estimated GFR were 1.0 mg/L, 79.6 micromol/L (0.9 mg/dL), and 83 mL/min per 1.73 m², respectively. Cystatin C concentrations (per SD, 0.18 mg/L) had strong associations with death (hazard ratio, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.25 to 1.40]), cardiovascular death (hazard ratio, 1.42 [CI, 1.30 to 1.54]), noncardiovascular death (hazard ratio, 1.26 [CI, 1.17 to 1.36]), incident heart failure (hazard ratio, 1.28 [CI, 1.17 to 1.40]), stroke (hazard ratio, 1.22 [CI, 1.08 to 1.38]), and myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 1.20 [CI, 1.06 to 1.36]) among these participants. Serum creatinine concentrations had much weaker associations with each outcome and only predicted cardiovascular death. Participants without chronic kidney disease who had elevated cystatin C concentrations (≥ 1.0 mg/L) had a 4-fold risk for progressing to chronic kidney disease after 4 years of follow-up compared with those with cystatin C concentrations less than 1.0 mg/L.

Limitations

Because this study did not directly measure GFR or albuminuria, the extent to which cystatin C may be influenced by nonrenal factors was not determined and participants with albuminuria might have been misclassified as having no kidney disease.

Conclusions

Among elderly persons without chronic kidney disease, cystatin C is a prognostic biomarker of risk for death, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. In this setting, cystatin C seems to identify a "preclinical" state of kidney dysfunction that is not detected with serum creatinine or estimated GFR.

### Creatinine-and cystatin C-based estimated glomerular filtration rate slopes for the prediction of kidney outcome: a comparative retrospective study [^112Hf54v]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study investigated the prognostic efficacy of eGFR slopes calculated by simultaneous measurement of two endogenous filtration markers, creatinine and cystatin C levels, over a 1-year period in patients with decreased kidney function. Both eGFR slopes were effective in identifying subjects at a higher risk of ESRD, and the eGFRcr slope was not different to the eGFRcys slope as a predictor of renal outcome in patients with CKD. Although serum cystatin C level has been reported to be a better predictor of cardiovascular disease and mortality than serum creatinine level, the latter may reflect GFR trends more directly, which may be useful for proper management of renal replacement therapy.

### Kidney function estimated from serum creatinine and cystatin C and peripheral arterial disease in NHANES 1999–2002 [^111x6Ghj]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

Serum cystatin C, a novel marker of kidney function, is reported to be superior to serum creatinine as a risk factor for atherosclerotic disease, but associations may vary across vascular beds.

Methods and Results

A cross-sectional study of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in 3089 adult participants aged 40+ from the 1999–2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Kidney function, assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), was determined from serum creatinine and cystatin C using established equations. Peripheral arterial disease defined by an ankle brachial index < 0.90. Glomerular filtration rate estimated using cystatin C was more strongly associated with PAD compared with eGFR using serum creatinine before and after multivariable adjustment. Further, after adjustment for cystatin C, kidney function based on serum creatinine was no longer significantly associated with PAD. However, cystatin C remained significantly associated with PAD even after adjustment for GFR estimated by serum creatinine. Compared with optimal kidney function (eGFR(serum creatinine) ≥ 60, eGFR(cystatin C) > 90), the odds ratio for PAD was 3.11 (95% confidence interval 1.26–7.64) for preclinical CKD (eGFR(serum creatinine) ≥ 60, eGFR(cystatin C) < 76.7) and 5.07 (3.01–8.52) for 'confirmed' CKD (eGFR(serum creatinine) < 60, eGFR(cystatin C) < 60).

Conclusion

Chronic kidney disease was strongly and independently associated with PAD. Cystatin C was a more potent marker of lower extremity PAD when compared with the serum creatinine equation currently used in clinical practice. Our results suggest that cystatin C may have clinical utility when combined with serum creatinine in evaluation of individuals who may have PAD.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) evaluation — serum creatinine–based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in adults recommends using serum creatinine and a GFR estimating equation for initial assessment, and recommends that clinicians use a GFR estimating equation to derive GFR from serum creatinine (eGFRcreat) rather than relying on the serum creatinine concentration alone; laboratories should measure serum creatinine using a specific assay traceable to international standard reference materials, report eGFRcreat in addition to the serum creatinine concentration in adults, and report eGFRcreat in adults using the 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equation; when reporting eGFRcreat, it should be reported and rounded to the nearest whole number and relative to a body surface area of 1.73 m² in adults using the units ml/min/1.73 m², and eGFRcreat levels less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m² should be reported as "decreased"; additional tests (such as cystatin C or a clearance measurement) are suggested for confirmatory testing in specific circumstances when eGFR based on serum creatinine is less accurate.

Guideline 1. Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease — Microalbuminuria is the best available test for screening of DKD, but it is imprecise, and markers under study include urinary immunoreactive intact albumin and shed podocytes, genetic risk indicators, blood and/or urine changes in growth factors, cytokines, inflammatory markers, or markers of oxidative stress, and innovative kidney imaging or tissue studies. Appropriately weighted risk algorithms should be derived using predictive variables, including AER within the normalalbuminuric or microalbuminuric range, retinopathy status, clinical and ambulatory blood pressure measurements, glycemic control, lipid levels, age, sex, race, and family history. Improved measures of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) should be developed and may include more reliable creatinine measurement methods, modifications of existing formulas, application of new GFR markers, such as cystatin C, and development of simplified direct GFR measurements. Additional studies on urinary albumin measurements, including predictive values of gender-specific ACR cutoffs, urine collection methods, and processing of urine samples, are warranted, and research questions include the rate of progression of DKD in people with reduced GFR but normal urinary albumin excretion compared with those with elevated urinary albumin excretion, whether regression of albuminuria modifies long-term progression, the effect of promising agents to prevent RCN in CKD across both types of diabetes, and the best common definition of RCN.

### Rounding creatinine, cystatin C or both: impact on discordance group assignment and GFR-estimating equation performance [^114iUZ8M]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The assumptions underlying different GFR-estimating equations can also influence eGFR accuracy, depending on the usage context. Inclusion of age and sex as variables in currently recommended GFR-estimating equations partially accounts for variability in creatinine and cystatin C levels unrelated to GFR, known as 'non-GFR determinants'. However, this inherently holds the assumption that non-GFR determinants are consistent among individuals of identical age and sex, which leaves eGFR subject to residual confounding if this assumption is not met. Moreover, there may be (unidentified) non-GFR determinants unrelated to age and sex that affect eGFR.

In summary, our findings underscore the necessity of adhering to a logical set of rules for appropriate rounding of biological measurements, a process that involves gathering the expanded uncertainty of a particular assay and identifying the number of significant decimals. For serum creatinine (in mg/dL) and cystatin C (in mg/L), this means using real numbers with two decimal places as per typical measurement imprecision of assays. Adherence to these rules will maximize accuracy in both clinical practice and research.

### Association of intraindividual difference in estimated glomerular filtration rate by creatinine vs cystatin C and end-stage kidney disease and mortality [^114scS8N]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

As cystatin C is increasingly adopted to estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), clinicians will encounter patients in whom cystatin C-based eGFR (eGFRcys) and creatinine-based eGFR (eGFRcr) differ widely. The clinical implications of these differences, eGFRdiffcys-cr, are unknown.

Objective

To evaluate the associations of eGFRdiffcys-cr with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and mortality among individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a prospective cohort study of 4956 individuals with mild to moderate CKD from 7 clinical centers in the United States who enrolled in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study between 2003 to 2018. Statistical analyses were completed in December 2021.

Exposures

eGFRdiffcys-cr (eGFRcys-eGFRcr) was calculated at baseline and annually thereafter for 3 years. Because 15 mL/min/1.73 m² represents a clinically meaningful difference in eGFR that also distinguishes CKD stages, eGFRdiffcys-cr was categorized as: less than -15 mL/min/1.73 m², -15 to 15 mL/min/1.73 m², and 15 mL/min/1.73 m² or greater.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The outcomes of ESKD, defined as initiation of maintenance dialysis or receipt of a kidney transplant, and all-cause mortality were adjudicated from study entry until administrative censoring in 2018.

Results

Among 4956 participants with mean (SD) age of 59.5 (10.5) years, 2152 (43.4%) were Black, 515 (10.4%) were Hispanic, and 2113 (42.6%) were White. There were 2156 (43.5%) women and 2800 (56.5%) men. At baseline, eGFRcys and eGFRcr values differed by more than 15 mL/min/1.73 m² in one-third of participants (1638 participants [33.1%]). Compared with participants with similar baseline eGFRcys and eGFRcr (eGFRdiffcys-cr -15 to 15 mL/min/1.73 m²), those in whom eGFRcys was substantially lower than eGFRcr (eGFRdiffcys-cr < -15 mL/min/1.73 m²) had a higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.86; 95% CI, 1.40–2.48) while those with eGFRdiffcys-cr of 15 mL/min/1.73 m² or greater had lower risks of ESKD (subHR [SHR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59–0.89) and mortality (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, CI 0.58–0.81). In time-updated analyses, participants with eGFRdiffcys-cr less than -15 mL/min/1.73 m² had higher risks of ESKD (SHR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.10–3.04) and mortality (HR, 3.03; 95% CI, 2.19–4.19) compared with participants with similar eGFRcys and eGFRcr. Conversely, participants with eGFRdiffcys-cr of 15 mL/min/1.73 m² or greater had lower risks of ESKD (SHR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.35–0.71) and mortality (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.45–0.75). Longitudinal changes in eGFRdiffcys-cr were associated with mortality risk. Compared with participants who had similar slopes by eGFRcys and eGFRcr, those with smaller eGFRcr declines had an 8-fold increased mortality risk (HR, 8.20; 95% CI, 6.37–10.56), and those with larger apparent declines by eGFRcr had a lower mortality risk (HR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.08–0.24).

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that large differences between eGFRcys and eGFRcr were common in persons with CKD. These differences and their changes over time may be informative of ESKD and mortality risks, warranting monitoring of both eGFRcys and eGFRcr in this high-risk population.

### Association of intraindividual difference in estimated glomerular filtration rate by creatinine vs cystatin C and end-stage kidney disease and mortality [^115wrR8z]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

While non-GFR factors associated with cystatin C also exist, such as obesity, steroid use, and possibly inflammation, their associations with serum cystatin C levels are smaller in magnitude than those of non-GFR factors associated with serum creatinine. We adjusted for waist circumference and steroid use in our baseline, time-updated, and slope analyses. Our results remained robust after additional adjustment for CRP in exploratory analyses. These results reinforce prior studies demonstrating that adjustment for markers of inflammation does not affect the prognostic value of cystatin C.

Our findings have important clinical implications. Persons with large negative or positive eGFRdiff cys-cr comprise high- and low-risk CKD subgroups for whom creatinine alone does not adequately capture ESKD and mortality risk. Recently, the NKF and ASN recommended increased use of the combined eGFR equation, which incorporates both cystatin C and creatinine to balance the influence of their non-GFR contributing factors. However, whether this combined eGFR equation should be applied among individuals in whom eGFRcys and eGFRcr are discrepant by more than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 is unclear. Our findings indicate that a large eGFRdiff cys-cr should prompt careful consideration as to whether creatinine may be heavily biased by factors unrelated to GFR, such as poor health status and sarcopenia. Use of the combined eGFR equation under these circumstances may misrepresent kidney function and prognosis. Recently, only 7% of surveyed laboratories in the US offered cystatin C tests. The higher cost of reagents for cystatin C compared with that for creatinine (approximately $4 vs $0.20 per test) is a commonly cited barrier to more widespread implementation. We anticipate that this cost barrier may be overcome with increased demand for cystatin C in clinical practice.

### Association of cystatin C with adverse outcomes [^113ocXsk]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To discuss recent studies which have evaluated determinants of cystatin C and to focus on the relationship of cystatin C with mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and noncardiovascular outcomes.

Recent Findings

In the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Study cystatin C was associated with demographic characteristics independent of measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR), although this was to a smaller extent than creatinine. In patients with established chronic kidney disease (CKD), cystatin C was strongly and inversely correlated with measured GFR, suggesting that although cystatin C may have other determinants, it is primarily a measure of kidney function. Several cohort studies, particularly in older adults, have now demonstrated that cystatin C is linearly associated with mortality, CVD and non-CVD outcomes, whereas creatinine is primarily associated with risk in individuals with more advanced kidney disease. A recent study has also shown that changes in kidney function as ascertained by cystatin C, even within the relatively normal range, are associated with subsequent CVD and all-cause mortality among older adults.

Summary

Cystatin C appears to capture an association of mild kidney disease with increased risk of mortality, CVD and non-CVD outcomes. Future studies should evaluate whether cystatin C can improve medical decision-making and lead to favorable patient outcomes.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^111d6CdQ]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Creatinine versus cystatin C — use of combined equation indicates that for most patients, the combined creatinine-cystatin C formula provides the most accurate estimate of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and in most circumstances eGFR from creatinine is sufficient for screening, diagnosis and monitoring kidney function; when there is a concern about accuracy of creatinine-based equations, the combined creatinine-cystatin C formula should be used. In extremes of creatinine generation, such as spinal cord injury or neuromuscular disease, the cystatin C alone formula may be more appropriate, and weight loss with chronic diseases can lead to a decrease in creatinine generation and falsely high eGFR. In individuals with high muscle mass and elevated creatinine (with normal urine albumin/creatinine), checking cystatin C could also rule out CKD, which is common in young military Veterans or Active-Duty personnel. In class 3 obesity (BMI > 40 kg/m²), the cystatin C formula may lead to falsely low eGFR, so the combined creatinine-cystatin C formula is most accurate, and the combination creatinine-cystatin C equation can be used to confirm the diagnosis of CKD in the elderly when low eGFR has been present for > 3 months and there are no other markers of CKD.

Conclusions

The present study has illustrated large discrepancies for the prevalence of stage 3 CKD according to the biomarker used to estimate the GFR. Moving from strictly creatinine-based equations (MDRD or CKD-EPI) to cystatin C-based or combined equations will decrease prevalence of stage 3 CKD by half, which is highly significant from an epidemiological point of view. Additional studies are thus necessary before asserting we know the true prevalence of CKD in the general population.

Chronic kidney disease in diabetes — assessment with urine albumin and estimated GFR: Screening for albuminuria can be most easily performed by urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) in a random spot urine collection, with albuminuria categories defined as " < 30 mg/g creatinine", " ≥ 30–300 mg/g creatinine", and " ≥ 300 mg/g creatinine". Because of high biological variability of " > 20%", two of three UACR specimens collected within a "3-to 6-month" period should be abnormal before considering moderately or severely elevated albuminuria, and transient factors such as "Exercise within 24 h, infection, fever, heart failure, marked hyperglycemia, menstruation, and marked hypertension may elevate UACR independently of kidney damage". For kidney function, "eGFR persistence < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and/or an urinary albumin value of > 30 mg/g of creatinine is considered abnormal", the CKD-EPI creatinine equation "was refit without the race variable and should be used for everyone", and "increased use of cystatin C… is suggested in combination with serum creatinine" because combining markers "is more accurate and would support better clinical decisions than either marker alone".

### Traditions and innovations in assessment of glomerular filtration rate using creatinine to cystatin C [^111SjC68]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the best index for kidney function and estimated GFR (eGFR) calculated from endogenous filtration markers like serum creatinine and cystatin C is widely used in clinical practice for chronic kidney disease diagnosis and prognostication. We sought to review the evolution of GFR estimating equations, nuances of eGFR interpretation, and utility of eGFR in drug dosing.

Recent Findings

The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) serum creatinine eGFR equation was recently updated to exclude the race variable and the CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C equation demonstrated the highest reliability. Although calculated creatinine clearance by Cockcroft Gault has been traditionally used for drug dosing, the use of eGFR is slowly being adapted by the Food and Drug Administration for pharmacokinetic studies. However, the individual-level accuracy of eGFR using the CKD-EPI 2021 equations remained low, with the distribution of measured GFR at a given eGFR value spanning several CKD stages.

Summary

Although current methods of estimating GFR have improved in population measures of reliability, all have significant individual-level inaccuracies that can be an issue when clinical decision-making is contingent on the actual level of GFR. Modern methods of GFR measurements should be made widely available to enhance individualized patient decision-making.

### New creatinine-and cystatin C-based equations to estimate GFR without race [^1179GEKx]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "CKD-EPI Creatinine Equation for eGFR (2021)" for diabetic nephropathy, chronic kidney disease, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, anemia of chronic kidney disease, anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, hepatorenal syndrome, immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis, infection-related glomerulonephritis, kidney transplantation and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.

The 2021 CKD-EPI creatinine equation estimates Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) using serum creatinine, age, and sex. This updated version removed race as a variable to provide more equitable care across populations. It's currently recommended by KDIGO guidelines for routine clinical practice.

The 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation is a useful tool for estimating the kidney's filtering ability, known as the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). This measure is central to understanding kidney health and staging chronic kidney disease (CKD). Three inputs are needed: the person's age, gender, and serum creatinine level.

Here's how it works:

Inputs include the person's age, gender, and serum creatinine level. Age is provided as a whole number between 18 and 90 years. Gender options are "Male" or "Female". Serum creatinine levels can be entered in mg/dL (ranging from 0.1 to 20) or in µmol/L (ranging from 8.84 to 1768.4), with an internal conversion done to ensure units are in mg/dL for consistency.

The computation begins with a gender-dependent factor (A), which is 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males. Next, depending on whether the creatinine level is below or above this threshold, a second factor (B) is determined: for creatinine levels below or equal to the threshold, B is -0.241 for females and -0.302 for males; for levels above, B is -1.2 regardless of gender.

Using these factors, the eGFR is calculated with the formula:
eGFR = 142 × ([creatinine/A])ᴮ × (0.9938)ᵃᵍᵉ

Additionally, for females, the eGFR is multiplied by 1.012 for final adjustment.

Once the eGFR is determined, it is rounded to a whole number and used to classify the CKD stage, reflecting the degree of kidney function:

- Stage 1 (Normal or High) is an eGFR of 90 or above
- Stage 2 (Mildly Decreased) spans 60 to under 90
- Stage 3a (Moderately Decreased) encompasses 45 to under 60
- Stage 3b (Moderately Decreased) covers 30 to under 45
- Stage 4 (Severely Decreased) ranges from 15 to under 30
- Stage 5 (Kidney Failure) is under 15

These stages provide critical insights into kidney health, potentially guiding clinical decisions and management.

### Assessment of cystatin C level for risk stratification in adults with chronic kidney disease [^112p9o2o]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

We initially sought to validate the guideline-recommended approachto perform confirmatory testing for CKD using eGFRcys when eGFRcr is 45 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m 2. For both older and younger adults, 1 case of CKD would be confirmed (and 1 case refuted) for every 2 eGFRcys tests performed. However, this approach would not capture individuals who have eGFRcys less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 but eGFRcr greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. For a fixed number of tests, eGFRcys detected 4 times more individuals with eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² compared with eGFRcr (and more than twice as many individuals compared with eGFRcr 2009). Increased CKD diagnosis by eGFRcys would enable enhanced eligibility for 3 important risk stratification and reduction strategies. First, assessment of CVD risk: current CVD risk estimation tools do not routinely account for eGFR, and the CKD patch (a multiplication factor for CVD risk to account for kidney function) is based on eGFRcr. Our findings suggest that, in a general population cohort with relatively preserved kidney function, eGFRcr does not enhance risk estimation, while eGFRcys improves stratification with greater sensitivity and specificity than established, treatable cardiovascular risk factors (eg, lipid levels and blood pressure). Enhanced detection of high-risk individuals with eGFRcys, who may not otherwise qualify for CVD prevention therapies based on established CVD risk estimation tools, would enable earlier introduction of cost-effective CVD risk-reduction treatments, such as statins, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (shown to reduce cardiovascular, kidney, and mortality risk in both diabetic and nondiabetic (albuminuric) CKD. Second, albuminuria testing, essential for estimation of kidney failure risk, is independently associated with CVD and all-cause mortality and is integral for treatment selection. Third, the kidney failure risk equation, developed and validated across multiple international cohorts, was used to estimate risk of kidney failure. The kidney failure risk equation is becoming an important gateway to nephrology care, requires albuminuria for calculation, and is only validated for use when eGFR is less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. There is no predictive advantage of using eGFRcr vs eGFRcys in the kidney failure risk equation to predict progression to kidney failure.

### Cystatin C versus creatinine in determining risk based on kidney function [^1119AfVX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Adding the measurement of cystatin C to that of serum creatinine to determine the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) improves accuracy, but the effect on detection, staging, and risk classification of chronic kidney disease across diverse populations has not been determined.

Methods

We performed a meta-analysis of 11 general-population studies (with 90,750 participants) and 5 studies of cohorts with chronic kidney disease (2960 participants) for whom standardized measurements of serum creatinine and cystatin C were available. We compared the association of the eGFR, as calculated by the measurement of creatinine or cystatin C alone or in combination with creatinine, with the rates of death (13,202 deaths in 15 cohorts), death from cardiovascular causes (3471 in 12 cohorts), and end-stage renal disease (1654 cases in 7 cohorts) and assessed improvement in reclassification with the use of cystatin C.

Results

In the general-population cohorts, the prevalence of an eGFR of less than 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m(2) of body-surface area was higher with the cystatin C-based eGFR than with the creatinine-based eGFR (13.7% vs. 9.7%). Across all eGFR categories, the reclassification of the eGFR to a higher value with the measurement of cystatin C, as compared with creatinine, was associated with a reduced risk of all three study outcomes, and reclassification to a lower eGFR was associated with an increased risk. The net reclassification improvement with the measurement of cystatin C, as compared with creatinine, was 0.23 (95% confidence interval, 0.18 to 0.28) for death and 0.10 (95% CI, 0.00 to 0.21) for end-stage renal disease. Results were generally similar for the five cohorts with chronic kidney disease and when both creatinine and cystatin C were used to calculate the eGFR.

Conclusions

The use of cystatin C alone or in combination with creatinine strengthens the association between the eGFR and the risks of death and end-stage renal disease across diverse populations. (Funded by the National Kidney Foundation and others.).

### Measurement and estimation of GFR for use in clinical practice: core curriculum 2021 [^111NHckj]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is fundamental to clinical practice, public health, and research. The kidney has several critical functions; GFR is used as an overall assessment of these kidney functions. GFR is used to diagnose, stage, and manage chronic kidney disease (CKD); ascertain the prognosis for chronic kidney disease-related events and mortality; and determine drug dosages. GFR is the rate at which the glomerulus filters plasma to produce an ultrafiltrate and can be assessed from clearance or serum levels of filtration markers. Clearance measurements using exogenous filtration markers are difficult to perform in routine clinical practice, so GFR is more commonly estimated through equations based on serum concentrations of endogenous filtration markers, most commonly creatinine. These GFR estimates are reasonably accurate, but optimal care for patients may require a confirmatory test for a more accurate GFR assessment. Confirmatory tests currently available include cystatin C-based equations, urinary or plasma clearance of exogenous filtration markers, or urinary clearance of creatinine. Appreciation of the concept of GFR and methods for optimal assessment in routine practice or special circumstances, and their strengths and limitations, are critical in making judicious use of the available tools.

### Glomerular filtration rate estimated by cystatin C among different clinical presentations [^114fGgNG]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimates from serum creatinine has not been generalizable across all populations. Cystatin C has been proposed as an alternative marker for estimating GFR. The objective of this study was to compare cystatin C with serum creatinine for estimating GFR among different clinical presentations. Cystatin C and serum creatinine levels were obtained from adult patients (n = 460) during an evaluation that included a GFR measurement by iothalamate clearance. Medical records were abstracted for clinical presentation (healthy, native chronic kidney disease or transplant recipient) at the time of GFR measurement. GFR was modeled using the following variables: cystatin C (or serum creatinine), age, gender and clinical presentation. The relationship between cystatin C and GFR differed across clinical presentations. At the same cystatin C level, GFR was 19% higher in transplant recipients than in patients with native kidney disease (P < 0.001). The association between cystatin C and GFR was stronger among native kidney disease patients than in healthy persons (P < 0.001 for statistical interaction). Thus, a cystatin C equation was derived using only patients with native kidney disease (n = 204). The correlation with GFR (r² = 0.853) was slightly higher than a serum creatinine equation using the same sample (r² = 0.827), the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation (r² = 0.825) or the Cockcroft-Gault equation (r² = 0.796). Averaged estimates between cystatin C and serum creatinine equations further improved correlation (r(2) = 0.891). Cystatin C should not be interpreted as purely a marker of GFR. Other factors, possibly inflammation or immunosuppression therapy, affect cystatin C levels. While recognizing this limitation, cystatin C may improve GFR estimates in chronic kidney disease patients.

### The eGFR-C study: accuracy of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation using creatinine and cystatin C and albuminuria for monitoring disease progression in patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease – prospective longitudinal study in a multiethnic population [^116MJW67]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Modelling monitoring strategies

Whilst our longitudinal cohort will not have adequate power to detect differences in progression, our estimates of the accuracy of eGFR (study 1), patterns and determinants of progression (study 2), and intra-individual biological variation (study 3) can be combined in a model to evaluate the impact of alternative monitoring strategies on detection of progression to stage 4 CKD. True GFR values will be modelled over time for representative cohorts of people, and performance of alternative monitoring strategies in detecting progression to stage 4 CKD (varying in timing and choice of eGFR equation) will be simulated utilising estimates of measurement error and accuracy. Outcome variables which will be assessed will include false positive progression rates, and the sensitivity and delays in detecting progression.

### KDIGO guidelines and kidney transplantation: is the cystatin-C based recommendation relevant? [^113MUtty]. American Journal of Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

The KDIGO guidelines propose a new approach to diagnose chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In patients with a GFR value comprised between 45 and 59mL/min/1.73m(2) as estimated by the CKD-EPI creatinine equation (eGFRcreat), it is suggested to confirm the diagnosis with a second estimation using the CKD-EPI cystatin C-based equations (eGFRcys /eGFRcreat-cys). We sought to determine whether this new diagnostic strategy might extend to kidney transplant recipients (KTR) and help to identify those with decreased GFR. In 670 KTR for whom a measured GFR was available, we simulated the detection of CKD using the two-steps approach recommended by the guidelines in comparison to the conventional approach relying on creatinine equation. One hundred forty-five patients with no albuminuria had eGFRcreat between 45 and 59mL/min/1.73m(2). Among them, 23% had inulin clearance over 60mL/min/1.73m(2) and were thus incorrectly classified as CKD patients. When applying the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) strategy, 138 patients were confirmed as having a GFR below 60mL/min with eGFRcreat-cys. However, 21% of them were misclassified in reference to measured GFR. Our data do no not support the use of cystatin C as a confirmatory test of stage 3A CKD in KTR.

### Association of intraindividual difference in estimated glomerular filtration rate by creatinine vs cystatin C and end-stage kidney disease and mortality [^1167VrRF]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the association between eGFRdiff cys-cr and ESKD. Prior studies have shown that eGFRcys can improve ESKD prognostication; however, these analyses compared associations of eGFRcys and eGFRcr with outcomes at the population level. Given the recent NKF and ASN recommendations, cystatin C is likely to become more widely used in clinical practice, and it will become increasingly apparent that many individual patients have 2 widely disparate eGFR values. Recently, members of our research team investigated the difference between eGFRcys and eGFRcr as a prognostic indicator. In analyses from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial and Cardiovascular Health Study cohorts, higher baseline eGFRdiff cys-cr was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality as well as frailty, falls, hospitalizations, and CVD events. However, prior studies have not evaluated kidney-specific end points among persons with CKD, a population for whom accurate GFR estimation and risk stratification are essential. Hence, our findings that eGFRdiff cys-cr was associated with risk for ESKD and mortality could inform how these 2 markers might be best used in clinical practice.

### Importance of cystatin C in estimating glomerular filtration rate: the PARADIGM-HF trial [^112XQPhi]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

The 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation combining creatinine and cystatin C provides a better estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) compared to the creatinine-only equation.

Methods and Results

CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C equation (creatinine-cystatin) was compared to creatinine-only (creatinine) equation in a subpopulation of Prospective comparison of ARNI with ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and morbidity in Heart Failure (PARADIGM-HF). Patients were categorized according to difference in eGFR using the two equations: Group 1 (< -10 mL/min/1.73 m2, i.e. creatinine-cystatin more than 10 mL/min lower than creatinine), Group 2 (> -10 and < 10 mL/min/1.73 m2), and Group 3 (> 10 mL/min/1.73 m2, i.e. creatinine-cystatin more than 10 mL/min higher than creatinine). Cystatin C and creatinine were available in 1966 patients at randomization. Median (interquartile range) eGFR difference was -0.7 (-6.4–4.8) mL/min/1.73 m2. Compared to creatinine, creatinine-cystatin led to a substantial reclassification of chronic kidney disease stages. Overall, 212 (11%) and 355 (18%) patients were reallocated to a better and worse eGFR category, respectively. Compared to patients in Group 2, those in Group 1 (lower eGFR with creatinine-cystatin) had higher mortality and those in Group 3 (higher eGFR with creatinine-cystatin) had lower mortality. Increasing difference in eGFR (due to lower eGFR with creatinine-cystatin compared to creatinine) was associated with increasing elevation of biomarkers (including N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin) and worsening Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire clinical summary score. The reason why the equations diverged with increasing severity of heart failure was that creatinine did not rise as steeply as cystatin C.

Conclusion

The CKD-EPI creatinine-only equation may overestimate GFR in sicker patients.

### Prognostic impact of 1-year changes in creatinine-and cystatin C-based estimated glomerular filtration rate after stroke on 5-year outcomes: insights from the third China national stroke registry [^115TvHuS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Clinical Characteristics

Among the 15 166 participants in the CNSR‐III, 11261 had blood samples sent to the central laboratory. After excluding 837 participants without baseline creatinine or cystatin C levels, 5843 without 1‐year creatinine or cystatin C levels, and 311 with missing 5‐year follow‐up data, 4270 participants were included in the final analysis (Figure 1).

The baseline clinical characteristics of the patients are presented in Table 1. The mean age of the study participants was 61.3 ± 10.9 years, with 2906 (68.1%) men. There were 360 (8.4%) patients with baseline eGFR Cr+CysC < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m² and 170 (4.0%) with eGF Cr+CysCr ≥ 120 mL/min per 1.73 m². The mean eGFR Cr+CysC at 1 year decreased by 5.6% (5.0 mL/min per 1.73 m²) from the value at admission, with a mean eGFR Cr+CysC at 88.6 ± 22.6 mL/min per 1.73 m² at baseline and 83.6 ± 20.7 mL/min per 1.73 m² at 1 year.

Table 1
Baseline Characteristics of Study Participants From the CNSR‐III Trial Overall and Categorized by 1‐Year Change in eGFR Cr+CysC

Participants experiencing the greatest change in eGFR Cr+CysC (Q1 and Q5 groups) were older and had a higher prevalence of stroke, a history of atrial fibrillation, and higher triglyceride levels. Those with a significant decrease in eGFR Cr+CysC had a higher prevalence of diabetes, were more likely to have had contrast exposure in a hospital, and had higher baseline eGFR Cr+CysC, ACR, and systolic blood pressure. Participants with a significant increase in eGFR had a higher prevalence of TIA, higher low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and a lower baseline eGFR Cr+CysC. Notably, the Q1 group had the highest baseline eGFR Cr+CysC (96.0 ± 32.0 mL/min per 1.73 m 2) but showed the most significant decrease (median −29.5%) and the worst kidney function at 1 year (67.7 ± 19.3 mL/min per 1.73 m 2) (Table 1).

### Association of differences in cystatin C-and creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate with prevalence and incidence of stroke [^117PbqJR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Stroke is the second leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and the global burden of stroke is increasing. Annually, 16.9 million people suffer from stroke, and approximately 70% of strokes occur in middle‐aged and older people. Primary stroke prevention is not sufficiently effective worldwide, and there was a substantial increase in incident stroke, death from stroke, prevalent stroke, and disability‐adjusted life‐years from 1990 to 2019. In China, there is an urgent need to improve stroke prevention strategies in the general population. Although traditional risk factors have been well validated, there is still some residual risk of stroke, with variations between regions and countries. The evidence suggests that substantial prevention of stroke is feasible in practice through early risk stratification and precise targeting of modifiable factors.

Impaired kidney function, as quantified by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, has been proposed as a risk factor for stroke. Baseline impaired kidney function was independently related to incident stroke across a variety of participants and study designs. The causal effect of decreased eGFR on stroke risk is consistently indicated using summarized genetic data. With an estimated prevalence of impaired kidney function of 2.2% in the general population and a greater prevalence in older individuals, the proportion of individuals at risk of stroke attributed to impaired kidney function is substantial. Among these reports, eGFR was primarily based on serum creatinine measurements. Given that creatinine is more easily affected by nonkidney determinants, such as age, muscle mass, physical activity, and diet, cystatin C has become an alternative and precise filtration marker for estimating the glomerular filtration rate for clinical decision‐making. The measurement of cystatin C improves the risk stratification for stroke in the general population. There may be a considerable discrepancy between cystatin C‐based eGFR (eGFRcys) and creatinine‐based eGFR (eGFRcr) measured in the same individual when cystatin C and creatinine are disproportionately affected by nonkidney factors in real‐world settings. The difference between the eGFRcys and eGFRcr (ie, eGFRdiff) has been suggested to capture additional biological and clinical value. According to recent cohort studies, a large negative eGFRdiff is significantly associated with increased risks of adverse clinical outcomes, including mortality, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, kidney disease, frailty, and cognition. However, it remains unclear whether the eGFRdiff is related to the risk of stroke in the general population. Given that the eGFRdiff could indicate the risk of several adverse and aging‐related outcomes, we hypothesized that the eGFRdiff could further track the risk of stroke beyond the eGFRcr level.

### Discordances between creatinine-and cystatin C-based estimated GFR and adverse clinical outcomes in routine clinical practice [^116NCGS1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Cystatin C is recommended for measuring estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) when estimates based on creatinine (eGFR cr) are not thought to be accurate enough for clinical decision making. While global adoption is slow, routine cystatin C testing in Sweden has been available for over a decade, providing real-world evidence about the magnitude of differences between eGFR cys and eGFR cr and their association with clinical outcomes.

Study Design

Observational study.

Setting & Participants

158,601 adults (48% women; mean age 62 years, eGFR cr 80, and eGFR cys 73mL/min/1.73/m 2) undergoing testing for creatinine and cystatin C on the same day in connection with a health care encounter during 2010–2018 in Stockholm, Sweden.

Exposure

Percentage difference of eGFR cys minus eGFR cr (eGFR diff).

Outcome

Kidney failure with replacement therapy (KFRT), acute kidney injury (AKI), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure, and death.

Analytical Approach

Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.

Results

Discordances between eGFR cr and eGFR cys were common, with eGFR cys being lower than eGFR cr (negative eGFR diff) in most cases (65%). Patients with larger negative eGFR diff were older, more often female, with higher eGFR cr and albuminuria, and more comorbid conditions. Compared with patients with similar eGFR cys and eGFR cr, the lowest quartile (eGFR cys > 27% lower than eGFR cr) had the higher HR of all study outcomes: AKI, 2.6 (95% CI, 2.4–2.9); KFRT, 1.4 (95% CI, 1.2–1.6); ASCVD, 1.4 (95% CI, 1.3–1.5); heart failure, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.9–2.2); and all-cause death, 2.6 (95% CI, 2.5–2.7). Conversely, patients in the highest quartile (positive eGFR diff) were at lower risk.

Limitations

Observational study, lack of information on indications for cystatin C testing.

Conclusions

Cystatin C testing in routine care shows that many patients have a lower eGFR cys than eGFR cr, and these patients have a higher risk of multiple adverse outcomes.

Plain-Language Summary

Clinicians require guidance when there are discrepancies between the estimated glomerular filtration rate based on creatinine (eGFR cr) and based on cystatin C (eGFR cys) in the same individual. Routine cystatin C testing in Sweden for over a decade permits exploration of how common and large these discrepancies are, and their associations with adverse clinical outcomes. In this observational study, we found that discordances between eGFR cys and eGFR cr are common, and 1 in 4 patients tested had an eGFR cys > 28% lower than their eGFR cr. We also show that an eGFR cys that is lower than the eGFR cr consistently identifies patients at higher risk of adverse outcomes, including cardiovascular events, kidney replacement therapy, acute kidney injury, and death.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that cystatin C was significantly associated with the presence and severity of asymptomatic CAD in MetS patients with normal kidney function. Probably cystatin C is more than a marker of glomerular filtration rate. Further research is warranted to clarify the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for this association.

### Cystatin C, albuminuria, and mortality among older adults with diabetes [^113Vzqy4]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Kidney disease is a major complication of diabetes that markedly increases risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. Albuminuria, which is believed to reflect hemodynamic disturbances within the glomerulus, has long been identified as a major prognostic indicator in individuals with diabetes. Impaired glomerular filtration rate (GFR), a complementary sign of kidney damage, is also associated with increased risk. As a result, screening for kidney disease using urinary albumin and serological markers of kidney function has become a cornerstone of diabetes care, facilitating targeted interventions to prevent CVD and kidney disease progression.

Albuminuria and impaired GFR may provide additive prognostic information regarding health outcomes in diabetes. However, the joint association of albuminuria and impaired GFR with mortality has not been defined in this setting, because few studies have evaluated albuminuria and GFR simultaneously, studies that have reached different conclusions, and GFR has only been estimated using serum creatinine. GFR estimated from serum cystatin C may reflect kidney function more precisely than GFR estimated using traditional serum creatinine-based methods and is more strongly linked with adverse health outcomes in community-based, mostly nondiabetic populations.

We examined associations of cystatin C–estimated GFR, creatinine-estimated GFR, change in estimated GFR over time, and albuminuria with mortality among older adults with diabetes. The relationship of kidney disease with mortality may be particularly important among older adults. In the general population, traditional cardiovascular risk factors predict CVD weakly in older compared with younger adults, and the prognostic value of kidney disease is increased. Our aim was to assess whether cystatin C–estimated GFR would provide additive prognostic information to urine albumin excretion and to compare the strength of the association with mortality with that of creatinine-estimated GFR.

### CKD-EPI and EKFC GFR estimating equations: performance and other considerations for selecting equations for implementation in adults [^114EnmV1]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Significance Statement

New eGFR equations from Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) and European Kidney Function Consortium (EKFC) using creatinine (eGFRcr), cystatin C (eGFRcys), and both (eGFRcr-cys) have sufficient accuracy for use in clinical practice, leading to uncertainty in selecting equations for implementation. The authors evaluated performance of equations in an independent population of 4050 adults and evaluated other considerations important for implementation. They found that CKD-EPI and EKFC equations are approaching convergence, with better performance of eGFRcr-cys equations in the overall group and fewer differences among race, sex, and age subgroups than eGFRcr equations. Larger differences among eGFRcr equations reflect regional population differences in creatinine, forcing a trade-off between accuracy and uniformity in global implementation of eGFRcr equations. More widespread use of cystatin C could avoid this trade-off.

Background

New CKD-EPI and EKFC eGFR equations using eGFRcr, eGFRcys, and both (eGFRcr-cys) have sufficient accuracy for use in clinical practice. A better understanding of the equations, including their performance in race, sex and age subgroups, is important for selection of eGFR equations for global implementation.

Methods

We evaluated performance (bias and P 30) of equations and methods used for equation development in an independent study population comprising 4050 adults pooled from 12 studies. The mean (SD) measured GFR was 76.4 (29.6) ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and age 57.0 (17.4) years, with 1557 (38%) women and 579 (14%) Black participants.

Results

Coefficients for creatinine, cystatin C, age, and sex in the CKD-EPI and EKFC equations are similar. Performance of the eGFRcr-cys equations in the overall population (bias < ± 5 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and P 30 > 90%) was better than the eGFRcr or eGFRcys equations, with fewer differences among race, sex, and age subgroups. Differences in performance across subgroups reflected differences in diversity of source populations and use of variables for race and sex for equation development. Larger differences among eGFRcr equations reflected regional population differences in non-GFR determinants of creatinine.

Conclusion

CKD-EPI and EKFC equations are approaching convergence. It is not possible to maximize both accuracy and uniformity in selecting one of the currently available eGFRcr equations for implementation across regions. Decisions should consider methods for equation development in addition to performance. Wider use of cystatin C with creatinine could maximize both accuracy and uniformity of GFR estimation using currently available equations.

GFR estimation with creatinine and/or cystatin C

While the creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFRcr) is still suggested as the first approach in adults at risk of CKD, the new guidelines promote the use of the combination of serum creatinine and cystatin C–based eGFR (eGFRcr-cys) when more precision is required. eGFRcr-cys has been proven to be superior for distinguishing eGFR risk stages by the CKD-Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC), and more accurate against measured GFR in clinical situations of discordance between both filtration markers. eGFRcr-cys should at minimum be considered in situations where eGFR from serum creatinine alone may be subject to error (e.g. muscle wasting/loss, special diets, severe illness) and/or when greater accuracy is needed for clinical decision-making (e.g. drugs with a narrow therapeutic index or high toxicity). However, challenges in implementation include access to cystatin C testing, costs and same-day turnaround time. Situations in which cystatin C is less reliable (e.g. high cell turnover in haematology) are still not yet fully documented.

Choice of equation to estimate GFR

The KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline emphasises that race, which is not a biological variable but a social construct, should not be included as a covariate in an eGFR equation. However, promoting the use of one formula over another at the international level remains delicate and complex. Instead of being prescriptive, the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline advocates for the use of the best-fitting validated equation within geographical regions (continents, countries or regions). To that end, they provide a list of validated equations that have undergone rigorous development and validation, and that show adequate accuracy compared with measured GFR (mGFR), with at least 90% of the eGFR values within ± 30% (P 30) of the mGFR. This leads to a range of choices, with the possibility to use for example equations developed by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) collaboration or equations developed by the European Kidney Function Consortium (EKFC), or their average — not to mention the additional modifications developed for specific regions.

### Assessment of cystatin C level for risk stratification in adults with chronic kidney disease [^112QNxi9]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discordance Between eGFRcr and eGFRcys

On assessment of cross-sectional baseline eGFR values, higher values of eGFRcr (> 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2) were generally associated with lower values of eGFRcys, especially in older age brackets (Figure 1; eFigure 1 in the Supplement). At lower values of eGFRcr (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2), eGFRcys values were generally higher in the younger age brackets.

Figure 1.

a Significant difference noted with use of Wilcoxon signed rank test (P < .001) in median within each age bracket compared with eGFRcr.

b Significant difference noted with use of Wilcoxon signed rank test (P < .001) in median within each age bracket compared with eGFRcr-cys.

This difference was more pronounced for eGFRcys than eGFRcr-cys: the median difference between eGFRcys and eGFRcr widened from 4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in the youngest group (age < 45 years) to 14 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in the oldest age category (70–73 years) (eTable 2 in the Supplement). The discrepancy was smaller between eGFRcys and 2009 eGFRcr (eTable 3, eFigure 2, and eFigure 3 in the Supplement).

Overall, the proportion of participants with discordant classifications of eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 was 9.2% of older participants and 2.4% in younger participants (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Among 2016 older participants with eGFRcr less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, 737 individuals (36.6%) had discordant eGFRcys values. The eGFRcr alone did not detect CKD in 6278 (8.2%) of older participants with eGFRcys less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. In sensitivity analyses, use of 2009 eGFRcr yielded similar proportions of discordance with eGFRcys as the main analyses (eTable 5 in the Supplement). The proportions with discordance between eGFRcr and eGFRcr-cys were much smaller in both older (2.4%) and younger (0.6%) participants (eTable 6 in the Supplement).

### A unifying approach for GFR estimation: recommendations of the NKF-ASN task force on reassessing the inclusion of race in diagnosing kidney disease [^1176rR4z]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In response to a national call for re-evaluation of the use of race in clinical algorithms, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) and the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) established a Task Force to reassess inclusion of race in the estimation of GFR in the United States and its implications for diagnosis and management of patients with, or at risk for, kidney diseases.

Process Deliberations

The Task Force organized its activities over 10 months in phases to (1) clarify the problem and evidence regarding eGFR equations in the United States (described previously in an interim report), and, in this final report, (2) evaluate approaches to address use of race in GFR estimation, and (3) provide recommendations. We identified 26 approaches for the estimation of GFR that did or did not consider race and narrowed our focus, by consensus, to five of those approaches. We holistically evaluated each approach considering six attributes: assay availability and standardization; implementation; population diversity in equation development; performance compared with measured GFR; consequences to clinical care, population tracking, and research; and patient centeredness. To arrive at a unifying approach to estimate GFR, we integrated information and evidence from many sources in assessing strengths and weaknesses in attributes for each approach, recognizing the number of Black and non-Black adults affected.

Recommendations

(1) For US adults (> 85% of whom have normal kidney function), we recommend immediate implementation of the CKD-EPI creatinine equation refit without the race variable in all laboratories in the United States because it does not include race in the calculation and reporting, included diversity in its development, is immediately available to all laboratories in the United States, and has acceptable performance characteristics and potential consequences that do not disproportionately affect any one group of individuals. (2) We recommend national efforts to facilitate increased, routine, and timely use of cystatin C, especially to confirm eGFR in adults who are at risk for or have CKD, because combining filtration markers (creatinine and cystatin C) is more accurate and would support better clinical decisions than either marker alone. If ongoing evidence supports acceptable performance, the CKD-EPI eGFR-cystatin C (eGFRcys) and eGFR creatinine-cystatin C (eGFRcr-cys_R) refit without the race variables should be adopted to provide another first-line test, in addition to confirmatory testing. (3) Research on GFR estimation with new endogenous filtration markers and on interventions to eliminate race and ethnic disparities should be encouraged and funded. An investment in science is needed for newer approaches that generate accurate, unbiased, and precise GFR measurement and estimation without the inclusion of race, and that promote health equity and do not generate disparate care.

Implementation

This unified approach, without specification of race, should be adopted across the United States. High-priority and multistakeholder efforts should implement this solution.

Next, we conducted subgroup analyses using the rapid progression group to evaluate the additional efficacy of combined use of these two markers. In the cystatin C-based rapid progression group (n = 463), the creatinine-based rapid progression group showed a higher incidence of ESRD than the creatinine-based slow progression group (20% vs. 5% at 3 years p < 0.0001, Fig. 3 a). After adjustment for baseline eGFR, both eGFRcr slopes and creatinine-based rapid progression were associated with a higher risk of ESRD (eGFRcr slope: HR = 0.91 [95% CI: 0.85–0.97], p = 0.003; creatinine-based rapid progression: HR = 4.25 [95% CI: 2.10–8.59], p < 0.001; Fig. 4 a). Within the creatinine-based rapid progression group (n = 503), the cystatin C-based rapid progression group showed a higher incidence of ESRD than did the cystatin C-based slow progression group (p < 0.0001, Fig. 3 b). However, when adjusting for baseline eGFR, the association between eGFRcys slope and the risk of ESRD did not achieve statistical significance (HR = 0.96 [95% CI: 0.88–1.04], p = 0.31; Fig. 4 b).

### Cystatin C, albuminuria, and mortality among older adults with diabetes [^111UT9me]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Thus, albuminuria and impaired GFR may reflect different pathways of kidney damage. Albuminuria may reflect widespread vascular damage and endothelial dysfunction, thus identifying susceptibility to disease in nonrenal vascular beds. Impaired GFR may reflect loss of nephrons and parenchymal fibrosis that leads to CVD through accumulation of uremic toxins, impaired volume and blood pressure regulation, and multiple metabolic abnormalities. Whether albuminuria and impaired GFR lead to CVD through distinct mechanisms, thus requiring distinct interventions, has not been established.

The association of cystatin C–estimated GFR with mortality was modestly stronger than that for GFR estimated from serum creatinine. This finding is consistent with prior studies using the full CHS population. These studies demonstrated 1) that cystatin C–estimated GFR was linearly associated with mortality risk, whereas MDRD-estimated GFR demonstrated a U-shaped association with mortality, and 2) that elevated serum cystatin C was associated with mortality when MDRD-estimated GFR was in the "normal" range. It is possible that cystatin C estimates true GFR more precisely in the near-normal range or that cystatin C is less susceptible to confounding by body size among older adults. We evaluated only one formula estimating GFR from cystatin C, which was developed among individuals with impaired kidney function, and other cystatin C–based formulas may perform differently.

In our study, a change in cystatin C–estimated GFR within individuals over time was not associated with mortality more strongly than a single baseline cystatin C measurement. This result may be explained in part by the relatively high correlation of cystatin C concentration within individuals over time and suggests that single cystatin C measurements carry important prognostic information on their own, even without prior context. However, the value of longitudinal measurements may be increased when more measurements per individual are available.

Limitations of this study include the availability of only a single urine ACR measurement and lack of data assessing current glycemic control. Notably, however, we were able to account for diabetes duration and the use of hypoglycemic medications, which reflect cumulative exposure to hyperglycemia and disease severity and have been associated with mortality in CHS. In addition, our findings may not extrapolate to younger diabetic populations. Study strengths include the diverse, community-based diabetic population, multiple measurements of kidney disease, long-term follow-up for mortality and adjudicated CVD events, and large numbers of events to facilitate study of kidney disease interactions.

### Detection of decreased glomerular filtration rate in intensive care units: serum cystatin C versus serum creatinine [^116vjMWf]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, SCysC performs significantly better than SCr in order to detect critically ill patients with measured GFR below 60 ml/min. More generally, we believe that SCysC is a more valid GFR biomarker than SCr in ICU and as such, might be evaluated as part of the AKI definition/classification in replacement of SCr.

Key messages

– High percentage of patients hospitalized in intensive care units has normal creatinine concentration but decreased glomerular filtration rate.

– Cystatin C is better than creatinine to detect measured glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m².

– All estimating equations lack of precision to estimate GFR.

### New creatinine-and cystatin C-based equations to estimate GFR without race [^114AqNLq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "CKD-EPI Creatinine-Cystatin C Equation for eGFR (2021)" for diabetic nephropathy, chronic kidney disease, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, anemia of chronic kidney disease, anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, hepatorenal syndrome, immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis, infection-related glomerulonephritis, kidney transplantation and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.

The 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine-Cystatin C equation combines both serum creatinine and cystatin C measurements to estimate GFR. This combination provides improved accuracy over single-marker equations, especially in patients where creatinine-based estimates alone may be less reliable.

The 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine-Cystatin C calculator is designed to estimate an individual's kidney function through the calculation of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and to assign a chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage based on key health parameters. By inputting a person's age, gender, serum creatinine, and cystatin C levels, the calculator determines their eGFR and corresponding CKD stage. Here is how it works:

- **Serum Creatinine**: This is initially adjusted to mg/dL if provided in µmol/L, using a straightforward conversion: creatinine (mg/dL) = creatinine (µmol/L) / 88.4.

- **Gender-Specific Parameters**: The calculator uses different parameters for males and females due to physiological differences:

- **For females**:

- A = 0.7
- B depends on whether creatinine is ≤ 0.7 (value -0.219) or > 0.7 (value -0.544)
- C = 0.8
- D depends on whether cystatin C is ≤ 0.8 (value -0.323) or > 0.8 (value -0.778)
- **For males**:

- A = 0.9
- B depends on whether creatinine is ≤ 0.9 (value -0.144) or > 0.9 (value -0.544)
- C = 0.8
- D depends on whether cystatin C is ≤ 0.8 (value -0.323) or > 0.8 (value -0.778)

- **Calculating eGFR**: With these values, the eGFR is calculated using the formula:
eGFR = 135 × ([creatinine/A])ᴮ × ([cystatin C/C])ᴰ × (0.996)ᵃᵍᵉ
If the individual is female, this result is further adjusted by multiplying the calculated eGFR by 0.963 to account for differences in muscle mass and body composition.

- **CKD Stage Interpretation**

- eGFR ≥ 90 indicates Stage 1 (Normal or High renal function)
- eGFR 60–89 indicates Stage 2 (Mildly Decreased function)
- eGFR 45–59 indicates Stage 3a (Moderately Decreased function)
- eGFR 30–44 indicates Stage 3b (Moderately Decreased function)
- eGFR 15–29 indicates Stage 4 (Severely Decreased function)
- eGFR < 15 indicates Stage 5 (Kidney Failure)

By evaluating the inputs of age, gender, creatinine, and cystatin C levels, this calculator yields a rounded eGFR and a concise assessment of kidney health through the assigned CKD stage. This interpretation aids in diagnosing and managing potential kidney health issues, based on recognized medical guidelines.

### Cystatin C, a novel measure of renal function, is an independent predictor of cardiac events in patients with heart failure [^113uArx4]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Cystatin C, a novel endogenous marker of glomerular filtration rate, has been reported as more sensitive to detect renal insufficiency than creatinine. The purpose of the present study was to examine the clinical significance of serum cystatin C level in patients with mild to moderate heart failure.

Methods and Results

Serum levels of cystatin C were measured by an enzyme immunoassay in 140 patients with heart failure and 64 control subjects without heart failure. Patients were prospectively followed during a median follow-up period of 480 days, with the end points of cardiac death and progressive heart failure requiring rehospitalization. Serum levels of cystatin C were higher in patients with heart failure than in control subjects (1.14 ± 0.60 ng/mL versus 0.72 ± 0.14 ng/mL, P < .001). The Cox multivariate proportional hazard analysis revealed that a change of 1 standard deviation (SD) in cystatin C level was the one of independent predictor for cardiac events (hazard ratio, 1.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.29–6.64; P < .01). The cardiac event rate was markedly higher in patients with elevated cystatin C level (≥ 1.0 ng/mL) than in those with normal level (≤ 1.0 ng/mL) (38.7% versus 10.3%, P < 0.001). Furthermore in patients with normal creatinine levels (n = 91), the cardiac event rate was similarly higher in patients with elevated cystatin C than in those with normal levels (29.2% versus 7.5%, P = 0.002).

Conclusion

Elevation of serum cystatin C, a new marker of renal function, provides promising prognostic information for clinical outcome in patients with mild to moderate heart failure.

### Estimating glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine and cystatin C [^1151ULyu]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

Estimates of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that are based on serum creatinine are routinely used; however, they are imprecise, potentially leading to the overdiagnosis of chronic kidney disease. Cystatin C is an alternative filtration marker for estimating GFR.

Methods

Using cross-sectional analyses, we developed estimating equations based on cystatin C alone and in combination with creatinine in diverse populations totaling 5352 participants from 13 studies. These equations were then validated in 1119 participants from 5 different studies in which GFR had been measured. Cystatin and creatinine assays were traceable to primary reference materials.

Results

Mean measured GFRs were 68 and 70 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body-surface area in the development and validation data sets, respectively. In the validation data set, the creatinine-cystatin C equation performed better than equations that used creatinine or cystatin C alone. Bias was similar among the three equations, with a median difference between measured and estimated GFR of 3.9 mL per minute per 1.73 m(2) with the combined equation, as compared with 3.7 and 3.4 mL per minute per 1.73 m(2) with the creatinine equation and the cystatin C equation (P = 0.07 and P = 0.05), respectively. Precision was improved with the combined equation (interquartile range of the difference, 13.4 vs. 15.4 and 16.4 mL per minute per 1.73 m², respectively [P = 0.001 and P < 0.001]), and the results were more accurate (percentage of estimates that were > 30% of measured GFR, 8.5 vs. 12.8 and 14.1, respectively [P < 0.001 for both comparisons]). In participants whose estimated GFR based on creatinine was 45 to 74 mL per minute per 1.73 m², the combined equation improved the classification of measured GFR as either less than 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m² or greater than or equal to 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m² (net reclassification index, 19.4% [P < 0.001]) and correctly reclassified 16.9% of those with an estimated GFR of 45 to 59 mL per minute per 1.73 m² as having a GFR of 60 mL or higher per minute per 1.73 m².

Conclusions

The combined creatinine-cystatin C equation performed better than equations based on either of these markers alone and may be useful as a confirmatory test for chronic kidney disease. (Funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.).

### The eGFR-C study: accuracy of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation using creatinine and cystatin C and albuminuria for monitoring disease progression in patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease – prospective longitudinal study in a multiethnic population [^115t6YSH]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Sample size calculations

1) Prospective longitudinal cohort study

The sample size calculation for the main study focuses on the ability to detect differences in accuracy of measurement between the MDRD creatinine equation and the CKD-EPI cystatin C equation. We will also make secondary comparisons with the other equations. The measure of accuracy we will use is the P 30. Sample size is based on a simulation study to estimate differences in P 30 and estimates of rate of change which are not amenable to algebraic solution. Our simulation modelled the full structure of the study including random variability, and computed statistical power through noting the percentage of simulations yielding statistically significant results (P < 0.05) for analysis of each outcome. Power estimates are based on 1000 simulations.

With 1000 evaluable subjects our simulations showed the study to have 87% power at the 5% significance level to detect a difference of 5% in P 30, between 81% and 86%, which is of a magnitude considered clinically important and likely to occur with the expected scale of differences in imprecision between the equations. We thus aim to recruit 1300 people, which allowing for 15–20% drop-out will deliver over 90% power. The proposed sample size in the ethnicity subgroups will allow P 30 estimates to be reported with 95% confidence intervals of 10 percentage points wide.

Rates of change in estimated and measured GFR will be obtained by linear regression. Padala et al. proposed two cut-points for estimating accuracy of rates of change: greater than 3 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year error and greater than 5% error. The study will have over 90% power and over 80% power at the 5% significance level to detect differences in these two outcomes respectively, for differences of a magnitude corresponding with P 30 measures of 81% and 86%.

2) Sub-study of patterns of disease progression

A sample size of 375 was chosen based on practical considerations to allow investigation of twelve covariates of interest (gender, age, diabetes, duration of diabetes, ethnicity, albuminuria, baseline GFR, blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, smoking status and presence of vascular disease) in addition to variables for time, drug effects and random effects. Another consideration was to include a reasonable number of subjects in each of the ethnic groups and high and low risk subgroups to estimate disease progression.

### Assessment of cystatin C level for risk stratification in adults with chronic kidney disease [^113oKzYD]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

After excluding participants with eGFRcr less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (as per study eligibility criteria), CKD status was defined as follows (G indicates that staging was made using only glomerular filtration criteria and not albuminuria): (1) no CKD (eGFRcr ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and eGFRcys ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2); (2) eGFRcr G3 (eGFRcr < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and eGFRcys ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2; (3) eGFRcys G3 (eGFRcr ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and eGFRcys < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2); and (4) both G3 (eGFRcr < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and eGFRcys < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2).

We conducted parallel analyses, defining CKD status using eGFRcr-cys rather than eGFRcys as the concordance test, because this combined equation has repeatedly been shown to approximate measured GFR more closely than either eGFRcr or eGFRcys alone. In sensitivity analyses, we defined CKD status using the 2009 eGFRcr by the CKD-EPI equation including race coefficients (2009 eGFRcr), because this would have been the recommended measure to diagnose CKD at the point of sampling.

Baseline variables of interest were selected according to atherosclerotic risk factors included in risk prediction tools for CVDand include age; sex; smoking status; systolic and diastolic blood pressure; total, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; self-reported history of diabetes or hypertension; and use of blood pressure– or cholesterol-lowering medications. Baseline medical conditions, medications, and smoking history were self-reported via a nurse-led interview.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^116ZErd8]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

HRS-AKI — other biomarkers for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and tubular injury are described with applicability caveats. For GFR estimation, "Cystatin C… is usually removed by glomerular filtration. Serum cystatin C levels represent a more accurate estimation of GFR and are less influenced by age and diabetes than is serum creatinine; decreased GFR is associated with higher levels of cystatin C". Evidence synthesis notes that "A recent meta-analysis found that the combination of serum cystatin C and creatinine has the least bias in the estimation of GFR in cirrhosis". However, "the meta-analysis included only a few studies in patients with ascites or on the liver transplant waiting list; therefore, the results may not be applicable to most patients at risk for the development of HRS". Tubular injury biomarkers listed include "N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase, α-glutathione S-transferase… KIM-1 (kidney injury molecule 1), and neutrophil gelatinase–associated lipocalin (NGAL)".

### Medication-related AEs and discordancies in cystatin C-based vs serum creatinine-based eGFR in patients with cancer… [^111t4ieW]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between baseline characteristics and having a cystatin C–based eGFR that was more than 30% lower than the serum creatinine–based eGFR or an eGFRcys that was more than 30% higher than the eGFRcr. Cystatin C is a low-molecular-weight protein produced by all nucleated cells that has been increasingly used as an alternative to SCr to estimate GFR. 2, 5, 7 Cystatin C is not readily affected by age, sex, muscle mass, or diet; however, there are non-GFR factors associated with cystatin C. It is elevated in acute inflammation, obesity, and thyroid disease and with corticosteroid use. 8–11 A recent large study in patients with solid tumors found that SCr overestimated GFR, cystatin C underestimated GFR, and an equation that combines both SCr and cystatin C was the most accurate and precise way to estimate GFR. 12, 13.

In a cohort of 1869 patients with cancer with simultaneous SCr and cystatin C measurement as a part of clinical care, discordancies between eGFRcr and eGFRcys were common. We found a considerably higher rate of supratherapeutic drug levels and AEs associated with select renally cleared medications and increased risk of death in patients with an eGFRcys that was more than 30% lower than the eGFRcr compared with patients with a concordant eGFR or those whose eGFRcys was more than 30% higher than the eGFRcr. There have been conflicting reports regarding the use of SCr vs cystatin C to estimate digoxin clearance. 37–41 Herein, we found that patients with an eGFRcys that was more than 30% lower than the eGFRcr were more likely to have supratherapeutic digoxin trough levels, and 2 patients had symptomatic digoxin toxic effects.

Consistent with prior knowledge that incorporation of cystatin C adds precision to the eGFR equation in patients with malnutrition, sarcopenia, and cirrhosis, 12, 44, 45 we found that hypoalbuminemia and anemia had an important role in detecting an eGFRcys that was more than 30% lower than the eGFRcr in patients with cancer.

### Including cystatin C levels may Be better for diagnosing CKD… [^114YmmnT]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

To diagnose chronic kidney disease, clinicians look for a low glomerular filtration rate, typically based on creatinine levels in serum. But estimated GFR isn't as strongly associated with clinical outcomes in older adults as it is in younger people. In a recent study, estimating GFR based on both creatinine and cystatin C levels was linked more strongly with a variety of adverse outcomes in older people, including acute kidney injury as well as all-cause hospitalization and heart failure.
