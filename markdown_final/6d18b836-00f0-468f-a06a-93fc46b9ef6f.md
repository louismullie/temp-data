## Question

What are some differential diagnosis for a patient who presents with a blood pressure of 118/73, respiratory rate of 21, SpO2 of 90%, heart rate of 75, and mild basilar atelecasis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for differential diagnoses for a patient with stable vitals, SpO2 of 90% on room air, and mild basilar atelectasis, prioritizing likely diagnoses and immediate next steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to interpret the hypoxemia in the context of a near-normal respiratory rate and stable hemodynamics. Then, I should verify how the basilar atelectasis fits mechanistically and whether it explains the oxygenation deficit. Next, I will rank a prioritized differential and highlight high-risk mimics that must be excluded early. After that, I should define the immediate workup, including ABG, targeted labs, and imaging. Finally, I will outline initial management, escalation criteria, and a follow-up plan, ensuring each step aligns with guideline targets and bedside logic.

> Let me first confirm the significance of the oxygen saturation of 90% on room air; by contemporary standards, an SpO2 below about 94% is abnormal in acutely ill adults, so 90% constitutes hypoxemia and warrants investigation and supplemental oxygen titration to a 94–98% target unless there is a risk of hypercapnia, in which case an 88–92% target applies [^1126Mjg4] [^116MWJjq]. I should double-check whether this degree of hypoxemia mandates urgent escalation; the BTS oxygen guideline supports early blood gas assessment when SpO2 is unexplained or abnormal and emphasizes documenting FiO2 with oximetry, which fits this scenario [^116MWJjq].

> Now, regarding the mild basilar atelectasis, let me think about mechanism and plausibility as a primary driver of hypoxemia; basilar collapse reduces ventilation in dependent regions, producing ventilation–perfusion mismatch and right-to-left shunt physiology, which can meaningfully depress arterial oxygenation even when respiratory rate and hemodynamics are preserved [^112ScTdo]. Wait, let me verify that the degree of hypoxemia aligns with atelectasis physiology; in CT-PA series, patients with segmental atelectasis frequently have moderate hypoxemia, supporting that basilar atelectasis can plausibly explain an SpO2 near 90% without overt distress when compensation maintains ventilation and perfusion balance elsewhere [^115ygVHU]. I should confirm that we are not overlooking atelectasis as a "benign" finding; atelectasis is common and consequential in perioperative and critical contexts and often requires targeted recruitment and secretion clearance strategies to reverse both collapse and hypoxemia [^111BvJ6G].

> Next, I should review a prioritized differential, starting with the most likely diagnosis: hypoventilation-related atelectasis with secondary V/Q mismatch. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; although the respiratory rate is only borderline high, microatelectasis from shallow breathing, pain, obesity, sedation, or poor cough mechanics can still cause clinically relevant shunt and hypoxemia, especially basally, and may not manifest with dramatic tachypnea early on [^112ScTdo]. I need to ensure I account for postoperative states, immobility, and secretions as contributors, as these are classic precipitants of lobar or basilar collapse with hypoxemia [^111BvJ6G].

> I will now examine pulmonary embolism as a high-priority exclusion, because the combination of mild tachypnea and hypoxemia without cardiorespiratory decompensation can still reflect PE with a preserved cardiac output; risk stratification tools like sPESI and PESI flag hypoxemia and tachypnea as prognostic, and many PE patients have normal blood pressure initially, so a normal BP does not safely exclude PE here [^115ygVHU] [^115ErE2p]. Hold on, I should verify imaging choice; if pretest probability is anything other than low, CT pulmonary angiography is appropriate, and the yield of alternative explanations on CT-PA is substantial, with atelectasis itself being a frequent alternative diagnosis when PE is not present, which underscores why CT-PE is reasonable even when atelectasis is seen on plain radiography [^111vYgB9].

> But wait, what if the hypoxemia is due to a parenchymal process like pneumonia or early viral illness; even subtle consolidations or ground-glass change can depress oxygenation and coexist with atelectasis, so I should keep community-acquired pneumonia, viral pneumonitis, and even early COVID-19 on the list, noting that IDSA COVID severity definitions classify hypoxemia as SpO2 at or below 94% on room air, which this patient meets [^115YEv67]. I need to check for systemic signs, exposure risks, and local epidemiology to guide pretest probabilities and empiric decisions pending targeted diagnostics [^111HgVKP].

> Let me consider cardiogenic contributors next; stable blood pressure and heart rate do not rule out heart failure with preserved ejection fraction or occult diastolic dysfunction contributing to basilar interstitial edema and small airway closure, which can mimic or amplify atelectasis and hypoxemia. I should confirm that NT-proBNP, ECG, and a careful volume and perfusion assessment are included early, since ESC heart failure guidance supports BNP/NT-proBNP and ECG in the initial evaluation of suspected cardiac or respiratory causes of dyspnea and hypoxemia [^114WmzcY].

> I should also review less common but important mimics of hypoxemia that oximetry alone will miss; methemoglobinemia and sulfhemoglobinemia can produce a gap between measured SpO2 and true oxygen content, and CO-oximetry is required when the clinical picture and ABG do not align or when there is suggestive medication exposure history, so I need to ensure a high index of suspicion and order appropriate testing if the ABG reveals a discordant saturation or elevated metHb [^112V1EdR]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "CO poisoning" here, but that would be a mistake; CO poisoning produces falsely normal or elevated pulse oximetry readings due to COHb, so the oximeter would likely read higher than 90% despite true hypoxemia, making CO an unlikely explanation for a low SpO2 in this case, though I should still consider it if there is exposure risk and obtain COHb when the story fits [^1125RzCV].

> Next, I should review the immediate workup to close the loop on these differentials. I need to obtain an arterial blood gas to quantify PaO2, PaCO2, and A–a gradient, because oximetry does not assess ventilation or acid–base status and can be misleading in certain hemoglobinopathies or dyshemoglobinemias; BTS recommends ABG when hypoxemia is unexplained or when oximetry and clinical status diverge, which applies here [^116MWJjq]. I should confirm a CBC, basic metabolic panel, troponin, NT-proBNP, inflammatory markers, and a D-dimer if PE is suspected, and I should obtain a high-quality chest radiograph if not already available, with strong consideration of CT pulmonary angiography if PE probability is not low or if the CXR is non-diagnostic [^111vYgB9]. Hold on, I should verify that bedside lung ultrasound is reasonable; yes, lung ultrasound can rapidly distinguish consolidation, effusion, pneumothorax, and atelectasis and can guide recruitment strategies in real time, which is valuable when CT is deferred or unavailable [^117VmDAZ].

> For initial management, I need to ensure oxygen is titrated to a target saturation of 94–98% if the patient is not at risk of hypercapnia, or 88–92% if COPD or other CO2-retaining conditions are suspected, and I should document the FiO2 and delivery device with serial oximetry to track response and avoid both hypoxemia and hyperoxia [^1126Mjg4] [^116MWJjq]. I should confirm that secretion mobilization, incentive spirometry, and positioning are instituted early to reverse basilar collapse, because targeted lung expansion maneuvers are first-line for atelectasis-related hypoxemia and can obviate the need for more invasive support if effective [^112ScTdo]. If hypoxemia persists despite modest supplemental oxygen and atelectasis-directed therapy, I should escalate to noninvasive ventilation with PEEP to recruit collapsed alveoli, aligning with guidance that supports NIV to improve oxygenation and reduce work of breathing in selected hypoxemic patients, while continuously reassessing for contraindications and tolerance [^115v1ZAs] [^111BvJ6G].

> I should double-check escalation thresholds and safety nets. If SpO2 remains below 90% on escalating oxygen, if respiratory rate rises above about 25–30 with accessory muscle use, or if mental status changes occur, I need to escalate to high-flow nasal cannula or noninvasive ventilation and involve critical care early, because these are markers of impending respiratory failure and may herald the need for invasive support if trends worsen despite optimized noninvasive strategies [^115v1ZAs] [^112oRKxz]. Let me reconsider the role of PE; if clinical suspicion remains intermediate to high and D-dimer is positive or imaging is delayed, I should proceed to CT-PA without undue delay, given the prognostic implications and the frequency of alternative diagnoses revealed by that study [^111vYgB9].

> Finally, I need to ensure a follow-up plan that addresses both immediate and preventive care. If atelectasis is confirmed as the primary driver, I should arrange respiratory therapy–led recruitment protocols, early mobilization, and analgesia optimization to sustain lung expansion, and I should schedule reassessment within 24–48 hours to confirm radiographic improvement and oxygen weaning feasibility [^112ScTdo]. If PE is excluded and hypoxemia resolves with recruitment, I should still screen for cardiopulmonary risk factors and consider ambulatory pulmonary rehabilitation if dyspnea persists, while arranging primary care follow-up to address modifiable contributors such as obesity, smoking, and chronic cardiopulmonary disease.

> In summary, the most likely diagnosis is hypoventilation-related basilar atelectasis causing ventilation–perfusion mismatch and shunt with resultant hypoxemia, but I must actively exclude pulmonary embolism, pneumonia or viral pneumonitis, and early heart failure, and I should keep dyshemoglobinemias in mind if the ABG–oximetry pattern is discordant; immediate ABG, targeted labs, and imaging with CT-PA when indicated, plus oxygen titration and lung recruitment, are the right first steps to both diagnose and treat while preventing deterioration [^112ScTdo] [^116MWJjq] [^1126Mjg4].

The most likely cause of hypoxemia with mild basilar atelectasis is **V/Q mismatch from atelectasis** [^112ScTdo] [^1162M4jH], but the differential includes pulmonary embolism, early pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiogenic edema. Evaluate with **ABG, chest CT, and echocardiography** [^111HgVKP] [^111vYgB9] [^113bw8RS], and start oxygen to maintain SpO2 ≥ 92% [^114W5L41].

## Diagnostic approach

- **Arterial blood gas (ABG)**: Assess PaO2, PaCO2, A-a gradient, and methemoglobin [^111HgVKP].
- **Chest CT**: Evaluate for PE, pneumonia, ILD, or other parenchymal disease [^111vYgB9].
- **Echocardiography**: Assess for cardiac dysfunction or pulmonary hypertension [^111tp8XA].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, renal function, BNP, and coagulation profile [^1139mBpe].

---

## Management

Start **oxygen therapy** to maintain SpO2 ≥ 92% [^114W5L41] [^113nCftv]; initiate **supportive care** with incentive spirometry, airway clearance, and mobilization [^112ScTdo]; and treat the **underlying cause** — anticoagulation for PE, antibiotics for pneumonia, diuretics for cardiogenic edema, or disease-specific therapy for ILD or pulmonary hypertension [^117AmvbA] [^111mrp4X].

---

Hypoxemia with mild basilar atelectasis most often reflects **V/Q mismatch from atelectasis** [^112ScTdo], but PE, pneumonia, ILD, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiogenic edema must be considered. Use ABG, CT, and echocardiography to guide diagnosis, and start oxygen while treating the cause [^116MWJjq].

Clinical manifestations of PCP in HIV-infected children include fever, tachypnea, dyspnea, and cough, with onset that can be abrupt or insidious and nonspecific symptoms such as mild cough, dyspnea, poor feeding, diarrhea, and weight loss; some patients may not be febrile, but almost all will have tachypnea by the time pneumonitis is evident on chest radiograph, and physical examination sometimes shows bilateral basilar rales with evidence of respiratory distress and hypoxia. In HIV-infected children with pneumonia, four clinical variables are independently associated with PCP: aged < 6 months, respiratory rate > 59 breaths per minute, arterial percentage hemoglobin saturation ≤ 92%, and absence of vomiting; a high plasma HIV RNA concentration strongly predicts PCP and other opportunistic infections (OIs).

Differential diagnosis

Congestive heart failure — echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis, enabled to estimate elevated heart filling pressures with further impact on therapy. The ultrasound examination also helped diagnose and quantify a large fluidothorax with an implication for a safe drainage.
Acute myocardial infarction — excluded by repeatedly negative cardiac biochemistry (troponin I and CK-MB mass) taken in a patient with a non-diagnostic 12-lead ECG due to VVI pacing and not changing regional wall motion abnormalities seen on echocardiography.
Pulmonary embolism — the patient showed a dilated RV with preserved contractility throughout this episode, without any signs of acute cor pulmonale or changes in the elimination of CO 2. After the drainage of pleural fluid which was performed on systemic anticoagulation, the mild increase of pulmonary artery pressure could be ascribed to the parallel increase of LAP, that is, presence of postcapillary pulmonary hypertension in heart failure. This deterioration after drainage was reversed swiftly with improvement of the LV function on dobutamine. All of this renders a possible diagnosis of a significant pulmonary embolism very unlikely as a cause of his transient deterioration.
Respiratory insufficiency due to tracheobronchitis or pneumonia — diagnosed with the help of positive inflammatory markers and clinical signs of increased bronchial secretions. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy confirmed the diagnosis of tracheobronchitis and excluded atelectasis.
Pneumothorax — excluded predrainage and postdrainage by the presence of pleural sliding, B lines and a lung pulse. A large pneumothorax was also excluded by the chest X-ray taken after admission to the ICU and again after pleural drainage.

### Acute lobar atelectasis [^112ScTdo]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Lobar atelectasis (or collapse) is an exceedingly common, rather predictable, and potentially pathogenic companion to many forms of acute illness, postoperative care, and chronic debility. Readily diagnosed by using routine chest imaging and bedside ultrasound, the consequences from lobar collapse may be minor or serious, depending on extent, mechanism, patient vulnerability, abruptness of onset, effectiveness of hypoxic vasoconstriction, and compensatory reserves. Measures taken to reduce secretion burden, assure adequate secretion clearance, maintain upright positioning, reverse lung compression, and sustain lung expansion accord with a logical physiologic rationale. Both classification and logical approaches to prophylaxis and treatment of lobar atelectasis derive from a sound mechanistic knowledge of its causation.

### Geriatric trauma management [^116ehq1g]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Geriatric trauma — breathing and ventilator management states that older adults may have a normal respiratory rate up to 25 breaths per minute and to maintain oxygen saturation in the low 90's; the older patient's response to hypoxia and hypercarbia declines by 50% and 40%, respectively. For ventilator management, data suggest that low volumes and lower-pressure ventilation are associated with better outcomes; consider ventilator settings of 6 mL/kg and plateau pressures of 30 cm H2O or less. Hyperventilated trauma patients appear to have increased mortality, and in patients with absolute or relative hypovolemia, high ventilator pressures and positive-pressure ventilation may compromise venous return, worsening hypotension and even causing cardiovascular collapse.

A 10-year-old male with a past medical history of premature pubarche, mild persistent asthma, and eczema presented to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea and chest pain. On examination, he was found to be tachycardic and tachypneic. Chest radiograph demonstrated cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions, and scattered atelectasis. Echocardiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion with right atrial collapse. The patient was admitted to the pediatric ICU for pericardiocentesis and drain placement. As he later became hypertensive and febrile, we will discuss how our patient's hospital course guided our differential diagnosis and how we arrived at a definitive diagnosis using a multidisciplinary approach.

Good practice points for clinical assessment of patients with suspected hypoxaemia
✓ The medical history should be taken when possible in an acutely breathless patient and may point to the diagnosis of a particular acute illness such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism or an exacerbation of a chronic condition such as COPD, asthma or heart failure.
✓ Never discontinue oxygen therapy to obtain an oximetry measurement on room air in patients who clearly require oxygen therapy.
✓ Physical examination should be undertaken urgently. This may provide evidence of a specific diagnosis such as heart failure or a large pleural effusion, but it is common for the cause of breathlessness to remain undiagnosed until the results of tests such as chest radiographs are available.
✓ Record arterial oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO 2) and consider blood gas assessment in patients with unexplained confusion and agitation as this may be presenting feature of hypoaxaemia and/or hypercapnia (cyanosis is a difficult physical sign to record confidently, especially in poor light or with an anaemic or plethoric patient).
✓ Carefully measure respiratory rate and heart rate because tachypnoea and tachycardia are more common than a physical finding of cyanosis in hypoxaemic patients.
✓ Appropriate changes should be made to any 'track and trigger' system used to allow for a lower target range in patients at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure. These patients should score no points for saturation if within their target range and they should score points if the oxygen saturation falls below the target range or if the saturation rises above the target range while breathing oxygen. The 2017 update of the national NEWS chart has a special section for oximetry measurements for use with patients who have a target range 88–92% and it is recommended that the 2017 NEWS chart should be used in all hospitals (see recommendation B4).
✓ The presence of a normal SpO 2 does not negate the need for blood gas measurements especially if the patient is on supplemental oxygen therapy. Pulse oximetry will be normal in a patient with normal oxygen tension (PO 2) but abnormal blood pH or carbon dioxide tension PCO 2 or with a low blood oxygen content due to anaemia. For this reason, blood gases and full blood count tests are required as early as possible in all situations where these measurements may affect patient outcomes.
✓ All clinical staff who use oximeters must be trained in their use and made aware of the limitations of oximetry. (Oximetry is a valuable clinical tool but subject to artefact and errors of interpretation).

### Platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome: a case of chronic paroxysmal hypoxemia [^113tHCeR]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

A 75-year-old man with chronic (30-year) unexplained paroxysmal hypoxemia presented with postural hypoxemia and desaturation consistent with a clinical manifestation of platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome. His history included a lack of significant past pulmonary disease, yet with intermittent need for oxygen supplementation. On admission he was found to have an interatrial shunt through a patent foramen ovale. Device closure by percutaneous catheterization led to sustained resolution of symptoms. Platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome is a rare but important consideration in the differential diagnosis of hypoxemia, as it represents a potentially curable cause of hypoxemia, with missed diagnosis leading to possible patient morbidity if untreated. Even more importantly, an astute and careful history and physical examination are integral to the diagnosis of this rare but likely under-recognized syndrome.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^113scyWr]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Universal care — oxygen administration and normal vital signs definitions: Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94–98% saturation, and supplemental oxygen administration is warranted to patients with oxygen saturations below this level and titrated based upon clinical condition, clinical response, and geographic location and altitude; the method of oxygen delivery should minimize or treat hypercarbia associated with hypoventilation (e.g., non-invasive positive airway pressure devices). For vital sign assessment (See Table 1. Normal Vital Signs), hypotension is considered a systolic blood pressure less than the lower limit on the chart, tachycardia is considered a pulse above the upper limit on the chart, bradycardia is considered a pulse below the lower limit on the chart, tachypnea is considered a respiratory rate above the upper limit on the chart, and bradypnea is considered a respiratory rate below the lower limit on the chart.

### Surgical removal of an unusual huge solitary fibrous tumor in the mediastinum: a case report [^113nEmt9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 66-year-old female presented with an initial manifestation of ambiguous pain in the chest and dysphagia and later developed pitting edema in both lower extremities and cachexia five months before admission. Past medical history was unremarkable, and the patient denied exposure to asbestos or other drugs or harmful substances. In the physical examination, vital signs were stable, and nothing significant was found. However, laboratory findings showed hypoalbuminemia (albumin: 1.9 g/dl).

Before hospital admission, the patient underwent echocardiography, in which a mass was seen in the mediastinum. Therefore, a computed tomography (CT) was performed, showing an oval shaped, hypodense, well defined posterior mediastinal mass lesion measuring 160*80 mm in transverse and anteroposterior diameter, and 160mm in craniocaudal extension, causing anterior displacement of the heart, widening of subcarinal angle associated with mild to moderate right side pleural effusion. The adjacent thoracic vertebra was normal, however, linear atelectasis was also seen in basilar segment of right upper lobe (Fig. 1). Bronchoscopy was then performed, and a biopsy was taken. Pathological evaluation of the biopsy revealed a differential diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor or fibromatosis. The patient was then referred to our center for tumor excision.

### Pediatric pulmonary hypertension: guidelines from the American Heart Association and American Thoracic Society [^111tp8XA]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn — clinical diagnosis and general care specify that clinical manifestations include labile oxygenation, differential saturation with higher Spo2 in the right upper extremity compared with a lower extremity, or profound hypoxemia despite oxygen and mechanical ventilation; these findings are not specific for PPHN, and echocardiography is required to exclude CHD and thus establish the diagnosis while also determining whether LV dysfunction is present. Management includes optimization of lung volume and function, oxygen delivery, and support of cardiac function; systemic blood pressure should be maintained at normal levels for age with volume and cardiotonic therapy, whereas increasing blood pressure to supraphysiological levels solely to drive a left-to-right shunt across the PDA may transiently improve oxygenation but will not reduce PVR and should be avoided. Oxygen is commonly used, but extreme hyperoxia (Fio2 > 0.6) may be ineffective and may aggravate lung injury; poor lung expansion will exacerbate PPHN, exogenous surfactant may improve lung expansion and reverse PPHN in significant parenchymal disease but did not reduce ECMO use and carries a risk for acute airway obstruction, therefore the use of surfactant should be considered only for infants with severe parenchymal lung disease and poor lung recruitment. Acidosis can induce pulmonary vasoconstriction and should be avoided; forced alkalosis induced by hyperventilation or infusion of sodium bicarbonate yields transient improvements in Pao2 without demonstrated long-term benefit.

### The pathophysiology of' happy' hypoxemia in COVID-19 [^111UzbNZ]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global crisis, challenging healthcare systems worldwide. Many patients present with a remarkable disconnect in rest between profound hypoxemia yet without proportional signs of respiratory distress (i.e. happy hypoxemia) and rapid deterioration can occur. This particular clinical presentation in COVID-19 patients contrasts with the experience of physicians usually treating critically ill patients in respiratory failure and ensuring timely referral to the intensive care unit can, therefore, be challenging. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiological determinants of respiratory drive and hypoxemia may promote a more complete comprehension of a patient's clinical presentation and management. Preserved oxygen saturation despite low partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood samples occur, due to leftward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve induced by hypoxemia-driven hyperventilation as well as possible direct viral interactions with hemoglobin. Ventilation-perfusion mismatch, ranging from shunts to alveolar dead space ventilation, is the central hallmark and offers various therapeutic targets.

### Bedside ultrasonography in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary pathologies in the intensive care unit [^117VmDAZ]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Among critically ill patients, opacification of a part or whole lung field on chest radiography may pose a challenge in the differential diagnosis of acute pulmonary pathologies (eg, pneumothorax, hemothorax, pleural effusion, atelectasis, and solid organ in thoracic cavity) and selection of treatment modalities. In cases in which clinical findings, history, and imaging studies are not conclusive, bedside ultrasonography may be invaluable in achieving a diagnosis. We present two cases in which portable ultrasonography at the bedside was critical to the diagnosis and subsequent management of the patient.

### Guidelines for the use of lung ultrasound to optimise the management of neonatal respiratory distress: international expert consensus [^116dRREv]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the outstanding advantages of guiding MV application under LUS monitoring, according to the expert consensus in Table 1, we summarise the following guidance opinions. Simply, invasive MV treatment should be provided if moderate or severe RDS is diagnosed on LUS, whereas noninvasive MV can initially be provided if the diagnosis is mild RDS on LUS (Fig. 1). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) using 0.9% NaCl is proposed before MV is initiated if LUS suggests a diagnosis of severe meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), severe pneumonia, or severe atelectasis; if BAL leads to the complete disappearance of a consolidation, MV is not required (Fig. 2); in contrast, in the case of a significant but incomplete reduction, noninvasive MV should be provided (Fig. 3). Invasive ventilation should be provided if the image of large consolidations shows no significant changes after BAL. Although MV is generally unnecessary in mild MAS, pneumonia, or atelectasis cases when the infant is clinically stable and breathing spontaneously. However, if severe lung consolidation occurs in a patient with pulmonary haemorrhage, invasive ventilator therapy with higher parameters should be used instead of BLA (Fig. 4 and Video 1). Another crucial differential diagnosis that may lead to improper use of MV is between TTN and RDS. Specifically, lung oedema may depend on TTN, especially in infants with dyspnoea shortly after birth. When identification is unclear, clinicians tend to treat TTN as RDS, leading to an expansion of the administration of MV. In general, invasive MV is unnecessary if the diagnosis is TTN on LUS unless disease progression leads to secondary RDS. Moreover, noninvasive MV can be given if the patient has severe dyspnoea (Fig. 5). PTX is also a common lung disease that threatens the safety of newborns in the NICU. Generally, MV is usually not required if LUS presents as mild PTX (Fig. 6 and Video 2). Invasive MV should be provided if moderate–severe PTX is observed via LUS and if the infant appears to be in significant clinical distress (Fig. 7). However, in this case, we should choose invasive high-frequency oscillatory ventilation instead of conventional invasive ventilation.

We recommend that, when available, supplemental oxygen sufficient to achieve an SpO2 of > 90% or relieve symptoms be used while waiting to initiate descent when descent is not feasible and during descent in severely ill patients. Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence.

Respiratory acidosis is characterized by a primary increase in whole-body carbon dioxide stores caused by a positive carbon dioxide balance. This acid-base disorder, if severe, may be life-threatening, therefore requiring prompt recognition and expert management. The case presented highlights the essential features of the diagnosis and management of respiratory acidosis. A brief description of the modifiers of carbon dioxide production, the pathogenesis of respiratory acidosis, and an algorithm for assessment and management of this disorder is included. Key teaching points include the clinical value of both arterial and venous blood gas analyses and the importance of proper recognition of a primary respiratory arrest in contrast to primary circulatory arrest when managing a patient who requires resuscitation from "cardiorespiratory arrest".

Clinical introductionA man in his 60s with no medical history presented with sudden-onset, severe interscapular pain. He was in circulatory shock with a blood pressure of 65/30mm Hg, heart rate of 115 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute and a room air oxygen saturation of 89%. Examination demonstrated weak peripheral pulses, an elevated jugular venous pressure, faint dual heart sounds, no cardiac murmurs and bilateral lung crepitations. An ECG was recorded which showed a broad QRS (figure 1A). There were no previous ECGs to compare this with. In view of his presentation with acute-onset interscapular pain, CT of the aorta was organised by the emergency department clinicians (figure 1B-D). After the CT result was obtained, the on-call cardiologist was contacted and a bedside echocardiogram performed. This demonstrated severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesia of the apex and lateral walls. The patient was then transferred to the catheter laboratory for an emergency invasive coronary angiogram.heartjnl;106/2/126/F1F1F1Figure 1ECG and CT images at presentation (A) 12 lead ECG.

### Pulmonary atelectasis: a pathogenic perioperative entity [^1162M4jH]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Atelectasis occurs in the dependent parts of the lungs of most patients who are anesthetized. Development of atelectasis is associated with decreased lung compliance, impairment of oxygenation, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and development of lung injury. The adverse effects of atelectasis persist into the postoperative period and can impact patient recovery. This review article focuses on the causes, nature, and diagnosis of atelectasis. The authors discuss the effects and implications of atelectasis in the perioperative period and illustrate how preventive measures may impact outcome. In addition, they examine the impact of atelectasis and its prevention in acute lung injury.

### Persistent hypoxia after diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary thromboembolism [^1117pujZ]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory failure in the perioperative period represents a frequent challenge to the anesthesiologist. The differential diagnosis is extensive and includes alterations on the pulmonary parenchyma, pulmonary vessels, airway, and cardiac system. Occasionally, two or more pathophysiological process superimpose. We present a patient who suffered from a left pulmonary embolism that was appropriately diagnosed and treated. However, the hypoxemia persisted and a second pathology was suspected. After careful evaluation and differential diagnosis, we drained a right pleural effusion, which had been present preoperatively, with resolution of the hypoxemia. There is controversy in the literature as to the role of drainage of pleural effusions on improving oxygenation. We present this case as an example of successful management of perioperative respiratory failure by thoracentesis in the presence of a second concurrent pathologic process.

Cardiovascular and respiratory conditions in acute care require rapid, critical decision making, often with limited clinical information. Focused cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS) can aid in diagnosis by providing information that may not be evident from a patient's medical history, physical examination, and ancillary tests. Eight cases are presented in which FOCUS drastically altered the management of patient care, shortened the differential diagnosis, or allowed for the development of a definitive diagnosis. In 3 cases, diagnoses that were not initially suspected were identified by FOCUS. In the remaining cases, uncommon yet critical diagnoses were established at early stages along the patients' courses of care.

Problem

The rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic has been responsible for 3.4 million deaths worldwideand has placed unprecedented strain on healthcare systems. A significant proportion of patients hospitalised with acute COVID-19 have severe hypoxia (very low blood oxygen saturation) frequently presenting 'silently' (ie, without breathlessness). Silent hypoxia is an independent indicator of worse patient outcomes, and delayed presentations of severe COVID-19; often leading to extended hospital stays, higher risk of ICU admission and higher mortality rates.

### Stelara struck: a case of noninfectious pneumonitis secondary to ustekinumab [^115SHUG4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

The patient is a 33-year-old man with history of Crohn's disease who was admitted to the medical ICU with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. He was in his usual state of health until 36 h prior to presentation, when he developed myalgias, fatigue, headache, and epigastric pain. He denied change in stools consistent with prior exacerbations of Crohn's disease. Due to his symptoms, he was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. His past medical history was notable for Crohn's disease diagnosed in 2000, for which he had been on multiple immunosuppressants. Most recently he was trialed on ustekinumab (Stelara) 2 years prior to this hospitalization, with good response to therapy. However, he discontinued the medication after 5 months due to concerns about potential infectious complications. Two weeks prior to presentation, ustekinumab was restarted due to evidence of active Crohn's disease. Importantly, prior to this hospitalization he had no respiratory symptoms and no evidence of interstitial lung disease found on prior CT scans.

On presentation to the hospital, his vital signs were noteworthy for temperature of 39.6C, heart rate 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, blood pressure 117/83 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98% on room air. Exam was remarkable only for epigastric tenderness on abdominal exam. His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Initial chest X-Ray was clear with no acute airspace disease. On hospital day 1, he developed cough, dyspnea, and hypoxemia, requiring 5 L nasal cannula oxygen to maintain SpO2 > 90%. His hypoxemia rapidly worsened, and on hospital day 2 he was moved to the ICU for initiation of high flow nasal cannula with 75% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). Repeat chest X-Ray showed diffuse reticular infiltrates. At this time, our differential was infectious (bacterial, viral, or atypical pneumonia) versus inflammatory (Crohn's disease associated pneumonitis, drug induced pneumonitis). Due to the concern for infectious etiology, he was intubated and a bronchoscopy was performed. Empiric antibiotic coverage with vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin was also started. CT chest with contrast showed bilateral consolidations and ground glass opacities without evidence of pulmonary embolism (Fig. 1 A).

### A 77-year-old woman with capillary hypoxia and perioral cyanosis [^112V1EdR]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Studies

The CBC was notable for hemoglobin (11.8 g/dL), whereas the basic metabolic panel results were unremarkable. Arterial blood gas was notable for a pH of 7.58; Pa 2, 24 mm Hg; and Pa 2, > 500 mm Hg while receiving oxygen via a high-flow nasal cannula at 60 L/min with an F 2 of 100%. Single-view portable chest radiography and transthoracic echocardiography with bubble contrast produced unremarkable results. A chest CT angiogram with contrast did not indicate pulmonary embolism and showed only mild atelectasis and inflammatory changes consistent with her known asthma. Mass spectrometry did not reveal any evidence of hemoglobin variants.

The patient's cyanosis and the discrepancy in oxygen saturation, as measured by pulse oximetry and blood gas analysis, were concerning for methemoglobinemia. Thorough medication reconciliation (Table 1) revealed intermittent phenazopyridine use over several years, and the patient had recently restarted this medication approximately 3 days before presentation. A blood sample was sent to the laboratory for CO-oximetry testing, but unfortunately, the results could not be reported because of the presence of an interfering substance. The team therefore decided to proceed with administration of methylene blue for empiric treatment of suspected methemoglobinemia. Unfortunately, the patient also reported current use of duloxetine and ginkgo biloba, so there was concern for inducing serotonin syndrome with concurrent use of methylene blue and agents that inhibit serotonin reuptake. A trial of IV vitamin C was thus initiated first, without improvement in the patient's Sp 2. After discussion of the risks and benefits with the toxicology service and the patient, methylene blue treatment was initiated the next morning. The patient received IV methylene blue at 1.5 mg/kg without improvement, followed by an additional 1 mg/kg, also without improvement. The lack of improvement argued against methemoglobinemia as the culprit for her hypoxia. On further discussion with the laboratory, it was determined that the interfering substance precluding reporting of the CO-oximetry results was suggestive of the presence of sulfhemoglobin, but available equipment did not have the ability to confirm. Send-out testing for sulfhemoglobin by spectrophotometry was performed, and the sulfhemoglobin level was later reported at 20.0% (reporting limit, 2.0%).

Oximetry and arterial blood gas measurement — use in COPD: Pulse oximetry can be used to evaluate arterial oxygen saturation and need for supplemental oxygen at the point-of-care and should be used to assess all patients with clinical signs suggestive of respiratory failure or right heart failure. If peripheral arterial oxygen saturation is ≤ 92%, arterial blood gases should be measured due to the imperfect correlation between oximetry and arterial blood gas. Pulse oximetry does not provide information on PaCO2 or pH, which may have potential therapeutic implications.

### Detection of spontaneous breathing during an apnea test in a patient with suspected brain death using electrical impedance tomography: a case report [^117NsPMp]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

During the AT, intentional induction of hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis aims to stimulate the medullary respiratory centers. However, the process can predispose patients to cardiopulmonary complications, such as various types of arrhythmias, fluctuation in blood pressure, or developing hypoxia. Several modifications to the procedure have been explored to enhance safety and reduce complication rates, such as the development of severe atelectasis. These modifications include adjustments of a CPAP system, or enabling flow and capnography monitoring.

However, as mentioned previously, implementation of AT highly varies according to national regulations. Despite these advancements to improve AT, the detection of spontaneous respiratory efforts continues to significantly rely heavily on visual observation of the chest and abdomen, a method whose efficacy relies on well-trained clinicians. Intensive care related overstress and inobservance due to night shift working, as well as the absence of an objective, digitally recorded and retrievable monitoring techniques, implies increased uncertainty in applying AT effectively and safely.

Our case study proposes the integration of EIT as a supplementary monitoring technique to detect spontaneous breathing effort during the AT in cases of regulation with complete disconnection from the ventilator. EIT offers the advantage of continuous and real-time imaging of ventilation distribution, offering potentially additional insights into respiratory mechanics by providing quantitative data. EIT can effectively monitor lung volume changes and detect ventilation heterogeneity in various clinical scenarios. Real-time EIT imaging provides immediate assessment of tidal impedance variations (TIV) at the bedside, which could improve the sensitivity and accuracy of the detection of subtle respiratory movements that might otherwise be missed due to distractions in visual observation. A further advantage of EIT is the digital and retrievable recording by the device, which provides a traceable audit.

It is important to note that the patient presented with extensive bilateral cerebellar hemorrhage as evidenced by CT scans, which severely compromised brain stem function. Although the patient displayed all clinical signs of brain death, spontaneous breathing persisted, likely due to minimal residual perfusion around the respiratory centers in the ventrolateral medulla oblongata, but not elsewhere. This case calls attention to the importance of AT. A series of physical examinations explored further spontaneous breath movements with the complete loss of the rest of the brain stem reflexes in the next two days. As the control CT scan revealed central nervous system damage incompatible with life and no further neurosurgical intervention emerged, patient underwent end-of-life care following the detailed information of the next of kin.

### Perioperative pulmonary atelectasis: part II. clinical implications [^111BvJ6G]. Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The development of pulmonary atelectasis is common in the surgical patient. Pulmonary atelectasis can cause various degrees of gas exchange and respiratory mechanics impairment during and after surgery. In its most serious presentations, lung collapse could contribute to postoperative respiratory insufficiency, pneumonia, and worse overall clinical outcomes. A specific risk assessment is critical to allow clinicians to optimally choose the anesthetic technique, prepare appropriate monitoring, adapt the perioperative plan, and ensure the patient's safety. Bedside diagnosis and management have benefited from recent imaging advancements such as lung ultrasound and electrical impedance tomography, and monitoring such as esophageal manometry. Therapeutic management includes a broad range of interventions aimed at promoting lung recruitment. During general anesthesia, these strategies have consistently demonstrated their effectiveness in improving intraoperative oxygenation and respiratory compliance. Yet these same intraoperative strategies may fail to affect additional postoperative pulmonary outcomes. Specific attention to the postoperative period may be key for such outcome impact of lung expansion. Interventions such as noninvasive positive pressure ventilatory support may be beneficial in specific patients at high risk for pulmonary atelectasis (e.g., obese) or those with clinical presentations consistent with lung collapse (e.g., postoperative hypoxemia after abdominal and cardiothoracic surgeries). Preoperative interventions may open new opportunities to minimize perioperative lung collapse and prevent pulmonary complications. Knowledge of pathophysiologic mechanisms of atelectasis and their consequences in the healthy and diseased lung should provide the basis for current practice and help to stratify and match the intensity of selected interventions to clinical conditions.

### A new global definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^113d8vmd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Timing, Risk Factors, and Extrapulmonary Factors

The committee agreed that the current time frame for the diagnosis of ARDS should be retained: acute onset or worsening of hypoxemic respiratory failure is defined as occurring within 1 week of the onset of the predisposing risk factor or within 1 week of new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Prolonging the time to onset of hypoxemic respiratory failure was considered, as protracted symptoms may precede progression to frank respiratory failure, as in the case of COVID-19; however, expanding the definition to include HFNO (detailed below) should allow earlier diagnosis, so the time frame of 1 week for acute onset of respiratory failure was maintained. The acute onset or worsening of hypoxemic respiratory failure and pulmonary edema should not be exclusively or primarily attributable to cardiogenic pulmonary edema or fluid overload, atelectasis or lung collapse, pleural effusion, or pulmonary embolism. ARDS can be diagnosed in the presence of these conditions if a predisposing risk factor for ARDS is also present, and the clinician believes that these other conditions (e.g. fluid overload, atelectasis) are unlikely to be the primary causes of the hypoxemia. ARDS also can be diagnosed in the presence of chronic lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, or pulmonary hypertension, providing that acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is not primarily attributable to these underlying conditions. Further rationale for these recommendations is provided in Supplement E2 and Tables E1 and E2.

Chest Imaging

The committee agreed that chest imaging criteria should include bilateral radiologic (chest radiography or computed tomography) or ultrasound findings suggestive of loss of lung aeration that are not fully explained by effusions, atelectasis, or nodules/masses. Although the identification of bilateral opacities by chest radiography has poor interrater reliability, chest radiography is the most common imaging modality in critically ill patients, which contributed to the recommendation to retain it in the definition despite its limitations. In addition, the committee recommended that ultrasound be accepted as a modality for identifying signs of loss of lung aeration consistent with (noncardiogenic) pulmonary edema or lung consolidation, especially when chest radiography or computed tomography is not available. There is evidence that ultrasound can be reliable if the operator is trained to detect bilateral consolidations and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, an approach that should have value, especially in resource-limited areas. Further discussion of the rationale for these recommendations is provided in Supplement E3.

Abstract

The profoundly hypoxemic child presents an interesting set of diagnostic and management challenges in the pediatric emergency department. While common pathologies including pneumonia, asthma, bronchiolitis, and pneumothoraces are managed using evidence-based algorithms, more enigmatic pathologies may present the treating physician with less diagnostic and therapeutic clarity.

The spectrum of disorders involving the tracheobronchial tree is diverse, with some of the conditions unique to the pediatric population. Despite the "airway first" maxim, many such disorders are missed initially. Tracheal bronchus is one such condition that comes to notice by persistent right upper lobe atelectasis, pneumothorax, recurrent pneumonia, chronic bronchitis, and prolonged ventilation. This anatomic variant in a patient with cyanotic congenital heart disease is reported. For this patient, timely identification of tracheal bronchus allowed appropriate changes in airway management and was life saving.

### Refractory hypoxemia in an asymptomatic 6-year-old: It is not always the heart [^114YA8Xb]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Hypoxemia and clubbing in otherwise healthy children have a broad differential diagnosis and require a thorough work-up. Hypoxemia unresponsive to supplemental oxygen is strongly suggestive of shunting. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, though less common than intra-cardiac shunts, can present in a similar fashion and physicians must have a high index of suspicion when evaluating patients with hypoxemia refractory to oxygen therapy. Echocardiography with bubble study is a helpful bedside tool that provides rapid diagnosis. Computed tomography angiography and catheterization provides definitive diagnosis. The management of PAVMs is similar irrespective of cause, with the primary modality considered embolization. Patients must be followed closely after embolization to monitor sequelae and observe for recurrence.

Step 3 (confirmation) — patients should be referred to a PH centre for further evaluation when an intermediate/high probability of PH is established and in the presence of risk factors for PAH, or a history of PE. A comprehensive work-up should be performed to establish differential diagnoses and distinguish between causes of PH, and the PH centre is responsible for performing an invasive assessment according to the clinical scenario. At any time, warning signs must be recognized, as they are associated with worse outcomes and warrant immediate intervention; warning signs include rapid progression of symptoms, severely reduced exercise capacity, pre-syncope or syncope on mild exertion, and signs of right heart failure. As indicated; CT pulmonary angiography recommended if PH suspected.

### Advanced life support. post-cardiac arrest care [^114ZFXGT]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Post-cardiac arrest care — oxygen and carbon dioxide target levels in adults — For adults with return of circulation after cardiac arrest in the prehospital and in-hospital settings, 100% inspired supplemental oxygen should be provided until the oxygen saturation can be measured reliably. Once arterial oxygen levels can be reliably measured, it is reasonable to provide the minimal amount of supplemental oxygen needed to maintain an oxygen saturation of 94% to 98%, or a partial pressure of arterial oxygen of 75 mmHg to 100 mmHg. (Good practice statement) Both hypoxemia and hyperoxemia should be avoided. Ventilations should be provided, starting at a rate of 10 breaths per minute and adjusting as needed to maintain normocapnia (a partial pressure of carbon dioxide [PaCO2] or end-tidal carbon dioxide level between 35 mmHg to 45 mmHg). Use capnography, pulse oximetry and, as available, a measured partial pressure of oxygen and PaCO2 to ensure that ventilation and oxygenation levels are in the physiological range. When relying on pulse oximetry, be aware that in patients with darker skin pigmentations, there is an increased risk of inaccuracy that may conceal hypoxemia. (Good practice statement)

### Clinical characteristics of 113 deceased patients with coronavirus disease 2019: retrospective study [^111dvp6G]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Among the deceased patients, the median time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was 10.0 (interquartile range 7.0–13.0) days, which tended to be longer than for recovered patients (9.0 (6.0–12.0) days). The median time from onset of symptoms to death in deceased patients was 16 (12.0–20.0) days, and the median time from first symptoms to discharge in recovered patients was 26 (21.8–29.0) days. The median time from admission to death was 5 (3.0–9.3) days and the median time from admission to discharge was 16 (14.0–19.0) days.

Measures of vital signs were recorded on the day of hospital admission for all patients. Median systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in deceased patients (137.0 mm Hg) than recovered patients (125.0 mm Hg). More patients who died than who recovered had arterial pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher (50 (44%) v 33 (20%)). Heart rates were much higher in deceased patients (101.0 beats per minute) than in recovered patients (91.0 beats per minute). Respiratory rates were significantly higher in deceased patients (24.0 breaths per minute) than in recovered patients (20.0 breaths per minute). Deceased patients more often developed tachycardia and tachypnoea (respiratory rate ≥ 24 breaths per minute) (56 (50%) and 66 (58%)) than did recovered patients (48 (30%) and 22 (14%)). Seventy two (64%) deceased patients and only 19 (12%) who recovered had percutaneous oxygen saturation of 93% or below on admission.

### The role of ventilation-induced surfactant dysfunction and atelectasis in causing acute respiratory distress syndrome [^117LrXcw]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

This Pulmonary Perspective describes a new pathophysiologic scenario by which the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) might develop, summarizes the literature on which this new scenario is based, and discusses the resulting implications with respect to patient management. Rather than ARDS occurring as a result of the inflammatory response associated with predisposing risk factors, the proposed scenario theorizes that the initiating problem is atelectasis that develops as a result of a surfactant abnormality that is caused by spontaneous or mechanical ventilation, together with our current approaches to patient positioning and sedation. The proposed pathophysiology implies that ventilation-induced lung injury occurs before, and causes, ARDS (rather than developing after the fact and only serving to magnify the existing injury) and that some instances of ARDS are iatrogenic. If the proposed scenario is correct, it also implies that at least some instances of ARDS might be prevented by implementing a number of simple, safe modifications in patient care.

### Pulmonary atelectasis: a frequent alternative diagnosis in patients undergoing CT-PA for suspected pulmonary embolism [^111vYgB9]. Emergency Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of atelectasis as an alternative diagnosis in patients who underwent computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CT-PA) for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), and to contrast the pathophysiology of pulmonary atelectasis and PE, both of which are associated with dyspnea and hypoxemia. We retrospectively identified 144 consecutive emergency department patients (n = 49) and inpatients (n = 95) admitted between July 2001 and June 2002 who were evaluated with CT-PA for suspected PE. There were 98 women and 46 men with a mean age of 58 years (range 27–95 years). Each CT report was reviewed for PE, the words "atelectasis", "collapse", and/or "volume loss", findings known to predispose to atelectasis, and alternative diagnoses. CT scans of those with PE and those with atelectasis were reviewed. Each case was categorized into one of three groups, as follows: group 1, PE; group 2, atelectasis of three or more segments and no PE; group 3, neither PE nor atelectasis. PaO2 was documented, when available (n = 115), with PaO2 > 100 mmHg recorded as 100 mmHg. Reports for group 3 were reviewed for alternative diagnoses. Thirteen percent of the study population (19/144, group 1) had PE, and two of them had concomitant atelectasis; mean PaO2 was 69 mmHg (range 38–100 mmHg). Nineteen percent of the study population (27/144, group 2) had atelectasis of three or more segments without PE; mean PaO2 was 73 mmHg (range 45–100 mmHg). Sixty-eight percent of the study population (98/144, group 3) had neither PE nor atelectasis; mean PaO2 was 79 mmHg (range 36–100 mmHg). There was a significant difference in the PaO2 between groups 1 and 3 (Student's t-test), with group 2 intermediate. Seventy percent of group 2 (19/27) had at least one finding predisposing to atelectasis: central bronchial abnormality (n = 6), moderate or larger pleural effusion (n = 11), pleural mass, pneumothorax, elevated hemidiaphragm, and severe kyphosis (the last four all n = 1 each), versus 16% (3/19) of group 1 (P < 0.05). Sixty-three percent of group 3 (62/98) had one or more alternative diagnoses on CT that explained the patient's symptoms as follows: pneumonia (28%, 27/98), other lung disease (18%, 18/98), congestive heart failure (13%, 13/98), and malignancy (13%, 13/98). Pulmonary atelectasis was common in patients undergoing CT-PA for suspected PE, equaling pneumonia as the most common alternative diagnosis. Most patients with atelectasis had predisposing findings on CT. Pulmonary atelectasis and PE cause similar symptoms by different mechanisms of ventilation-perfusion mismatch.

Philosophy of the guideline

✓ Oxygen is a treatment for hypoxaemia, not breathlessness. Oxygen has not been proven to have any consistent effect on the sensation of breathlessness in non-hypoxaemic patients.
✓ The essence of this guideline can be summarised simply as a requirement for oxygen to be prescribed according to a target saturation range and for those who administer oxygen therapy to monitor the patient and keep within the target saturation range.
✓ The guideline recommends aiming to achieve normal or near-normal oxygen saturation for all acutely ill patients apart from those at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure or those receiving terminal palliative care.

Assessing patients For critically ill patients, high concentration oxygen should be administered immediately (table 1 and figure 1) and this should be recorded afterwards in the patient's health record. Clinicians must bear in mind that supplemental oxygen is given to improve oxygenation, but it does not treat the underlying causes of hypoxaemia which must be diagnosed and treated as a matter of urgency. The oxygen saturation should be checked by pulse oximetry in all breathless and acutely ill patients, 'the fifth vital sign' (supplemented by blood gases when necessary), and the inspired oxygen concentration should be recorded on the observation chart with the oximetry result. (The other vital signs are pulse rate, blood pressure, temperature and respiratory rate). Pulse oximetry must be available in all locations where emergency oxygen is used. Clinical assessment is recommended if the saturation falls by ≥ 3% or below the target range for the patient. All critically ill patients outside of a critical care area (e.g. intensive care unit (ICU), high dependency unit (HDU), respiratory HDU), should be assessed and monitored using a recognised physiological track and trigger system such as the National Early Warning Score (NEWS).
Target Oxygen prescription Oxygen should be prescribed to achieve a target saturation of 94–98% for most acutely ill patients or 88–92% or patient-specific target range for those at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure (tables 1–4). Best practice is to prescribe a target range for all hospital patients at the time of admission so that appropriate oxygen therapy can be started in the event of unexpected clinical deterioration with hypoxaemia and also to ensure that the oximetry section of the early warning score (EWS) can be scored appropriately. The target saturation should be written (or ringed) on the drug chart or entered in an electronic prescribing system (guidance on figure 1).
Oxygen administration Oxygen should be administered by staff who are trained in oxygen administration. These staff should use appropriate devices and flow rates in order to achieve the target saturation range (figure 2). Staff should be trained in the use of a range of different oxygen delivery devices to ensure oxygen is delivered safely.
Monitoring and maintenance of target saturation Oxygen saturation and delivery system (including flow rate) should be recorded on the patient's monitoring chart. Oxygen delivery devices and flow rates should be adjusted to keep the oxygen saturation in the target range. Prompt clinical assessment is required if oxygen therapy needs to be initiated or increased due to a falling saturation level. Oxygen should be prescribed and a signature should be entered on the drug chart on each drug round.
Weaning and discontinuation of oxygen therapy Oxygen should be reduced in stable patients with satisfactory oxygen saturation. Oxygen should be discontinued once the patient can maintain saturation within or above the target range breathing air but the prescription for a target range should be left in place in case of future deterioration and to guide early warning scores (EWS/NEWS).

### Severe diaphragmatic dysfunction with preserved activity of accessory respiratory muscles in a critically ill child: a case report of failure of neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) and successful support with pressure support ventilation (PSV) [^116qHVMv]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

A constant positive end-expiratory pressure of 4 cmH 2 O and fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.21 were applied throughout the clinical test. We recorded ventilatory variables (tidal volume, respiratory rate, mean airway pressure, end tidal carbon dioxide, pulse oximetry), EAdi and heart rate at 3 min intervals during both phases. A blood gas analysis of central venous blood and non-invasive blood pressure were measured at the beginning and at the end of each 15-min trial.

Table 1 summarizes the observed results. On PSV, the patient presented stable tidal volumes, respiratory rates, minute ventilation, end-tidal and venous CO 2 levels. On the contrary, when switched to NAVA, an immediate drop in tidal volume with consequent marked reduction in minute ventilation was observed. Thereafter, the patient increased the respiratory rate from 15 to 24 breaths per minute, leading to an increase in total minute ventilation, despite the reduced tidal volume. Nevertheless, end-tidal CO 2 progressively increased from 49 to 55 mmHg with a corresponding increase in venous CO 2 from 52 to 57 mmHg. Peripheral arterial oxygen saturation, as measured with pulse oximetry, did not change. The amplitude of the EAdi signal remained very low during both phases and it did not change significantly with the ventilation mode. Of note, during NAVA, the majority of breaths were initiated by the secondary source, i.e. by the pneumatic trigger, as the EAdi signal was frequently not able to trigger inspiration. Clinically, while the patient was well adapted to PSV, on NAVA her breathing pattern became irregular. She showed clear signs of increased work of breathing and distress, such as nasal flaring and suprasternal-intercostal retractions, mild tachycardia and hypertension.

Case presentation

A 73-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of DLBCL presented to the emergency department with a four-day history of worsening shortness of breath and hypoxemia 88% on room air requiring 2–3 L supplemental oxygen. Her social history includes a 25-pack year of tobacco smoking which she quit 33 years before her diagnosis. Pertinent family history includes breast cancer in her mother and sister. The patient has received both sars-cov-2 and influenza vaccination for the year.

Two weeks prior to her current presentation, patient had received the first cycle of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (R-CHOP). Her initial infusion was complicated by an episode of lacy, erythematous rash that was attributed to potential hypersensitivity reaction. A week after administration, she was noted to have persistent dyspnea associated with small pleural effusion and lower extremity edema. She was started on a diuretic for concern for possible volume overload with a close follow up in a week. No thoracentesis was done given small size and no safe window.

Upon presentation to the emergency department, she was visibly dyspneic at rest and with minimal exertion. Initial vitals showed a normal temperature of 36.9 °C, blood pressure, 124/75 and heart rate at 100 beats per minute. On physical examination, her pulmonary auscultation revealed diffuse rhonchi with decreased breath sounds at the left lower lung base and 1 + putting edema in the lower extremity.

Initial work up in the emergency room included complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), Troponin, prothrombin (PT) and international normalized ration (INR), Urinalysis, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), electrocardiogram (EKG), chest radiography (chest x-ray), and computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest. EKG showed premature atrial complexes, inferior infarct, and a shortened QT interval. Chest x-ray revealed a left perihilar opacity and a small left pleural effusion. Chest tomography angiogram of the chest revealed no pulmonary embolism, multifocal ground glass opacities (GGO) present in all five lobes, emphysema, and trace left pleural effusion with atelectasis (Fig. 1). Labs demonstrated mildly elevated white blood cell (WBC) count.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: management of pediatric patients with oxygen in the acute care setting [^116zE7Yv]. Respiratory Care (2021). High credibility.

AARC Clinical Practice Guideline — background on pediatric oxygen therapy emphasizes common use for hypoxemia in acute conditions but highlights risks and the need for appropriate delivery selection. Oxygen is one of the most commonly delivered medications to children for the treatment of hypoxemia caused by many acute conditions such as lower respiratory tract infections, sepsis, or shock. Oxygen therapy does, however, have consequences of over-use and hyperoxia, such as oxygen toxicity and absorption atelectasis. The delivery of oxygen in pediatric patients requires appropriate selection of the delivery device, concentration, and flow for the most effective therapy to avoid both hypoxia and hyperoxia.

Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are a rare cause of pulmonary symptoms, including dyspnoea on exertion, hypoxemia and haemoptysis. PAVMs are an aetiology that is often overlooked by physicians when developing a differential diagnosis for pulmonary symptoms and unidentified lung masses. However, it is an important differential diagnosis to have as PAVMs can have serious sequelae including strokes, brain abscess and life-threatening bleeding. We present a case of an impressive PAVM presenting with chest pain, chronic cough, feelings of anxiety, mild resting hypoxemia and exertional hypoxemia. Of note, on previous chest X-ray, 8 years prior to presentation, an incidental mass was found during a shoulder repair presurgical workup but not further evaluated.

### Spontaneous pneumothorax as unusual presenting symptom of COVID-19 pneumonia: surgical management and pathological findings [^114uj7Co]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

On December 2019, a novel coronavirus-related pneumonia has been first reported in the city of Wuhan, China. Since then, the disease has spread worldwide throughout Asia, Europe, America and Africa. In Italy, the first cases of novel coronavirus infections were reported on February 21, 2020.

Patients with COVID-19 can have mild symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and smell and taste dysfunction, or more serious and rapidly progressing respiratory impairment such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

Radiological presentation at CT scan is characterized by bilateral interstitial infiltrates with ground glass opacities (GGO), multiple lobar and subsegmental consolidations and air bronchograms. Other findings such as pleural effusion, cavitation, pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax are uncommon and in some cases anecdotal.

Pneumothorax is often a late manifestation of the disease, mainly due to patient intubation and positive air-pressure oxygen administration.

We describe two cases of spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) as presenting symptom of COVID-19 disease and their surgical management, with insight on intraoperative and pathological findings.

Case 1

A 58-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department of our hospital on March 22 for sudden right thoracic pain, dyspnea, and mild fever. He was a former smoker, with no significant medical history. At presentation, he had tachycardia and hypertension (heart rate 120, blood systemic pressure 190/120), tachypnea and desaturation (respiratory rate 40/min, arterial blood saturation 81%). At hemogasanalysis, pH was 7.38, paO2 was 53 mmHg and paCO2 44 mmHg. Chest X-ray showed massive right pneumothorax (Fig. 1 a): a 20 Ch chest drain was positioned, with immediate relief of patient dyspnea and normalization of vital parameters. Post-procedural X-ray showed full re-expansion of the lung. Blood tests revealed mild leukocytosis with lymphopenia, slight lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) elevation, normal C-reactive protein (CRP). A CT scan showed bilateral interstitial pneumonia with GGO and air bronchograms, suggesting COVID-19 disease. Oropharyngeal swab test was positive for Sars-CoV2.

East-West (Ridler syndrome) in awake veno-arterial ECMO is a novel syndrome of differential hypocapnia and a new diagnostic dilemma. In a spontaneously ventilating patient, increased respiratory rate increases minute volume and CO2 clearance by the lung, so measured pCO2 in the right radial blood gas drops and the patient may appear to have a respiratory alkalosis; however, when the watershed mixing area sits between the brachiocephalic artery and the left carotid artery, radial blood gases will show low CO2 and high pH despite delivery of hypercapnic blood to the cerebral circulation and respiratory drive centers. In response to the right radial arterial blood gas measurements, providers may be inclined to decrease CO2 clearance by the ECMO circuit by reduction in the device' gas sweep, which results in increasingly hypercapnic retrograde blood flow entering the cerebral circulation and a further inappropriate centrally driven increase in respiratory rate, thereby exacerbating this cycle; further reduction in ECMO sweep gas will result in worsening cerebral hypercapnia with worsening paradoxical tachypnea. Early recognition avoids progression to respiratory exhaustion, cerebral edema, and neurological injury; if Ridler Syndrome is suspected, careful examination of central, mixed venous and post-oxygenator pCO2 will be helpful, and titration of sweep gas to both right radial and post-oxygenator pCO2 with confirmation of the watershed mixing zone by echocardiography will disrupt the cycle.

Regarding respiratory support for pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome, more specifically with respect to invasive ventilation (technical considerations), PALICC-2/PALISI 2023 guidelines recommend to consider maintaining SpO2 between 92–97% in patients with mild/moderate PARDS.
Consider accepting SpO2 < 92% in patients with severe PARDS after optimizing PEEP, in order to reduce FiO2 exposure.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^116GDJuq]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

BRUE diagnosis — Patient presents for initial medical assessment after a brief, resolved event that was observed by caregiver in a child < 1 year of age, and the patient may be well-appearing or have additional symptoms or abnormal vital signs; use event characteristics, rather than the term "ALTE", to describe the event. The clinician characterizes the event as a sudden, brief, and now resolved episode of one or more of the following, including cyanosis or pallor, absent, decreased, or irregular breathing, marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia), or altered responsiveness. If event criteria are present, perform appropriate history and physical examination (PE); if no explanation for the event is identified, diagnosis of Brief Resolved Unexplained Event is made, whereas if an explanation for the event is identified (eg, GER, feeding difficulties, or airway abnormality) it is out of guideline scope and should be managed accordingly.
