## Question

How to interpret paracentesis studies

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret paracentesis studies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why paracentesis is performed. Then, I should verify the core diagnostic tests and their thresholds, especially SAAG and PMN count. Next, I will examine culture technique and SBP diagnosis. After that, I need to check special scenarios like malignant, pancreatic, and tuberculous ascites. I will then review procedural safety, including coagulopathy and ultrasound guidance. Finally, I should integrate therapeutic implications, including albumin use and follow-up strategies, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indications, because misclassification here derails everything downstream. Paracentesis is both diagnostic and therapeutic; diagnostically, it clarifies etiology and detects infection, while therapeutically it relieves refractory ascites and improves respiratory mechanics, so I need to keep both aims in mind as I interpret results and studies [^114Qadwe] [^113MXKL3].

> I will now examine the foundational tests that anchor interpretation. The serum–ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) remains the primary discriminator: SAAG ≥ 1.1 g/dL supports portal hypertension–related ascites, whereas SAAG < 1.1 g/dL suggests peritoneal disease such as malignancy, infection, or pancreatitis; I should double-check that this threshold is consistent across guidelines, and yes, AASLD, EASL, and BASL/BSG align on this cut point and its clinical implications [^115HHZ9u] [^1153r1oP] [^113Brfv2] [^111KuzhC].

> Wait, let me verify the neutrophil threshold for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), because this is easy to misstate. The diagnosis of SBP requires an ascitic fluid PMN count > 250 cells/mm³, and I should confirm that this is the universal standard; indeed, AASLD, EASL, and BASL/BSG all endorse this threshold and emphasize that culture positivity is not required for diagnosis, which matters when interpreting negative cultures in the right clinical context [^1114zpPx] [^116iQsaf] [^116xctRG].

> Next, I should review culture technique, since yield directly affects interpretation. Bedside inoculation of at least 10 mL of ascitic fluid into aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles increases culture sensitivity to over 90%, and I need to ensure this is done before antibiotics; if antibiotics have already been started, I should note that cultures may be falsely negative and plan accordingly [^111QMCdv] [^116i32Wu] [^114Qadwe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology without integrating SAAG with total protein and clinical context. High SAAG with high total protein (> 2.5 g/dL) points toward cardiac ascites, whereas low SAAG with high protein suggests malignant or tuberculous peritonitis; I should confirm that this pattern is guideline-supported, and yes, AASLD and BASL/BSG endorse using total protein alongside SAAG to refine the differential [^1177Wn5b] [^113Brfv2] [^111KuzhC].

> I need to check special scenarios next. For suspected malignant ascites, cytology is the key test but has variable yield; combining cytology with tumor markers such as CEA, CA 15–3, and CA 19–9 can improve specificity, though CA-125 is nonspecific and often elevated in any ascites; I should also remember that EUS-guided paracentesis can increase diagnostic yield in selected upper GI and pancreaticobiliary malignancies, which can change management decisions [^111KuzhC] [^113A8PYU].

> For pancreatic ascites, I should confirm the diagnostic triad: ascitic amylase > 1000 IU/L, total protein > 3 g/dL, and SAAG < 1.1 g/dL; this pattern, together with clinical context, supports the diagnosis and guides therapy toward pancreatic ductal management rather than cirrhosis-directed care [^1137WuCd].

> For tuberculous peritonitis, I should double-check that adenosine deaminase (ADA) is the most useful adjunct when TB is suspected, with ADA > 40 IU/L supporting the diagnosis; smear and culture have low yield, so a negative AFB smear does not exclude TB, and I must interpret ADA in the right clinical and epidemiologic context [^1116aGS6] [^1115uioo].

> Now, I will examine procedural safety and technique, because interpretation of studies hinges on whether complications were minimized. Ultrasound guidance reduces bleeding and improves success, particularly in patients with low-volume ascites, obesity, or coagulopathy; I should confirm that major society statements recommend ultrasound when available, and yes, SHM and BASL/BSG endorse its routine use and provide practical guidance on site selection and vessel avoidance [^116ghThQ] [^1148hJci].

> But wait, what if the INR is 2.5 and platelets are 50,000 — do I need to transfuse before paracentesis? I should verify the coagulopathy guidance. Contemporary guidance indicates that elevated INR and thrombocytopenia are not contraindications to diagnostic or therapeutic paracentesis, and routine transfusion of clotting factors or platelets is not recommended; exceptions include DIC or severe uremic platelet dysfunction, where case-by-case judgment applies [^111BcorH] [^115o9h96].

> Next, I should review therapeutic implications and albumin use, since many studies operationalize this. For large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L), albumin 20–25% at 8 g per liter removed is recommended to prevent post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction; for smaller volumes, albumin may be considered in high-risk patients such as those with acute kidney injury or ACLF; I should confirm that this remains a strong recommendation despite low-to-moderate certainty evidence, and yes, BASL/BSG and AGA maintain this stance while acknowledging evidence limitations [^115o9h96] [^1111AaRS] [^114fLvXr].

> I will now examine follow-up and response assessment, because interpretation of SBP studies often hinges on timing. A repeat paracentesis at 48 hours to document a ≥ 25% decrease in PMN count is recommended to confirm response; failure to achieve this threshold should prompt broadening antibiotics and evaluation for secondary peritonitis; I should confirm the 5–7 day antibiotic duration and the caveat that some data support stopping earlier if PMN drops below 250/mm³ with clinical improvement, which can influence study endpoints [^1131FfV3] [^111RuPDB].

> Let me consider prognostic and systems-level signals that can bias interpretation. Early diagnostic paracentesis within 12–24 hours of admission is associated with lower in-hospital mortality, shorter length of stay, and less acute kidney injury; however, I should be cautious about confounding and note that a meta-analysis supports the mortality signal while calling for randomized trials, which tempers causal inference from observational data [^112mQfR9].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not overgeneralizing from cirrhosis to noncirrhotic ascites. SAAG and total protein remain useful across etiologies, but the pretest probability and additional tests differ: amylase for pancreatic ascites, ADA for TB, cytology and markers for malignancy, and BNP when cardiac ascites is suspected; aligning the test panel to the leading differential prevents misinterpretation of isolated results [^112Xjg6J] [^111KuzhC].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined sequence: confirm the indication and context, calculate SAAG and total protein to frame etiology, assess PMN count for SBP, obtain bedside cultures before antibiotics, add targeted tests based on suspicion (cytology, amylase, ADA, BNP), use ultrasound to maximize safety, apply albumin for large-volume taps, and reassess at 48 hours if SBP is diagnosed; anchoring interpretation to this pathway reduces error and aligns with high-quality guidance and the best available evidence [^1177Wn5b] [^115o9h96] [^114Qadwe].

Paracentesis studies are interpreted by integrating **SAAG, total protein, cell count, and culture** to distinguish portal hypertensive from non-portal ascites, diagnose SBP, and guide therapy [^1177Wn5b] [^114Qadwe]. SAAG ≥ 1.1 g/dL indicates portal hypertension, while **< 1.1 g/dL suggests malignancy, infection, or pancreatitis** [^1153r1oP] [^1137WuCd]. Total protein helps refine etiology: **> 2.5 g/dL favors cardiac or malignant ascites**; **< 1.5 g/dL in cirrhosis increases SBP risk** [^111KuzhC] [^116pba1m]. PMN > 250/mm³ diagnoses SBP; bedside inoculation improves culture yield [^1114zpPx] [^114Qadwe]. Always interpret results in clinical context and repeat paracentesis if the course is atypical or the response is suboptimal [^1131FfV3].

## Indications for paracentesis

Paracentesis is indicated for both **diagnostic and therapeutic** purposes:

- **Diagnostic indications**: New-onset ascites, unexplained encephalopathy, suspected infection (SBP), or worsening ascites in hospitalized patients [^1135CgdZ] [^114fDbhH].

- **Therapeutic indications**: Symptomatic relief from large-volume ascites, refractory ascites, or respiratory compromise [^112Ng1wK] [^113MXKL3].

---

## Essential laboratory tests and their interpretation

### Serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG)

- **Definition**: SAAG = serum albumin − ascitic albumin [^113Ljg1Q].

- **Interpretation**: SAAG ≥ 1.1 g/dL indicates portal hypertension (e.g. cirrhosis, heart failure, Budd-Chiari); SAAG < 1.1 g/dL suggests non-portal causes (e.g. malignancy, infection, pancreatitis) [^1153r1oP] [^1137WuCd].

- **Limitations**: SAAG is less reliable in mixed ascites or after recent paracentesis [^notfound].

---

### Total protein concentration

Total protein helps distinguish cardiac or malignant ascites (** > 2.5 g/dL**) from cirrhotic ascites (** < 2.5 g/dL**) and identifies patients at **higher SBP risk** when **< 1.5 g/dL** [^116pba1m] [^111KuzhC].

---

### Cell count and differential

- **Polymorphonuclear (PMN) count**: PMN > 250 cells/mm³ diagnoses SBP; repeat paracentesis at 48 hours if the response is inadequate [^1114zpPx] [^1131FfV3].

- **Total leukocyte count**: Elevated counts support infection or inflammation but are nonspecific [^notfound].

---

### Ascitic fluid culture

Bedside inoculation into **blood culture bottles** increases yield to > 90% [^116i32Wu]; **culture-negative SBP** is common, so PMN count remains the diagnostic standard [^116iQsaf].

---

## Additional tests based on clinical suspicion

| **Clinical suspicion** | **Recommended test** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Malignancy | Cytology, CEA, CA 19–9 | Positive cytology or elevated markers suggest malignant ascites [^111KuzhC] |
| Pancreatitis | Amylase, lipase | Levels > 3× serum suggest pancreatic ascites [^notfound] |
| Tuberculosis | ADA, AFB smear/culture | ADA > 40 IU/L supports TB; smear/culture are insensitive [^1116aGS6] |
| Chylous ascites | Triglycerides | > 200 mg/dL confirms chylous ascites [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Portal hypertensive ascites**: Manage with salt restriction, diuretics, and consider TIPS for refractory cases [^1111AaRS] [^11327JZX].

- **Non-portal ascites**: Treat underlying cause (e.g. chemotherapy for malignancy, antituberculous therapy, pancreatic duct intervention) [^notfound].

- **SBP**: Start empiric antibiotics (e.g. cefotaxime) and administer albumin to prevent renal failure [^111RuPDB].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Interpretation can be confounded by **mixed ascites**, recent paracentesis, or **sample handling issues**. Clinical judgment and, when needed, **repeat paracentesis** help mitigate these limitations [^1131FfV3].

---

Paracentesis studies are interpreted by integrating **SAAG, total protein, cell count, and culture** to distinguish portal hypertensive from non-portal ascites, diagnose SBP, and guide therapy. Always interpret results in clinical context and repeat paracentesis if the course is atypical or the response is suboptimal [^1177Wn5b] [^1131FfV3].

Context

Abdominal paracenteses are performed in patients with ascites, most commonly to assess for infection or portal hypertension and to manage refractory ascites.

Objectives

To systematically review evidence for paracentesis methods that may decrease risk of adverse events or improve diagnostic yield and to determine the accuracy of ascitic fluid analysis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension.

Data Sources

Relevant English-language studies from Medline (1966-April 2007) and EMBASE (1980-April 2007).

Study Selection

Paracentesis studies evaluating interventions (use of preprocedure coagulation parameters, needle type, insertion location, ultrasound guidance, bedside inoculation into blood culture bottles, and use of plasma expanders in therapeutic taps) for reducing adverse events or improving the diagnostic yield, and studies assessing the accuracy of ascitic fluid biochemical analyses for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension.

Data Extraction

For technique studies, data on intervention and outcome; and for diagnostic studies, data on parameters for diagnosing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and portal hypertension (ie, ascitic fluid white blood cell and polymorphonuclear leukocyte [PMN] count, ascitic fluid pH, blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient, and serum-ascites albumin gradient).

Data Synthesis

Thirty-seven studies met inclusion criteria: 2 showed that obtaining preprocedure coagulation was likely unnecessary prior to paracentesis; 1 showed the 15-gauge, 3.25-inch needle-cannula results in less multiple peritoneal punctures [P = 0.05] and termination due to poor fluid return [P = 0.02] vs a 14-gauge needle in therapeutic paracentesis; 1 showed immediate inoculation of culture bottles improves diagnostic yield vs delayed (from 77% to 100% [95% CI for the difference, 5.3%-40.0%]); 9 evaluated therapeutic paracentesis, performed with or without albumin or nonalbumin plasma expanders, and found no consistent effect on morbidity or mortality; 16 showed the accuracy of biochemical analysis of ascitic fluid in patients suspected of having spontaneous bacterial peritonitis to increase the likelihood of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (PMN count > 250 cells/µL [summary likelihood ratio {LR}, 6.4] 95% CI, 4.6–8.8; ascitic fluid leukocyte count > 1000 cells/µL [summary LR, 9.1] 95% CI, 5.5–15.1; pH < 7.35 [summary LR, 9.0] 95% CI, 2.0–40.6; or a blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient ≥ 0.10 [LR, 11.3] 95% CI, 4.3–29.9) and other levels lowered the likelihood (PMN count ≤ 250 cells/µL [summary LR, 0.2] 95% CI, 0.11–0.37; or a blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient < 0.10 [summary LR, 0.12] 95% CI, 0.02–0.77); and 4 showed the diagnostic accuracy of the serum-ascites albumin gradient lowers the likelihood of portal hypertension (< 1.1 g/dL [summary LR, 0.06] 95% CI, 0.02–0.20).

Conclusions

Ascitic fluid should be inoculated into blood culture bottles at the bedside. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is more likely at predescribed parameters of ascitic PMN count or blood-ascitic fluid pH, and portal hypertension is less likely below a predescribed serum-ascites albumin gradient.

Executive summary of recommendations

Diagnostic paracentesis in new- onset ascites 1.1. A diagnostic paracentesis is recommended in all patients with new-onset ascites. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.2. The initial ascitic fluid analysis should include total protein concentration and calculation of the serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.3. Ascites fluid analysis for cytology, amylase, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and adenosine deaminase should be considered based on pretest probability of specific diagnosis (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: weak)
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 2.1. Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without a delay to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis SBP) in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.2. A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.3. Ascitic neutrophil > 250/mm³ count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.4. Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.5. Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.6. A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.7. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong; Recommendation: strong) 2.8. Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.9. Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Dietary salt restriction 3.1. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should have a moderately salt restricted diet with daily salt intake of no more than 5–6.5 g (87–113 mmol sodium). This translates to a no added salt diet with avoidance of precooked meals. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 3.2. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should receive nutritional counselling on the sodium content in the diet. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Diuretics 4.1. In patients with the first presentation of moderate ascites, spironolactone monotherapy (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) is reasonable. In those with recurrent severe ascites, and if faster diuresis is needed (for example, if the patient is hospitalised), combination therapy with spironolactone (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) and furosemide (starting dose 40 mg, increased to 160 mg) is recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 4.2. All patients initiating diuretics should be monitored for adverse events. Almost half of those with adverse events require diuretic discontinuation or dose reduction. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.3. Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia during diuretic therapy should be managed by discontinuation of diuretics and expansion of plasma volume with normal saline. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.4. Fluid restriction to 1–1.5 L/day should be reserved for those who are clinically hypervolaemic with severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 125 mmol/L). (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.5. Hypertonic sodium chloride (3%) administration should be reserved for those who are severely symptomatic with acute hyponatraemia. Serum sodium should be slowly corrected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.6. It may be appropriate to consider use of midodrine in refractory ascites on a case by case basis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Large volume paracentesis (LVP) 5.1. Patients should give informed consent for a therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 5.2. Ultrasound guidance should be considered when available during LVP to reduce the risk of adverse events (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 5.3. Routine measurement of the prothrombin time and platelet count before therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis and infusion of blood products are not recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Use of human albumin solution (HAS) 6.1. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of > 5 L is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 6.2. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) can be considered after paracentesis of < 5 L at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed in patients with ACLF or high risk of post-paracentesis acute kidney injury. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 6.3. In patients with SBP and an increased serum creatinine or a rising serum creatinine, infusion of 1.5 g albumin/kg within 6 hours of diagnosis, followed by 1 g/kg on day 3, is recommended. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) 7.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with refractory ascites. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 7.2. Caution is required if considering TIPSS in patients with age > 70 years, serum bilirubin > 50 µmol/L, platelet count < 75×10⁹/L, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score ≥ 18, current hepatic encephalopathy, active infection or hepatorenal syndrome. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Umbilical hernia 8.1. Suitability and timing of surgical repair of umbilical hernia should be considered in discussion with the patient and multidisciplinary team involving physicians, surgeons and anaesthetists. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Hepatic hydrothorax (HH) 9.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with HH after discussion with the multidisciplinary team. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 9.2. In patients with HH who are not undergoing a TIPSS and/or a liver transplant evaluation, alternative palliative interventions should be considered. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB) and ascites 10.1. Refractory ascites should not be viewed as a contraindication to NSBB. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 10.2. Patients with refractory ascites who are taking NSBB should be monitored closely, and dose reduction or discontinuation may be appropriate in those who develop hypotension or acute/progressive renal dysfunction.

Randomised controlled trials (RCT) with large sample size should evaluate the role of antibiotics in the secondary prophylaxis for SBP in ascites secondary to cirrhosis. 13.2. Large RCTs should assess the role of midodrine in the management of ascites. 13.3. Cost-effectiveness of long-term administration of albumin to patients with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites should be evaluated. 13.4. Role of nutritional interventions in the management of ascites should be evaluated. 13.5. Large RCT of long-term carvedilol versus no carvedilol in patients with refractory ascites without large oesophageal varices should be carried out. 13.6. Role of TIPSS in the management of hepatic hydrothorax should be compared with other therapeutic interventions. 13.7.

IN RECENT YEARS, numerous reports have appeared in the literature on the use of diagnostic paracentesis, particularly in cases of abdominal trauma and acute disease requiring surgery. In these reports, complication rates have been low and the use of this technique has been strongly advocated. Recently, we have encountered a patient in whom an erroneous diagnosis was made due to an abdominal paracentesis. It is our purpose to alert physicians to an error in technique that may lead to a false diagnosis and subsequent unnecessary laparotomy. Report of a Case A 20-year-old white man was admitted four hours after being involved in an automobile accident during which he was thrown against the steering wheel of his car. He had lost consciousness for approximately two minutes. Following the accident, the patient developed pain in the right upper abdominal quadrant and right anterior parts of the chest. He vomited once. Tindel S, Meyerowitz BR.

Recommendations

Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without a delay to rule out SBP in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Ascitic neutrophil > 250/mm³ count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate, Recommendation: strong)
Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong, Recommendation: strong)
Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)

Baseline characteristics of small versus large volume paracentesis.

The second analysis, aimed to identify predictors of a drop in HGB after paracentesis, used similar statistical methods. Baseline characteristics were summarized, stratified by HGB drop versus no HGB drop, and tested for statistical difference between the groups using the same methods. The same multivariable backwards stepwise method to create a mixed effects regression model was used to identify significant predictors of HGB drop, however a linear regression model was used as opposed to a logistic regression model, so the outcome was defined as drop in HGB g/dl as a continuous variable. Extreme values of change in HGB (> 10 g/dL) were excluded from linear regression as outliers. Linear regression was chosen instead of logistic regression because only 117 (5.8%) of patients had a significant HGB drop to avoid biasing the results in a logistic regression. Volume of fluid removed was also added to the multivariable regression to determine its effect on HGB drop.

### Recommendations on the use of ultrasound guidance for adult abdominal paracentesis: a position statement of the Society of Hospital Medicine [^116ghThQ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

1. We recommend that ultrasound guidance should be used for paracentesis to reduce the risk of serious complications, the most common being bleeding. 2. We recommend that ultrasound guidance should be used to avoid attempting paracentesis in patients with an insufficient volume of intraperitoneal free fluid to drain. 3. We recommend that ultrasound guidance should be used with paracentesis to improve the success rates of the overall procedure. 4. We recommend that ultrasound should be used to assess the volume and location of intraperitoneal free fluid to guide clinical decision making of where paracentesis can be safely performed. 5. We recommend that ultrasound should be used to identify a needle insertion site based on size of the fluid collection, thickness of the abdominal wall, and proximity to abdominal organs. 6. We recommend that the needle insertion site should be evaluated using color flow Doppler ultrasound to identify and avoid abdominal wall blood vessels along the anticipated needle trajectory. 7. We recommend that a needle insertion site should be evaluated in multiple planes to ensure clearance from underlying abdominal organs and detect any abdominal wall blood vessels along the anticipated needle trajectory. 8. We recommend that a needle insertion site should be marked with ultrasound immediately before performing the procedure, and the patient should remain in the same position between marking the site and performing the procedure. 9. We recommend that using real-time ultrasound guidance for paracentesis should be considered when the fluid collection is small or difficult to access. 10. We recommend that dedicated training sessions, including didactics, supervised practice on patients, and simulation-based practice, should be used to teach novices how to perform ultrasound-guided paracentesis. 11. We recommend that simulation-based practice should be used, when available, to facilitate acquisition of the required knowledge and skills to perform ultrasoundguided paracentesis. 12. We recommend that competence in performing ultrasound-guided paracentesis should be demonstrated prior to independently performing the procedure on patients.

### The untapped potential of ascites in ovarian cancer research and treatment [^111hBTmD]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

A challenge to be overcome when considering further work with this sample type is the variable capturing of ascites in tumour biobanks and clinical databases. Ascites and its contents are not routinely stored for downstream analysis in biorepositories, and volumes are often inconsistently recorded. As such, the possibility of retrospective or large-scale analysis of ascites samples is, at this stage, limited. However, an increased awareness of the potential of this substrate for research might encourage more comprehensive documentation and cataloguing of this valuable sample, which will serve to enhance research possibilities as they advance. Another challenge when working with ascites is that sample transfer to researchers might be prone to delay, as the samples are retrieved secondary to a patient's therapeutic paracentesis. As such, it is crucial to consider how the integrity of the samples is affected by time, to ensure that valid research can be performed. A standardised protocol for handling this unique biospecimen is warranted. Meeting these challenges will allow us to harness the full potential of this ascites and might provide the key for improving outcomes for this devastating disease.

### Plasma expanders for people with cirrhosis and large ascites treated with abdominal paracentesis [^115PJ6BY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Plasma volume expanders are used in connection to paracentesis in people with cirrhosis to prevent reduction of effective plasma volume, which may trigger deleterious effect on haemodynamic balance, and increase morbidity and mortality. Albumin is considered the standard product against which no plasma expansion or other plasma expanders, e.g. other colloids (polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch solutions, fresh frozen plasma), intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol have been compared. However, the benefits and harms of these plasma expanders are not fully clear.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of any plasma volume expanders such as albumin, other colloids (polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch solutions, fresh frozen plasma), intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol versus no plasma volume expander or versus another plasma volume expander for paracentesis in people with cirrhosis and large ascites.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index until January 2019. Furthermore, we searched FDA, EMA, WHO (last search January 2019), www.clinicaltrials.gov/, and www.controlled-trials.com/ for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials, no matter their design or year of publication, publication status, and language, assessing the use of any type of plasma expander versus placebo, no intervention, or a different plasma expander in connection with paracentesis for ascites in people with cirrhosis. We considered quasi-randomised, retrieved with the searches for randomised clinical trials only, for reports on harms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) using the fixed-effect model and the random-effects model meta-analyses, based on the intention-to-treat principle, whenever possible. If the fixed-effect and random-effects models showed different results, then we made our conclusions based on the analysis with the highest P value (the more conservative result). We assessed risks of bias of the individual trials using predefined bias risk domains. We assessed the certainty of the evidence at an outcome level, using GRADE, and constructed 'Summary of Findings' tables for seven of our review outcomes.

Main Results

We identified 27 randomised clinical trials for inclusion in this review (24 published as full-text articles and 3 as abstracts). Five of the trials, with 271 participants, assessed plasma expanders (albumin in four trials and ascitic fluid in one trial) versus no plasma expander. The remaining 22 trials, with 1321 participants, assessed one type of plasma expander, i.e. dextran, hydroxyethyl starch, polygeline, intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol versus another type of plasma expander, i.e. albumin in 20 of these trials and polygeline in one trial. Twenty-five trials provided data for quantitative meta-analysis. According to the Child-Pugh classification, most participants were at an intermediate to advanced stage of liver disease in the absence of hepatocellular carcinoma, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, infections, and hepatic encephalopathy. All trials were assessed as at overall high risk of bias. Ten trials seemed not to have been funded by industry; twelve trials were considered unclear about funding; and five trials were considered funded by industry or a for-profit institution. We found no evidence of a difference in effect between plasma expansion versus no plasma expansion on mortality (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.83; 248 participants; 4 trials; very low certainty); renal impairment (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.02 to 5.88; 181 participants; 4 trials; very low certainty); other liver-related complications (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.79 to 3.27; 248 participants; 4 trials; very low certainty); and non-serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.40; 158 participants; 3 trials; very low certainty). Two of the trials stated that no serious adverse events occurred while the remaining trials did not report on this outcome. No trial reported data on health-related quality of life. We found no evidence of a difference in effect between experimental plasma expanders versus albumin on mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.30; 1014 participants; 14 trials; very low certainty); serious adverse events (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.10 to 8.30; 118 participants; 2 trials; very low certainty); renal impairment (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.91; 1107 participants; 17 trials; very low certainty); other liver-related complications (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.48; 1083 participants; 16 trials; very low certainty); and non-serious adverse events (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.85; 977 participants; 14 trials; very low certainty). We found no data on heath-related quality of life and refractory ascites.

Authors' Conclusions

Our systematic review and meta-analysis did not find any benefits or harms of plasma expanders versus no plasma expander or of one plasma expander such as polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch, intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol versus albumin on primary or secondary outcomes. The data originated from few, small, mostly short-term trials at high risks of systematic errors (bias) and high risks of random errors (play of chance). GRADE assessments concluded that the evidence was of very low certainty. Therefore, we can neither demonstrate or discard any benefit of plasma expansion versus no plasma expansion, and differences between one plasma expander versus another plasma expander. Larger trials at low risks of bias are needed to assess the role of plasma expanders in connection with paracentesis. Such trials should be conducted according to the SPIRIT guidelines and reported according to the CONSORT guidelines.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^111KuzhC]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic paracentesis in new-onset ascites

Aspiration of ascitic fluid and its laboratory analysis is an essential step in the management of patients with newly diagnosed ascites. In cirrhosis, hepatic sinusoids are less permeable owing to fibrous tissue deposition, resulting in ascites with low protein content. It is important to estimate total protein level in ascites fluid; a concentration below 1.5 g/dL (or 15 g/L) is a risk factor for the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In addition, serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) should be estimated routinely. A cut-off point of 1.1 g/dL (or 11 g/L) differentiates between causes of ascites with high sensitivity, although alternative causes should be considered based on the clinical scenario (table 1).

Table 1
Grouping of aetiology of ascites based on serum albumin ascites gradient (SAAG)

Hepatic sinusoids are normally permeable in heart failure, which allows for leakage of protein-rich lymph into the abdominal cavity and therefore, total protein concentration in ascitic fluid is high (> 2.5 g/dL) in combination with a high SAAG. In such a situation, measurement of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the serum ± ascites is useful. Total protein concentrations > 2.5 g/dL within the ascites and serum BNP > 364 ng/L are suggestive of underlying or additional cardiac disease, whereas serum protein values < 182 ng/L rule out cardiac disease.

In low SAAG states, clinical context and imaging should guide the investigational approach. The yield for positive cytology in the context of malignancy is variable, ranging from 0% to 96.7%, in part determined by the site of the tumour. Combining cytology with tumour markers in the ascitic fluid may increase the positive predictive value (PPV), specifically the use of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), CA 15–3 and CA 19–9. However, CA 125 in the serum or ascites has no role as a discriminator and will commonly be elevated by the presence of ascites from any cause.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^114fLvXr]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Recommendations

Approximately one-third of albumin is used for patients with cirrhosis, and although this practice is exceedingly common, the certainty of evidence supporting this therapy in this population is insufficient to allow for strong recommendations. Although the use of albumin for large-volume paracentesis is a commonly accepted clinical practice and is endorsed by guidelines, the reported trials have important limitations that affect the certainty in outcomes. These trials included a small number of patients and findings for most patient-important outcomes (mortality, kidney dysfunction) were imprecise, leaving residual uncertainty regarding true clinical benefits and harms. Albumin, as compared with other fluid expanders, may be superior for the prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (rise in serum renin level on the sixth day after paracentesis), but whether this translates to improvement in patient-important outcomes is less certain. Plasma renin levels are predictive of greater morbidity in patients with cirrhosis. The panel suggested continuing this commonly accepted practice for patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis, but believed the data supported only a conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence. Further trials are needed urgently to clarify if albumin improves patient important outcomes, to elucidate the optimal dosing strategy, to further the understanding of the safety profile of the treatment, and to evaluate alternative fluids and therapies. It is unclear if improving laboratory measures of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction will translate into reductions in renal failure, hospital admission, or other patient-important outcomes. The panel also highlighted the need to personalize the use of albumin, the dose after paracentesis, or both, considering the patient's baseline creatinine, volume of ascites removed, and history of hypotensive symptoms after prior procedures.

### Physician clinical impression does not rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients undergoing emergency department paracentesis [^117VcRDt]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We determine whether clinical characteristics and physician assessment are useful in the exclusion of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in emergency department (ED) patients with ascites requiring paracentesis.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, observational study of ED patients with ascites undergoing paracentesis. Predefined clinical characteristics including historical features and ED vital signs were recorded. Each patient was assessed by 2 separate, blinded physicians for severity of abdominal tenderness and overall clinical suspicion for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The primary outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LR) of the individual clinical characteristics and the physician assessments. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was defined by absolute neutrophil count greater than 250 cells/mm³ or positive fluid culture result.

Results

There were 285 separate physician assessments in 144 patients enrolled with complete data. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was diagnosed in 17 (11.8%) patients. Physician clinical impression had a sensitivity of 76% (95% confidence interval [CI] 62% to 91%) and specificity of 34% (95% CI 28% to 40%) for the detection of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The lowest negative LR was associated with the presence of any abdominal pain or tenderness (negative LR = 0.4); however, the presence of pain/tenderness was also observed in 85% of patients without spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Six patients (4.2%) with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis had at least 1 physician assessment of little to no risk for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and 3 of the 6 subsequently died during their hospitalization.

Conclusion

Clinical characteristics and physician assessment were insufficient in the diagnosis or exclusion of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in the ED patient undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic paracentesis. This finding supports routine laboratory fluid analysis after ED paracentesis.

### Effects of paracentesis on hemodynamic parameters and respiratory function in critically ill patients [^114dPJEu]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Given the fact, that all hemodynamic parameters were stable 6 hours after the end of paracentesis and that vasopressor dependency index did not change statistically significantly, LVP seems to be a safe procedure regarding circulatory function.

Regarding the positive impact of paracentesis on respiratory function, an improvement of oxygenation (while PaCO₂ remained unchanged) was also observed in a previous study. These positive effects regarding respiratory function are most likely due to improved respiratory mechanics as a consequence of a paracentesis-induced reduction of intraabdominal pressure. The fact that paracentesis caused a significant improvement of dynamic respiratory system compliance in mechanically ventilated patients is also indicative for a decreased intraabdominal pressure following paracentesis. These findings are in accordance with the results from a recent study by Levesque and colleagues in 31 mechanically ventilated cirrhotic patients demonstrating a significant decrease in intraabdominal pressure, improvement of oxygenation, and an increase in end-expiratory lung volume after LVP. The improvement of dynamic respiratory system compliance, LIS, and PaO₂/FiO₂ in mechanically ventilated patients demonstrates the possibility to reduce ventilator associated lung injury by removal of ascites in these patients.

The median urine output on the day after paracentesis was significantly higher compared with the day before the intervention. This indicates, as described before by our group and others, that paracentesis might help to improve renal function. The increase of urine output on the day after paracentesis despite a negative fluid balance on the day of paracentesis indicates that the reduction of intraabdominal pressure – besides possible humoral effects – is causative for the improvement of renal function.

Limitations of the study

There are several limitations of our study that need to be mentioned. In general, since we studied a limited number of paracenteses in a monocentric study, the results of our study need to be interpreted with caution. Especially the number of patients on mechanical ventilation is relatively low in our study. In addition, documentation of intraabdominal pressure before and after paracentesis is not routinely performed and therefore not available for data analysis. Finally, albumin substitution after paracentesis was at the discretion of the treating ICU physician and was not performed strictly adhering to international guidelines.

### The practice and implications of finding fluid during point-of-care ultrasonography: a review [^112h38if]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) is an increasingly affordable and portable technology that is an important part of 21st-century medicine. When appropriately used, POCUS has the potential to expedite diagnosis and improve procedural success and safety. POCUS is now being adopted in medical education as early as the first year of medical school. While potentially powerful and versatile, POCUS is a user-dependent technology that has not been formalized or standardized yet within internal medicine residency training programs. Physicians and residency directors are trying to determine whether to incorporate POCUS, and if so, how. In this systematic review, basic concepts and applications of POCUS are examined, as are issues surrounding training and implementation.

Observations

A key use of POCUS is to detect fluid, and this is a cornerstone of POCUS teaching. Even in inexperienced hands, POCUS has shown to be more sensitive and specific than physical examination for conditions such as ascites, pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion. Detecting fluid requires a basic understanding of ultrasonography operation, sonographic anatomy, and probe orientation. Once fluid is localized, ultrasonographic guidance can increase success and decrease complications of common procedures such as thoracentesis or paracentesis.

Conclusions and Relevance

POCUS can augment physical examination and procedural efficacy but requires appropriate education and program setup. As POCUS continues to spread, internal medicine physicians need to clarify how they intend to use this technology. Equipment is now increasingly accessible, but programs need to determine how to allocate time and resources to training, clinical use, and quality assurance. Programs that develop robust implementation processes that establish proper scope of practice and include quality assurance that use image archival and feedback can ensure POCUS will positively impact patient care across hospital systems.

### Deterioration in quality of life (QoL) in patients with malignant ascites: results from a phase II / III study comparing paracentesis plus catumaxomab with paracentesis alone [^116mwQo9]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

study end points

Patients' HRQL was measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 items (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaire at screening, 1, 3 and 7 months after treatment and in the case of therapeutic ascites re-puncture on the day of paracentesis. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a well-recognised HRQL questionnaire designed for use in a wide range of cancer patient populations and considered as a reliable and valid measure of HRQL. It was also shown to be appropriate for the evaluation of symptom relief after paracentesis in symptomatic ascites. The EORTC QLQ-C30 was developed to measure the HRQL of cancer patients participating in international clinical trials; it has thus been translated into and validated in more than 80 different languages. It includes 30 items grouped into 6 functional and quality of life (QoL) scales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, social functioning and global QoL), and 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnoea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea and financial impact). All scores range from 0 to 100, with a higher score corresponding to a better level of functioning or QoL for the functional and QoL scales, and to a higher level of symptoms for the symptom scales. Thresholds for the interpretation of EORTC QLQ-C30 scores were established by Osoba et al.: a change in the score from 5 to 10 can be interpreted as a small change in the HRQL, a change in the score from 10 to 20 can be interpreted as a moderate change in the HRQL and a change in the score above 20 can be interpreted as a large change in the HRQL. Reference values have been published for QLQ-C30 scores by the EORTC QoL group for all cancer types grouped together.

Fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnoea, sleep disturbance and appetite loss symptoms are the common symptoms associated with MA and were considered of primary importance for MA patients. Emotional and global QoL scores were also considered of primary interest in this study as Husain et al. highlighted the importance of measuring HRQL and emotional symptoms, such as depression and anxiety, in studies conducted on MA.

### Management of ascites: expert panel narrative review [^117WEX5C]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ascites can develop in the setting of a variety of pathologies. The approach to treatment depends on accurate determination of the underlying cause, for which fluid analysis plays a central role. In particular, the serum-ascites-albumin gradient serves as a primary diagnostic test for differentiating among causes, with certain additional fluid tests performed based on clinical suspicion. Treatment options range from nonspecific fluid removal, including large-volume paracentesis and tunneled peritoneal catheters, to targeted therapies (e.g., diuretics, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and lymphangiography). Societal guidelines exist for the approach to cirrhotic ascites, but the management of other less common causes remains less well defined. The goal of this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review is to provide guidance for the diagnosis and management of ascites, based on available evidence and the authors' clinical experience.

### Paracentesis is associated with reduced mortality in patients hospitalized with cirrhosis and ascites [^111aXzxq]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Diagnostic paracentesis is recommended for patients with cirrhosis who are admitted to the hospital for ascites or encephalopathy. However, it is not known whether clinicians in the United States adhere to this recommendation; a relationship between paracentesis and clinical outcome has not been reported. We analyzed a U.S. database to determine the frequency of paracentesis and its association with mortality.

Methods

The 2009 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (which contains data from approximately 8 million hospital discharges each year) was used to identify patients with cirrhosis and ascites who were admitted with a primary diagnosis of ascites or encephalopathy. In-hospital mortality, length of stay, and hospital charges were compared for those who did and did not undergo paracentesis. Outcomes were compared for those who received an early paracentesis (within 1 day of admission) and those who received one later.

Results

Of 17,711 eligible admissions, only 61% underwent paracentesis. In-hospital mortality was reduced by 24% among patients who underwent paracentesis (6.5% vs 8.5%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–0.74). Most paracenteses (66%) occurred ≤ 1 day after admission. In-hospital mortality was lower among patients who received early paracentesis than those who received it later (5.7% vs 8.1%, P = 0.049), although this difference was not significant after adjustment for confounders (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.78–2.02). Among patients who underwent paracentesis, the mean hospital stay was 14% longer and hospital charges were 29% greater than for patients who did not receive the procedure.

Conclusions

Paracentesis is underused for patients admitted to the hospital with ascites; the procedure is associated with increased short-term survival. These data support practice guidelines derived from expert opinion. Studies are needed to identify barriers to guideline adherence.

### Early diagnostic paracentesis improves outcomes of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112mQfR9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic paracentesis is recommended for patients with cirrhosis admitted to the hospital, but adherence is suboptimal with unclear impact on clinical outcomes. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the outcomes of early vs delayed diagnostic paracentesis among hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites.

Methods

We searched multiple databases for studies comparing early vs delayed diagnostic paracentesis among hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and mean difference with confidence intervals (CIs) for proportional and continuous variables were calculated using the random-effects model. Early diagnostic paracentesis was defined as receiving diagnostic paracentesis within 12–24 hours of admission. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay, acute kidney injury, and 30-day readmission.

Results

Seven studies (n = 78,744) (n = 45,533 early vs n = 33,211 delayed diagnostic paracentesis) were included. Early diagnostic paracentesis was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46–0.82, P = 0.001), length of hospital stay (mean difference -4.85 days; 95% CI -6.45 to -3.20; P < 0.001), and acute kidney injury (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42–0.92, P = 0.02) compared with delayed diagnostic paracentesis, with similar 30-day readmission (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.52–2.39, P = 0.79). Subgroup analysis revealed consistent results for in-hospital mortality whether early diagnostic paracentesis performed within 12 hours (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.32–0.79, P = 0.003, I² = 0%) or within 24 hours of admission (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45–0.98, P = 0.04, I² = 82%). Notably, the mortality OR was numerically lower when diagnostic paracentesis was performed within 12 hours, and the results were precise and homogenous (I² = 0%).

Discussion

Findings from this meta-analysis suggest that early diagnostic paracentesis is associated with better patient outcomes. Early diagnostic paracentesis within 12 hours of admission may be associated with the greatest mortality benefit. Data from large-scale randomized trials are needed to validate our findings, especially if there is a greater mortality benefit for early diagnostic paracentesis within 12 hours.

### Pancreatic ascites: update on diagnosis and management [^1137WuCd]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic paracentesis

Paracentesis is considered the gold standard for diagnosing pancreatic ascites and has a therapeutic effect on patients. The diagnostic criteria for pancreatic ascites include an amylase concentration > 1000 mg/dL, a protein level of > 3 g/dL, and a serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) < 1.1 g/dL. First proposed by Dr. John C. Hoefs in 1981, SAAG can help clinicians determine whether ascites is due to portal hypertension or to other causes. The SAAG is calculated by subtracting the ascitic albumin concentration from the serum concentration. SAAG > 1.1 g/dL is transudative in nature and indicates portal hypertension etiology, which may include cirrhosis, heart failure, portal vein occlusion, Budd-Chiari syndrome and hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. In contrast, an SAAG < 1.1 g/dL is considered exudative, insidious, and often due to peritoneal disease. Common causes include infectious peritonitis, chylous ascites, malignancy, nephrotic syndrome and pancreatic ascites. However, SAAG < 1.1 g/dL alone is not diagnostic for either condition.

Similarly to amylase and albumin levels, lipase enzyme level tends to be elevated in pancreatic ascites. Lactate dehydrogenase is typically elevated in pancreatic ascites; however, it can also be elevated in malignant ascites and tuberculous peritonitis. Tumor markers such as alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, and cancer antigen 125 help rule out peritoneal carcinomatosis and malignancy. Fluid cytology and culture are usually negative in pancreatic ascites, particularly in the absence of abscesses or infected pseudocysts. Pancreatic ascites is typically straw-colored in appearance, although isolated cases of black or bloody ascites have also been reported.

statistical analysis

For each EORTC QLQ-C30 score, deterioration in HRQL was defined as a decrease in the score from screening of at least five points, the threshold proposed by Osoba et al. as a small but meaningful change in HRQL. Time to first deterioration in HRQL was then analysed using survival methods with the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for the baseline value of the EORTC QLQ-C30 score, country and primary tumour type. Patients with no deterioration in EORTC QLQ-C30 scores were censored at the end of study, re-puncture time or death time.

A sensitivity analysis was conducted using a decrease of 10 points to define deterioration in HRQL. Analyses were conducted on all randomised patients who completed at least one item of the EORTC QLQ-C30 at screening (Full QoL analysis set, FQoLAS). Sensitivity analyses were also conducted on all patients who received at least one dose of treatment in the catumaxomab group or all randomised patients in the control group, and who completed at least one item of the EORTC QLQ-C30 at screening (Safety QoL analysis set, SQoLAS). All analyses were carried out using SAS software for Windows version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^1116aGS6]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Where peritoneal TB is considered plausible, ascites can be sent for acid-fast bacilli smear and culture, although culture positivity occurs in < 50% and smear-positive ascites is rare. Adenosine deaminase is more useful to distinguish between peritoneal TB and carcinomatosis, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98; adenosine deaminase levels of < 40 IU/mL are used to exclude TB.

Pancreatic ascites is a rare complication of pancreatitis, although more common when a pseudocyst is present. In pancreatic ascites, the amylase level in the ascitic fluid is typically > 1000 IU/L or greater than six times the serum amylase, with mean values exceeding 4000 IU/L in a recent cohort of 80 patients. Raised polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) count may also be found in pancreatic ascites.

The ascitic fluid samples required from the diagnostic paracentesis is summarised in figure 2.

### Paracentesis outcomes from a medicine procedure service at a tertiary care transplant center [^111LFMS9]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Bedside paracentesis is a commonly performed procedure across various patient care settings. Overall, this is considered a safe procedure with a low likelihood of complication rates, estimated to be less than 2%. Given the low prevalence of complications, outcomes data from different settings is often combined to reach statistical power to detect factors contributing to adverse outcomes or complications. This could miss certain clinical factors unique to hospitalized patients.

Additionally, some outcomes data from older studies were published before current standards regarding IV albumin infusion or point‐of‐care ultrasound coalesced. Few studies investigate the experience of primary operator, which could also have an effect on procedural risk. Furthermore, outcomes data also precede the adoption of medicine procedure services (MPS).

While complication rates from paracenteses are low, it can be fatal or life‐threatening, requiring additional procedures. A systematic review noted 40% of hemorrhagic complications required a surgical (35%) or IR (65%) intervention, with mortality rates as high as 43% from paracentesis‐associated hemorrhage. Additionally, some complications can be days to a week after paracentesis in rare instances, which may lead to missed detection and underestimate true complication rates.

We aimed to evaluate complication rates and outcomes of paracentesis in patients in the inpatient setting of a large tertiary transplantation center. We included patients with decompensated cirrhosis with high MELD scores that are at a perceived higher risk of procedural complications. We also included patients with other reasons for ascites, including cardiogenic ascites, which is not captured in prior literature. Additionally, we evaluated operator outcomes data from our MPS, consisting of residents and a supervising hospitalist attending, who perform bedside procedures utilizing a standardized technique.

### Treatment for ascites in adults with decompensated liver cirrhosis: a network meta-analysis [^1173NWrF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 20% of people with cirrhosis develop ascites. Several different treatments are available; including, among others, paracentesis plus fluid replacement, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts, aldosterone antagonists, and loop diuretics. However, there is uncertainty surrounding their relative efficacy.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different treatments for ascites in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the different treatments for ascites according to their safety and efficacy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until May 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis and ascites.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and ascites. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the odds ratio, rate ratio, and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance.

Main Results

We included a total of 49 randomised clinical trials (3521 participants) in the review. Forty-two trials (2870 participants) were included in one or more outcomes in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies, without other features of decompensation, having mainly grade 3 (severe), recurrent, or refractory ascites. The follow-up in the trials ranged from 0.1 to 84 months. All the trials were at high risk of bias, and the overall certainty of evidence was low or very low. Approximately 36.8% of participants who received paracentesis plus fluid replacement (reference group, the current standard treatment) died within 11 months. There was no evidence of differences in mortality, adverse events, or liver transplantation in people receiving different interventions compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement (very low-certainty evidence). Resolution of ascites at maximal follow-up was higher with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (HR 9.44; 95% CrI 1.93 to 62.68) and adding aldosterone antagonists to paracentesis plus fluid replacement (HR 30.63; 95% CrI 5.06 to 692.98) compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement (very low-certainty evidence). Aldosterone antagonists plus loop diuretics had a higher rate of other decompensation events such as hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and variceal bleeding compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement (rate ratio 2.04; 95% CrI 1.37 to 3.10) (very low-certainty evidence). None of the trials using paracentesis plus fluid replacement reported health-related quality of life or symptomatic recovery from ascites.

Funding

the source of funding for four trials were industries which would benefit from the results of the study; 24 trials received no additional funding or were funded by neutral organisations; and the source of funding for the remaining 21 trials was unclear.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on very low-certainty evidence, there is considerable uncertainty about whether interventions for ascites in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis decrease mortality, adverse events, or liver transplantation compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis and ascites. Based on very low-certainty evidence, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and adding aldosterone antagonists to paracentesis plus fluid replacement may increase the resolution of ascites compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement. Based on very low-certainty evidence, aldosterone antagonists plus loop diuretics may increase the decompensation rate compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^1148hJci]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound guidance

Use of ultrasound guidance may reduce the adverse events related to LVP. In a study involving 1297 procedures, 723 (56%) with ultrasound guidance and 574 (44%) without where the indications for paracentesis were similar between the two groups, the incidence of adverse events was lower in the ultrasound-guided procedures. In another retrospective cohort study, 0.8% of 565 patients undergoing paracentesis experienced bleeding complications. After adjustment, ultrasound guidance was associated with lower risk of bleeding complications by 68%.

Recommendations

Patients should give informed consent for a therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Ultrasound guidance should be considered when available during LVP to reduce the risk of adverse events. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Routine measurement of the prothrombin time and platelet count before therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis and infusion of blood products are not recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate and Recommendation: strong)

### Quantitative modeling of the physiology of ascites in portal hypertension [^114x2snw]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

How the above described systemic changes translate into ascites accumulation is poorly understood at the quantitative level, and, in fact, is seldom discussed (as illustrated by the above quote). As a result, several clinically important observations remain unexplained. For example, how do the systemic alterations induced by salt restriction and diuretics lead to a reduction in ascites and why does the commonly employed measurement of plasma-ascitic fluid albumin gradient accurately diagnose portal hypertension. In an attempt to better understand the physiology of ascites, we present what appears to be the first quantitative model of the formation and removal of ascitic fluid. In this model, ascites accumulation is explained solely by pathophysiological alterations within the peritoneal cavity; systemic abnormalities are considered relevant only to the extent that they alter intraperitoneal physiology. Insights derived from this model may provide answers to previously unexplained clinical observations in patients with ascites.

Section I of the Discussion provides a brief quantitative description of the factors involved in fluid balance in the peritoneal space of normal subjects. Section II presents an analysis of the pathological abnormalities in the peritoneal cavity that are involved in the accumulation of ascites. This discussion includes mechanistic explanations for several clinically important, but poorly understood phenomena. Finally, in Section III, using a reasonable set of assumptions, a quantitative physical model describing ascites accumulation is developed and discussed. This model accurately predicts the magnitude and time course of the changes in ascites volume that are observed clinically with diuretic treatment or paracentesis. In sections I-III we have focused on the key factors and main supporting experimental results. The attached Additional file 1 (Section A), provides a more detailed discussion of the evidence supporting (or contradicting) the model's assumptions.

### Clinical outcomes after bedside and interventional radiology paracentesis procedures [^117B7PZU]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Increasingly, paracentesis procedures are performed in interventional radiology (IR) rather than at the bedside. No guidelines exist to aid decision-making about the best location, and patient outcomes are unknown. Our aims were to develop a prediction model for which location (bedside vs IR) clinicians select for inpatient paracentesis procedures, and to compare clinical outcomes.

Methods

We performed an observational medical records review of all paracentesis procedures performed on the hepatology service of an 894-bed urban tertiary care hospital from July 2008 through December 2011. We developed a prediction model to determine factors for IR referral. Clinical outcomes including blood product transfusions, intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, hospital length of stay, inpatient mortality, 30-day readmission, and emergency department visit within 30 days of discharge were compared between patients who had bedside versus IR procedures.

Results

Five hundred two patients who underwent a paracentesis were included in the analysis. Being female, higher body mass index, lower volume of ascites removed, and attending physician of record predicted the probability of IR referral. IR referrals were associated with 1.86 additional hospital days (P = 0.003). Platelet and fresh frozen plasma transfusions were more common in patients who underwent IR procedures (odds ratio [OR] 4.56; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.13–9.78 and OR 4.07; 95% CI, 2.03–8.18, respectively). Subsequent ICU transfers also were more common among patients who had IR procedures (OR 2.21; 95% CI, 1.13–4.31). All other clinical outcomes were similar between groups.

Conclusions

The decision to perform a paracentesis procedure at the bedside or in IR is largely discretionary. Paracentesis procedures performed at the bedside result in equal or better patient outcomes. Clinicians should receive the training needed to perform paracentesis procedures safely at the bedside. Large prospective studies are needed to confirm the findings of this study and inform national practice patterns.

### Paracentesis outcomes from a medicine procedure service at a tertiary care transplant center [^111y2Y7Z]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Bedside paracentesis still remains a relatively low‐risk procedure when utilizing ultrasound. However, when complications do occur, it is often associated with high morbidity. We found that post‐paracentesis AKI risk is not affected by the volume of ascites removed, but it is heightened in patients with higher MELD‐Na scores and when performed in patients already experiencing clinical deterioration. Additionally, the risk of hemorrhagic complications remained low in our cohort, but interestingly higher rates were seen in patients with elevated AST levels and those that had larger pockets of ascites pre‐procedure and larger volumes removed.

### Assessment of false-negative ascites cytology in epithelial ovarian carcinoma: a study of 313 patients [^11158oZA]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to determine how often peritoneal cytology is positive for malignancy in women with known ovarian cancer. Knowing this fact would help determine the usefulness of diagnostic paracentesis.

Methods

Records of all women diagnosed with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer from 2004 to 2012 were examined to correlate presence of ascites, cytologic, and pathologic findings.

Results

A total of 313 patients were included in analysis. A total of 210 of 313 patients (67.1%) with ascites had cytology positive for malignancy. This left 103 patients with ascites and cancer without malignant cells found in the ascites removed at the time of surgery.

Conclusions

Except in a few cases, paracentesis is not recommended for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer because of the potential spreading of cancer. Furthermore, with only just over two thirds of cases of known cancer and ascites having cytology positive for malignancy, the value of paracentesis for diagnosis of ovarian cancer is minimal.

### Daily low-volume paracentesis and clinical complications in patients with refractory ascites… [^113FgLPp]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Categorical data were analyzed using χ2 or McNemar testing, respectively. PSM was performed with nearest neighbor matching and a caliper of 0.
25. Standardized mean differences were used to assess balance before and after matching. Time-to-event analysis was conducted with Fine and Gray's competing risk analysis or log-rank testing. Using the Youden-Index, a cutoff of 1. 5 L/d was identified to estimate any complication within 90-day. The cutoff of 1. 5 L/d or more was used for further analysis. All patients with daily paracentesis of 1. 5 L/d or more were matched with the SOC cohort. Patients in the group with drainage of 1. 5 L/d or more received significantly less albumin per liter ascites drained within 90 days compared with the SOC cohort.

The rehospitalization rate was higher in patients with devices who performed paracentesis of 1. 5 L/d or more. Besides the increased incidence of clinical end points in patients with drainage of 1. 5 L/d or more, we observed a significant decrease of serum sodium while leucocyte count and C-reactive protein increased in patients with taps of

1. 5 L/d or more after 28 days, similar to patients undergoing LVP without albumin infusion. 10, 24 Interestingly, this was not the case in patients with daily drainage of 1. 5 L/d or less. In the setting of LVP without albumin substitution, postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction occurs frequently and is most likely the result of effective blood volume reduction. 13 PPCD is associated with AKI, hyponatremia, and decreased survival. 25 Repeated low-volume paracentesis of 1.

5 L/d or more might have led to a PPCD-like state over time and could explain the clinical observations in our cohort.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116i32Wu]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)/spontaneous bacterial empyema (SBE) evaluation — patients with ascites due to cirrhosis emergently admitted to the hospital should undergo a diagnostic abdominal paracentesis to rule out SBP even in the absence of symptoms/signs of infection, and patients with ascites who develop signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of infection should undergo workup for infection plus a diagnostic abdominal paracentesis (for cell count and bacteriological culture); if the workup is negative and the patient has a pleural effusion, the patient should undergo a diagnostic thoracentesis; the ascitic fluid should be cultured at the bedside in aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles before initiation of antibiotics, and bedside inoculation of at least 10 mL of the ascitic sample into blood culture bottles increases the sensitivity of the culture to > 90% in the diagnosis of SBP; the diagnosis of SBP/SBE is established with a fluid polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocyte count > 250/mm³.

These results reflect the correlation between the in vitro results and the clinical outcomes and further suggest the reliability of our personalised approach.

Our model system is based on the linkage and correlation between the ascites-derived PDAC cells and the clinical course of the correspondent patient. We have summarised the clinical characteristics of 33 patients that we successfully established primary cells cultures from the fluid obtained at palliative paracentesis/pleurocentesis (Supplementary Data, Supplementary Table 2). The clinical characteristics include: demographics, stage at diagnosis, metastatic sites, types and duration of treatments and germ-line mutation carrier status.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1131FfV3]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and spontaneous bacterial empyema (SBE) response assessment and duration are specified as follows: it is recommended that a diagnostic paracentesis (or thoracentesis for SBE) be performed 48 hours after initiating antibiotic therapy to assess response, and a negative response is defined by a decrease in PMN count < 25% from baseline that should prompt broadening antibiotics and evaluation for secondary peritonitis. The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy is 5–7 days, although a small study found therapy was shorter when discontinued once PMN decreased to < 250/mm³ (mean, 4.8 days) compared with empirically determined duration (mean, 9.6 days). Patients with ascites PMN < 250/mm³ and a positive bacteriological culture (bacterascites) without signs of infection should not receive antibiotics, and a repeat diagnostic paracentesis should be performed to investigate progression to SBP, while repeat paracentesis/thoracentesis may be unnecessary if an organism is isolated, is susceptible, and the patient is improving clinically.

### TIPS versus paracentesis for cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites [^11327JZX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Ten per cent of cirrhotic patients develop refractory ascites, which carries substantial morbidity and has a one-year survival of less than 50 per cent. Patients with refractory ascites may benefit from transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunts (TIPS).

Objectives

To compare TIPS versus paracentesis standard treatment in patients with refractory ascites due to cirrhosis with regard to overall short- and long-term mortality, treatment efficacy, and complications.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (July 2003), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials on The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2003), EMBASE (1980 to July 2003), and CINAHL (1982 to July 2003). We supplemented the searches with reading through scientific citations, review of citations in relevant primary articles, and hand-searched abstracts from national meetings.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials comparing TIPS and paracentesis with or without volume expanders for cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites.

Data Collection and Analysis

We evaluated the methodological quality of the randomised clinical trials by the generation of the allocation section, allocation concealment, and follow-up. Two independent observers extracted data from each trial. We contacted trial authors for additional information. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

Main Results

Four randomised clinical trials, including 264 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was moderate. Thirty-day mortality (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.10 to 10.06, P = 1.0) and 24-month mortality (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.66, P = 0.70) did not differ significantly between TIPS and paracentesis treatment. TIPS significantly reduced ascites re-accumulation at three months (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.18, P < 0.00001) and at 12 months follow-up (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.28, P < 0.00001). Hepatic encephalopathy occurred significantly more often in the TIPS group (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.66, P = 0.008). Gastrointestinal bleeding (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.84, P = 0.63), acute renal failure (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.72, P = 0.55), septicemia/infection (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.94, P = 0.96), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.84, P = 0.63) did not differ significantly between groups.

Reviewers' Conclusions

TIPS removed ascites more effectively than paracentesis. After 12 months, the beneficial effects of TIPS on ascites was still present. Mortality, gastrointestinal bleeding, septicemia/infection, acute renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation did not differ significantly between the two groups. Hepatic encephalopathy occurred significantly more often in the TIPS group.

### Emergency medicine updates: spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^113zjcZu]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common infection in patients with cirrhosis and ascites and is associated with significant risk of mortality. Therefore, it is important for emergency medicine clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this condition.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning SBP for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

SBP is commonly due to Gram-negative bacteria, but infections due to Gram-positive bacteria and multidrug resistant bacteria are increasing. The typical presentation of SBP includes abdominal pain, worsening ascites, fever, or altered mental status in a patient with known liver disease; however, some patients may be asymptomatic or present with only mild symptoms. Paracentesis is the diagnostic modality of choice and should be performed in any patient with ascites and concern for SBP or upper gastrointestinal bleeding, or in those being admitted for a complication of cirrhosis. Ultrasound should be used to optimize the procedure. An ascites absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 250 cells/mm³ is diagnostic of SBP. Ascitic fluid should be placed in blood culture bottles to improve the culture yield. Leukocyte esterase reagent strips can be used for rapid diagnosis if available. While many patients will demonstrate coagulation panel abnormalities, routine transfusion is not recommended. Management traditionally includes a third-generation cephalosporin, but specific patient populations may require more broad-spectrum coverage with a carbapenem or piperacillin-tazobactam. Albumin infusion is associated with reduced risk of renal impairment and mortality.

Conclusions

An understanding of literature updates can improve the care of patients with suspected SBP.

### The AIUM practice parameter for the performance of an ultrasound examination of the abdomen and / or retroperitoneum [^111UcaTF]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Peritoneal fluid — Evaluation for free or loculated peritoneal fluid should include documentation of the extent and location of any fluid identified, and assessment for ascites should include limited images of the pelvis as well as both lower quadrants/paracolic gutters; fluid localization for subsequent paracentesis can be performed by identifying an appropriate location. In the focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination, the objective of the abdominal portion is to screen the abdomen for free fluid, and longitudinal and transverse plane images should be obtained in the right upper quadrant through the area of the liver, left upper quadrant through the area of the spleen, along the bilateral paracolic gutters, and within the pelvis to assess for free fluid; analysis through a fluid-filled bladder (which may be filled through a catheter, when necessary) may help in evaluating the deep pelvis.

### EUS-guided paracentesis for the diagnosis of malignant ascites [^113A8PYU]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2006). Low credibility.

Background

EUS and EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) have well-defined roles in the diagnosis and staging of GI and pancreaticobiliary malignancy. Malignant ascites usually represents peritoneal carcinomatosis, increases disease stage, and portends a poor prognosis. There are limited data regarding the yield of EUS-guided paracentesis (EUS-P) for the diagnosis of malignant ascites.

Objective

To determine the usefulness of EUS-P for the diagnosis of malignant ascites.

Design

Prospective case series.

Setting

Tertiary referral academic center.

Patients

Those presenting for EUS examination for suspected or proven malignancy over a 16-month period were evaluated prospectively for the presence of ascites.

Interventions

EUS-P was performed via a transgastric or transduodenal approach if ascites was detected.

Main Outcome Measurements

Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of EUS-P for diagnosing malignant ascites.

Results

Six hundred twenty-nine patients were studied. Twenty-five patients with ascites who met inclusion criteria comprised the study cohort. The mean volume of ascites aspirated was 6.8 mL (range, 1–20 mL). Sixty-four percent (16 of 25) of EUS-P samples revealed malignant cytology. Of the group with negative ascitic cytology, 67% (6 of 9) had a proven malignancy. There was one false-negative cytology result. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of EUS-P for diagnosing malignant ascites was 94%, 100%, 100%, and 89%, respectively. The complication rate was 4%; 1 patient developed bacterial peritonitis after EUS-P.

Limitations

The study did not address cost savings in patient care based on the diagnosis of malignant ascites.

Conclusions

EUS-P is highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing malignant ascites. The finding of malignant ascites significantly alters patient management, so an active search for ascites and use of EUS-P should be incorporated into the diagnosis and staging of upper GI and pancreaticobiliary malignancy.

### Clinical impression and ascites appearance do not rule out bacterial peritonitis [^111qJ9Gn]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Previous research has demonstrated that physician clinical suspicion, determined without assessing fluid appearance, is not adequate to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) without fluid testing.

Study Objective

To determine the sensitivity of physician clinical suspicion, including a bedside assessment of fluid appearance, in the detection of SBP in Emergency Department (ED) patients undergoing paracentesis.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, observational study of ED patients with ascites undergoing paracentesis at three academic facilities. The enrolling physician recorded the clinical suspicion of SBP ("none", "low", "moderate", or "high"), and ascites appearance ("clear", "hazy", "cloudy", or "bloody"). SBP was defined as an absolute neutrophil count ≥ 250 cells/mm³, or culture pathogen growth. We defined "clear" ascites fluid as negative for SBP, and "hazy", "cloudy", or "bloody" as positive. A physician clinical suspicion of "none" or "low" was considered negative for SBP, and an assessment of "moderate" or "high" was considered positive. The primary outcome measure was sensitivity of physician clinical impression and ascites appearance for SBP.

Results

There were 348 cases enrolled, with SBP diagnosed in 43 (12%). Physician clinical suspicion had a sensitivity of 42% (95% confidence interval [CI] 29–55%) for the detection of SBP. Fluid appearance had a sensitivity of 72% (95% CI 58–83%).

Conclusion

Physician clinical impression, which included an assessment of fluid appearance, had poor sensitivity for the detection of SBP and cannot be used to exclude the diagnosis. Routine laboratory fluid analysis is indicated after ED paracentesis, even in patients considered to have a low degree of suspicion for SBP.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^112PX1Z2]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence Summary

We identified a 2019 Cochrane systematic review including 27 RCTs (N = 1,592) examining the use of any plasma volume expanders in patients with cirrhosis undergoing paracentesis. In general, enrolled patients were undergoing large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L), and the most commonly used albumin doses were either 6 to 8 g of albumin per 1 L of fluid removed or a standard dose of 20 to 40 g. Compared with no plasma expander, no statistically significant effect of using hyperoncotic (20%-25%) albumin on mortality (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.06–4.83), kidney impairment (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.02–5.88), or recurrence of ascites (RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.49–3.42) was found. Compared with hyperoncotic albumin, use of other fluids showed uncertain effects on mortality (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.82–1.30), kidney impairment (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.71–1.91), and recurrence of ascites (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.96–1.36). Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction was more frequent with nonalbumin plasma expanders (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.31–2.99) compared with albumin. A 2020 systematic review focused on the impact of different therapies (albumin, other fluids, vasoactive drugs) on the rate of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction and identified nine RCTs (N = 620). Albumin at a dose of 8 g/L was found to be superior to other volume expanders for the prevention of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (rise in plasma renin activity by ≥ 50% of baseline). Similar to the Cochrane review, uncertainty regarding the role of albumin as compared with alternative treatments was noted for the prevention of complications after paracentesis. RCTs comparing high-dose albumin (6–8 g/L of ascitic fluid removed) with low-dose albumin (2–4 g/L of ascitic fluid removed) found no difference in the rate of paracentesis associated circulatory dysfunction, although uncertainty exists regarding the risk to benefit profile of the two doses, given the small sample size (two studies [N = 120]; RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.22–4.49).

### Paracentesis outcomes from a medicine procedure service at a tertiary care transplant center [^112pUAGs]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Paracentesis is a commonly performed procedure with overall low complication rates. There is a paucity of modern data investigating outcomes for inpatients using standardized point of care ultrasound.

Objectives

We aimed to evaluate complication rates and outcomes of paracentesis in patients in the inpatient setting of a large tertiary transplantation center.

Methods

We identified patients with ascites of multiple etiologies undergoing paracentesis by a medicine procedure service at a university center. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify clinical and demographic factors associated with kidney injury (AKI) or significant HGB drop (≥ 2 g/dL).

Results

Of 1746 patients, 12% of patients receiving small volume (≤ 5 L) and 10% receiving large volume paracentesis (> 5 L) developed a post procedural AKI (OR 0.857, 95% CI: 0.633–1.154) with no significant difference between groups (p = .30). In multivariable analysis, Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease Sodium (MELD‐Na) score as a continuous variable had a more significant impact in the development of AKI (OR 1.15 CI 1.08–1.22, p < .001) as well as patients who were noted to be receiving paracentesis due to clinical deterioration (OR 2.48 CI 1.08–5.7, p < .03). Of 2034 patients, 94% of patients had no significant drop in hemoglobin (< 2 g/dL). There was no significant difference in BMI (12.73 vs. 16.68, p = .6), INR (1.6 vs. 1.6, p = .8), or platelet count (114 vs. 106, p > .9) between groups.

Conclusion

Regardless of volume of ascites removed, paracentesis is associated with a low risk of AKI, however there was an increased risk in the clinically decompensating patient. The bleeding risk was also found to be low when performed by experienced proceduralists on a procedure service.

### Laboratory investigation of peritoneal fluids: an updated practical approach based on the available evidence [^112Xjg6J]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Even though analysis of peritoneal fluids (PF) is often requested to medical laboratories for biochemical and morphological tests, there is still no mutual agreement on what the most appropriate way is to manage PF samples and which tests should be appropriately executed. In this update, we tried to identify the most useful tests for PF analysis to establish best practice indications. We performed a literature review and examined available guidelines to select the most appropriate tests by an evidence-based approach. Accordingly, the basic PF profile should include (1) serum to effusion albumin gradient and (2) automated cell counts with differential analysis. This profile allows to determine the PF nature, differentiating between 'high-albumin gradient' and 'low-albumin gradient' effusions, which helps to identify the pathophysiological process causing the ascites formation. Restricted to specific clinical situations, additional tests can be requested as follows: PF lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glucose, to exclude (LDH) or confirm (glucose) secondary bacterial peritonitis; PF total protein, to differentiate ascites of cardiac origin from other causes; PF (pancreatic) amylase, for the identification of pancreatic ascites; PF bilirubin, when a choleperitoneum is suspected; PF triglycerides, in differentiating chylous from pseudochylous ascites and PF creatinine, to detect intraperitoneal urinary leakage.

### Appropriate use criteria for lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid testing in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease [^116xVDPC]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2018). Medium credibility.

Research in context for lumbar puncture (LP) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing in Alzheimer's disease outlines methods, indications, and future work. Using the PICOTS framework, the Workgroup developed key research questions to guide a systematic review of the clinical literature on LP and CSF testing, conducted by the Evidence-based Practice Center at Oregon Health & Science University. Applying their interpretation of the evidence with clinical expertise and patient factors, the Workgroup developed 14 clinical indications to guide when LP and CSF analysis "should and should not be used to confirm or rule out AD pathology in the diagnostic process". The manuscript offers guidance on implementation and suggests areas for future research, including improved standardization of pre-analytical practices using new analytical platforms, large-scale patient populations with amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) or autopsy brain examination as reference standard, evidence generation on cognitively normal individuals with elevated amyloid, and research on best practices for disclosure of CSF biomarker data.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116LkawM]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Diagnosis and management of ascites in children — Ultrasonography is used to confirm the presence of ascites, differentiate abdominal distension due to fluid accumulation from that due to organomegaly, and identify important associated abnormalities (e.g., venous thromboses, kidney abnormalities). Although the indications for diagnostic paracentesis in children have been poorly defined, it has generally been recommended when the cause of ascites is unclear or when spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is suspected. Sodium intake of less than 2 mmol/kg per day is recommended for children with cirrhotic ascites; infants fed only with breast milk or infant formula feeds receive about 1 mmol/kg per day, and those taking weaning foods with no added salt will also fall within the 2 mmol/kg per day limit. Based on expert opinion and adult recommendations, water restriction is generally recommended when serum sodium is reduced ≤ 125 mEq/L. Diuretic therapy is commenced with spironolactone or spironolactone and furosemide in combination; a spironolactone dose range of 1–4 mg/kg per day is commonly used, typically starting with 1–2 mg/kg per day and escalating to higher dose as needed, with dose changes at 3 to 5-day intervals. Furosemide is started at 0.5 mg/kg per dose twice daily and increased as needed, and adequacy of diuretic therapy can be monitored as in adults by weight loss and by urine sodium estimation.

### Liver biopsy [^117LLBiT]. Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Ascites — little data are available to guide liver biopsy practice in patients with ascites; whether the risk of bleeding is increased is unclear. One study suggested that CT-guided or US-guided biopsy in patients with ascites was not associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Options include total therapeutic paracentesis performed immediately prior to palpation/percussion-guided transcutaneous biopsy or transvenous or laparoscopic biopsy.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to evaluation of ascites, AASLD 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain the following in the initial laboratory investigation of ascitic fluid:

- neutrophil count

- ascitic fluid total protein

- ascitic fluid albumin

- serum albumin (to calculate the serum-ascites albumin gradient).

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115HHZ9u]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Ascites — initial evaluation includes abdominal ultrasonography with Doppler, complete blood count, liver function tests (INR, serum total bilirubin, serum albumin), renal function tests (serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen), serum and urine electrolytes (Na, K) and urine analysis with spot urine protein, and ascitic fluid analysis with serum albumin ascites gradient (SAAG), total protein concentration, polymorphonuclear leukocyte count, and culture. For ascitic fluid interpretation, a serum albumin ascites gradient < 1.1 g/dL suggests other causes of ascites, while a high ascitic fluid protein (> 2.5 g/dL) supports a cardiac source for ascites; other tests of the ascitic fluid, such as amylase, cytology, or culture for mycobacteria, are not routinely indicated but should be guided by the patient's clinical context.

### Abdominal paracentesis… [^113MXKL3]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

The normal abdominal cavity has a small amount of fluid. Cirrhosis with associated portal hypertension. is the most common cause of ascites. Other causes of ascites include cancer, heart failure, kidney failure, tuberculosis, and pancreatic disease. An abdominal paracentesis involves the surgical puncture of the abdominal cavity with a needle and placement of a catheter line for the removal of excess fluid. The procedure can be diagnostic in helping identify the cause of ascites or may be used as a therapeutic measure if a large volume of fluid can be removed to lessen discomfort and improve breathing. The March 12. 2008, issue of JAMA includes an article about paracentesis techniques. It identifies ways to decrease the risk of complications and to improve diagnostic accuracy.

Patients with new-onset ascites Patients with chronic ascites and at least one of the following symptoms: Fever Abdominal pain Increasing ascites volume — increasing abdominal girth. Unexplained encephalopathy Declining liver function Kidney failure With current techniques, diagnostic paracentesis is considered a safe procedure. Some coagulopathies may make the procedure too risky to perform. Pregnancy, organomegaly, severe bowel or bladder distention, and previous abdominal-pelvic surgery may increase the risk of the procedure. In those situations, an ultrasound-guided paracentesis should be considered. Procedural complications are rare but can include.

Persistent leakage of ascitic fluid Circulatory problems, such as lowered blood pressure Localized infection at the puncture site Abdominal wall blood clots or bruises Bleeding Injury to organs in the abdomen Tests of the removed fluid help to establish the cause of the ascites and to rule out infection. These tests include counts of the numbers and types of cells in the fluid. Testing for albumin should be done in cases of new ascites. Additional tests may be done depending on the patient's history and physical examination.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111RuPDB]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) initial management — First-line empirical antibiotic therapy for community-acquired SBP/SBE is IV third-generation cephalosporin, whereas in patients with a health care–associated or nosocomial infection or recent exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics or who are admitted with sepsis or septic shock, empirical therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated as the first line. Response to empirical antibiotic therapy may be assessed by repeating diagnostic paracentesis/thoracentesis 2 days after initiation, and a decrease in fluid PMN < 25% from baseline indicates lack of response and should lead to broadening of antibiotic coverage and further evaluation to rule out secondary bacterial peritonitis. Patients with SBP should be treated with IV albumin in addition to antibiotics (1.5 g/kg at day 1 and 1 g/kg at day 3), and patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and/or jaundice at time of diagnosis of SBP are more likely to benefit from albumin. Nonselective beta blockers (NSBBs) should be temporarily held in patients with SBP who develop hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 65 mm Hg) or AKI.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of ascites, volume overload, and hyponatremia in cirrhosis: expert review [^1111AaRS]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update (CPU) is to summarize the available evidence and offer expert Best Practice Advice (BPA) on the management of ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, and hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board and Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. This CPU expert review underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through the standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These BPA statements were developed based on review of the published literature and expert opinion and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board. Because formal systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Patients with cirrhosis with ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, or volume overload should be managed with dietary sodium restriction and diuretics at the lowest effective dose, with dose escalation guided by symptoms, weight, urine output, and electrolyte/renal monitoring. Education and referral to a dietitian should be provided for dietary management. Triggers of liver decompensation should be identified and addressed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with cirrhosis with new-onset ascites, or those admitted to the hospital for symptoms related to ascites or encephalopathy should receive diagnostic paracentesis as soon as possible. Testing should include serum ascites albumin gradient and cell count, Gram stain, and culture. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients with hepatic hydrothorax with dyspnea and/or hypoxemia should undergo a therapeutic thoracentesis for both symptom relief and expansion of the underlying lung. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: All patients with refractory ascites and/or hepatic hydrothorax should be considered for liver transplantation evaluation, regardless of their Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Refractory ascites and/or hydrothorax should be managed with therapeutic paracentesis and/or thoracentesis, respectively, with the frequency guided by recurrence. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: When the volume of ascites removed is > 5 L, 20%-25% intravenous albumin 6–8 g per every total liter removed should be administered. For patients with hypotension, renal insufficiency, or electrolyte abnormalities, albumin should also be considered for removal of smaller volumes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Well-selected patients with refractory ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, or hyponatremia should be referred for to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Diagnostic workup for the etiology of hyponatremia in cirrhosis should include dietary and medication history (diuretics, bowel regimen); review of electrolyte and kidney function; gastrointestinal bleeding assessment; infectious workup, including diagnostic paracentesis, and evaluation of secondary causes (thyroid or adrenal dysfunction). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Outpatient management of asymptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis entails both sodium and water restriction (aiming for 1–1.5 L of daily fluid intake), modification of diuretics and laxatives, and monitoring of electrolytes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Inpatient management of severe or symptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis includes both sodium and water restriction; modification or discontinuation of diuretics and laxatives; and additional measures, such as intravenous albumin based on volume assessment or oral vasoconstriction therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Recurrent or refractory hyponatremia management should involve a multidisciplinary approach (including the liver transplantation team when appropriate) and can consider several therapeutic options, including intravenous vasoconstrictor therapy, infusion of hypertonic saline, use of vasopressin receptor antagonist (vaptans), or use of renal replacement therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Inpatient management of volume overload includes escalation or trial of intravenous loop diuretics (furosemide or bumetanide) in bolus (2–3 times per day) or continuous fashion. Cautious escalation can be done every 2–3 days with monitoring of volume status, kidney function, daily weights, and symptoms. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Advanced strategies in refractory anasarca should be coordinated with nephrology for consideration of diuretics in the setting of contraction alkalosis (eg, addition of acetazolamide), second agent with alternate mechanism of actions (eg, thiazide diuretics, such as metolazone), or need for ultrafiltration.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^116o11eo]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to evaluation of ascites, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to calculate the serum ascites-albumin gradient when the cause of ascites is not immediately evident, and/or when conditions other than cirrhosis are suspected.

### Sensitivity of a bedside reagent strip for the detection of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in ED patients with ascites [^113YqHwA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To determine the sensitivity of a highly sensitive bedside leukocyte esterase reagent strip (RS) for detection of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in emergency department (ED) ascites patients undergoing paracentesis.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, observational cohort study of ED ascites patients undergoing paracentesis at two academic facilities. Two practitioners, blinded to each other's results, did a bedside RS analysis of the peritoneal fluid in each patient and documented the RS reading at 3-min according to manufacturer-specified colorimetric strip reading as either "negative", "trace", "small", or "large". The primary outcome measure was sensitivity of the RS strip for SBP (absolute neutrophil count ≥ 250 cells/mm³) at the "trace" threshold (positive equals trace or greater).

Results

There were 330 cases enrolled, with 635 fluid analyses performed. Of these, 40 fluid samples had SBP (6%). Bedside RS had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 95% (95% CI 82%-99%), 48% (95% CI 44%-52%), 11% (95% CI 10%-11%), and 99% (95% CI 97%-99%) respectively at the "trace" threshold for the detection of SBP.

Conclusion

Bedside use of the RS in ED ascites patients demonstrated high sensitivity for SBP. Given the wide confidence intervals, we cannot currently recommend it as a stand-alone test. We recommend further study with a larger number of SBP patients, potentially combining a negative RS result with low clinical suspicion to effectively rule out SBP without formal laboratory analysis.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111BcorH]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Paracentesis safety in coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia is summarized as follows: LVP is a safe procedure even in the presence of coagulopathy, and therefore elevated prothrombin time or thrombocytopenia is not a contraindication for paracentesis, nor is transfusion of clotting factors or platelets recommended; possible exceptions may include patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation or uremia and thrombocytopenia, and in the latter patients, desmopressin may be considered, particularly if there is history of prior bleeding.

### Acute bilateral retinal artery occlusion causing sudden blindness in 25-year-old patient [^112oGmXp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

A 25-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with the chief complaint of sudden blindness and was found to have suffered bilateral central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). This process is most commonly the result of a thrombus or embolus that occludes the retinal artery, and normally presents in a single eye in patients older than 65 who are predisposed to vascular disease. Diagnosis relies most heavily upon funduscopic exam. Potential treatments involve ocular massage, acetazolamide, anterior chamber paracentesis and systemic or local fibrinolysis. Despite these interventions vision is often significantly and permanently impaired. This case underscores the importance of the emergency physician's ability to promptly perform and interpret the funduscopic exam in order to diagnose and evaluate CRAO.

### Ascites, or fluid in the belly, in patients with cancer… [^113Lcvjs]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

308. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2019.5409 Ascites refers to excess fluid in the abdomen. This fluid collects in the space within the walls of the abdomen, between the abdominal organs. It is common in patients with liver disease and cirrhosis, though patients with cancer can also develop ascites. Two main reasons cause ascites in patients with cancer. First, cancer can spread to the lining of the organs — the peritoneum — and make it leaky, causing malignant ascites. Second, cancer can spread to the liver and cause increased pressure in the liver. Certain cancers, such as ovarian, pancreatic, liver, and colon cancers, are more likely to cause ascites. Patients can experience swelling and tightness of the abdomen, feeling full when eating, nausea, or shortness of breath. The fluid can become infected, which can cause fever and pain.

Ascites may be suspected because of symptoms and examination findings. Ultrasonography is often the first step. A computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan can provide more information about the underlying cancer. A needle and syringe may be used to remove some of the fluid in a procedure called a paracentesis. Checking this fluid for white blood cells, blood, cancer cells, and bacteria can help determine the cause and diagnose an infection, if present. Finding cancer cells in the fluid confirms a diagnosis of malignant ascites as opposed to liver damage or other causes. If patients have severe tightness in the abdomen or shortness of breath, a paracentesis can remove several liters of fluid in minutes. A hollow needle is inserted into the fluid and connected to a bottle via tubing. This can provide immediate relief, though fluid can return, often in days to weeks. The procedure can be repeated if needed. Cancer. Netwww. cancer.
