## Question

A patient has posterior adhesion of the cervical spinal cord from C2-4, in the absence of significant compression. The radiologist did not note this on the report. Is it of no clinical significance?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether posterior cervical spinal cord adhesion at C2–4 without significant compression is clinically significant and what to do about it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "posterior adhesion" implies pathologically and radiologically. Then, I should verify whether adhesions can cause symptoms even without frank compression. Next, I will review prognostic implications and risk modifiers. After that, I need to check how often radiologists miss subtle adhesions and why. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation for follow-up and when to escalate care, anchoring to the best available evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the terminology. "Posterior adhesion" in this context most plausibly reflects arachnoid adhesions tethering the dorsal cord to the dura or posterior elements, which can distort normal cord motion and CSF dynamics even when static canal diameter appears adequate on routine imaging, and this pattern is well described in adhesive arachnoiditis and related tethering syndromes [^d61da96a] [^68e2ec8a].

> Wait, let me verify whether absence of overt compression excludes clinical impact. It does not. Cord tethering can produce progressive myelopathy, syringomyelia, and dynamic symptoms via impaired CSF flow, mechanical strain, and ischemia, even when conventional T2 sequences show minimal canal compromise; case series and reviews document symptomatic adhesive arachnoiditis with cord deformity and syrinx formation despite modest or intermittent compression, and tethering after anterior surgery has been reported to cause delayed myelopathy even without persistent compression [^d61da96a] [^b671bf0f] [^aa3cbba3].

> I should confirm prognostic markers. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — MRI signal changes and cord morphology correlate with outcomes in compressive myelopathy, and similar principles apply to tethered cords: severe preoperative cord flattening, low T1/high T2 signal, and atrophy portend worse recovery, whereas early recognition and untethering can halt progression. In adhesive arachnoiditis with syrinx, outcomes hinge on restoring CSF flow and releasing adhesions, reinforcing that morphology and flow dynamics matter beyond static canal diameter [^f99201b4] [^e621d74d] [^b15beeb4].

> Next, I should review why the radiologist might have underreported it. Routine MRI protocols can miss subtle arachnoid webs, thin adhesions, and dynamic tethering; arachnoid bands and focal adhesions are best visualized with high-resolution T2 and careful axial scrutiny, and CSF flow artifacts can obscure small dorsal adhesions. Moreover, radiologists may label noncompressive adhesions as incidental unless specifically prompted by clinical context, so a negative or nonspecific report does not equate to absence of pathology [^d61da96a] [^68e2ec8a].

> I need to ensure I consider risk modifiers. Location at C2–4 places the lesion in a high-risk zone where cord diameter is greater and space is tighter, and prior surgery, trauma, infection, or hemorrhage increase adhesion risk. Dynamic factors such as flexion–extension can convert a seemingly noncompressive adhesion into a clinically significant tether, and cervical instability amplifies repetitive cord injury, worsening prognosis if unrecognized [^8b0c15c8] [^5fb77666] [^0aa09482].

> Let me synthesize clinical significance. Even without significant static compression, posterior C2–4 adhesions can be clinically meaningful: they may cause progressive myelopathy, pain, dysesthesias, gait imbalance, or syringomyelia, and they carry prognostic implications if cord deformity or signal change evolves. Therefore, I should not dismiss them as incidental without correlating symptoms, serial imaging, and, when appropriate, advanced studies such as cine MRI or CT myelography to assess CSF flow and dynamic tethering [^d61da96a] [^b671bf0f] [^68e2ec8a].

> Now, I should translate this into a practical plan. First, I will double-check the patient for subtle myelopathic signs — gait imbalance, hand clumsiness, hyperreflexia, sensory levels, or Lhermitte's phenomenon — and document a baseline exam. Second, I will request targeted MRI review with high-resolution T2 and axial sequences focused on C2–4, and consider CSF flow imaging if symptoms suggest dynamic tethering. Third, if symptoms are present or evolve, I will refer to neurosurgery or spine for consideration of untethering or decompression, recognizing that early intervention before fixed cord change yields better outcomes. If asymptomatic, I will arrange clinical and MRI surveillance at 6–12 months given the potential for progression and the anatomic vulnerability at C2–4 [^b15beeb4] [^f99201b4] [^8b0c15c8].

> But wait, what if the "adhesion" is just a positional artifact or a normal variant? I should confirm by correlating with symptoms and, if needed, obtaining flexion–extension MRI or kinematic studies to distinguish true tethering from transient apposition, because dynamic compression or tethering can be missed on neutral-position scans and may clarify the pathophysiology before committing to intervention [^5fb77666] [^b281b14c].

> In conclusion, posterior C2–4 cord adhesion without significant static compression is not necessarily benign. It can impair cord mechanics and CSF dynamics, leading to progressive neurological deficits or syrinx, and warrants careful clinical correlation, advanced imaging when indicated, and timely referral if symptomatic or evolving, rather than passive reassurance based on a nonspecific radiology report [^d61da96a] [^b671bf0f] [^b15beeb4].

---

Posterior adhesion of the cervical spinal cord at C2–4 without significant compression is **not necessarily benign** and may still be clinically significant. Even without overt compression, adhesions can tether the cord, impair CSF flow, and cause progressive myelopathy or radiculopathy [^d61da96a] [^b671bf0f]. MRI may underdetect subtle adhesions, so **clinical correlation is essential** [^68e2ec8a]. If the patient has neurological symptoms or risk factors (prior surgery, trauma, infection), **further evaluation** with advanced imaging (CT myelography, high-resolution MRI) and neurosurgical consultation is warranted [^68e2ec8a]. Asymptomatic patients should be monitored clinically and with serial MRI if symptoms develop [^b6acb9d0].

---

## Clinical significance of posterior cord adhesion without significant compression

Posterior cord adhesion can **tether the spinal cord**, limiting its normal movement and causing neurological deficits even without overt compression [^d61da96a]. Clinical significance depends on:

- **Tethering effect**: Adhesions can restrict cord movement, causing progressive myelopathy or radiculopathy [^b671bf0f].
- **CSF flow impairment**: Adhesions can disrupt CSF dynamics, leading to syringomyelia or cyst formation [^b671bf0f].
- **Progression risk**: Adhesions may worsen over time, leading to significant compression and neurological decline [^e3a5007c].

---

## Clinical symptoms and neurological implications

Patients with posterior cord adhesion at C2–4 may present with:

- **Myelopathy**: Gait instability, hand clumsiness, hyperreflexia, spasticity, and sensory disturbances [^2f03c37c].
- **Radiculopathy**: Neck pain, upper limb weakness, and sensory changes corresponding to C2–4 nerve roots [^4b79a453].
- **Syringomyelia**: Progressive neurological deficits due to cyst formation and cord cavitation [^b671bf0f].

---

## Diagnostic challenges and limitations of MRI

MRI is the gold standard for spinal cord imaging, but **subtle adhesions can be missed** [^c9e444d1]. Limitations include:

- **Resolution limits**: Small adhesions or thin arachnoid bands may be below MRI resolution [^notfound].
- **Motion artifacts**: Cervical motion can obscure subtle lesions [^notfound].
- **Interpretation variability**: Radiologist experience and protocol differences affect detection [^notfound].

Thus, a negative or nonspecific MRI does not exclude clinically significant adhesions, especially when symptoms are present [^68e2ec8a].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **clinical correlation** and **individualized management**:

- **Clinical correlation**: Imaging findings must be interpreted in the context of symptoms and examination [^2f03c37c].
- **Advanced imaging**: CT myelography or high-resolution MRI can better delineate adhesions and CSF flow obstruction [^68e2ec8a].
- **Neurosurgical consultation**: Consider referral for symptomatic patients or those with risk factors (prior surgery, trauma, infection) [^notfound].

---

## Prognostic factors and risk of progression

Several factors influence prognosis and progression risk:

| **Prognostic factor** | **Impact on prognosis** |
|-|-|
| Degree of adhesion | More extensive adhesions increase risk of progression [^b671bf0f] |
| Presence of symptoms | Symptomatic patients have higher risk of neurological decline [^notfound] |
| Age | Younger patients may have better recovery potential [^f99201b4] |
| Underlying etiology | Post-infectious or post-traumatic adhesions carry higher progression risk [^b671bf0f] |

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on **symptoms, adhesion severity, and progression risk**:

- **Conservative management**: Observation, physical therapy, and pain management for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients [^notfound].
- **Surgical intervention**: Consider decompression, adhesiolysis, or untethering for symptomatic patients or those with progressive neurological deficits [^b15beeb4].
- **Multidisciplinary approach**: Coordinate care among neurology, neurosurgery, and rehabilitation specialists [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Posterior cord adhesion at C2–4 without significant compression is **not necessarily benign** and may cause significant neurological deficits. Clinicians should:

- **Correlate clinically**: Align imaging with symptoms and examination [^2f03c37c].
- **Consider advanced imaging**: Use CT myelography or high-resolution MRI if suspicion remains high [^68e2ec8a].
- **Monitor closely**: Arrange serial clinical and MRI follow-up for asymptomatic patients [^b6acb9d0].
- **Refer early**: Involve neurosurgery for symptomatic patients or those with risk factors [^notfound].

In sum, posterior cord adhesion at C2–4 without significant compression can still be **clinically significant** and warrants careful evaluation and follow-up.

### Cervical myelopathy: diagnosis, contemporary treatment, and outcomes [^2f03c37c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Cervical myelopathy is a clinical syndrome caused by compression of the spinal cord between the levels of the C1 and T1 vertebrae. Its clinical presentation can mimic other degenerative and neurological pathologies, making diagnosis challenging. Diagnosis is confirmed with appropriate imaging studies carefully correlated with history and physical examination. Treatment options are focused on decompression of the spinal canal from an anterior, posterior, or combined anterior and posterior surgical approach depending on the location of compression and patient factors. Outcomes are favorable if treatment is performed prior to severe symptom onset.

### Does posterior cord compression from the ligamentum flavum influence clinical outcomes after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion? [^0dc43a9f]. Spine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Objective

To clarify whether outcomes of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) differ according to the presence of posterior cord compression from the ligamentum flavum (CCLF).

Summary Of Background Data

Although ACDF effectively addresses anterior cord compression from disc material and bone spurs, it cannot address posterior compression. Whether ACDF could result in favorable outcomes when CCLF is present remains unclear.

Patients and Methods

A total of 195 consecutive patients who underwent ACDF and were followed up for > 2 years were included. CCLF was graded based on magnetic resonance imaging findings. Patients with CCLF grade 2 were classified as such, whereas patients with CCLF grades 0 to 1 were classified as the no-CCLF group. Patient characteristics, cervical sagittal parameters, neck pain visual analog scale, arm pain visual analog scale, and Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score were assessed. Categorical variables were analyzed using a χ² test, whereas continuous variables were analyzed using the Student t test. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to elucidate factors associated with JOA recovery rates of > 50%.

Results

One hundred sixty-seven patients (85.6%) were included in the no-CCLF group, whereas the remaining 28 patients (14.4%) were included in the CCLF group. Among patients in the CCLF group, 14 patients (50.0%) achieved clinical improvement. JOA score significantly improved in the no-CCLF group after the operation (P < 0.001), whereas improvement was not appreciated in the CCLF group (P = 0.642). JOA scores at 3 months (P = 0.037) and 2 years (P = 0.001) postoperatively were significantly higher in the no-CCLF group. Furthermore, the JOA recovery rate at 2 years after surgery was significantly higher in the no-CCLF group (P = 0.042). Logistic regression demonstrated that CCLF was significantly associated with a JOA recovery rate of > 50% at 2 years after surgery (odds ratio: 2.719; 95% CI: 1.12, 6.60).

Conclusion

ACDF performed for patients with CCLF grade 2 showed inferior JOA score improvement compared with those with CCLF grade 0 or 1. ACDF cannot remove posterior compressive structures, which limits its utility when ligamentum flavum significantly contributes to cord compression.

### Is posterior spinal cord shifting by extensive posterior decompression clinically significant for multisegmental cervical spondylotic myelopathy? [^67e09a0e]. Spine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Design

Posterior cervical spinal cord shifting after selective single laminectomy associated with partial laminotomies was compared with that after bilateral open-door laminoplasty between the C3 and C7 levels in relation to the clinical results of each procedure.

Objectives

To investigate the clinical significance of posterior spinal cord shifting after extensive cervical laminoplasty.

Summary Of Background Data

Current techniques used for cervical laminoplasty for multisegmental cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) are consecutively performed between the C3 and C6 or C7 levels with expectation that the spinal cord will shift backward to keep it clear of anterior compression. However, the clinical significance of the posterior spinal cord shifting remains controversial, and there has been no report verifying it by comparing limited posterior decompression procedures with conventional extensive ones.

Methods

Twenty-six patients with consecutive 2- to 3-level CSM who underwent selective laminoplasty (Group A) were enrolled in the study, and among 56 CSM patients who underwent bilateral open-door laminoplasty between the C3 and C7 levels, 25 who had consecutive 2- or 3- level stenosis identified by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging were used as controls (Group B). The recovery rate was calculated using preoperative and postoperative Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scores for each patient, and for each patient's magnetic resonance imaging, the postoperative cervical curvature index was obtained according to Ishihara's method and the magnitude of postoperative backward shifting of the spinal cord was measured.

Results

There was no significant difference between the subjects in Groups A and B with respect to the spinal curvature index, preoperative JOA scores, and recovery rate, but the magnitude of the postoperative posterior shifting of the spinal cord was greater for those in Group B than for those in Group A. There was no correlation between the recovery rate and posterior shifting of the spinal cord for each group, and no correlation was also found between the curvature index and posterior shifting of the spinal cord.

Conclusions

The outcome of posterior decompression surgery for multisegmental CSM is not correlated with the magnitude of postoperative backward shifting of the spinal cord. Extensive and consecutive decompression performed in conventional cervical laminoplasties is therefore not always necessary for multisegmental CSM.

### Frequency, timing, and predictors of neurological dysfunction in the nonmyelopathic patient with cervical spinal cord compression, canal stenosis, and / or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament [^b6acb9d0]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review and survey.

Objective

To perform an evidence synthesis of the literature and obtain information from the global spine care community assessing the frequency, timing, and predictors of symptom development in patients with radiographical evidence of cervical spinal cord compression, spinal canal narrowing, and/or ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) but no symptoms of myelopathy.

Summary Of Background Data

Evidence for a marker to predict symptom development remains sparse, and there is controversy surrounding the management of asymptomatic patients.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of the English language literature and an international survey of spine surgeons to answer the following key questions in patients with radiographical evidence of cervical spinal cord compression, spinal canal narrowing, and/or OPLL but no symptoms of myelopathy: (1) What are the frequency and timing of symptom development? (2) What are the clinical, radiographical, and electrophysiological predictors of symptom development? (3) What clinical and/or radiographical features influence treatment decisions based on an international survey of spine care professionals?

Results

The initial literature search yielded 388 citations. Applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria narrowed this to 5 articles. Two of these dealt with the same population. For patients with spinal cord compression secondary to spondylosis, one study reported the frequency of myelopathy development to be 22.6%. The presence of symptomatic radiculopathy, cervical cord hyperintensity on magnetic resonance imaging, and prolonged somatosensory- and motor-evoked potentials were reported in one study as significant independent predictors of myelopathy development. In contrast, the lack of magnetic resonance imaging hyperintensity was found to be a positive predictor of early myelopathy development (≤ 12-mo follow-up). For subjects with OPLL, frequency of myelopathy development was reported in 3 articles and ranged from 0.0% to 61.5% of subjects. One of these studies reported canal stenosis of 60% or more, lateral deviated OPLL, and increased cervical range of motion as significant predictors of myelopathy development. In a survey of 774 spine surgeons, the majority deemed the presence of clinically symptomatic radiculopathy to predict progression to myelopathy in nonmyelopathic patients with cervical stenosis. Survey responses pertaining to 3 patient case vignettes are also presented and discussed in the context of the current literature.

Conclusion

On the basis of these results, we provide a series of evidence-based recommendations related to the frequency, timing, and predictors of myelopathy development in asymptomatic patients with cervical stenosis secondary to spondylosis or OPLL. Future prospective studies are required to refine our understanding of this topic. EVIDENCE-BASED CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:

Recommendation

Patients with cervical canal stenosis and cord compression secondary to spondylosis, without clinical evidence of myelopathy, and who present with clinical or electrophysiological evidence of cervical radicular dysfunction or central conduction deficits seem to be at higher risk for developing myelopathy and should be counseled to consider surgical treatment.

Overall Strength Of Evidence

Moderate.

Strength Of Recommendation

Strong. SUMMARY STATEMENTS: STATEMENT 1: On the basis of the current literature, for patients with cervical canal stenosis and cord compression secondary to spondylosis, without clinical evidence of myelopathy, approximately 8% at 1-year follow-up and 23% at a median of 44-months follow-up develop clinical evidence of myelopathy. STATEMENT 2: For patients with cervical canal stenosis and cord compression secondary to spondylosis, without clinical evidence of myelopathy, the absence of magnetic resonance imaging intramedullary T2 hyperintensity has been shown to predict early myelopathy development (< 12-mo follow-up) and the presence of such signal has been shown to predict late myelopathy development (mean 44-mo follow-up). In light of this discrepancy, no definite recommendation can be made surrounding the utility of this finding in predicting myelopathy development. STATEMENT 3: For patients with OPLL but without myelopathy, no recommendation can be made regarding the incidence or predictors of progression to myelopathy.

### Ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament growth in the C1 / 2 segment and its clinical significance: is C2 total decompression necessary? [^95fd1237]. Spine (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Design

A retrospective analysis at a single institution.

Objective

This study aimed to determine whether ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) growth in the C1/2 area remains clinically uneventful despite visible radiologic enlargement.

Background

In cervical decompressive surgery for OPLL, preserving the C2 lamina is preferred for stability, and the larger spinal canal space above C2 tends to mitigate clinical issues caused by OPLL growth. However, the effects of OPLL progression in the C1/2 segment, which often remains untreated, on patients' clinical outcomes are unclear.

Patients and Methods

We enrolled 144 patients with cervical OPLL who underwent decompression surgery between January 2011 and December 2018. The patients were categorized based on whether they underwent a C2 sparing procedure or C2 laminectomy. The primary outcome was radiologic progression of OPLL, defined as a 2mm increase in sagittal thickness or longitudinal elongation, and its correlation with clinical symptoms.

Results

Of the 144 patients, 35 were in the C2 sparing group, and 109 were in the C2 laminectomy group, with an average follow-up period of 5.2 to 5.6 years. The rate of radiologic progression of OPLL in the C1/2 segment was comparable between the two groups (54.3% vs. 51.4%, P = 0.916). However, diagnosis of C1/2 stenosis at the final follow-up was still lower in the C2 sparing group than in the C2 laminectomy group (2.9% vs. 10.1%, P = 0.294), and there were no new cases of symptoms caused by cord compression in the C1/2 segment in either group.

Conclusion

OPLL in the C1/2 segment was clinically silent despite radiologic growth. For patients who do not present with significant canal stenosis or cord compression due to OPLL above the C2 upper lamina, C2 lamina-sparing decompressive surgery is preferred.

Level Of Evidence

Level III.

### Impact of morphological restoration of the spinal cord from the preoperative to early postoperative periods on C5 palsy development [^eefc29e9]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

C5 palsy (C5P) is a known complication of cervical decompression surgery. The tethering effect of the C5 nerve root following the posterior shift of the spinal cord is the most accepted pathologic mechanism for C5P development; however, this mechanism cannot fully explain C5P by itself in clinical practice. Separately, some studies have suggested that preoperative severe spinal cord compression and postoperative morphological changes in the spinal cord affect C5P development; however, no previous study has quantitatively addressed these possibilities. The aim of this study was to examine whether spinal cord morphology and morphological restoration after surgery affect C5P development.

Methods

The authors reviewed consecutive patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy who underwent laminoplasty including the C3-4 and C4-5 intervertebral disc levels. All participants underwent MRI both preoperatively and within 4 weeks postoperatively. To assess the severity of spinal cord compression, the compression ratio (CR; spinal cord sagittal diameter/transverse diameter) was calculated. As an index of morphological changes in the spinal cord during the early postoperative period, the change rate of CR (CrCR, %) was calculated as CRwithin 4 weeks postoperatively/CRpreoperatively × 100. These measurements were performed at both the C3-4 and C4-5 intervertebral disc levels. The study cohort was divided into C5P and non-C5P (NC5P) groups; then, CR and CrCR, in addition to other radiographic variables associated with C5P development, were compared between the groups.

Results

A total of 114 patients (mean age 67.6 years, 58.8% men) were included in the study, with 5 and 109 patients in the C5P and NC5P groups, respectively. Preoperative CR at both the C3-4 and C4-5 levels was significantly lower in the C5P group than in the NC5P group (0.35 vs 0.44, p = 0.042 and 0.27 vs 0.39, p = 0.021, respectively). Patients with C5P exhibited significantly higher CrCR at the C3-4 level than those without (139.3% vs 119.0%, p = 0.046), but the same finding was not noted for CrCR at the C4-5 level. There were no significant differences in other variables between the groups.

Conclusions

This study reveals that severe compression of the spinal cord and its greater morphological restoration during the early postoperative period affect C5P development. These findings could support the involvement of segmental cord disorder theory, characterized as the reperfusion phenomenon, in the pathomechanism of C5P, in addition to the tethering effect.

### The posterior cervical transdural approach for retro-odontoid mass pseudotumor resection: report of three cases and discussion of the current literature [^14592112]. European Spine Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The treatment of a retro-odontoid pseudotumor mass associated with severe spinal cord compression is challenging due to the complex regional anatomy. Here, we present an attractive treatment option involving a single-stage posterior transdural microsurgical resection followed by instrumented cervical reconstruction.

Methods

We describe three patients presenting with clinical signs of cervical myelopathy and an imaging finding of mucoid and fibrous soft or semi-soft retro-odontoid pseudotumor mass with significant spinal cord compression at the C1/C2 level. Given the severity of the symptoms, surgical decompression was planned and fusion was necessitated by the severe degenerative osteoarthritis seen at the C1/C2 level with signs of instability. Using a standard posterior approach to the spine, a suboccipital decompression by craniectomy and laminectomy of C1, C2 and C3 was performed. The masses were visualized and confirmed with ultrasound imaging, and intraoperative neurosurgical monitoring was applied. The dura was then opened from the level of C0-C2. Exiting C2-C3 nerve roots were identified and protected throughout the procedure, and the dentate ligament was cut to facilitate access. Incision of the anterior dura provided easy access to the lesion for resection without any spinal cord retraction. Multiple intraoperative samples were sent to pathology for tissue diagnosis. The dura was closed with sutures and an overlay of fibrin sealant with collagen matrix sponge. The fusion procedures were performed using a standard occipital cervical plate and screws technique with contoured titanium rods.

Conclusions

The posterior cervical transdural approach is a safe alternative procedure for mucoid and fibrous soft or semi-soft retro-odontoid pseudotumor mass removal. Preoperative CT scan can evaluate tissue characteristics and distinguish between a soft or ossified mass in front of the spinal cord. Local anatomical conditions facilitate less bleeding and adhesions, together with less spinal cord traction, in the intradural space. Cranio-cervical and suboccipital stabilization can be easily and safely performed with this exposure.

### Anterior cervical approach for the treatment of cervical myelopathy [^236f7fb9]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Compression of the spinal cord by the degenerating cervical spine tends to lead to progressive clinical symptoms over a variable period of time. Surgical decompression can stop this process and lead to recovery of function. The choice of surgical technique depends on what is causing the compression of the spinal cord. This article reviews the symptoms and assessment for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (clinically evident compression of the spinal cord) and discusses the indications for decompression of the spinal cord anteriorly.

### Rapid progressive clinical deterioration of cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^e3a5007c]. Spinal Cord (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective clinical study.

Objective

To elucidate the pathophysiology of rapid progressive clinical deterioration following the onset of cervical myelopathy.

Setting

Spinal Injuries Center, Fukuoka, Japan.

Methods

A total of 43 cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) patients were treated surgically by a senior surgeon. All patients showed intramedullary intensity changes on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Overall, eight patients suffered rapid progressive clinical deterioration; four of them had obvious anamnesis of minor trauma. We assessed the responsible injured segment by MR T2-weighted images. Clinical instabilities at the focal segment were evaluated using functional sagittal plain radiographs. Neurological evaluations were performed preoperatively and at 12 months postoperatively using American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor scores and Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores for cervical myelopathy. Intraoperatively, we evaluated the presence of adhesive scar tissue on the dura mater at the focal segment.

Results

The responsible injured segment was C3-4 in 75% of the rapid progressive (rp)-CSM and in 28.57% of the conventional CSM subjects. One with rp-CSM showed sagittal translational segmental instability. Preoperative ASIA motor scores and JOA scores in the rp-CSM were significantly lower than those in the conventional CSM subjects. Postoperative ASIA motor scores between the subjects showed no significant differences; however, postoperative JOA scores in the rp-CSM subjects were significantly lower. Moreover, an epidural membrane was observed in 62.5% of rp-CSM and 11.4% of conventional CSM subjects.

Conclusions

We hypothesized that the pathophysiology of rp-CSM might be additional cervical cord disorder following the onset of cervical myelopathy. Early decompression surgery is recommended in such patients.

### Failure of surgical equipoise in posterior cord syndrome myelopathy [^a81c0566]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

For clinical PCS, he was admitted and placed on the urgent inpatients surgical list for posterior surgical decompression and fusion C2-C5.

The next day, the operating on-call surgeon voiced equipoise on the MRI and performed anterior surgical decompression and fusion C3-5.

Postoperatively, symptoms and disability were increased with coarsening of baseline intention tremor in any mobilization of the arms. The patient could not feed himself. Motor strength remained uniformly normal. Inpatient spinal cord rehabilitation was ineffective. A repeat MRI (Figure 4) showed cord compression to have been unchanged by the anterior surgery.

The patient was returned to the operating room for cervical laminectomy C3 and C4.

After the second surgery, there was immediate relief of intention tremor and extremities dysesthesia with improved manual dexterity and balance. After a short period of inpatient spinal cord rehab, he was discharged home with rapidly improving functional capacity and is now independently mobile.

### Dynamic changes in spinal cord compression by cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament evaluated by kinematic computed tomography myelography [^5fb77666]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

A prospective clinical study.

Objective

To investigate the dynamic causative factor in the pathogenesis of myelopathy in patients with cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) using kinematic computed tomography (CT) myelography.

Summary Of Background Data

Kinematic CT myelography is useful for dynamically evaluating the cervical spine with high-resolution images, particularly in bony compressive lesions. However, no studies have evaluated the dynamic factors in patients with OPLL using kinematic CT myelography.

Methods

From 2008 to 2013, 51 consecutive patients with OPLL who presented with myelopathy were prospectively enrolled in this study. The patients were examined with kinematic (flexion-extension) CT myelography using a multidetector CT scanner. The range of motion at C2-C7 from flexion to extension was measured in the sagittal view. The segmental range of motion, anterior-posterior diameter and cross-sectional area (CSA) of the spinal cord were measured at the level where the spinal cord was most compressed by OPLL.

Results

The neurological condition of the patients evaluated by Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores were 10.8 ± 2.4 points. The mean range of motion at C2-C7 and at the most compressed segment were 23.1 ± 11.7 and 7.0 ± 4.4°, respectively. Both the anterior-posterior diameter and the CSA at the most compressed levels were significantly decreased during neck extension compared with flexion. Interestingly, the anterior-posterior diameter and the CSA were decreased during neck flexion in 13.7% (7/51) of the patients. All 7 of these patients had massive OPLL with an occupying rate 60% or more. The dynamic change rate of CSA (flexion/extension) was significantly smaller in patients with an OPLL occupying rate 60% or more compared with patients with an occupying rate less than 60%.

Conclusion

Although spinal cord compression was increased during neck extension in most of the patients, greater levels of compression could be placed on the spinal cord during neck flexion when the patients had OPLL with a high occupying rate.

Options

Intensive care unit (or other monitored setting) management of patients with acute central cervical spinal cord injuries, particularly patients with severe neurological deficits, is recommended. Medical management, including cardiac, hemodynamic, and respiratory monitoring, and maintenance of mean arterial blood pressure at 85 to 90 mmHg for the first week after injury to improve spinal cord perfusion is recommended. Early reduction of fracture-dislocation injuries is recommended. Surgical decompression of the compressed spinal cord, particularly if the compression is focal and anterior, is recommended.

Cervical spondylosis — prevalence, age association, and affected levels are described, noting that in most symptomatic cases spondylosis is associated with aging and with compression of the spinal cord in patients older than 55. Degenerative changes of the cervical spine are seen in approximately 10% of individuals by age 25 and in 95% by age 65, and the levels most commonly affected by both disc herniation and chronic spondylosis are C6/C7 followed by C5/C6. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy refers to clinically evident spinal cord dysfunction with the presence of long-track signs due to compression of the spinal cord.

### Anterior migration of spinal cord after cervical corpectomy [^56a0fb0c]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Posterior migration of spinal cord is a common complication of posterior cervical decompression, whereas anterior migration of spinal cord after anterior cervical decompression has not been reported previously. This report presents a case of anterior migration of spinal cord after cervical corpectomy. A 65-year-old male underwent a cervical corpectomy of the C4 and C5 for cervical spondylotic myelopathy. The postoperative MRI showed that spinal cord was decompressed. However, at 12 months postoperatively, the patient complained that improved gait aggravated again, and the MRI showed an anterior migration of the spinal cord at the level of the C4 and C5, and a compression of spinal cord at the level of caudal endplate of C3. Secondary surgery, laminaplasty of C3 and C4 was conducted. The postoperative MRI showed that the spinal canal increased at the C3 and C4 levels, and the spinal cord went through smoothly without sharp turning.

Results

Pathological changes in FSUs

All 295 subjects were classified into three groups based on the average sagittal cervical spinal canal diameter: Group A consisted of 89 subjects with an average age of 45.1 years; Group B, 153 subjects with an average age of 43.7 years; Group C, 53 subjects with an average age of 42.1 years. Subjects with narrower cervical spinal canal tended to be older, although no significant differences were observed among the groups.

Table 2 shows the grade of cervical intervertebral disc degeneration at all segments for each group. When the grades were compared between Groups A and B, the C3-4, C5-6, and C6-7 segments showed significant differences. When compared between Groups A and C, significant differences in the grades were observed at all segments except C2-3. In addition, when compared between Groups B and C, a significant difference in the grades was only observed at the C5-6 segment.

### Effect of posterior decompression with and without fixation on a kyphotic cervical spine with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament [^1e043cc4]. Spinal Cord (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Biomechanical study.

Objective

Cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (C-OPLL) causes myelopathy. Though posterior decompression for C-OPLL showed positive results, poor outcomes were seen in patients with a kyphotic alignment. Posterior decompression with fusion (PDF) tends to show better results compared to posterior decompression. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of the posterior procedures for C-OPLL.

Setting

Yamaguchi University.

Methods

Based on 3D finite element C2-C7 spine created from medical images and a spinal cord, the following compression models were created: the intact model, K-line 0mm model, and K-line 2mm model. These models were used to analyze the effects of posterior decompression with varied lengths of fixation. The stress of the spinal cord was calculated for intact, K-line 0mm, and K-line 2mm as preoperative models, and laminectomy (LN)-K-line 0mm, PDF (C4-C5)-K-line 0mm, PDF (C3-C6)-K-line 0mm, LN-K-line 2mm, PDF (C4-C5)-K-line 2mm, and PDF (C3-C6)-K-line 2mm model as operative models in a neutral, flexion, and extension.

Results

As the compression increased, stress on the spinal cord increased compared to the intact model. In the neutral, posterior decompression decreased the stress of the spinal cord. However, in flexion and extension, the stress on the spinal cord for LN-K-line 0 or 2mm, PDF (C4-C5)-K-line 0 or 2mm, and PDF (C3-C6)-K-line 0 or 2mm models decreased by more than 40%, 43%, and 70% respectively compared to the K-line 0 or 2mm model.

Conclusions

In kyphotic C-OPLL, it is essential to control intervertebral mobility in the posterior approach.

### Combined ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament at C2-3 and invagination of the posterior axis resulting in myelopathy [^814d1c07]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Spinal stenosis at the C2-3 segment is a rare occurrence, and when it occurs myelopathy infrequently results. Furthermore, only a handful of cases involving congenital abnormalities of the posterior arch of the axis have been described resulting in cervical myelopathy many of which described simultaneous congenital abnormalities at adjacent levels and none of which identified ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) at the same level. We report a case of a previously undescribed combination of abnormalities at the C2-3 segment resulting in clinical myelopathy.

Methods

A 49-year-old Chinese male presented with a progressive cervical myelopathy (C-JOA score 11 immediately pre-op). Segmental OPLL at the C2-3 disk space was visible, together with invagination of the bilaterally hypoplastic C2 lamina into the spinal canal. Signal abnormalities of the spinal cord were evident on both T1 and T2 sequences.

Results

The patient underwent a posterior decompression and instrumented fusion at C2-3 using pars screws at C2 and lateral mass screws at C3. Following surgery there was a rapid and significant improvement in the neurological symptoms, with the C-JOA score improving to 14 at final follow-up. A successful fusion was evident.

Conclusions

Deficiencies in the posterior arch of the axis are rare and have not previously been reported in conjunction with OPLL. Advanced imaging is helpful to define the abnormality and site of compression. In the setting of a progressive neurological dysfunction, surgical decompression and stabilization is a reasonable intervention and can be associated with neurological and symptomatic improvement.

### Myelopathy and spinal deformity: relevance of spinal alignment in planning surgical intervention for degenerative cervical myelopathy [^d4cc1d83]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Surgical management of degenerative cervical myelopathy requires careful pathoanatomic consideration to select between various surgical options from both anterior and posterior approach. Hitherto, unexplored is the relevance of cervical deformity to the pathophysiology of such neurological disability, and whether correction of that deformity should be a surgical objective when planning for reconstruction after spinal cord decompression. Such correction could address both the static cord compression and the dynamic repetitive cord injury, while also restoring more normal biomechanics to the cervical spine. The articles in this focus issue's section on cervical spinal deformity reveal that cervical sagittal alignment is geometrically related to thoracolumbar spinal pelvic alignment and to T1 slope, and that it is further clinically correlated to regional disability and general health scores and to myelopathy severity. These conclusions are based on narrative reviews and a selection of primary research data, reflecting the nascency of this field. They further recommend for preoperative assessment of spinal alignment when significant deformity is suspected, and that correction of cervical kyphosis should be an objective when surgery is planned.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^6aa45f22]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

Cervical post-surgery syndrome — clinical features, proposed mechanisms, and epidural intervention context: It represents a cluster of symptoms following cervical spine surgery wherein the expectations of the patient and spine surgeon are not met, with animal models of post-lumbar laminectomy syndrome demonstrating paraspinal muscle spasms, tail contractures, pain behaviors, tactile allodynia, epidural and perineural scarring, and nerve root adherence. Multiple factors, including surgical trauma to the posterior cervical muscles and external immobilization, have been suggested as causative, yet the precise mechanism of post-operative axial pain remains unclear; soft tissue injuries, including intraoperative damage of the posterior extensor musculature, and nerve tissue injuries sustained during surgery have been suggested as contributors. Based on this pathophysiologic basis, epidural interventions are performed in the cervical spine with appropriate outcomes.

### Failure of surgical equipoise in posterior cord syndrome myelopathy [^ae01958f]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is increasingly commonand when presenting motor functional impairments and decreased quality of life, it is recognized to be a primarily surgical disease with consistent benefit to be had from timely decompression.

There is a wide spectrum of options in surgical decompression, generically including anterior and posterior approaches. Although many cases can dictate a preferred direction of approach as a function of case-specific pathoanatomy, in those presenting with preserved cervical lordosis and without ossification in the posterior longitudinal ligament, the literature defines equipoise in surgical approach as anterior versus posterior options generally providing equal benefit.

Spinal cord injury syndromes include anterior cord syndrome, central cord syndrome, posterior cord syndrome (PCS), and lateral (Brown-Sequard), injuries. Most of these cases are anterior or central cord syndromes. The frequency of posterior and lateral injuries are recognized to be in the low single digits.

Literature on the surgical care of CSM does not commonly differentiate the outcome by the cord syndrome involved, and so at the current state of practice evidence, it remains professionally acceptable to treat a posterior cord syndrome anteriorly.

A recent publication from Koreafound that posterior indentations of the cord from ligamentum flavum hypertrophy were not consistently relieved by anterior surgery and so that pathoanatomy argues for a posterior approach.

Both patients reported here have given written permission for the presentation of their case details and imaging.

Cervical spinal stenosis — epidemiology and imaging reliability note that cervical spinal stenosis is a common disease that results in considerable morbidity and disability, and tandem spinal stenosis accounts for between 5% and 25% of all cases of stenosis. Cervical spinal stenosis has been detected in 26% of older asymptomatic individuals. For the past 4 decades, attempts to correlate clinical symptoms with the degree of spinal cord compression on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have not yielded a validated methodology; however, measurements of maximum canal compromise, maximum spinal cord compression, and compression ratio were reported as reliable and correlated well with the clinical severity of cervical myelopathy.

### Spine injury [^275e6118]. ACS (2022). High credibility.

AO Spine Trauma Classification — scope, morphology categories, neurologic grades, and modifiers are described as follows: Four separate classification systems are defined for upper cervical spine (Occiput-C2), subaxial cervical spine (C3-7), thoracolumbar spine (T1-L5), and sacrum (S1-5, including coccyx). Each classification evaluates the morphology of the injury, neurologic status, and patient-specific clinical modifiers, and a surgical decision-making algorithm using the injury severity score exists to guide operative treatment. For the upper cervical spine, injury morphology is divided into three categories: injuries to the occipital condyle and craniocervical junction, C1 ring and C1-2 joint, and C2 and C2-3 joint. The subaxial cervical spine and thoracolumbar classification both consist of 3 main categories — type A compression injuries, type B tension band injuries, and type C translation injuries — with the cervical classification containing two additional modifiers to describe bilateral (type BL) or facet injuries (type F). Sacral injuries are categorized into three main categories: lower sacro-coccygeal fractures (type A), posterior pelvic injuries (type B), and spino-pelvic injuries (type C). Neurologic injuries are described hierarchically as N0 (neurologically intact), N1 (transient neurologic deficit), N2 (nerve root injury or radiculopathy), N3 (incomplete spinal cord injury or cauda equina injury), N4 (complete spinal cord injury), with Nx for unknown status and a plus sign (+) modifier to denote ongoing spinal cord compression. Patient-specific clinical modifiers are denoted with M and include variables that may significantly impact or change patient treatment.

### Effect of the decompressive extent on the magnitude of the spinal cord shift after expansive open-door laminoplasty [^f3148435]. Spine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Design

A retrospective study to analyze the effect of decompressive extent on the posterior shift of spinal cord after expansive open-door laminoplasty (ELAP).

Objective

To investigate the effect of decompressive extent on cord shift distance after ELAP, and determine the morphologic limitations of posterior approach when the cervical alignment is lordotic or straight.

Summary Of Background Data

It is still controversial on the effect of space available for spinal cord at the level cephalad to the decompression with cord shift. Moreover, there is less understanding regarding the significance of decompressive extent of laminoplasty in relation to spinal cord shift and clinical outcome.

Methods

Preoperative and postoperative MRIs of 76 patients with a straight or lordotic cervical spine who had undergone cervical laminoplasty were reviewed and evaluated retrospectively. Radiographic parameters including cervical sagittal alignment, space available at the level cephalad, the thickness of compressive mass, and the average anterior subarachnoid space were measured. Laminoplasty was performed from C1 to C7 in 11 cases (CI group), C2 to C7 in 30 cases (CII group), and C3 to C7 in 35 cases (CIII group). According to whether the anterior indirect decompression was adequate or not, CII and CIII groups were further divided into two subgroups, the noncontact group in which the spinal cord was completely separated from the anterior compressive mass after laminoplasty, and the contact group in which there was residual cord compression after laminoplasty. The recovery rate that based on the Japanese Orthopedic Association score was calculated for each patient.

Results

There were statistically significant differences in the average anterior subarachnoid space among CI, CII, and CIII groups (P < 0.05); the average anterior subarachnoid space was the largest in CI group, and the smallest in CIII group. The space available at the level cephalad had strong sigmoidal correlation with cord postoperative shift in CIII group (R = 0.91). A higher neurologic recovery rate (69% ± 20% vs. 29% ± 11%; P < 0.05) in the noncontact group after surgery than in the contact group, with a similar follow-up period.

Conclusion

The posterior decompression extent is a main factor affecting cord shift distance after laminoplasty in the context of a straightened or lordotic cervical curvature. The space available at the levels cephalad is a key factor to predict cord shift distance in laminoplasty from C3 to C7. Neurologic recovery rate after ELAP is affected by whether the anterior indirect decompression was adequate or not.

### The characteristic clinical symptoms of C-4 radiculopathy caused by ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament [^4b79a453]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy of the C2-4 spinal nerves is a rare condition and is poorly documented in terms of clinical symptoms, hindering its detection during initial patient screening based on imaging diagnostics. The authors describe in detail the clinical symptoms and successful surgical treatment of a patient diagnosed with isolated C-4 radiculopathy. This 41-year-old man suffered from sleep disturbance because of pain behind the right ear, along the right clavicle, and at the back of his neck on the right side. The Jackson and Spurling tests were positive, with pain radiating to the area behind the patient's ear. Unlike in cases of radiculopathy involving the C5-8 spinal nerves, no loss of upper-extremity motor function was seen. Magnetic resonance imaging showed foraminal stenosis at the C3-4 level on the right side, and multiplanar reconstruction CT revealed a beak-type ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament in the foraminal region at the same level. In the absence of intracranial lesions or spinal cord compressive lesions, the positive Jackson and Spurling tests and the C3-4 foraminal stenosis were indicative of isolated C-4 radiculopathy. Microscopic foraminotomy was performed at the C3-4 vertebral level and the ossified lesion was resected. The patient's symptoms completely resolved immediately after surgery. To the authors' knowledge, this report is the first to describe the symptomatic features of isolated C-4 radiculopathy, in a case in which the diagnosis has been confirmed by both radiological findings and surgical outcome. Based on this case study, the authors conclude that the characteristic symptoms of C-4 radiculopathy are the presence of pain behind the ear and in the clavicular region in the absence of upper-limb involvement.

### Anterior spinal pseudomeningocele after C0-C2 traumatic injuries: role of the "dural transitional zone" in the etiopathogenesis [^e869e3b9]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Spinal pseudomeningoceles (SPM) are extradural collections of CSF (cerebrospinal fluid); a frequent association with upper cervical injuries (UCI) has been observed. We propose a possible etiopathogenetic mechanism supporting the formation of cervical SPM based on some considerations.

Methods

We present four cases of SPM. All patients sustained a severe UCI. Three patients were symptomatic with delayed and progressive clinical signs.

Results

One patient was misinterpreted as epidural hematoma and operated on due to progressive signs with postoperative clinical improvement. The rest of patients were treated conservatively; spontaneous reduction of CSF collection occurred. From a radiological standpoint: (1) a line of demarcation separated the intradural cervical compartment from the anterior epidural space, (2) CSF epidural collection was never evident at C0-C2 level and extended from C2 downwards, and (3) shape of collection was similar to epidural hematomas suggesting a ball-valve mechanism.

Conclusions

The dural layer at C0-C2 level is adherent to the thick ligamentous apparatus, as opposed to the segments below where it is solely covered by the posterior longitudinal ligament. A "transitional zone" of dura exists between the C0-C2 region and subaxial segment of the cervical spine. This watershed area constitutes a point of minor resistance. Lacerations of the meningeal layers, caused by severe UCI at the "transitional zone", drain CSF into the anterior epidural space and form SPM.

### Failure of surgical equipoise in posterior cord syndrome myelopathy [^3c939874]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

We suggest that a clinical diagnosis of posterior cord syndrome indicates primary posterior decompression in cervical spondylotic myelopathy cases. We present two unique cases of failed anterior decompression in neutrally aligned necks with compressive myelopathy and a literature review. Two recent cases of cervical spondylotic myelopathy that failed to respond after anterior surgical decompression and fusion surgery were observed at our institution. Both patients had motor strength preservation but were unable to stand and walk independently and had other clinical findings consistent with posterior cord syndrome rather than the more common anterior or central cord syndromes, and both responded well to staged posterior decompression. Posterior cervical decompression successfully relieved posterior cord syndrome symptoms after a failed anterior decompression in both of our cases. Posterior cord syndrome is a rare syndrome best diagnosed clinically and should be considered in cases of cervical spondylotic myelopathy in which motor strength testing is preserved.

Surgical strategy

All patients were positioned under general anesthesia in the prone position. Intraoperative monitoring included MEP, SEP of the upper and lower extremities, and silent periods.

Two patients underwent laminoplasty (Table 2): one patient at two levels (case 1) and the other at one level, with undercutting of both adjacent laminae (case 2). One patient underwent laminectomy at one level (case 3) (Table 2).

After opening the dura and identifying SAW, we dissected the arachnoid membrane and adhesion bands covering the spinal cord (Fig. 3). The spinal cord compression was resolved after dissection, and CSF flow could be observed.

Fig. 3
Identification of SAW and caliber variation of spinal cord during surgery

No significant change in intraoperative monitoring was noted in all cases during surgery.

In one patient (case 1), the membrane underwent histopathological examination.

### Controversial aspects of imaging in child abuse: a second roundtable discussion from the ESPR child abuse taskforce [^56865e55]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Considering the above scenario, what findings will be missed if the spine is not imaged in the context of abusive head trauma? In which scenarios, should whole spine imaging be performed?

Where abusive head trauma is being considered, imaging of the whole spine would aid the diagnosis (of abuse), particularly in the presence of intracranial subdural haemorrhage. One of the authors (AKC) has never seen spinal subdural haemorrhage present without posterior fossa haemorrhage also being present; however, this combination has been reported in the literature.

If spinal imaging in the context of abusive head trauma is limited to the cervical spine, the presence of cervical ligamentous injury should prompt imaging of the whole spine given that is significantly associated with abusive head trauma. Evidence of any additional spinal injury, such as bony or cord injury, should also prompt evaluation of the whole spine. If, on evaluation of cervical spine, spinal subdural haemorrhage is already identified in the cervicothoracic spinal canal, extension of imaging to include the remainder of the spine may not add anything further given that in most of the cases of spinal subdural haemorrhage, no other spinal injury is typically identified. However, this presumes that the patient does not have any clinical sign attributable to spinal cord compression or injury which would also be an indication to image the remainder of the spine.

In summary, imaging of the whole spine is recommended to enable a comprehensive evaluation of the neuraxis in the context of abusive head trauma. Further studies are needed to understand the frequency and importance of these findings and their relationship to both abusive head trauma and accidental trauma.

### Are subjects with spondylotic cervical cord encroachment at increased risk of cervical spinal cord injury after minor trauma? [^8623fb0a]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to analyse the risk of symptomatic myelopathy after minor trauma in patients with asymptomatic spondylotic cervical spinal cord encroachment (ASCCE). In a cohort of 199 patients with ASCCE, previously followed prospectively in a study investigating progression into symptomatic myelopathy, the authors looked retrospectively for traumatic episodes that may have involved injury to the cervical spine. A questionnaire and data file analysis were employed to highlight whatever hypothetical relationship might emerge with the development of symptomatic myelopathy. Fourteen traumatic episodes in the course of a follow-up of 44 months (median) were recorded in our group (who had been instructed to avoid risky activities), with no significant association with the development of symptomatic myelopathy (found in 45 cases). Only three minor traumatic events without fracture of the cervical spine were found among the symptomatic myelopathy cases, with no chronological relationship between trauma and myelopathy. Furthermore, 56 traumatic spinal cord events were found before the diagnosis of cervical cord encroachment was established, with no correlation to either type of compression (discogenic vs osteophytic). In conclusion, the risk of spinal cord injury after minor trauma of the cervical spine in patients with ASCCE appeared to be low in our cohort provided risky activities in these individuals are restricted. Implementation of preventive surgical decompression surgery into clinical practice in these individuals should be postponed until better-designed studies provide proof enough for it to take precedence over a conservative approach.

### Cervical intradural disc herniation with Brown-Séquard syndrome: case report and literature review [^84d82696]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Surgery was performed under general anesthesia, with the aim of C3-6 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) or C4 anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) + C5/6 ACDF. The classic anterior cervical approach was used. C5/6 was completely decompressed and an artificial bone cage (DePuy Synthes, MA, USA) was installed and filled. The C4/5 intervertebral disc was resected. The nucleus pulposus had protruded into the dura mater, and its removal was difficult because of tight adhesions between the dura and the posterior longitudinal ligament. Therefore, subtotal resection of C4 vertebra body was performed. After the nucleus pulposus was removed, a small break in the dura mater, with exudation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), was apparent (Figure 3A). The posterior longitudinal ligament was dissected free of the dura and resected. The dural tear was closed. A titanium mesh (Weigao, ShanDong, China) was then installed and filled with autologous bone. The vertebral body was fixed with a titanium plate and screws (Weigao, ShanDong, China).

Figure 3
Intraoperative photograph and sagittal and axial magnetic resonance images obtained 3 months postoperatively. (A) A small breach in the dura mater (white arrow) was seen after the removal of the nucleus pulposus. There was minimal cerebral spinal fluid leakage. T1-weighted (B) and T2 weighted (C, D) MR images reveal satisfactory segmental decompression and no compression of the dural sac (whitarrow).

Postoperatively, the patient had obvious relief of symptoms. At review 3 months after surgery, muscle strength was normal but mild sensory abnormalities persisted. The shallow feeling of the right limb skin was slightly abnormal. Imaging showed stable internal fixation, satisfactory decompression of the surgical segment, and no compression of the dural sac (Figure 3B – D). At 1 year after surgery, the patient had recovered completely, with normal muscle strength on both sides and no paresthesias. Figure 4 shows the preoperative and follow-up radiographs.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^c9e444d1]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) — soft tissue and discoligamentous assessment is complementary to computed tomography (CT) for characterizing spinal cord injury and MR images are often used to guide surgical interventions. MRI assessment of the discoligamentous complex integrity is a crucial component in preoperative assessment of the C-spine, and discoligamentous injury is invariably present in a mechanically unstable C-spine; MRI is the recommended imaging for assessment of soft tissue injuries, including injury to the discoligamentous complex. MRI can also identify soft tissue injuries frequently associated with C-spine instability, such as epidural hematoma and cord contusion needing surgical management, and compression of the cord by disk herniation, bone fragments, and hematomas is best displayed on MRI. No widely accepted criteria exist for grading the severity of C-spine soft tissue injury on MRI, and while MRI has a high sensitivity for identifying C-spine soft tissue injuries, its specificity for identifying clinically significant cervical soft tissue injuries is modest. For an MRI of the C-spine use T2-weighted images to evaluate for cord edema and gradient echo images that are sensitive for detection of hemorrhage, and in the subacute and chronic stages after cord trauma, MRI can help define the extent of cord injury.

### Correlation between operative outcomes of cervical compression myelopathy and mri of the spinal cord [^f99201b4]. Spine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

Magnetic resonance images of cervical compression myelopathy were retrospectively analyzed in comparison with surgical outcomes.

Objectives

To investigate which magnetic resonance findings in patients with cervical compression myelopathy reflect the clinical symptoms and prognosis, and to determine the radiographic and clinical factors that correlate with the prognosis.

Summary Of Background Data

Signal intensity changes of the spinal cord on magnetic resonance imaging in chronic cervical myelopathy are thought to be indicative of the prognosis. However, the prognostic significance of signal intensity change remains controversial.

Methods

The participants in this study were 73 patients who underwent cervical expansive laminoplasty for cervical compression myelopathy. Their mean age was 64 years, and the mean postoperative follow-up period was 3.4 years. The pathologic conditions were cervical spondylotic myelopathy in 42 patients and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament in 31 patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (spin-echo sequence) was performed in all the patients. The transverse area of the spinal cord at the site of maximal compression was computed, and spinal cord signal intensity changes were evaluated before and after surgery. Three patterns of spinal cord signal intensity changes on T1-weighted sequences/T2-weighted sequences were detected as follows: normal/normal, normal/high-signal intensity changes, and low-signal/high-signal intensity changes. Surgical outcomes were compared among these three groups. The most useful combination of parameters for predicting prognosis was determined using a stepwise regression analysis.

Results

The findings showed 2 patients with normal/normal, 67 patients with normal/high-signal, and 4 patients with low-signal/high-signal change patterns before surgery. Regarding postoperative recovery, the preoperative low-signal/high-signal group was significantly inferior to the preoperative normal/high-signal group. There was no significant difference between the transverse area of the spinal cord at the site of maximal compression in the normal/high-signal group and the low-signal/high-signal group. A stepwise regression analysis showed that the best combination of surgical outcome predictors included age (correlation coefficient R = -0.348), preoperative signal pattern, and duration of symptoms (correlation coefficient R = -0.231).

Conclusions

The low-signal intensity changes on T1-weighted sequences indicated a poor prognosis. The authors speculate that high-signal intensity changes on T2 weighted images include a broad spectrum of compressive myelomalacic pathologies and reflect a broad spectrum of spinal cord recuperative potentials. Predictors of surgical outcomes are preoperative signal intensity change pattern of the spinal cord on radiologic evaluations, age at the time of surgery, and chronicity of the disease.

Neurological findings and complications

Chronic changes identified in the spinal cord following injury include atrophy, myelomalacia, syrinx, focal cyst formation and cord disruption. Delayed progressive intramedullary cystic degeneration complicates 3–4% of traumatic SCIs (Fig. 12). This progression to syringomyelia is felt to involve arachnoid adhesions, presumably secondary to haemorrhage and inflammation at the time of injury, which alters and/or obstructs the flow of cerebral spinal fluid and leads to expansion of the central canal. Risk factors for progression of syringomyelia and neurologic deterioration include arachnoiditis, cord compression and kyphosis. Treatment is reserved for symptomatic or expanding syrinx with the goal to restore CSF flow dynamics.

Neuromuscular scoliosis is a known complication of SCI. The patient age at time of injury is a major determinate in the severity of spinal deformity. Ambulatory status is the other major determinate, with more severe deformity in the non-ambulatory patients. Progressive curvature causes difficulty with transfers and sitting upright (Fig. 13). In contrast to idiopathic juvenile scoliosis, bracing is ineffective in the treatment of neuromuscular scoliosis as patients typically do not possess the motor function to contract the axial muscles to help correct their curvature. Surgical correction may be required for severe or progressive cases. Laminectomies in the thoracic spine at the time of injury can result in progressive post-laminectomy kyphosis.

### Complete surgical resection of a C3 neuroenteric cyst with concurrent cervical fusion deformity through posterior midline approach in the lateral position: case report [^e207e715]. Neurosurgery Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION

A 36-year-old female patient presented with a 4-week history of progressive left neck pain. Initial MRI scans on admission revealed a cystic mass located extramedullary and subdural at the C3 level, approximately 12 × 15 × 17 mm in size. This mass was situated on the ventral side of the spinal cord, causing compression and displacement. Further radiological evaluation with computed tomography scans demonstrated fusion deformity of the C4-6 vertebral bodies, along with the disappearance of the intervertebral space. Based on the imaging findings and clinical presentation, a diagnosis of neuroenteric (or enterogenous) cyst was suggested. However, clinical examination did not reveal any positive signs, and the patient had no significant medical history or related diagnostic and treatment processes (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1.
Preoperative imaging data of the patient. A, Preoperative MRI of the spine shows an anteriorly placed central extramedullary cyst at the C3 level. B, The spinal cord was compressed by this ventrally located cyst. C, Computed tomography scans showed fusion deformity of C4-6.

We adopted a posterior surgical approach in the lateral position, resected the C2-3 laminae, and cut the dentate ligament. With opening the cyst, we gently tractioned the capsule and the lesion was completely resected (Video). Intraoperative electrophysiological neuromonitoring was used to maintain the integrity of neurological functions during surgery (Figure 2).

FIGURE 2.
Surgical findings during the operation. A, The surgery was performed through a posterior median approach in the lateral position under intraoperative neuroelectrophysiological monitoring. B, After resecting the dentate ligament, the cyst was gradually exposed. C, Without opening the cyst wall, the cyst was completely resected under microscopic.

The postoperative course was uneventful, and postoperative MRI confirmed complete removal of the cyst. The patient was discharged without neurological dysfunction. Follow-up at 6 months showed that the patient had resumed normal life, and MRI showed no residual lesions (Figure 3).

Finally, it is possible to perform combined approach, particularly indicated for patients with severe kyphotic angulation necessitating decompression of 3 or more levels.

To date, decompressive surgery remains the most effective long-term treatment for this pathology, although the decision of which type of approach use and when to perform such a procedure remains challenging.

Several prognostic factors could affect the outcome after surgical management. The most important prognostic factors are duration of symptoms, preoperative neurological status, the effective diameter of the canal, number of compression levels, intrinsic cord alterations (assessed from pre-operative MRI study), and other clinic-radiological features. In recent years, novel techniques have been applied to investigate central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

### Semiautomated pipeline effectively assesses severity and monitor disease progression in compressed spinal cord of degenerative cervical myelopathy patients [^cb619ac8]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a progressive and disabling condition resulting from chronic compression of the spinal cord, leading to functional impairments that can severely affect quality of life. Traditional methods for assessing spinal cord injury and morphometrics rely on subjective visualization of contrast changes and manual segmentation, which are nonstandardized, time-consuming, and inconsistent across patients. This variability limits understanding of DCM pathology and hampers timely clinical intervention.

METHODS:

We introduce a semiautomated pipeline using the Spinal Cord Toolbox, an open-source platform that uses advanced algorithms, including optimization and computational efficiency algorithms, support vector machine, and convolutional neural networks, to streamline the assessment of spinal cord shape, microstructural changes, and gray and white matter integrity. By integrating spinal cord segmentation, anatomical labeling, and registration to a standardized template, the pipeline extracts normalized morphometric measures, providing efficient and reliable analysis of spinal cord pathology in DCM.

RESULTS:

We extracted normalized spinal cord morphometrics, including cross-sectional area (CSA), anterior-posterior diameter, right-left diameter, eccentricity, solidity, gray matter CSA, white matter CSA, and regional and tract-based magnetization transfer ratio measures. Our analysis demonstrates that DCM patients exhibit significant reductions in these morphometrics compared with healthy controls, even in regions without visible compression. Furthermore, CSA reductions across the spinal cord highlight areas of severe compression, including at the intervertebral disks, which may not be apparent on standard imaging.

CONCLUSION:

These quantitative measures give clinicians easily interpretable data on the extent of spinal cord injury, even in regions without obvious compression. This enables a comprehensive understanding of DCM pathophysiology. By eliminating the subjectivity of manual segmentation and accounting for intersubject and intrasubject variability, this approach supports consistent cross-subject comparisons and is poised to reshape how clinicians assess and manage DCM.

We reviewed the MRI of seven patients with syringomyelia associated with surgically proven adhesive spinal arachnoiditis to describe clinical and MRI findings in this condition. Using 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 tesla units, we obtained sagittal T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo and axial T1-weighted images. Additional sagittal T2-weighted images were obtained without using motion-artefact suppression. Contrast medium was given intravenously to five patients. The syrinx cavities were thoracic in five cases, cervicothoracic in one, and extended from C4 to L1 in one. No Chiari malformation or craniovertebral junction anomaly was demonstrated. Meningeal thickening was seen on T2-weighted sagittal images only in one case. Cord deformity due to adhesion or displacement due to an associated arachnoid cyst was seen in all cases best demonstrated on axial images. Focal blurring of the syrinx wall on axial images was seen in six patients. Flow voids were seen in the syrinx fluid in all cases on T2-weighted images obtained without motion-artefact suppression. No abnormal contrast enhancement was demonstrated.

The following constitutes key background information on cervical spine injury:

- **Definition**: Cervical spine injury is a traumatic disruption of the cervical vertebrae, intervertebral discs, or cervical spine ligaments, which can result in spinal cord compression or transection leading to transient or permanent loss of motor, sensory, and autonomic functions.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of cervical spine injury involves the initial mechanical trauma, which can cause spinal cord compression, transection, or both. This is followed by a secondary injury phase characterized by spinal cord ischemia, edema, and hemorrhage. The extent of the injury depends on the severity of the trauma and the level of the spinal cord affected.
- **Epidemiology**: The annual incidence of traumatic cervical spine injury in Western populations is reported at 4–17 per 100,000 person-years. Spinal cord injuries in the US are reported to represent 3% of hospital trauma admissions.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for cervical spine injury include high-energy trauma, such as motor vehicle accidents and falls from height, as well as certain medical conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Other risk factors include violence, alcohol use, diving, and sports-related injuries.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of cervical spine injury can vary widely. Initial presentation often includes neck pain, stiffness, and tenderness, along with neurological deficits such as weakness or numbness in the limbs. In severe cases, the condition can progress to quadriplegia, respiratory failure, and autonomic dysfunction. Patients can also have associated injuries, such as head trauma, atlanto-occipital dissociation, occipital condyle fracture, anterior subluxation, facet joint dislocation, spinal epidural hematoma, and vertebral artery injury.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of cervical spine injury is generally poor for complete spinal cord injuries. During the initial hospital stay, over 50% of patients with spinal cord injury develop multisystem complications. The 30-day mortality rate is reported to be 9.4%. Early surgical intervention can help decrease the instantaneous death risk, especially in early surgery.

Cross-sectional surface area for the spinal canal and cord

The cross-sectional surface areas of the spinal canal and cord are summarised in Table 4 and Figs. 5 and 6. There is a narrowing of spinal canal at C3 level, although the variation in spinal canal cross-sectional surface area is not significant. On the other hand, the spinal cord is narrowest at C1/2 level (56 and 51 mm², respectively), although again the inter-level variation in area is not significant (p = 0.191). However, there is a significant inter-level variation in the ratio of the spinal canal to cord transverse area (p = 0.014) (Figs. 7 and 8). C2 has the lowest ratio at 0.44. The relative uniform spinal cord surface area along the cervical spine is in contrast with the marked reduction AP diameter at C1/2 levels. Such observation can be explained by the change in cross-section of the cord, as expressed by the reduction of RAPT at higher cervical levels (0.59 at C1 and 0.52 at C2 compared to above 0.64 from C3 to C7) (p < 0.001) (Table 5). When compressed in an antero-posterior direction, the spinal cord is seen to be displaced into the potential space of the lateral recesses, with an associated change in shape from round to oval, similar to cord compression in cervical spondylosis.

The inter-subject variation in spinal cord cross-sectional surface area is statistically significant (p < 0.001), like the CBR, AP canal and cord diameters. However, while the variations of other parameters are not age-dependent, the spinal cord surface area is inversely correlated with the age, with a coefficient of −0.7078 mm²/year (p = 0.038). In other words, the cervical spinal cord is narrower in older children with Morquio-Brailsford syndrome.

### MRI morphometric characterisation of the paediatric cervical spine and spinal cord in children with MPS IVA (Morquio-Brailsford syndrome) [^64f77daf]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In this MRI study, children with MPS IVA generally have a normal spinal canal to vertebral body ratio and therefore strictly speaking do not have congenital spinal stenosis as part of the skeletal dysplasia and platyspondily universally found in MPS IVA. However because of the reduced dimensions of both the spinal canal and spinal cord found in MPS IVA affected children compared to normal adults, the value of this ratio in predicting cord compression is suspect.

There is a reduction in the antero-posterior canal diameter at C1–C2, and a relatively reduced C1–C2 spinal cord volume. The cord volume was significantly smaller than their healthy counterparts and was measured just above levels considered to have poor prognosis for recovery of cord compression. This study has introduced a number of measurement methods and has shown that these methods are useful in evaluating the extent of cord compression and may be clinically applied in the management and prognostication of compressive myelopathy in MPS IVA children.

### ABCs of the degenerative spine [^ea5819d3]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Complications of disc displacement may be neurological, vascular or focal. Neurological complications are related to nerve root and spinal cord compression, which are the most common complications of disc herniation. At any spinal level, an acute persistent neurological deficit from disc herniation is a medical emergency, which may require surgical decompression. Vascular complications develop secondary to acute or chronic compression of the vertebral artery or medullary segmental arteries feeding the spinal cord (large cervical radiculomedullary at level C5–C7; dominant radiculomedullary artery at T4–T5; the artery of Adamkiewicz located at T10 and the additional radiculomedullary artery of Deproges-Gotteron arises at the L4–L5 level), which may cause a severe neurological deficit and also may require intervention. Focal complications occur because of long-standing inflammatory changes secondary to persistent fluctuating or chronic hernia, which eventually may lead to extensive epidural scarring (without surgical intervention). Normally, the nerve roots freely move in the foraminae with body movements. Epidural scarring limits nerve root passage through foraminae and may cause nerve root tethering. This process is virtually impossible to identify at imaging. Acute disc sequestration in the settings of adhesions between the ventral wall of the dura and the posterior longitudinal ligament may lead to dural perforation and developing intradural herniation. This is a very rare complication, comprising only 0.27% of all herniated discs and mostly occurring on the lumbar spine. Epidural vein varicosis, enlargement of epidural veins secondary to disc herniation usually on the lumbar spine, can mimic the clinical signs of disc herniation or spinal stenosis. MRI has been reported to be of high value in demonstrating the dilated epidural vein but the findings might be misinterpreted as herniated nucleus pulposus material.

Many studies have reported the spontaneous regression or disappearance of disc herniations without surgical management. Sequestrations have the highest likelihood of regressing radiographically in the shortest timeframe in comparison to the other subtypes of disc herniation. Although the exact mechanism of this phenomenon is unknown, dehydration and shrinkage appear to play a primary role and can be clearly demonstrated using MRI because of the decreasing water content over time. After disc material sequestrates into the epidural space, it is recognised as a foreign body, and autoimmune and inflammatory responses lead to neovascularisation, enzymatic degradation and macrophage phagocytosis.

### Diagnostic tests… [^ca643f90]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Spinal cord injuries are critical emergencies that must be recognized and treated early to increase the possibility of preventing permanent loss of function. The physician should perform a systematic, thorough motor and sensory examination of the patient's extremities. Chronic mild neurologic deficits involving a single nerve root may not necessarily be considered a red flag because these deficits are common in patients with degenerative pathologies such as disc herniation and lateral stenosis. However, a more aggressive approach is required when a patient has progressive neurologic deficits.
2. Babinski's sign and hyperreflexia are widely understood to be cardinal signs of the upper motor neuron syndrome that typically occurs in spinal cord compression. The physician should be aware that, if present, a positive Babinski's sign is helpful, but a negative or absent sign does not exclude severe disease.

One emergency department study found that nine patients who presented with severe myelopathy had a low incidence of extensor plantar responses and hyperreflexia. 7 The criteria for ordering plain-film radiographs of the cervical spine are summarized in Table 5, 5 and the recommended indications for CT scanning are summarized in Table 6 5 The initial evaluation of suspected injury to the cervical spine includes a cross-table lateral plain-film radiograph with the patient supine. If the lateral projection is inadequate, a swimmer's projection, oblique projections or a CT scan is indicated. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Lateral radiographs of the cervical spine must always be followed by anteroposterior and open-mouth projections.

Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the thoracic or lumbar regions are indicated in patients with localized tenderness or a suspicious mechanism of injury. Because there is a 10 to 15 percent incidence of spinal fractures at more than one site, consideration must always be given to radiographic examination of the entire spine when one fracture is identified. Herniation of a cervical disc is not uncommon. The presentation is similar to that for lumbar disc herniation. MRI is the modality of choice for identifying cervical disc herniation.

### Posterior endoscopic cervical decompression in metastatic cervical spine tumors: an alternative to palliative surgery [^d84d9685]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Metastatic spinal cord compression of the cervical spine is a well-known consequence of cancer that generally manifests as an oncological emergency. This study presents and describes an alternative to the minimally invasive posterior full-endoscopic approach for direct decompression and tumor debulking from the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the cervical spine. A 54-year-old man presented with progressive cervical radiculopathy that had persisted for 3 months. The underlying disease was HCC. Radiographic examination revealed evidence of metastatic spinal cord compression with an epidural mass at the C4-C5 levels, which compressed the C4-C5 spinal cord without bony destruction. The modified Tomita score was 6 to 8 points based on palliative surgery. A posterior full-endoscopic approach to remove the tumor from the metastasis of HCC in the cervical spine was done. A postoperative radiographic study revealed adequate tumor mass resection and spinal decompression. The patient was extremely satisfied with this alternative treatment and achieved complete neurologic recovery at 1 month and no recurrent symptoms at the 6-month follow-up. The technique of posterior full-endoscopic decompression of cervical metastasis causing unilateral radiculopathy, presented in this study, is feasible. This surgical intervention seems to be optional minimally invasive and acts as an alternative to palliative surgery.

### A late neurological complication following posterior correction surgery of severe cervical kyphosis [^2b54b418]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Though a possible cause of late neurological deficits after posterior cervical reconstruction surgery was reported to be an iatrogenic foraminal stenosis caused not by implant malposition but probably by posterior shift of the lateral mass induced by tightening screws and plates, its clinical features and pathomechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this retrospective clinical review was to investigate the clinical features of these neurological complications and to analyze the pathomechanisms by reviewing pre- and post-operative imaging studies. Among 227 patients who underwent cervical stabilization using cervical pedicle screws (CPSs), six patients who underwent correction of cervical kyphosis showed postoperative late neurological complications without any malposition of CPS (ND group). The clinical courses of the patients with deficits were reviewed from the medical records. Radiographic assessment of the sagittal alignment was conducted using lateral radiographs. The diameter of the neural foramen was measured on preoperative CT images. These results were compared with the other 14 patients who underwent correction of cervical kyphosis without late postoperative neurological complications (non-ND group). The six patients in the ND group showed no deficits in the immediate postoperative periods, but unilateral muscle weakness of the deltoid and biceps brachii occurred at 2.8 days postoperatively on average. Preoperative sagittal alignment of fusion area showed significant kyphosis in the ND group. The average of kyphosis correction in the ND was 17.6° per fused segment (range 9.7°-35.0°), and 4.5° (range 1.3°-10.0°) in the non-ND group. A statistically significant difference was observed in the degree of preoperative kyphosis and the correction angles at C4-5 between the two groups. The diameter of the C4-5 foramen on the side of deficits was significantly smaller than that of the opposite side in the ND group. Late postoperative neurological complications after correction of cervical kyphosis were highly associated with a large amount of kyphosis correction, which may lead foraminal stenosis and enhance posterior drift of the spinal cord. These factors may lead to both compression and traction of the nerves, which eventually cause late neurological deficits. To avoid such complications, excessive kyphosis correction should not be performed during posterior surgery to avoid significant posterior shift of the spinal cord and prophylactic foraminotomies are recommended if narrow neuroforamina were evident on preoperative CT images. Regardless of revision decompression or observation, the majority of this late neurological complication showed complete recovery over time.

### Cervical myelopathy caused by posttraumatic osteophytes resulting from long-standing neglected posterior atlanto-occipital dislocation more than 30 years: a case report [^48c65d33]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Traumatic AOD is typically caused by high-energy trauma. Furthermore, the report on survival in traumatic AOD is extremely rare and only showed in the form of a case report. Early surgical stabilization including OCF is recommended as the standard treatment. In the case of intractable neck pain by severe osteoarthritis of atlanto-occipital or antlato-axial joint, the neck pain could be significantly improved by OCF or atlanto-axial fusion. However, in the patient presented, we performed laminectomy of the C1 posterior arch without OCF for several reasons. First, no significant instability in the C0-C1 joint was noted on preoperative dynamic radiographs. This finding suggested that prolonged AOD, neglected for 20 years, had caused severe osteoarthritic changes of the C0-C1 joint, resulting in a stable situation. Second, the patient has lived well for 20 years as a farmer without significant problems but needed surgical intervention because daily activity was impossible after abrupt onset of cervical myelopathy. Third, the main cause of cervical myelopathy was severe spinal cord compression between posttraumatic osteophytes and C1 posterior arch. Therefore, we believed that removal of the C1 posterior arch was sufficient to achieve decompression of the spinal cord. As expected, the cervical myelopathy significantly improved after surgery, and the patient was doing well without recurring symptoms at a long-term follow-up. In conclusion, we reported the first patient with cervical myelopathy caused by neglected posterior AOD with posttraumatic osteophytes of the C0-C1-C2 joints, which was successfully treated by laminectomy of the C1 posterior arch without OCF.

We scheduled a two-stage decompression for both the OPLL and OYL. First, we performed laminectomy on the C3-C6 segments and resected the OYL. We did not observe any dural tear or CSF leakage in the dura. The patient's neurological symptoms improved. After the laminectomy, his myelopathy recurred. Postoperative MRI showed a spinal cord herniation. We had the C3/4 anterior cervical disectomy and fusion as we planned. In addition, we performed a surgery to repair the damaged dura mater at the site of spinal cord herniation at the same second surgery. The integrity of the arachnoid membrane was preserved. The patient's myelopathy gradually improved. There have been no reports on postoperative neurological deterioration caused by spinal cord herniation associated with a dural defect at the laminectomy site, without dural tear in the surgery after the resection of a posteriorly located cervical OYL. The possibility of a dural defect in OYL cases should be considered when planning a laminectomy for the resection of the OYL.

### Which kind of prognosis is better in the treatment of cervical and lumbar disc herniation with coblation nucleoplasty? [^0a8437c7]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

The research was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University (Ethical Application Reference: PJ 2024–02–52) and was registered at the Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2400089145). This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and clinical practice guidelines. All patients had previously signed informed consent for the procedure. Consecutive patients who suffered from CDH or LDH between May 2016 and June 2017 were included in this single-center retrospective cohort study.

Inclusion Criteria

(1) The diagnosis of a single segmental cervical/lumbar disc herniation was confirmed by clinical manifestations and CT/MRI examination. (CDH: Pain in the shoulder and neck region or radicular upper limb pain; LDH: Low back pain or radicular lower limb pain) (2) The patients had failed to respond to previous medical or physical treatment for at least three months. (3) There was no evidence of severe spinal cord compression or obvious changes in spinal cord signals. (4) The protruded nucleus pulposus was enclosed by annulus fibrosus or posterior longitudinal ligament and did not form free fragments in the spinal canal.

Exclusion Criteria

The study excluded patients who had a history of cervical/lumbar surgery or significant spinal stenosis, motor weakness, fracture, cervical or lumbar instability, suspected infection tumor or spondylolisthesis. Patients who had more than two symptomatic discs were also excluded.

### Clinical reasoning: a 64-year-old man with history of meningitis presenting with proximal weakness of the arms [^68e2ec8a]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

A 64-year-old man presented for evaluation of proximally pronounced weakness of the arms with preserved facial and lower extremity strength. Symptoms slowly developed over the last 2 years, and the patient's history was notable for severe Listeria monocytogenes meningitis 4 years before presentation, which was adequately treated with antibiotics. On examination, symptoms clinically reassembled man-in-the-barrel syndrome and localized to the cervicothoracic central cord. Blood analysis was unremarkable, and CSF analysis showed no recurrent or persistent infection. Spinal MRI revealed pockets of sequestered CSF from C3 to C4 and areas of CSF space effacement from C3 to T12. MRI findings were interpreted as cord tethering suggestive of adhesive arachnoiditis. CT myelogram showed insufficient contrast agent migration above T10 and contour irregularities of the conus medullaris, confirming the postulated pathomechanism of cord tethering. Final diagnosis was therefore cervicothoracic central cord damage due to cord tethering in the setting of postinfectious adhesive arachnoiditis following bacterial meningitis. The patient failed a course of pulsed methylprednisolone therapy, and symptoms progressed. Best supportive care was provided. The clinical presentation of adhesive arachnoiditis is variable, and advanced imaging techniques and invasive studies such as CT myelogram may be required to establish the diagnosis. Timely diagnosis is warranted as early surgical or medical therapy can improve symptoms.

### Posterior surgical approach for ventral cervical spinal cord herniation: 2-dimensional operative video [^ddd2ecac]. Operative Neurosurgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Spinal cord herniation (SCH) is a rare condition that is typically of idiopathic origin. Although SCH is mostly found in the thoracic region because of a dural defect, there are some reports of cervical SCH following surgery or trauma.1–3 Spinal cord tethering can be a result of SCH or as a standalone issue.4,5 These conditions can lead to progressive neurological deficits, including numbness, gait disturbances, and decreased muscle strength, requiring surgical correction. There are limited reports of surgical procedures for ventral SCHs. Several reports exist using a ventral approach for intradural tumors, but it is not commonly employed because of the inability to obtain adequate dural closure.6 Much of the literature on SCH comes from idiopathic and congenital cases in the thoracic spine.7,8 Posterior and posterolateral approaches for a ventral thoracic SCH have been described, as well as an anterior approach for a ventral cervical SCH.9–12 In this video, we describe a posterior approach for a ventral cervical SCH. A 38-yr-old male presented with progressive cervical myelopathy 9 yr after a C2-C3 schwannoma resection requiring an anterior approach and corpectomy of C3 with partial corpectomies of C2 and C4. A preoperative magnetic resonance imaging showed a ventrally herniated spinal cord at the top of the C3 vertebral body and below the C4 vertebral body. Informed consent was obtained. The posterior surgical approach involved a C1-C5 laminectomy, sectioning the dentate ligament, ventral cord untethering, removal of residual tumor, and placement of a ventral sling. A significant improvement in sensory and motor function was observed postoperatively.

### Anterior cervical spinal cord tethering after anterior spinal surgery: case report [^aa3cbba3]. Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

This is the first reported case of anterior cervical spinal cord tethering after anterior spinal surgery. A mechanistic hypothesis is presented to explain the observed phenomenon.

Clinical Presentation

A patient developed cervical myelopathy 2 years after multiple anterior cervical discectomies complicated by cerebrospinal fluid leakage. She demonstrated reflex and motor changes as well as neuropathic pain.

Intervention

An anterior corpectomy was performed, with opening of the dura and detethering of an arachnoid band and then fusion and plating.

Conclusion

Reflex and motor changes improved, but pain did not. We hypothesize that mechanical deformation and scar formation after cerebrospinal fluid leakage may have led to tethering of the spinal cord.

Miscellaneous

Compressive myelopathy

A common cause of weakness and sensory deficits in older patients is cervical compressive myelopathy or myelopathic spondylosis, which can occur secondary to spondylotic changes in the cervical spine and less commonly because of congenital abnormalities. The mechanism of injury involves decreased canal diameter and spinal stenosis, with resultant focal signal abnormality within the affected cord (Fig. 23). Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a common contributor. Compressive myelopathy typically demonstrates focal T2 hyperintensity in the cord at a level of spinal stenosis (at the level of a disc) with or without associated enhancement (Table 5).

Miscellaneous lesion summary

Hirayama disease

Hirayama disease is a disease of young males, mostly recognised in Japan and India. It presents with unilateral upper extremity weakness. The disease is related to a lax dura mater, which changes position with flexion and extension. Resulting repetitive circulatory changes in the anterior spinal artery due to cord compression cause atrophy and eventual necrosis in the anterior horns. MRI plays an essential role in the diagnosis of this rare disease (Fig. 24). Neutral cervical spine images are not very sensitive in showing the pertinent changes, and if there is clinical concern for this condition, flexion images should be obtained. Forward displacement of the dura mater is seen, with anterior cord compression and enlargement of the posterior epidural space, which may enhance post contrast. On transverse sections, there is atrophy of the anterior horns, which is typically asymmetric (Table 5).

### Long-term surgical outcome and risk factors in patients with cervical myelopathy and a change in signal intensity of intramedullary spinal cord on magnetic resonance imaging [^0aa09482]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2010). Low credibility.

Object

The goal of this study was to determine the long-term clinical significance of and the risk factors for intramedullary signal intensity change on MR images in patients with cervical compression myelopathy (CCM), an entity most commonly seen with cervical spondylotic myelopathy and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).

Methods

One hundred seventy-four patients with CCM but without cervical disc herniation, severe OPLL (in which the cervical canal is < 10 mm due to OPLL), or severe kyphotic deformity (> 15 degrees of cervical kyphosis) who underwent surgery were initially selected. One hundred eight of these patients were followed for > 36 months, and the 71 patients who agreed to MR imaging examinations both pre- and postsurgery were enrolled in the study (the mean follow-up duration was 60.6 months). All patients underwent cervical laminoplasty. The authors used the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score and recovery ratio for evaluation of pre- and postoperative outcomes. The multifactorial effects of variables such as age, sex, a history of smoking, diabetes mellitus, duration of symptoms, postoperative expansion of the high signal intensity area of the spinal cord on MR imaging, sagittal arrangement of the cervical spine, presence of ventral spinal cord compression, and presence of an unstable cervical spine were studied.

Results

Change in intramedullary signal intensity was observed in 50 of the 71 patients preoperatively. The pre- and postoperative JOA scores and the recovery ratio were significantly lower in the patients with signal intensity change. The mean JOA score of the upper extremities was also significantly lower in these patients. Twenty-one patients showed hypointensity in their T1-weighted images, and a nonsignificant correlation was observed between intensity in the T1-weighted image and the mean JOA score and recovery ratio. The risk factors for signal intensity change were instability of the cervical spine (OR 8.255, p = 0.037) and ventral spinal cord compression (OR 5.502, p < 0.01). Among these patients, 16 had postoperative expansion of the high signal intensity area of the spinal cord. The mean JOA score and the recovery ratio at the final follow-up were significantly lower in these patients. The risk factor for postoperative expansion of the high signal intensity area was instability of the cervical spine (OR 5.509, p = 0.022). No significant correlation was observed between signal intensity on T1-weighted MR images and postoperative expansion of the intramedullary high signal intensity area on T2-weighted MR images.

Conclusions

Long-term clinical outcome was significantly worse in patients with intramedullary signal intensity changes on MR images. The risk factors were instability of the cervical spine and severe ventral spinal compression. The long-term clinical outcome was also significantly worse in patients with postoperative expansion of the high signal intensity area. The fact that cervical instability was a risk factor for the postoperative expansion of the high signal intensity indicates that this high signal intensity area occurred, not only from necrosis secondary to ischemia of the anterior spinal artery, but also from the repeated minor traumas inflicted on the spinal cord from an unstable cervical spine. The long-term neurological outcome found in the preliminary study of patients with CCM who had cervical instability and intramedullary signal intensity changes on MR images suggests that surgical treatment should include posterior fixation along with cervical laminoplasty or anterior spinal fusion.

KEY RESULTS:

All measures presented are extracted at C3 level. MT, magnetization transfer; MTR, magnetization transfer ratio; WM, white matter; GM, gray matter; CSA, cross sectional area; CNN, convolutional neural networks; RL, right-left (transverse) diameter; AP, anterior-posterior diameter; HC, healthy control; DCM, degenerative cervical myelopathy.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most common cause of spinal cord disorder in individuals aged older than 50 years leading to significant neurological impairment and reduced quality of life. The complex pathogenesis of DCM, driven by chronic spinal cord compression from multifactorial causes such as disk herniation and osteophyte formation, results in a highly variable clinical presentation. Parameters such as spinal cord shape, morphometrics, and hyperintensity are recognized as key biological markers because they show association with clinical symptoms of DCM.

Despite growing recognition of spinal cord morphometrics such as cross-sectional area (CSA), shape alterations, and microstructural integrity as valuable biomarkers, - the widespread adoption of these measures in clinical practice has been limited. Manual segmentation of spinal cord MRI is labor-intensive, prone to variability, and particularly challenging in regions of compression, creating barriers to clinical translation. To address these challenges, we designed an analysis pipeline based on the Spinal Cord Toolbox (SCT), to streamline the extraction of key morphometric data from spinal cords of patients with DCM. This pipeline is a game-changing solution that can provide clinicians with standardized, quantitative metrics that are easy to interpret and clinically actionable, even in complex compression regions of the spinal cord. We incorporate a Batch-processing command that enables reliable and rapid extraction of spinal cord morphometrics across multiple subjects. Evidence from Muhammad et al has demonstrated the efficacy of this automated pipeline in extracting morphometric data from compressed spinal cords in 36 DCM patients, whereas Haynes et al further validated its performance in generating clinically relevant white matter (WM) injury metrics to elucidate the severity of DCM.

Our study leverages this pipeline to demonstrate how morphometric analysis can enhance clinical decision making in DCM, facilitating early diagnosis, improved monitoring, and prognosis of DCM.

### Spinal cord shift on magnetic resonance imaging at 24 hours after cervical laminoplasty [^3978bc53]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

A prospective study in 19 patients after cervical laminoplasty, using magnetic resonance imaging.

Objective

To evaluate the value of spinal cord shift at 24 hours after cervical laminoplasty.

Summary Of Background Data

Postoperative C5 palsy is a noticeable complication within 1 week after cervical laminoplasty. The root tethering due to the posterior shift of the spinal cord after laminoplasty was reported as one of the causes of C5 palsy. However, the spinal cord shift after surgery within 1 week is unknown.

Methods

The posterior shift of the spinal cord was measured in 19 consecutive patients on magnetic resonance images at 24 hours and 2 weeks after cervical laminoplasty.

Results

The mean posterior shift of the spinal cord at 24 hours was 2.8 mm, with the maximum at the C5 level, decreasing to 1.9 mm at 2 weeks. The posterior shift of the spinal cord at C5 was correlated with the amount of the dura mater at C4, C5, and C6 levels. In a patient with right C5 palsy, posterior shift at C5 level was 5.5 mm, decreasing to 3.0 mm at 2 weeks after surgery. The posterior shift of the spinal cord was not correlated with the sagittal alignment.

Conclusion

The posterior shift of the spinal cord at 24 hours had a tendency to shift more posteriorly than that observed at 2 weeks after cervical laminoplasty. C5 palsy may be prevented if the expansion of dura mater, which is strongly correlated with the posterior shift, can be controlled.

### Upper cervical cord compression due to a C-1 posterior arch in a patient with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and a kyphotic cervical spine in the protruded-head position: case report [^101ea47d]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2013). Low credibility.

In this paper the authors report the case of a patient with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) below the axial vertebra (C-2) at the kyphotic cervical spine, with an atlas vertebra (C-1) posterior arch that compressed the spinal cord with the head in a pathognomonic position, similar to a protruded position. This condition appears to be very rare. The morphological findings between the kyphotic cervical spine and OPLL, the upper occipitocervical junction, and the protruded-head position are discussed. A 40-year-old man presented with severe pain radiating to both legs when he yawned, sneezed, or extended his jaw (a protruded-head position). A kyphotic cervical spine with OPLL below C-2 was observed using CT and radiography, yet sagittal T2-weighted MRI failed to identify abnormal findings in a neutral or extension position, except for a slight cervical canal stenosis. However, in a pathognomonic protruded-head position, sagittal T2-weighted MRI showed a C-1 posterior arch that severely compressed the spinal cord at the upper cervical level. Therefore, the authors believe that the severe pain radiating to both legs was caused by a spinal canal stenosis due to a C-1 posterior arch impingement. The C-1 posterior arch was resected, and after the surgery, the patient indicated that the intolerable pain had disappeared. In conclusion, in patients with OPLL and a kyphotic cervical spine, the authors propose that the pathognomonic protruded position is valuable for estimating disrupted compensatory mechanisms at the upper cervical junction.

### Cervical spinal cord compression attributable to a calcified intervertebral disc in a patient with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets: case report and review of the literature [^bdc28b94]. Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets is a common inherited phosphate-wasting disorder, but it is a rare cause of spinal cord compression. We present the first reported case of a calcified intervertebral disc causing spinal canal stenosis in X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets.

Clinical Presentation

A 44-year-old woman presented with paresthesia of her left arm and a loss of grip in both hands. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a calcified intervertebral disc, as well as a posterior osteophytic bar causing marked cervical cord compression at C6/C7.

Intervention

An anterior cervical discectomy at C6/C7 and fusion with autologous bone graft were performed. The patient then exhibited significant improvement.

Conclusion

A review of the 16 published cases demonstrates that thickening of the vertebral laminae, facet joint hypertrophy, and ossification of the intervertebral discs, posterior longitudinal ligament, and/or ligamentum flavum contribute to spinal canal stenosis in X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets. Those changes are caused by the disease itself and are unlikely to be related to long-term vitamin D treatment. Eleven of 16 patients were reported to have experienced favorable outcomes after surgery.

### Lateral approach for resection of the C3 corpus: technical case report [^7af2dda1]. Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

The C3 level is the transition zone between the upper and lower cervical spine. Because of its high position and anatomic relationships to significant structures, exposing C3 is challenging, and the surgical approach is controversial.

Clinical Presentation

A 16-year-old girl was admitted to our institution with a 3-year history of neck pain and progressive quadriparesis. Neuroradiological examination revealed severe spinal cord compression from kyphosis at the C3 level.

Technique

We used the lateral approach to resect the C3 corpus and realign the cervical spine. Resecting the transverse processes of C2-C4 and mobilizing the V2 segment of the vertebral artery adequately exposed C3 for resection. Bilateral occipitocervical fusion was performed in a second procedure, and no postoperative complications occurred. The patient's neurological status improved drastically after surgery, and she has had no craniocervical instability during the follow-up period.

Conclusion

The lateral approach to the C3 corpus offers the greatest degree of cord decompression and easy access to the lesion in a wide and sterile operative field. We describe the surgical technique of this approach as an alternative to the anterior transmucosal or anterolateral retropharyngeal approach.

### Surgical treatment of upper, middle and lower cervical injuries and non-unions by anterior procedures [^dc7f9cb3]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The goals of any treatment of cervical spine injuries are: return to maximum functional ability, minimum of residual pain, decrease of any neurological deficit, minimum of residual deformity and prevention of further disability. The advantages of surgical treatment are the ability to reach optimal reduction, immediate stability, direct decompression of the cord and the exiting roots, the need for only minimum external fixation, the possibility for early mobilisation and clearly decreased nursing problems. There are some reasons why those goals can be reached better by anterior surgery. Usually the bony compression of the cord and roots comes from the front therefore anterior decompression is usually the procedure of choice. Also, the anterior stabilisation with a plate is usually simpler than a posterior instrumentation. It needs to be stressed that closed reduction by traction can align the fractured spine and indirectly decompress the neural structures in about 70%. The necessary weight is 2.5 kg per level of injury. In the upper cervical spine, the odontoid fracture type 2 is an indication for anterior surgery by direct screw fixation. Joint C1/C2 dislocations or fractures or certain odontoid fractures can be treated with a fusion of the C1/C2 joint by anterior transarticular screw fixation. In the lower and middle cervical spine, anterior plating combined with iliac crest or fibular strut graft is the procedure of choice, however, a solid graft can also be replaced by filled solid or expandable vertebral cages. The complication of this surgery is low, when properly executed and anterior surgery may only be contra-indicated in case of a significant lesion or locked joints.

### MRI morphometric characterisation of the paediatric cervical spine and spinal cord in children with MPS IVA (Morquio-Brailsford syndrome) [^8b0c15c8]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2013). Low credibility.

When evaluating cord compression, measurements of spinal stenosis using x-rays and CT alone may be less helpful in patients with MPS IVA and other MPS conditions. These patients have a significant soft tissue mass component to their spinal stenosis and the ensuing cord compression may be underestimated unless a CT scan soft tissue filter or protocol is used. Because MRI demonstrates the spinal cord and spinal canal directly, it is the most useful technique in diagnosing stenosis and cord compression in this region of the spine. To date, no study has compared the SAC measurement for determining stenosis with the Torg ratio (Solanki).

Spinal canal and cord measurements

In normal adults, the spinal canal at C1 level measures 22 mm (20–26 mm), decreasing to 20 mm at C2, and between 14 and 22 mm between C3–7. The sagittal cord at C1 measures 10.4 mm (7–11 mm), decreasing to 9 mm (7–10 mm) at C2, and averages 8.5 mm (6–9 mm) between C3–7. The transverse cord measures 10–14 mm. The reserve area for the spinal cord should include a subarachnoid space for CSF. A reduced cross-sectional surface area of the cord (30–44 mm²) is known to correlate with poor outcome. An antero-posterior (AP) spinal canal diameter of about 12 mm is probably associated with symptoms, and of less than 14 mm is associated with cervical stenosis at any segment (Kessler). In adults, a spinal canal of about 15–16 mm is usually asymptomatic.

Other normal measurements of upper cervical spine on conventional radiographs and multi-dimensional CT (MDCT) are compared in Table 1.

### Cross-sectional transverse area and hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging in relation to the clinical picture in cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^0d88adac]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective observational cohort study.

Objective

To ascertain the threshold of critical spondylotic cervical cord compression and its relation to MRI-increased signal intensities.

Summary Of Background Data

The critical degree of spinal cord compression required to induce significant clinical signs remains unknown.

Methods

The study group consisted of 243 patients (mean age, 53.9 ± 9.8 years), with spondylotic cervical spine compression. The transverse cross-sectional area of the spinal cord at the level of maximum compression was measured, while MRI hyperintensities were recorded and related to clinical status and quantified by modified JOA score (mJOA).

Results

A statistically significant difference in mJOA was shown between patients with a spinal cord sectional area of under 50 mm² and a group of patients with a spinal cord sectional area of over 60 mm². This difference was highly significant (P = 0.001) in a subgroup with MRI hyperintensities (187 patients, P = 0.001), whereas within the group of patients without hyperintensities this difference was not observed (P = 0.63).

Conclusion

The critical degree of spinal cord compression needed to induce clinically significant signs was found between 50 and 60 mm2 of cross-sectional transverse area at the level of maximal compression in association with MRI hyperintensities.

### Acute central cord syndrome: injury mechanisms and stress features [^0e6fd39c]. Spine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Design

Numerical techniques were used to study the mechanisms of acute central cord syndrome.

Objective

To analyze the features of stress distribution in the cervical cord under different injury conditions using finite element model of the cervical cord and to improve the understanding of the possible pathogenesis of acute central cord syndrome.

Summary Of Background Data

Acute central cord spinal injury was initially attributed to hemorrhagic damage to the central portion of the spinal cord, but recent histopathologic studies showed that it was predominantly a white matter injury. The precise anatomic location of neuronal injury and the etiology of the clinical manifestation were poorly understood.

Methods

Cervical cord injury was simulated using a finite element model of the cervical enlargement described previously, with the model loaded under 3 traumatic postures: neutral, flexion, and extension. Five traumatic conditions were simulated and analyzed: hyperextension with the pinch force directed to the anterior (A) or posterior (B); flexion injuries (C), vertical compression with the pinch force directed to the anterior (D) or posterior (E). After simulation, several representative cross-sections of each traumatic pattern were selected. In each cross-section, the average von Mises stress of 9 regions, such as anterior funiculus, lateral part of the lateral funiculus, medial part of the lateral funiculus, lateral part of the posterior funiculus, medial part of the posterior funiculus, anterior horn, the bottom of anterior horn, the cervix cornu posterioris, the caput cornu posterioris, and the apex cornu posterioris was recorded.

Results

High localized stress occurred at the portion under compression injury and the level above it. High localized stress tended to occur at the lateral part of the anterior horn motor neurons innervating the hand muscles in traumatic conditions A and D. Under conditions A, D, and E, the average localized stress at the anterior and posterior horn of the gray matter was higher than that at the white matter in all selected cross-sections, and the stress was higher at the anterior funiculus, the medial part of the lateral funiculus, and the lateral part of the posterior funiculus in the white matter. Under conditions B and C, the differences of the localized stress between the gray and the white matter were not as significant as under conditions A, D, and E, and the stress was lower at the medial part of the lateral funiculus than that at the lateral part of the posterior funiculus. Under all traumatic conditions, the average stress at the lateral part was higher than that at the medial part of the posterior funiculus.

Conclusion

Three common traumatic patterns: hyperextension, flexion, and vertical compression, could be the possibly underlying injury mechanisms of the central cervical cord syndrome according to the results of the current finite element analysis. The stress features under different injury conditions were not in complete accord. High stress mainly occurred at the posterior horn, the anterior horn, and the adjacent white matter. The centermost lesion was not common in mild central cord injuries. The upper extremity weakness should be ascribed to the damage at the corticospinal tract and the motor neurons in the anterior horn. Hyperpathia probably resulted from injuries to the posterior horn, the anterior funiculus, and the fasciculus cuneatus. Just as there are varieties of the localized stress features in central cord injuries, variations in clinical presentations were common.

### Beyond the spinal canal [^94171193]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Cross-sectional spinal imaging is common, and extraspinal findings are often incidentally identified during interpretation. Although some of these findings may cause symptoms that mimic a spinal disorder, the majority are entirely asymptomatic and incidental. It is essential that the radiologist not only identify those abnormalities that may have clinical significance but also recognize those that are clinically irrelevant and thereby prevent patients from being subjected to further unnecessary, expensive and potentially harmful interventions. This article focuses on those abnormalities that are commonly encountered and provides practical guidance for follow-up and management based on current recommendations.

### Long-term impacts of different posterior operations on curvature, neurological recovery and axial symptoms for multilevel cervical degenerative myelopathy [^0e54324a]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

In patients with kyphotic deformities who underwent the laminectomy alone, the spinal cord shifted to the anterior portion of the spinal canal and abutted the posterior aspect of the vertebral bodies at the apex of the deformity. With the progression of kyphosis, the mechanical stress applied to the anterior aspect of the spinal cord eventually increased. In addition, segmental instability, which is often seen at the level of kyphosis particularly in cervical flexion movement, might cause cervical degeneration acceleration and osteophytosis, thus further hindering spinal cord function recovery. Our long-term follow-up results revealed that segmental and kyphotic instability after laminectomy could be the main cause of poor neurological recovery. Therefore, we presumed that the restoration of cervical lordosis and strengthening of cervical stability may be pivotal factors in neurological recovery.

At final follow-up, 58.2% (57/98) of the entire group experienced axial symptoms, an incidence consistent with previous studies. The incidence of axial symptoms was 66.7% (24/36) for group LP, 76.7% (23/30) for group LC, and 37.5% (12/32) for group LCS, respectively; the difference was statistically significant. The incidence of axial symptoms can be as high as 30–80%, but the exact reason is unknown. Takeuchi et al. believed that the axial symptoms were related to cervical kyphotic deformity. Otani et al. proposed that lateral retraction of paravertebral muscles attached on the cervical spine and removal of lamina and ligamentum flavum in laminectomy, especially the semispinalis attached on the C2 spinous process, increased the flexion mechanical stress, which may be a significant factor in the development of axial symptoms. Tang et al. demonstrated that the severity of neck pain and disability increases with positive sagittal malalignment following surgical reconstruction. The present study showed that axial symptom severity was positively correlated with loss of CI, which meant that the symptoms would get worse if the cervical curvature index was more severely lost. However, some patients in the final follow-up did not complain of neck pain (group LP 12/36; group LC 7/30; group LCS 20/32). Although the patients of three groups complained more or less of neck pain after surgery in short time, neck pain was gradually improved in groups LP and LCS with the restoration of cervical lordosis and strengthening of cervical stability. Our study suggested that the incidence of axial symptoms can be reduced by the restoration of cervical lordosis and strengthening of cervical stability.

### MRI morphometric characterisation of the paediatric cervical spine and spinal cord in children with MPS IVA (Morquio-Brailsford syndrome) [^6e6dbb28]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Stenosis in MPS IVA

In MPS IVA, stenosis of the spinal canal may be multi-segmental or segmental. At each level the stenosis may be central, lateral recess or foraminal when there is encroachment of the central space, of the lateral recess or of the root exit foraminae respectively. The most likely sites for spinal cord compression are where the cord is normally at its thickest, in the axial cervical spine (C1–C2), brachial expansion in the subaxial spine (C4–C7), and at the conus medullaris (L1–L2). Unfortunately it is also at the vicinity of these sites that the deposition of glycosaminoglycans seems to be greater such as in the C1–C2 joint. Also, kyphotic curves are the most pronounced such as in the cervico-thoracic and the thoraco-lumbar junctions.

In the axial cervical spine (C1–C2 level) the spinal cord is at particular risk. The thickening of the connective tissues within the bony spinal canal, particularly the anterior soft tissue deposition of GAGs in the cruciate ligament and the indentation by the posterior arch of the atlas, further compound cord compression. Dens hypoplasia increases instability which can lead to secondary intermittent or fixed compression.

In the subaxial spine (C3–7), it is not uncommon to see multi-segmental thickening of the posterior longitudinal ligament and ligamentum flavum encroaching on the mid-cervical expansion of the cervical cord. Below this level we often see a prominent cervico-thoracic curve, giving the typical swan-neck appearance in these children in an attempt to maintain cervical extension, a position more protective of the cervical spinal cord than in neutral or flexion positions.

Multi-segmental stenosis is associated with generalized thickening of the posterior longitudinal ligament perhaps due to GAG (glycosaminoglycan) deposition. Thickening of the posterior longitudinal ligament and ligamentum flavum becomes more prominent with increasing age and contributes to functional canal stenosis and cord compression.

Assessing cervical instability. Cervical flexion-extension lateral radiographs in (a) can be difficult to interpret. The pre-dental space is obscured by delayed ossification of the dens and superimposition of the mastoid processes (arrow). Measuring the spinal canal at C1-2 between the base of the odontoid process of C2 and the posterior arch of C1 is preferred (white lines). Flexion-extension CT with sagittal reformation and soft-tissue filtration in (b) shows the cone-shaped dens, a thickened cruciate ligament, and small thick cartilaginous posterior arch of C1 (arrow). With flexion, there is narrowing of the canal between the body of C2 and the cartilaginous posterior arch of C1 (white lines). T2 TSE sagittal flexion-extension MR has the advantage of imaging the spinal canal and cord directly. As shown in (c), there is spinal stenosis and flexion instability sufficient to compress the cervical cord at C1-2 (arrow)

Spinal canal stenosis

Stenosis of the spinal canal may be diffuse (multi-segmental) or focal (segmental). Stenosis is classified as central, lateral recess or circumferential whether it is focal or diffuse. Diffuse stenosis is the combined result of multi-segmental thickening of the connective tissues within the bony spinal canal, particularly of the posterior longitudinal ligament and ligamentum flavum. Bulging discs also play a role, particularly at the thoracolumbar region. Diffuse stenosis is most likely to result in spinal cord compression at the brachial expansion (C4-C7) and at the conus medullaris (T10-L1), all levels where the cord is normally at its thickest. Generalized thickening of the posterior longitudinal ligament and the ligamentum flavum due to GAG deposition are therefore the main contributors to diffuse cord compression.

### Complications of a unilateral nondisplaced cervical facet fracture in a patient with previously noninstrumented anterior cervical fusion [^d4f586b3]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

At 1-month follow-up, the patient reported no axial neck pain. He reported mild right shoulder pain with overhead activity and forward flexion. At 3 months after surgery, the patient reported feeling much better and was no longer required pain medications. His right shoulder pain had completely resolved, and his left arm pain had markedly improved. Standing upright AP, lateral, and flexion-extension views of the cervical spine demonstrated stable alignment of the cervical spine with solid maintenance of the C4-C5 reduction, C2-T1 posterior fusion, and instrumentation at 3 months (Figure 4).

### Cervical cord compression due to delayed scarring around epidural electrodes used in spinal cord stimulation [^eda0f39f]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2010). Low credibility.

The authors report on 2 cases of delayed compression of the cervical spinal cord by dense scar tissue forming around epidural electrodes implanted for spinal cord stimulation (SCS). This complication has not been previously reported. Myelopathy developed in 2 patients 5 and 16 years after the surgical placement of a cervical epidural electrode. Prior to myelopathy, both patients experienced a tolerance phenomenon. Magnetic resonance imaging in both cases showed severe compression of the spinal cord by the electrode. At surgery, thick scar tissue surrounding the electrode and compressing the posterior aspect of the cord was discovered. Both patients experienced a full recovery following the removal of both scar tissue and the electrode. Medical and paramedical staff dealing with SCS should be aware of this severe and delayed complication. In addition, the development of epidural fibrosis can explain the occurrence of tolerance.
