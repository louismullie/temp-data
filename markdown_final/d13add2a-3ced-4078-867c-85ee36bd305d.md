## Question

Refractory epilepsy AEDs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about antiseizure medication (ASM) management in drug-resistant epilepsy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining drug-resistant epilepsy and confirming the diagnostic threshold. Then, I should verify the initial management steps before escalating pharmacotherapy. Next, I will review the highest-certainty evidence for adjunctive ASMs in adults with focal seizures, followed by pediatric-specific data. After that, I need to examine combination strategies and their limitations. I will then consider non-pharmacologic options, including surgery and devices. Finally, I should address special populations, safety, and synthesize a practical algorithm with attention to uncertainties and evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the definition and epidemiology so I don't anchor on an outdated criterion. Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) is generally defined as failure of two appropriately chosen and used ASMs, whether as monotherapy or in combination, to achieve sustained seizure freedom, and it affects roughly 30% of people with epilepsy, with higher prevalence in focal epilepsies and certain syndromes, which underscores the need for early referral to comprehensive epilepsy centers after two failures [^117NYuNe] [^1166LoFp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "refractory" until we've verified the basics. I need to ensure the diagnosis is correct, classify the seizure type and syndrome accurately, confirm adherence, exclude pseudoresistance, and review comorbidities and drug–drug interactions before escalating therapy; this step is crucial because misclassification or nonadherence can masquerade as pharmacoresistance and delay effective care [^111wuBNw] [^117NYuNe].

> Next, I should review the highest-certainty evidence for adjunctive ASMs in adults with treatment-resistant focal epilepsy. Immediate-release pregabalin and perampanel have Level A evidence for reducing seizure frequency as add-on therapy, with pregabalin showing a dose–response and perampanel demonstrating efficacy across a range of doses; however, both carry tolerability trade-offs, particularly sedation and dizziness, which must be balanced against benefit in shared decision-making [^113jvdop] [^112CJs8f] [^115Mwm5x].

> I will now examine other agents with strong but slightly lower-certainty recommendations. Lacosamide, eslicarbazepine, and extended-release topiramate carry Level B support for adjunctive therapy in adults with treatment-resistant focal epilepsy, and lamotrigine has supportive evidence in generalized tonic–clonic seizures within generalized epilepsies; I should confirm syndrome-specific nuances and patient-specific factors before choosing among them [^113jvdop] [^1166utg1].

> Let me consider third-generation options with promising signals. Brivaracetam shows moderate-certainty evidence for ≥ 50% seizure reduction and a signal for seizure freedom in adults with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, though withdrawals for adverse events are more frequent; cenobamate demonstrates robust efficacy with about 52% responders and 16% achieving seizure freedom in two RCTs, but adverse events are common and dose titration is critical to mitigate risks [^112afHBt] [^113A6uwj].

> Wait, I should double-check pediatric-specific data because adult efficacy does not automatically translate. Levetiracetam has Class I evidence as adjunctive therapy in children with treatment-resistant focal epilepsy across age strata, with target pediatric doses of 60 mg/kg/day for ages 4–16 years and 40–50 mg/kg/day for infants, showing significant responder rates; zonisamide and oxcarbazepine also have Level B support in defined pediatric age groups, reinforcing the need for age-tailored selection and dosing [^11554gTe] [^1147iZzh] [^1134JM2v].

> I need to check combination strategies carefully because most evidence is observational. Real-world effectiveness analyses suggest that approximately 15% of patients with refractory focal epilepsy may achieve seizure freedom on triple therapy, with LTG/VPA/TPM and LTG/VPA/LEV showing notable efficacy; however, these data are nonrandomized and confounded, so I should avoid overinterpreting them and instead use them to inform hypothesis-driven, mechanism-diverse combinations when dual therapy fails [^114PbV5q] [^113Mg85Z].

> Hold on, I should verify the principle of rational polytherapy. Combining agents with complementary mechanisms and favorable interaction profiles is biologically plausible, but the evidence base is limited; a classic observational study suggested lamotrigine plus valproate might outperform other combinations, yet confounding and retrospective design limit inference, so I must communicate uncertainty and monitor closely for efficacy and toxicity when layering drugs [^115nquW5].

> Next, I should review non-pharmacologic options because medication alone may not suffice. After failure of two appropriate ASMs, early referral to a comprehensive epilepsy center is recommended to evaluate candidacy for resective surgery, which offers the highest chance of durable seizure freedom in selected focal epilepsies; neuromodulation options such as vagus nerve stimulation, responsive neurostimulation, and deep brain stimulation can be considered when surgery is not feasible or has failed [^117NYuNe] [^115U7cDQ].

> But wait, what if the patient has a genetic epilepsy or is in a special population. I need to ensure syndrome-specific therapies are considered, such as rufinamide for Lennox–Gastaut syndrome and stiripentol for Dravet syndrome, and recognize that precision approaches targeting the underlying genetic mechanism are emerging though not yet broadly available; in people with intellectual disability, standard ASMs generally retain efficacy but behavioral adverse effects require vigilant monitoring and individualized risk–benefit assessment [^113jvdop] [^112xFQEN] [^116ctAwh].

> I should confirm safety priorities that change the risk–benefit calculus in DRE. Uncontrolled seizures elevate SUDEP risk, and a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials suggests that achieving meaningful seizure reduction with efficacious adjunctive ASMs is associated with substantially lower SUDEP incidence compared with placebo, supporting active treatment optimization even when complete seizure freedom is elusive; I must also counsel patients about adverse effects, teratogenic risks, and drug–drug interactions during regimen adjustments [^116uYuZd] [^116suNDj].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm while acknowledging uncertainties. After confirming the diagnosis, adherence, and optimal dosing of two appropriate ASMs, refer to a comprehensive epilepsy center; in adults with focal seizures, prioritize Level A options such as pregabalin, perampanel, or brivaracetam/cenobamate based on comorbidities and tolerability, consider Level B agents like lacosamide or eslicarbazepine if needed, and in children prioritize levetiracetam or age-appropriate options; if dual therapy fails, a cautious, mechanism-diverse triple regimen may be tried with close monitoring, and throughout, maintain an active surgical evaluation pathway and consider neuromodulation when appropriate [^117NYuNe] [^113jvdop] [^114PbV5q].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated the certainty of triple therapy. I should emphasize again that triple-therapy seizure freedom rates come from observational cohorts and within-patient comparisons, not randomized trials, so they should be framed as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive; shared decision-making should explicitly communicate this uncertainty and the trade-offs of increased adverse effects and drug load [^114PbV5q] [^113Mg85Z].

> Finally, I need to ensure longitudinal reassessment is built into the plan. Even in highly refractory cohorts, approximately 19% achieve at least 12 months of seizure freedom over long-term follow-up with further medication changes, and about half of those who remit remain seizure-free at five years; this argues for periodic re-evaluation of the regimen, avoidance of therapeutic nihilism, and timely reconsideration of surgical or device options as the disease course evolves [^114wj9V7] [^114wj9V7].

Refractory epilepsy affects ~30% of patients [^117NYuNe] and is defined by persistent seizures despite two appropriately selected and dosed AEDs [^116k41Yn]. Management centers on **rational polytherapy** [^113vRDEF] with complementary mechanisms, careful titration, and monitoring for adverse effects and drug interactions [^113vRDEF]. If seizures persist, **early referral** to a comprehensive epilepsy center is essential to evaluate for surgery, neuromodulation, or dietary therapy [^113w9mKZ]. Emerging options such as brivaracetam [^112afHBt], cenobamate [^113A6uwj], and precision therapies offer additional hope, but sustained seizure control remains challenging and requires individualized, multidisciplinary care [^112xFQEN].

---

## Definition and epidemiology

Refractory epilepsy is defined as failure of at least two appropriately chosen and adequately dosed AEDs, whether as monotherapy or combination therapy, to achieve sustained seizure control [^117NYuNe]. It affects approximately 30% of patients with epilepsy [^1166LoFp] and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and reduced quality of life [^114nTJdH].

---

## Mechanisms of pharmacoresistance

Several mechanisms underlie pharmacoresistance in epilepsy, including:

- **Pharmacokinetic resistance**: Overexpression of multidrug transporters such as P-glycoprotein at the blood-brain barrier, reducing AED concentrations at therapeutic targets [^1166LoFp].

- **Pharmacodynamic resistance**: Alterations in drug targets, including mutations in voltage-gated ion channels and changes in synaptic transmission, diminishing AED efficacy [^1166LoFp].

- **Network hypothesis**: Seizure-induced neural network reorganization and hyperexcitability, rendering seizures self-sustaining and resistant to medication [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnosis

Accurate diagnosis of refractory epilepsy requires a thorough clinical evaluation, including:

- **Detailed seizure history**: Semiological analysis, triggers, and patterns of seizure occurrence [^115U7cDQ].

- **Neuroimaging**: MRI to identify structural abnormalities, such as cortical dysplasia, hippocampal sclerosis, or tumors [^115U7cDQ].

- **Electroencephalography (EEG)**: Video-EEG monitoring to characterize seizure types and localize epileptogenic zones [^notfound].

- **Neuropsychological assessment**: Cognitive and psychological evaluation to guide treatment decisions and assess comorbidities [^1116roEM].

---

## Pharmacological management strategies

### Rational polytherapy

Rational polytherapy involves combining AEDs with **complementary mechanisms of action** to enhance efficacy and reduce seizure frequency [^113vRDEF]. Commonly used combinations include:

| **Combination therapy** | **Mechanisms of action** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Levetiracetam + lamotrigine | Synaptic vesicle protein 2A modulation + sodium channel blockade | Effective in reducing seizure frequency [^notfound] |
| Valproate + lamotrigine | GABAergic enhancement + sodium channel blockade | Effective in refractory focal epilepsy [^notfound] |
| Clobazam + valproate | GABAergic enhancement + GABAergic enhancement | Effective in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome [^notfound] |

---

### Third-generation antiepileptic drugs

Recent additions to the AED arsenal include **third-generation drugs** with novel mechanisms and improved tolerability profiles:

- **Brivaracetam**: High-affinity synaptic vesicle protein 2A ligand, effective as adjunctive therapy in drug-resistant epilepsy [^112afHBt].

- **Cenobamate**: Potent inhibitor of voltage-gated sodium currents and positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors, showing significant efficacy in refractory focal epilepsy [^113A6uwj].

- **Perampanel**: AMPA receptor antagonist, effective in refractory focal and generalized epilepsies [^113jvdop].

---

### Precision medicine approaches

Advances in genetic testing and molecular profiling enable **personalized treatment strategies** targeting specific genetic mutations and underlying pathophysiology [^112xFQEN]. Examples include:

- **Dravet syndrome**: Cannabidiol and fenfluramine have demonstrated efficacy in reducing seizure frequency [^notfound].

- **CDKL5 deficiency disorder**: Trofinetide has shown promise in improving seizure control and developmental outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

For patients who remain refractory despite optimal pharmacological management, **non-pharmacological interventions** should be considered:

- **Epilepsy surgery**: Resective surgery, such as temporal lobectomy, can achieve seizure freedom in approximately 60–70% of carefully selected patients [^115U7cDQ].

- **Neuromodulation**: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and responsive neurostimulation (RNS) are effective in reducing seizure frequency and improving quality of life [^notfound].

- **Dietary therapies**: Ketogenic diet and modified Atkins diet are effective, particularly in pediatric refractory epilepsies [^notfound].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Ongoing research and development efforts focus on novel therapeutic targets, including **ion channel modulators, GABAergic enhancers, and anti-inflammatory agents** [^notfound]. Gene therapy and RNA-based approaches targeting specific genetic mutations are under investigation [^notfound]. Improved clinical trial designs, including adaptive trials and biomarker-driven strategies, aim to accelerate drug development and enhance efficacy [^notfound].

---

## Challenges and limitations

Despite advances, several challenges persist:

- **Limited efficacy**: Only approximately 50% of patients achieve meaningful seizure reduction with new AEDs, and sustained seizure freedom remains elusive for many [^116suNDj].

- **Adverse effects**: Long-term use of AEDs is associated with cognitive impairment, mood disturbances, and metabolic complications [^notfound].

- **Individual variability**: Genetic, demographic, and disease-specific factors contribute to variability in treatment response, necessitating individualized care [^113vRDEF].

---

Refractory epilepsy remains a significant clinical challenge, requiring a **multidisciplinary approach** and individualized treatment strategies. While pharmacological management remains the cornerstone, emerging therapies and non-pharmacological interventions offer hope for improved seizure control and quality of life.

### Etiology and management of refractory epilepsies [^1166LoFp]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2007). Medium credibility.

The epilepsies are an important, common and diverse group of symptom complexes characterized by recurrent spontaneous seizures. Although many patients with epilepsy have their seizures controlled effectively by antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), about one-third of patients continue to have seizures, despite trying a range of AEDs. Such patients bear the heaviest burden of epilepsy, with increased morbidity and risk of premature mortality. Our current understanding of the refractory epilepsies — the most common of which are focal — is limited; even their definition is problematic. Standard treatments for refractory epilepsies include optimization of existing AED regimens, trials of further AEDs, and, for some patients, therapeutic resective neurosurgery. Recent basic research has explored possible underlying causes of refractory epilepsy, and two main hypotheses have emerged to account for the failure of AED treatment. According to one hypothesis, AEDs might fail because of alterations in the properties of their usual targets. Alternatively, they might fail because multidrug transporter mechanisms limit concentrations of the drugs at their targets. The refractory epilepsies can be viewed as offering remarkable insights into biological processes in the epilepsies, and their effective treatment remains an important aim; treatment would potentially bring much-needed relief to hundreds of thousands of patients across the world.

### Development of new antiepileptic drugs: challenges, incentives, and recent advances [^117JQ2mM]. The Lancet: Neurology (2007). Medium credibility.

Despite the introduction of many second-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the past 15 years, a third of patients with epilepsy remain refractory to available treatments, and newer and more effective therapies are needed. Although our understanding of the mechanisms of drug resistance is fragmented, novel AED targets have been identified, and models of refractory epilepsy have been developed that can help to select candidate compounds for development. There are more than 20 compounds with potential antiepileptic activity in various stages of clinical development, and for many of these promising clinical trial results are already available. Several incentives justify further investment into the discovery of newer and more effective AEDs. Moreover, developments in clinical trial methodology enable easier completion of proof-of-concept studies, earlier definition of the therapeutic potential of candidate compounds, and more efficient completion of trials for various epilepsy indications.

### Key factors in the discovery and development of new antiepileptic drugs [^111UTgXJ]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2010). Medium credibility.

Since the early 1990s, many new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that offer appreciable advantages in terms of their favourable pharmacokinetics, improved tolerability and lower potential for drug-drug interactions have entered the market. However, despite the therapeutic arsenal of old and new AEDs, approximately 30% of patients with epilepsy still suffer from seizures. Thus, there remains a substantial need for the development of more efficacious AEDs for patients with refractory seizures. Here, we briefly review the emerging knowledge on the pathological basis of epilepsy and how it might best be used in the design of new therapeutics. We also discuss the current approach to AED discovery and highlight some of the unique features of newer models of pharmacoresistance and epileptogenesis that have emerged in recent years.

### When the antiepileptic drugs are not working [^111wuBNw]. Practical Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Most patients with epilepsy respond to the initial antiepileptic drug (AED). But, as the responders are discharged, our clinics inevitably accumulate a number of "refractory" patients who require more manipulation of their treatment. This article looks at ways in which the identification and management of refractory epilepsy can be enhanced. The most important thing is to be able to assess if the initial diagnosis and classification are correct, and if the epilepsy is genuinely refractory, or if other medical or social issues are contributing to the deterioration in AED control. Once any treatment resistance is confirmed, specific attention should be paid to thorough investigation and, if appropriate, treatment manipulation. As all AEDs are equally efficacious, it is knowledge of the drug pharmacology and of expected adverse effects that is most helpful in determining drug choice. For those patients who do not fully respond to any medication, the challenges are to provide maximum benefit with minimum adverse effects, reducing risk to life, and risk to quality of life.

### Clonazepam add-on therapy for refractory epilepsy in adults and children [^1124G94t]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Epilepsy affects about 50 million people worldwide, nearly a quarter of whom have drug-refractory epilepsy. People with drug-refractory epilepsy have increased risks of premature death, injuries, psychosocial dysfunction, and a reduced quality of life.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of clonazepam when used as an add-on therapy for adults and children with refractory focal onset or generalised onset epileptic seizures, when compared with placebo or another antiepileptic agent.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases on 14 September 2017: Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO), MEDLINE (Ovid 1946 to 14 September 2017), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).

Selection Criteria

Double-blind randomised controlled studies of add-on clonazepam in people with refractory focal or generalised onset seizures, with a minimum treatment period of eight weeks. The studies could be of parallel or cross-over design.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted relevant data, and assessed trial quality. We contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

No double-blind randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence from double-blind randomised controlled trials for or against the use of clonazepam as an add-on therapy for adults and children with refractory focal or generalised onset epileptic seizures.

### Lamotrigine add-on for drug-resistant partial epilepsy [^1113gjFg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the Cochrane review published in The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 1. Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, affecting almost 0.5% to 1% of the population. For nearly 30% of these people, their epilepsy is refractory to currently available drugs. Pharmacological treatment remains the first choice to control epilepsy. Lamotrigine is one of the newer antiepileptic drugs and is the topic of this review. Lamotrigine in combination with other antiepileptic drugs (add-on) can reduce seizures, but with some adverse effects. The aim of this systematic review was to overview the current evidence for the efficacy and tolerability of lamotrigine when used as an adjunctive treatment for people with refractory partial epilepsy.

Objectives

To determine the effects of lamotrigine on (1) seizures, (2) adverse effect profile, and (3) cognition and quality of life, compared to placebo controls, when used as an add-on treatment for people with refractory partial epilepsy.

Search Methods

For the previous version of the review, the authors searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (January 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1950 to January 2010), and reference lists of articles. For this update, we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (28 May 2015), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 4), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to May 2015), and reference lists of articles. We also contacted the manufacturers of lamotrigine (GlaxoSmithKline). No language restrictions were imposed.

Selection Criteria

Randomised placebo-controlled trials of people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy of any age, in which an adequate method of concealment of randomisation was used. The studies were double-, single- or unblinded. For cross-over studies, the first treatment period was treated as a parallel trial. Eligible participants were adults or children with drug-resistant partial epilepsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

For this update, two review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion, and extracted data. Outcomes included 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, treatment withdrawal (any reason), adverse effects, effects on cognition and quality of life. Primary analyses were by intention-to-treat. Sensitivity best and worse case analyses were undertaken to account for missing outcome data. Pooled Risk Ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% Cl) were estimated for the primary outcomes of seizure frequency and treatment withdrawal. For adverse effects, pooled RRs and 99% Cls were calculated.

Main Results

We did not identify any new studies for this update, therefore, the results are unchanged. For the previous version of the review, the authors found five parallel add-on studies and eight cross-over studies in adults or children with refractory focal epilepsy, and one parallel add-on study with a responder-enriched design in infants. In total, these 14 studies included 1958 participants (38 infants, 199 children, and 1721 adults). Baseline phases ranged from 4 to 12 weeks; treatment phases from 8 to 36 weeks. Overall, eleven studies (n = 1243 participants) were rated as having a low risk of bias, and three (n = 715 participants) had un unclear risk of bias due to lack of reported information around study design. Effective blinding of studies was reported in three studies (n = 504 participants). The overall risk ratio (RR) for 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency was 1.80 (95% CI 1.45 to 2.23; 12 RCTs) for twelve studies (n = 1322 participants, adults and children) indicating that lamotrigine was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing seizure frequency. The overall RR for treatment withdrawal (for any reason) was 1.11 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.36; 14 RCTs) for fourteen studies (n = 1958 participants). The adverse events significantly associated with lamotrigine were: ataxia, dizziness, diplopia, and nausea. The RR of these adverse effects were as follows: ataxia 3.34 (99% Cl 2.01 to 5.55; 12 RCTs; n = 1524); dizziness 2.00 (99% Cl 1.51 to 2.64;13 RCTs; n = 1767); diplopia 3.79 (99% Cl 2.15 to 6.68; 3 RCTs; n = 943); nausea 1.81 (99% Cl 1.22 to 2.68; 12 RCTs; n = 1486). The limited data available precluded any conclusions about effects on cognition and quality of life. No important heterogeneity between studies was found for any of the outcomes. Overall, we assessed the evidence as high to moderate quality, due to incomplete data for some outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Lamotrigine as an add-on treatment for partial seizures appears to be effective in reducing seizure frequency, and seems to be fairly well tolerated. However, the trials were of relatively short duration and provided no evidence for the long-term. Further trials are needed to assess the long-term effects of lamotrigine, and to compare it with other add-on drugs. Since we did not find any new studies, our conclusions remain unchanged.

### Refractory epilepsy: one size does not fit all [^112z8xw5]. Epilepsy Currents (2007). Low credibility.

A unifying definition of refractory epilepsy has been hotly debated but, to date, has not been agreed upon. Evidence from clinical trials indicates that some patients actually are not refractory, as many will partially respond to add-on treatment or will worsen when antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are removed. There are several important issues relating to the assessment of AED response that routinely have not been addressed in the determination of treatment responsiveness, such as incorporating baseline seizure severity, including partial response rather than solely an all-or-none response, and the consideration of variability in response over time.

### Felbamate as an add-on therapy for refractory partial epilepsy [^113DPGG3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 7, 2014) on 'Felbamate as an add-on therapy for refractory epilepsy'. Epilepsy is a chronic and disabling neurologic disorder, affecting approximately 1% of the population. Up to 30% of people with epilepsy have seizures that are resistant to currently available drugs. Felbamate is one of the second-generation antiepileptic drugs and we have assessed its effects as an add-on therapy to standard drugs in this review.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of felbamate versus placebo when used as an add-on treatment for people with refractory partial-onset epilepsy.

Search Methods

For the latest update we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, up to 20 October 2016. There were no language and time restrictions. We reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies to search for additional reports of relevant studies. We also contacted the manufacturers of felbamate and experts in the field for information about any unpublished or ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised placebo-controlled add-on studies of people of any age with refractory partial-onset seizures. The studies could be double-blind, single-blind or unblinded and could be of parallel or cross-over design.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted information. We resolved disagreements by discussion. If disagreements persisted, the third review author arbitrated. We assessed the following outcomes: 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency; absolute or percentage reduction in seizure frequency; treatment withdrawal; adverse effects; quality of life.

Main Results

We included four randomised controlled trials with a total of 236 participants. Two trials were parallel design, the third had a two-period cross-over design, and the fourth had a three-period cross-over design. Two studies were at an unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. These two studies did not include any description of their methods for outcome assessment and performance blinding (i.e. participants or doctors). Two studies were at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. Due to significant methodological heterogeneity, clinical heterogeneity and differences in outcome measures, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis of the results. Only one study reported 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. One study reported absolute and percentage reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo, P values were 0.046 and 0.018, respectively. One study reported percentage reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo, but there were no P values. Adverse effects rates were higher during the felbamate period than the placebo period, particularly headache, nausea and dizziness.

Authors' Conclusions

In view of the methodological deficiencies, limited number of individual studies and differences in outcome measures, we have found no reliable evidence to support the use of felbamate as an add-on therapy in people with refractory partial-onset epilepsy. A large-scale, randomised controlled trial conducted over a longer period of time is required to inform clinical practice.

### Felbamate as an add-on therapy for refractory epilepsy [^114oBcbY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This review is an update of a previously published review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 1, 2011) on 'Felbamate as an add-on therapy for refractory epilepsy'. Epilepsy is a chronic and disabling neurologic disorder, affecting approximately 1% of the population. Up to 30% of people with epilepsy have seizures that are resistant to currently available drugs. Felbamate is one of the second-generation antiepileptic drugs and its effects as an add-on therapy to standard drugs are assessed in this review.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of felbamate versus placebo when used as an add-on treatment for people with refractory partial-onset epilepsy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (24 July 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013, Issue 6), and PubMed (24 July 2013). This search was run for the original review on 20 May 2010. There were no language and time restrictions. We reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies to search for additional reports of relevant studies. We also contacted the manufacturers of felbamate and experts in the field for information about any unpublished or ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized placebo-controlled add-on studies of people of any age with refractory partial-onset seizures. The studies could be double-blind, single-blind or unblinded and could be of parallel or crossover design.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted information. We resolved disagreements by discussion. If disagreements persisted, the third review author arbitrated. We assessed the following outcomes: 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency; absolute or percentage reduction in seizure frequency; treatment withdrawal; adverse effects; quality of life.

Main Results

Three randomised controlled trials with a total of 153 participants were included. The first was a parallel design, the second had a two-period crossover design, and the third had a three-period crossover design. One study was at unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. And in the same study, there was no description of how to blind outcome assessment, performance blinding was for participants, might not be for doctors. Two studies were at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. Due to significant methodological heterogeneity, clinical heterogeneity and differences in outcome measures, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis of the results. None of the three studies reported 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. Only one study reported absolute and percentage reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo, P values were 0.046 and 0.018, respectively. Adverse effects rates were higher during the felbamate period than the placebo period, particularly headache, nausea and dizziness.

Authors' Conclusions

In view of the methodological deficiencies, limited number of individual studies and differences in outcome measure, we have found no reliable evidence to support the use of felbamate as an add-on therapy in patients with refractory partial-onset epilepsy. A large-scale, randomised controlled trial conducted over a longer period of time is required to inform clinical practice. Since the last version of this review no new studies have been found.

Epilepsy Currents (2018). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for future research in TR epilepsy — higher-dose forced titrations led to higher AE rates; future studies should use doses commonly used in clinical practice and use flexible-dosing regimens, and there is a lack of placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of newer AEDs in pediatric patients.

### Practice guideline update summary: efficacy and tolerability of the new antiepileptic drugs II: treatment-resistant epilepsy: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society [^1126CKXu]. Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Treatment-resistant epilepsy guideline update — objective, methods, and evidence base: To update the 2004 American Academy of Neurology guideline for managing treatment-resistant (TR) epilepsy with second- and third-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), 2004 criteria were used to systematically review literature (January 2003 to November 2015), classify pertinent studies according to the therapeutic rating scheme, and link recommendations to evidence strengths. Forty-two articles were included.

### Felbamate as an add-on therapy for refractory epilepsy [^114yq6FJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is a chronic and disabling neurologic disorder, affecting approximately one per cent of the population. Up to 30% of people with epilepsy have seizures that are resistant to currently available drugs. Felbamate is one of the second generation antiepileptic drugs and its effects as an add-on therapy to standard drugs are assessed in this review.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of felbamate versus placebo when used as an add-on treatment for people with refractory partial-onset epilepsy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (6 December 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, 6 December 2010), and PubMed (6 December 2010). There were no language restrictions. We reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies to search for additional reports of relevant studies. We also contacted the manufacturers of felbamate and experts in the field for information about any unpublished or ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized placebo-controlled add-on studies of people of any age with refractory partial-onset seizures. The studies could be double-blind, single-blind or unblinded and could be of parallel or crossover design.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted information. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. If disagreements persisted, the third review author arbitrated. The following outcomes were assessed: 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency; absolute or percentage reduction in seizure frequency; treatment withdrawal; adverse effects; quality of life.

Main Results

Three randomized controlled trials were included. The first was a parallel design, the second was a two-period crossover design, and the third was a three-period crossover design. Due to significant methodological heterogeneity, clinical heterogeneity and differences in outcome measures, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis of the results. None of the three studies reported 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. Only one study reported absolute and percentage reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo, P values were 0.046 and 0.018, respectively. Adverse effects rates were higher during the felbamate period than the placebo period, particularly headache, nausea and dizziness.

Authors' Conclusions

In view of the methodological deficiencies, limited number of individual studies and differences in outcome measure, we have found no reliable evidence to support the use of felbamate as an add-on therapy in patients with refractory partial-onset epilepsy. A large scale, randomized controlled trial conducted over a greater period of time is required to inform clinical practice.

### Gabapentin add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy [^116Myt2S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review previously published in 2013. Most people with epilepsy have a good prognosis and their seizures are well controlled by a single antiepileptic drug, but up to 30% develop drug-resistant epilepsy, especially those with focal seizures. In this review, we summarised the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of gabapentin, when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin when used as an add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Search Methods

For the latest update, we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web, 20 March 2018), which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 20 March 2018), ClinicalTrials.gov (20 March 2018) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, 20 March 2018). We imposed no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, add-on trials of gabapentin in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. We also included trials using an active drug control group or comparing different doses of gabapentin.

Data Collection and Analysis

For this update, two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the relevant data. We assessed the following outcomes: seizure frequency, seizure freedom, treatment withdrawal (any reason) and adverse effects. Primary analyses were intention-to-treat. We also undertook sensitivity best-case and worst-case analyses. We estimated summary risk ratios (RR) for each outcome and evaluated dose-response in regression models.

Main Results

We included 12 trials representing 2607 randomised participants. We combined data from six trials in meta-analyses of 1206 randomised participants. The overall RR for reduction in seizure frequency of 50% or more compared to placebo was 1.89 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40 to 2.55; 6 trials, 1206 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Dose regression analysis (for trials in adults) showed increasing efficacy with increasing dose, with 25.3% (19.3 to 32.3) of people responding to gabapentin 1800 mg compared to 9.7% on placebo, a 15.5% increase in response rate (8.5 to 22.5). The RR for treatment withdrawal compared to placebo was 1.05 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.49; 6 trials, 1206 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Adverse effects were significantly associated with gabapentin compared to placebo. RRs were as follows: ataxia 2.01 (99% CI 0.98 to 4.11; 3 studies, 787 participants; low-quality evidence), dizziness 2.43 (99% CI 1.44 to 4.12; 6 studies, 1206 participants; moderate-quality evidence), fatigue 1.95 (99% CI 0.99 to 3.82; 5 studies, 1161 participants; low-quality evidence) and somnolence 1.93 (99% CI 1.22 to 3.06; 6 studies, 1206 participants; moderate-quality evidence). There were no significant differences for the adverse effects of headache (RR 0.79, 99% CI 0.46 to 1.35; 6 studies, 1206 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or nausea (RR 0.95, 99% CI 0.52 to 1.73; 4 trials, 1034 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Overall, the studies were rated at low to unclear risk of bias due to information on each risk of bias domain not being available. We judged the overall quality of evidence (using the GRADE approach) as low to moderate due to potential attrition bias resulting from missing outcome data and imprecise results with wide confidence intervals.

Authors' Conclusions

Gabapentin has efficacy as an add-on treatment in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. However, the trials reviewed were of relatively short duration and provide no evidence for the long-term efficacy of gabapentin beyond a three-month period. The results cannot be extrapolated to monotherapy or to people with other epilepsy types.

### Efficacy and safety of antiepileptic drugs for refractory partial-onset epilepsy: a network meta-analysis [^11421y8o]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The optimal combination of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for the treatment of refractory partial-onset epilepsy is a perpetual point of debate. While several network meta-analyses (NMAs) have been published, conclusions remain controversial, especially since newer AEDs have been introduced. In our review, we included the newer AEDs to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of AEDs for the treatment of refractory partial-onset epilepsy. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library 2017, Issue 1) from their inception to February 18, 2017. The risk of bias in the included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was evaluated according to the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. An NMA was performed with a Bayesian random-effects model, and we used the surface under the cumulative ranking curve to detect the optimal AEDs. Seventy-six RCTs with 17 AEDs and 20,711 patients were included in the NMAs, which showed that Brivaracetam (BRV), Levetiracetam (LEV), Oxcarbazepine (OXC), Topiramate, Vigabatrin (VGB), and Valproate (VPA) had a greater likelihood of allowing patients to achieve seizure freedom. We also found that LEV was associated with a lower withdrawal rate due to adverse effects than Lacosamide, Eslicarbazepine acetate, OXC, Pregabalin, and Retigabine. LEV, VGB, VPA, and BRV emerged as the agents with the best combination of properties when considering the efficacy and safety outcomes based on the full double-blind treatment period. However, it is critical to perform RCTs and to obtain prospective data from representative cohort studies.

### Intrinsic severity as a determinant of antiepileptic drug refractoriness [^113KusE9]. Epilepsy Currents (2008). Low credibility.

For the most part, resistance to medications in epilepsy is independent of the choice of antiepileptic drug. This simple clinical observation constrains the possible biological mechanisms for drug refractory epilepsy by imposing a requirement to explain resistance for a diverse set of chemical structures that act on an even more varied group of molecular targets. To date, research on antiepileptic drug refractoriness has been guided by the "drug transporter overexpression" and the "reduced drug-target sensitivity" hypotheses. These concepts posit that drug refractoriness is a condition separate from the underlying epilepsy. Inadequacies in both hypotheses mandate a fresh approach to the problem. In this article, we propose a novel approach that considers epilepsy pharmacoresistance in terms of intrinsic disease severity. We suggest that neurobiological factors that confer increased disease severity lead to drug intractability. The occurrence of frequent seizures at disease onset is an important factor that signals increased severity.

### Modern antiepileptic drugs: guidelines and beyond [^114B84ud]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Ten antiepileptic drugs have been licensed since 1990. Their usage will be briefly reviewed focusing on new data and inclusion in guidelines. The hypotheses exploring the underlying basis of pharmacoresistance will be presented.

Recent Findings

Lamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate, and oxcarbazepine are available for use as monotherapy in many countries following comparative studies with older antiepileptic drugs. Zonisamide and pregabalin have recently obtained licences as adjuvant therapy in the US and Europe for partial epilepsy with or without secondary generalization. The UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence guideline has advised, largely based on cost, against the routine use of modern antiepileptic drugs, except when older drugs have failed or are contraindicated. This contrasts with the US guidelines which are less conservative. Surgically resected specimens from patients with refractory epilepsy have led to the development of two hypotheses to explain pharmacoresistant epilepsy.

Summary

The introduction of 10 new antiepileptic drugs has provided greater choice for patients and doctors, although evidence in support of their superiority over the older drugs is sparse. This has led to conflicting advice in guidelines. Recent developments in the understanding of pharmacoresistance may explain the relatively high incidence of refractory epilepsy.

### Rufinamide add-on therapy for refractory epilepsy [^115AVpYD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is a central nervous system disorder (neurological disorder). Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal cortical nerve cell electrical activity in the brain. Despite the development of more than 10 new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) since the early 2000s, approximately a third of people with epilepsy remain resistant to pharmacotherapy, often requiring treatment with a combination of AEDs. In this review, we summarised the current evidence regarding rufinamide, a novel anticonvulsant medication, which, as a triazole derivative, is structurally unrelated to any other currently used anticonvulsant medication, when used as an add-on treatment for refractory epilepsy. In January 2009, rufinamide was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of children four years of age and older with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. It is also approved as an add-on treatment for adults and adolescents with focal seizures.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide when used as an add-on treatment in people with refractory epilepsy.

Search Methods

On 2 October 2017, we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We imposed no language restrictions. We also contacted the manufacturers of rufinamide and authors in the field to identify any relevant unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, add-on trials of rufinamide, recruiting people (of any age or gender) with refractory epilepsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the relevant data. We assessed the following outcomes: 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (primary outcomes); seizure freedom; treatment withdrawal; and adverse effects (secondary outcomes). Primary analyses were intention-to-treat (ITT) and we presented summary risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We evaluated dose response in regression models. We carried out a risk of bias assessment for each included study using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and assessed the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE approach, which we presented in a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

The review included six trials, representing 1759 participants. Four trials (1563 participants) included people with uncontrolled focal seizures. Two trials (196 participants) included established Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Overall, the age of the adults ranged from 18 to 80 years and the age of the infants ranged from four to 16 years. Baseline phase ranged from 28 to 56 days and double-blind phases from 84 to 96 days. Five of the six included trials described adequate methods of concealment of randomisation and only three described adequate blinding. All analyses were by ITT. Overall, five studies were at low risk of bias, and one had unclear risk of bias due to lack of reported information around study design. All trials were sponsored by the manufacturer of rufinamide, and therefore, were at high risk of funding bias. The overall RR for 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency was 1.79 (95% CI 1.44 to 2.22; 6 RCTs; moderate-quality evidence) indicating that rufinamide (plus conventional AED) was significantly more effective than placebo (plus conventional AED) in reducing seizure frequency by at least 50%, when added to conventionally used AEDs in people with refractory focal epilepsy. The overall RR for treatment withdrawal (for any reason and due to AED) was 1.83 (95% CI 1.45 to 2.31; 6 RCTs; moderate-quality evidence) showing that rufinamide was significantly more likely to be withdrawn than placebo. In respect of adverse effects, most were significantly more likely to occur in the rufinamide-treated group. The adverse events significantly associated with rufinamide were: headache, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, nausea, fatigue and diplopia. The RRs of these adverse effects were: headache 1.36 (95% Cl 1.08 to 1.69; 3 RCTs; high-quality evidence); dizziness 2.52 (95% Cl 1.90 to 3.34; 3 RCTs; moderate-quality evidence); somnolence 1.94 (95% Cl 1.44 to 2.61; 6 RCTs; moderate-quality evidence); vomiting 2.95 (95% Cl 1.80 to 4.82; 4 RCTs; low-quality evidence); nausea 1.87 (95% Cl 1.33 to 2.64; 3 RCTs; moderate-quality evidence); fatigue 1.46 (95% Cl 1.08 to 1.97; 3 RCTs; moderate-quality evidence); and diplopia 4.60 (95% Cl 2.53 to 8.38; 3 RCTs; low-quality evidence). There was no important heterogeneity between studies for any of the outcomes. Overall, we assessed the evidence as moderate to low quality, due to potential risk of bias from some studies contributing to the analysis and wide CIs.

Authors' Conclusions

In people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, rufinamide when used as an add-on treatment was effective in reducing seizure frequency. However, the trials reviewed were of relatively short duration and provided no evidence for the long-term use of rufinamide. In the short term, rufinamide as an add-on was associated with several adverse events. This review focused on the use of rufinamide in drug-resistant focal epilepsy and the results cannot be generalised to add-on treatment for generalised epilepsies. Likewise, no inference can be made about the effects of rufinamide when used as monotherapy.

### Continuing burden of refractory epilepsy [^114nTJdH]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases, and uncontrolled seizures remain a significant problem for one-third of patients with epilepsy on drug therapy. Ongoing seizures affect the morbidity and mortality of patients with epilepsy. Premature death is up to 3 times higher in those with epilepsy than in the general population. Quality of life is affected by refractory epilepsy with physical, social, and psychological consequences. Patients may be stigmatized by society, institutions, and their own shame surrounding seizures. Questions remain on how to treat refractory epilepsy, also called drug-resistant, pharmacoresistant, or intractable epilepsy. Cenobamate, a novel antiseizure medication, may provide additional benefit for refractory epilepsy treatment.

Antiepileptic drug trials

Despite being a common disorder, the number of high quality trials of antiepileptic drugs is small. Trials of new AED are normally in the form of an add-on therapy in refractory partial epilepsy, usually with the end point of a 50% reduction of seizures. This may be realistic in showing a biological effect but does not confer the psychosocial benefits of seizure freedom, and therefore drugs enter the market with the knowledge that they will not dramatically alter the burden of refractory epilepsy. The Federal Drug Administration in the US requires monotherapy trials against placebo and the European Medicines Agency requires head-to-head trial of active agents. Consequently, results cannot cross the Atlantic, delaying introduction and increasing cost for manufacturers. Both types of trials have their merits. The result is a non-systematic hotchpotch of evidence in relation to monotherapy in epilepsy. Whilst the pragmatic study SANAD has guided many UK clinicians to lamotrigine as first line in monotherapy for focal epilepsy, carbamazepine remains a drug of choice in many countries and studies. A recent study has shown that zonisamide is non-inferior to carbamazepine in new onset focal epilepsy in adults. A large study of 1688 new onset patients compared time to withdrawal of levetiracetam in two arms to first choice carbamazepine or valproate in monotherapy in adults. Overall, the drugs performed similarly but in a post hoc analysis, levetiracetam withdrawal rate was lower in those over 60, especially in comparison to carbamazepine, with fewer adverse effects rather than greater efficacy.

### Drug resistance in epilepsy [^117NYuNe]. The Lancet: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Drug resistance is estimated to affect about a third of individuals with epilepsy, but its prevalence differs in relation to the epilepsy syndrome, the cause of epilepsy, and other factors such as age of seizure onset and presence of associated neurological deficits. Although drug-resistant epilepsy is not synonymous with unresponsiveness to any drug treatment, the probability of achieving seizure freedom on a newly tried medication decreases with increasing number of previously failed treatments. After two appropriately used antiseizure medications have failed to control seizures, individuals should be referred whenever possible to a comprehensive epilepsy centre for diagnostic re-evaluation and targeted management. The feasibility of epilepsy surgery and other treatments, including those targeting the cause of epilepsy, should be considered early after diagnosis. Substantial evidence indicates that a delay in identifying an effective treatment can adversely affect ultimate outcome and carry an increased risk of cognitive disability, other comorbidities, and premature mortality. Research on mechanisms of drug resistance and novel therapeutics is progressing rapidly, and potentially improved treatments, including those targeting disease modification, are on the horizon.

Epilepsy Currents (2018). Medium credibility.

Clinical context — pharmacokinetic: pharmacodynamic analysis comparing adults and children receiving approved antiepileptic drugs showed similar seizure reduction when serum concentrations were similar, and on this basis the FDA determined that efficacy of AEDs for focal seizures in adults can be extrapolated downward to children 4 years of age.

### Medical therapy of epilepsy: when to initiate treatment and when to combine? [^113vRDEF]. Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Most patients reporting more than one well-documented or witnessed seizure require prophylactic antiepileptic (AED) therapy. Those with an underlying brain disorder and/or an abnormal electroencephalogram should probably be treated after their first event. The goal should be maintenance of a normal lifestyle by complete seizure control with no or minimal side-effects. Failure of the first AED due to lack of efficacy implies refractoriness. A policy of consecutive substitutions is unlikely to be an effective strategy. Thus, if the first or second monotherapy improves control but does not produce seizure freedom, an AED with different and perhaps multiple mechanisms of action should be added. Strategies for combining drugs should involve individual assessment of patient-related factors, including seizure type and epilepsy syndrome classifications coupled with an understanding of the pharmacology, side-effects and interaction profile of the AEDs. Reducing the dose of one or more AEDs may help accommodate the introduction of a second or third drug. An orderly approach to the pharmacological management and, when appropriate, surgical investigations for each epilepsy syndrome will optimise the chance of perfect seizure control and help more people achieve safer and more fulfilled lives.

### Zonisamide add-on therapy for focal epilepsy [^111s5Kgw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The majority of people with epilepsy have a good prognosis, and their seizures can be well controlled with the use of a single antiepileptic agent, but up to 30% develop refractory epilepsy, especially those with focal seizures. In this review, we summarised the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCT) of zonisamide, used as an add-on treatment for focal epilepsy uncontrolled by one or more concomitant antiepileptic drug. This is an updated version of the Cochrane review previously published in 2013.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of zonisamide, when used as an add-on treatment for people with focal epilepsy uncontrolled by one or more concomitant antiepileptic drugs.

Search Methods

For this update, on 4 September 2017, we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE Ovid, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ICTRP. We searched SCOPUS on 13 February 2013, but this is no longer necessary, because RCTs and quasi-RCTs in Embase are now included in CENTRAL. In addition, we contacted Eisai Limited (makers and licensees of zonisamide) and experts in the field to seek any ongoing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials, in which add-on zonisamide was compared with placebo or another antiepileptic drug in people with focal epilepsy, uncontrolled by one or more concomitant antiepileptic drugs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and assessed the quality of the evidence, using the GRADE approach. The primary outcome was at least a 50% reduction in total seizure frequency; the secondary outcomes were (1) tolerability; and (2) adverse effects. We used an intention-to-treat approach for our primary analyses. We estimated summary risk ratios (RRs) for each outcome. We displayed a summary of the estimates of effects and quality of the evidence for each outcome in a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included eight studies (1636 participants). The overall RR with 95% confidence interval (CI) for at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo for 300 mg to 500 mg/day of zonisamide was 1.90 (95% CI 1.63 to 2.22; 7 trials, 1371 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The RR for 50% reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo for any dose of zonisamide (100 mg to 500 mg/day) was 1.86 (95% CI 1.60 to 2.17; 7 trials, 1429 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome was six (95% CI 4.1 to 6.8) for this outcome. Two trials provided evidence of a dose-response relationship for this outcome. The RR for treatment withdrawal for 300 mg to 500 mg/day of zonisamide compared to placebo was 1.59 (95% CI 1.18 to 2.13; 6 trials, 1099 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and for 100 mg to 500 mg/day was 1.44 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.93; 6 trials, 1156 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome was 15 (95% CI 9.3 to 36.7). The CIs of the following adverse effects indicated that they were significantly associated with zonisamide: ataxia RR 3.85 (99% CI 1.36 to 10.93; 4 trials, 734 participants; low-quality evidence); somnolence RR 1.52 (99% CI 1.00 to 2.31; 8 trials, 1636 participants; moderate-quality evidence); agitation RR 2.35 (99% CI 1.05 to 5.27; 4 trials, 598 participants; low-quality evidence); and anorexia RR 2.74 (99% CI 1.64 to 4.60; 6 trials, 1181 participants; low-quality evidence). Across the eight studies, we rated risk of bias domains at low or unclear risk of bias apart from two studies which we rated at high risk of attrition bias. Five of the eight studies were sponsored by the drug companies that produced zonisamide.

Authors' Conclusions

When used as an add-on treatment in people with focal epilepsy uncontrolled by one or more concomitant antiepileptic drugs, moderate-quality evidence found that zonisamide was more successful than placebo at reducing the frequency of seizures by at least 50%. We were unable to identify minimum effective and maximum tolerated doses. The included trials evaluated a maximum stable-dose phase of 18 weeks, so results cannot be used to confirm longer periods of efficacy in seizure control. The results cannot be extrapolated to monotherapy or to people with other seizure types or epilepsy syndromes.

### Pregabalin add-on for drug-resistant focal epilepsy [^115Mwm5x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review last published in Issue 7, 2019; it includes two additional studies. Epilepsy is a common neurological disease that affects approximately 1% of the UK population. Approximately one-third of these people continue to have seizures despite drug treatment. Pregabalin is one of the newer antiepileptic drugs that has been developed to improve outcomes. In this review we summarised the current evidence regarding pregabalin when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Search Methods

For the latest update we searched the following databases on 16 November 2020: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 16 November 2020). CRS Web includes randomised or quasi-randomised, controlled trials from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Specialised Registers of Cochrane Review Groups, including Epilepsy. We imposed no language restrictions. We contacted the manufacturers of pregabalin and authors in the field to identify any relevant unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing pregabalin with placebo or an alternative antiepileptic drug as an add-on for people of any age with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Double-blind and single-blind trials were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency; secondary outcomes were seizure freedom, treatment withdrawal for any reason, treatment withdrawal due to adverse effects, and proportion of individuals experiencing adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the relevant data. Primary analyses were intention-to-treat (ITT). We presented summary risk ratios (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We evaluated dose response in regression models. We carried out a risk of bias assessment for each included study using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and assessed the overall certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 11 randomised controlled trials (3949 participants). Nine trials compared pregabalin to placebo. For the primary outcome, participants randomised to pregabalin were significantly more likely to attain a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.72, 9 trials, 2663 participants, low-certainty evidence). The odds of response doubled with an increase in dose from 300 mg/day to 600 mg/day (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.28), indicating a dose-response relationship. Pregabalin was significantly associated with seizure freedom (RR 3.94, 95% CI 1.50 to 10.37, 4 trials, 1125 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Participants were significantly more likely to withdraw from pregabalin treatment than placebo for any reason (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.60; 9 trials, 2663 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and for adverse effects (RR 2.60, 95% CI 1.86 to 3.64; 9 trials, 2663 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Three trials compared pregabalin to three active-control drugs: lamotrigine, levetiracetam and gabapentin. Participants allocated to pregabalin were significantly more likely to achieve a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency than those allocated to lamotrigine (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.12; 1 trial, 293 participants) but not those allocated to levetiracetam (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.11; 1 trial, 509 participants) or gabapentin (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.12; 1 trial, 484 participants). We found no significant differences between pregabalin and lamotrigine for seizure freedom (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.40 to 4.83). However, significantly fewer participants achieved seizure freedom with add-on pregabalin compared to levetiracetam (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.85). No data were reported for this outcome for pregabalin versus gabapentin. We detected no significant differences in treatment withdrawal rate for any reason or due to adverse effects, specifically, during either pooled analysis or subgroup analysis. Ataxia, dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, headache and fatigue were significantly associated with pregabalin than in active control. We rated the overall risk of bias in the included studies as low or unclear due to the possibility of publication bias and lack of methodological details provided. We assessed all the studies to be at a high risk of funding bias as they were all sponsored by Pfizer. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low to moderate using the GRADE approach.

Authors' Conclusions

For people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, pregabalin when used as an add-on treatment was significantly more effective than placebo at producing a 50% or greater seizure reduction and seizure freedom. Results demonstrated efficacy for doses from 150 mg/day to 600 mg/day, with increasing effectiveness at 600 mg doses, although there were issues with tolerability at higher doses. However, the trials included in this review were of short duration, and longer-term trials are needed to inform clinical decision-making. This review focused on the use of pregabalin in drug-resistant focal epilepsy, and the results cannot be generalised to add-on treatment for generalised epilepsies. Likewise, no inference can be made about the effects of pregabalin when used as monotherapy.

### Emerging drugs for epilepsy and other treatment options [^115oFiMe]. European Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Epilepsies are amongst the most frequent chronic neurological conditions. Patients suffer from spontaneously recurring seizures because of sudden extensive electrical gray matter discharges. Although the current drug therapy allows many patients at least some degree of a satisfying course of the disease, a substantial number of patients remain without adequate seizure control. Reasons are either refractoriness to anticonvulsant drugs or intolerable drug-related side effects. Epilepsy surgery should be considered in these cases as possible treatment option. Nevertheless, a considerable rate of patients will not be suitable candidates or continue to have seizures despite surgery. Therefore there is a substantial need for better antiepileptic drugs. The aim of this review is to highlight currently emerging different treatment approaches which may ameliorate the perspectives of patients with difficult-to-treat epilepsies.

Recommendations for future research — TR focal epilepsy and TR GE: head-to-head trials are lacking on newer AEDs; in studies of new-onset epilepsy, higher-dose forced titrations led to higher AE rates; future studies should be based on commonly used in clinical practice and use flexible-dosing regimens; and there is a lack of placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of newer AEDs in pediatric patients.

Epilepsy Currents (2018). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Neurology/American Epilepsy Society guideline update — scope and exclusions — notes that since the 2004 publications, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 6 new third-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and 2 older AEDs, and this update reviews new evidence for efficacy of these AEDs in managing treatment-resistant (TR) focal epilepsies and generalized epilepsies (GEs) in children and adults; however, an additional new drug, brivaracetam, and an additional indication for perampanel are not included because they received FDA approval after the last literature search update in November 2015. Per the AAN guideline development process, studies not retrieved in a literature search cannot be included in the systematic review, and a companion guideline update examines the evidence in new-onset focal epilepsy or generalized epilepsy (GE).

### Clinical trials of antiepileptic medications in newly diagnosed patients with epilepsy [^112nW3bG]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Results from add-on antiepileptic drug (AED) trials performed in patients with chronic refractory epilepsy cannot be directly extrapolated to newly diagnosed patients because of fundamental differences in disease characteristics between the two patient populations. This article reviews the results of randomized, controlled trials of AEDs as monotherapy in newly diagnosed patients, focusing on the newer drugs. None of the newer AEDs has shown superior efficacy when tested against established agents for the treatment of partial seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, the most common seizure types. Some of the newer drugs have shown good tolerability, resulting in better overall effectiveness in the case of lamotrigine over carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine over phenytoin, whereas vigabatrin and remacemide were demonstrated to have inferior efficacy compared with carbamazepine. The difficulty in detecting differences in efficacy among the AEDs might be attributed to the strategies underlying their development and the characteristics of the patient population under investigation. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of seizures and its relationship to epileptogenesis, and the use of more innovative strategies to identify new molecular targets, are needed for the development of a new generation of more effective AEDs that are not merely antiseizure but will hinder or reverse the deleterious processes that underlie the genesis of refractory epilepsy.

### Transporters in drug-refractory epilepsy: clinical significance [^114HQX3H]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Drug resistance remains an unmet challenge in a variety of neurological disorders, but epilepsy is probably the refractory disease that has received most experimental, preclinical, and therapeutic attention. Although resective surgery continues to improve our ability to provide seizure relief, new discoveries have potential as alternative therapeutic approaches to multiple drug resistance. As discussed here, the field is replete with controversies and false starts, in particular as it concerns the existence of genetic predisposition to inadequate pharmacological seizure control.

### Topiramate add-on therapy for drug-resistant focal epilepsy [^1137RbWX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The majority of people with epilepsy have a good prognosis and their seizures are controlled by a single antiepileptic drug. However, up to 20% of patients from population-based studies, and up to 30% from clinical series (not population-based), develop drug-resistant epilepsy, especially those with focal-onset seizures. In this review, we summarise the current evidence regarding topiramate, an antiepileptic drug first marketed in 1996, when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 1999, and last updated in 2014.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate when used as an add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Search Methods

For the latest update of this review we searched the following databases on 2 July 2018: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946-); ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We imposed no language restrictions. We also contacted the manufacturers of topiramate and researchers in the field to identify any ongoing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled add-on trials of topiramate, recruiting people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the relevant data. We assessed the following outcomes: (1) 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency; (2) seizure freedom; (3) treatment withdrawal (any reason); (4) adverse effects. Primary analyses were intention-to-treat (ITT), and summary risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) are presented. We evaluated dose-response in regression models. We carried out a 'Risk of bias' assessment for each included study using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and assessed the overall certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 12 trials, representing 1650 participants. Baseline phases ranged from four to 12 weeks and double-blind phases ranged from 11 to 19 weeks. The RR for a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency with add-on topiramate compared to placebo was 2.71 (95% CI 2.05 to 3.59; 12 studies; high-certainty evidence). Dose regression analysis showed increasing effect with increasing topiramate dose demonstrated by an odds ratio (OR) of 1.45 (95% CI 1.28 to 1.64; P < 0.001) per 200 mg/d increase in topiramate dosage. The proportion of participants achieving seizure freedom was also significantly increased with add-on topiramate compared to placebo (RR 3.67, 95% CI 1.79 to 7.54; 8 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Treatment withdrawal was significantly higher for add-on topiramate compared to placebo (RR 2.37, 95% CI 1.66 to 3.37; 12 studies; high-certainty evidence). The RRs for the following adverse effects indicate that they are significantly more prevalent with topiramate, compared to placebo: ataxia 2.29 (99% CI 1.10 to 4.77; 4 studies); concentration difficulties 7.81 (99% CI 2.08 to 29.29; 6 studies; moderate-certainty evidence); dizziness 1.52 (99% CI 1.07 to 2.16; 8 studies); fatigue 2.08 (99% CI 1.37 to 3.15; 10 studies); paraesthesia 3.65 (99% CI 1.58 to 8.39; 7 studies; moderate-certainty evidence); somnolence 2.44 (99% CI 1.61 to 3.68; 9 studies); 'thinking abnormally' 5.70 (99% CI 2.26 to 14.38; 4 studies; high-certainty evidence); and weight loss 3.99 (99% CI 1.82 to 8.72; 9 studies; low-certainty evidence). Evidence of publication bias for the primary outcome was found (Egger test, P = 0.001). We rated all studies included in the review as having either low or unclear risk of bias. Overall, we assessed the evidence as moderate to high certainty due to the evidence of publication bias, statistical heterogeneity and imprecision, which was partially compensated for by large effect sizes.

Authors' Conclusions

Topiramate has efficacy as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy as it is almost three times more effective compared to a placebo in reducing seizures. The trials reviewed were of relatively short duration and provided no evidence for the long-term efficacy of topiramate. Short-term use of add-on topiramate was shown to be associated with several adverse events. The results of this review should only be applied to adult populations as only one study included children. Future research should consider further examining the effect of dose.

### Topiramate add-on for drug-resistant partial epilepsy [^112PsFNx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The majority of people with epilepsy have a good prognosis and their seizures are controlled by a single antiepileptic drug. However, up to 20% of patients from population-based studies and up to 30% from clinical series (not population-based) develop drug-resistant epilepsy, especially those with partial onset seizures. In this review we summarise the current evidence regarding topiramate, an antiepileptic drug first marketed in 1996, when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant partial epilepsy. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 1999.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of topiramate when used as an add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (June 2013); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 5); MEDLINE (1946 to 2013); SCOPUS (1823 to 2013); ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. We imposed no language restrictions. We also contacted the manufacturers of topiramate and researchers in the field to identify any ongoing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled or active drug controlled add-on trials of topiramate, recruiting people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the relevant data. We assessed the following outcomes: (a) 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency; (b) seizure freedom; (c) treatment withdrawal (any reason); (d) side effects. Primary analyses were intention-to-treat and summary risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) are presented. We evaluated dose response in regression models. We carried out a 'Risk of bias' assessment for each included study using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and assessed the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE approach, which we presented in a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

Eleven trials were included, representing 1401 randomised participants. Baseline phases ranged from 4 to 12 weeks and double-blind phases from 11 to 19 weeks. The RR for a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo was 2.97 (95% CI 2.38 to 3.72). Dose regression analysis shows increasing effect with increasing dose, but found no advantage for doses over 300 or 400 mg per day. The RR for seizure freedom (95% CI) compared to placebo was 3.41 (95% CI 1.37 to 8.51). The RR for treatment withdrawal compared to placebo was 2.44 (95% CI 1.64 to 3.62). The RRs for the following side effects indicate that they are significantly associated with topiramate: ataxia 2.29 (99% CI 1.10 to 4.77); concentration difficulties 7.81 (2.08 to 29.29); dizziness 1.54 (99% CI 1.07 to 2.22); fatigue 2.19 (99% CI 1.42 to 3.40); paraesthesia 3.91 (1.51 to 10.12); somnolence 2.29 (99% CI 1.49 to 3.51); 'thinking abnormally' 5.70 (99% CI 2.26 to 14.38) and weight loss 3.47 (1.55 to 7.79). Evidence of publication bias was found (P-value from the Egger test was P = 0.003). We rated all studies included in the review as having either low or unclear risk of bias. Overall, we assessed the evidence as moderate quality due to the evidence of publication bias.

Authors' Conclusions

Topiramate has efficacy as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant partial epilepsy in that it is three times more effective compared to a placebo in reducing seizures. However, the trials reviewed were of relatively short duration and provide no evidence for the long-term efficacy of topiramate. In the short term topiramate as an add-on has been shown to be associated with several adverse events. The results of this review cannot be extrapolated to monotherapy or treatment of other epilepsy types and future research should consider examining the effect of dose.

### Pregabalin add-on for drug-resistant focal epilepsy [^111ZsaNx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is a common neurological disease that affects approximately 1% of the UK population. Approximately one-third of these people continue to have seizures despite drug treatment. Pregabalin is one of the newer antiepileptic drugs which have been developed to improve outcomes. This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review published in Issue 3, 2014, and includes three new studies.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Search Methods

For the latest update we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), on 5 July 2018, MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 5 July 2018), ClinicalTrials.gov (5 July 2018), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, 5 July 2018), and contacted Pfizer Ltd, manufacturer of pregabalin, to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing pregabalin with placebo or an alternative antiepileptic drug as an add-on for people of any age with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Double-blind and single-blind trials were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency; secondary outcomes were seizure freedom, treatment withdrawal for any reason, treatment withdrawal due to adverse effects, and proportion of individuals experiencing adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected and assessed trials for eligibility and extracted data. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. We presented results as risk ratios (RR) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Two review authors assessed the included studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool.

Main Results

We included nine industry-sponsored randomised controlled trials (3327 participants) in the review. Seven trials compared pregabalin to placebo. For the primary outcome, participants randomised to pregabalin were significantly more likely to attain a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo (RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.42, 7 trials, 2193 participants, low-certainty evidence). The odds of response doubled with an increase in dose from 300 mg/day to 600 mg/day (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.28), indicating a dose-response relationship. Pregabalin was significantly associated with seizure freedom (RR 3.94, 95% CI 1.50 to 10.37, 4 trials, 1125 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Participants were significantly more likely to withdraw from pregabalin treatment than placebo for any reason (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.65, 7 trials, 2193 participants, moderate-certainty evidence) and for adverse effects (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.88 to 3.74, 7 trials, 2193 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Three trials compared pregabalin to three active-control drugs: lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and gabapentin. Participants allocated to pregabalin were significantly more likely to achieve a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency than those allocated to lamotrigine (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.12, 1 trial, 293 participants) but not those allocated to levetiracetam (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.11, 1 trial, 509 participants) or gabapentin (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.12, 1 trial, 484 participants). We found no significant differences between pregabalin and lamotrigine (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.40 to 4.83) for seizure freedom, however, significantly fewer participants achieved seizure freedom with add-on pregabalin compared to levetiracetam (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.85). No data were reported for this outcome for pregabalin versus gabapentin. We found no significant differences between pregabalin and lamotrigine (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.52), levetiracetam (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.49), or gabapentin (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.07) for treatment withdrawal due to any reason or due to adverse effects (pregabalin versus lamotrigine: RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.48; versus levetiracetam: RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.54; versus gabapentin: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.11). Ataxia, dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, and fatigue were significantly associated with pregabalin. We rated the overall risk of bias in the included studies as low or unclear due to the possibility of publication bias and lack of methodological details provided. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low to moderate using the GRADE approach.

Authors' Conclusions

Pregabalin, when used as an add-on drug for treatment-resistant focal epilepsy, is significantly more effective than placebo at producing a 50% or greater seizure reduction and seizure freedom. Results demonstrated efficacy for doses from 150 mg/day to 600 mg/day, with increasing effectiveness at 600 mg doses, however issues with tolerability were noted at higher doses. The trials included in this review were of short duration, and longer-term trials are needed to inform clinical decision making.

Clinical context — adult-to-pediatric extrapolation: a pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic analysis comparing adults and children receiving approved antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) showed similar seizure reduction when serum concentrations were similar, and based on these data the FDA determined that efficacy in adults with focal seizures can be extrapolated downward to children 4 years of age.

### Response to early AED therapy and its prognostic implications [^114RhV1U]. Epilepsy Currents (2002). Low credibility.

Determining the prognosis of patients when they first present with epilepsy is a difficult task. Several clinical studies have shed light on this very important topic. Potential predictors of the refractory state, including seizure etiology, duration of epilepsy before treatment, and epilepsy type, have not been successful indicators of long-term outcome. One predictor of the refractory state appears to be early response to AED therapy. Inadequate seizure control after initial treatment is a poor prognostic sign. Recent research into genetic causes of the refractory state has included investigation of the multiple drug resistance gene, and polymorphisms at drug targets. More work is needed to determine the causes and predictors of drug resistance.

### Gabapentin add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy [^114edDkq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review previously published in 2018. Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterised by recurrent seizures. Most people with epilepsy have a good prognosis and their seizures are well controlled by a single antiepileptic drug, but up to 30% develop drug-resistant epilepsy, especially people with focal seizures. In this review, we summarised the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of gabapentin, when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin when used as an add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Search Methods

For the latest update, we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE (Ovid) on 11 August 2020. CRS Web includes randomised or quasi-randomised, controlled trials from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Specialised Registers of Cochrane Review Groups including Epilepsy. We imposed no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, add-on trials of gabapentin in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. We also included trials using an active drug control group or comparing different doses of gabapentin.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the relevant data. We assessed the following outcomes: seizure frequency, seizure freedom, treatment withdrawal (any reason) and adverse effects. Primary analyses were intention-to-treat. We also undertook sensitivity best-case and worst-case analyses. We estimated summary risk ratios (RR) for each outcome and evaluated dose-response in regression models.

Main Results

We identified no new studies for this update, therefore, the results and conclusions are unchanged. In the previous update of this review, we combined data from six trials in meta-analyses of 1206 randomised participants. The overall risk ratio (RR) for reduction in seizure frequency of 50% or more compared to placebo was 1.89 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40 to 2.55; 6 studies, 1206 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Dose regression analysis (for trials in adults) showed increasing efficacy with increasing dose, with 25.3% (95% CI 19.3 to 32.3) of people responding to gabapentin 1800 mg compared to 9.7% on placebo, a 15.5% increase in response rate (95% CI 8.5 to 22.5). The RR for treatment withdrawal compared to placebo was 1.05 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.49; 6 trials, 1206 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Adverse effects were significantly associated with gabapentin compared to placebo. RRs were as follows: ataxia 2.01 (99% CI 0.98 to 4.11; 3 studies, 787 participants; low-certainty evidence), dizziness 2.43 (99% CI 1.44 to 4.12; 6 studies, 1206 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), fatigue 1.95 (99% CI 0.99 to 3.82; 5 studies, 1161 participants; low-certainty evidence) and somnolence 1.93 (99% CI 1.22 to 3.06; 6 studies, 1206 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference for the adverse effects of headache (RR 0.79, 99% CI 0.46 to 1.35; 6 studies, 1206 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or nausea (RR 0.95, 99% CI 0.52 to 1.73; 4 trials, 1034 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Overall, the studies were at low to unclear risk of bias due to information on each risk of bias domain not being available. We judged the overall certainty of the evidence (using the GRADE approach) as low to moderate due to potential attrition bias resulting from missing outcome data and imprecise results with wide CIs.

Authors' Conclusions

Gabapentin has efficacy as an add-on treatment in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, and seems to be fairly well-tolerated. However, the trials reviewed were of relatively short duration and provide no evidence for the long-term efficacy of gabapentin beyond a three-month period. The results cannot be extrapolated to monotherapy or to people with other epilepsy types. Further trials are needed to assess the long-term effects of gabapentin, and to compare gabapentin with other add-on drugs.

### Surgical management of pediatric epilepsy: decision-making and outcomes [^1116roEM]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

First-line treatment for epilepsy is antiepileptic drug and requires an interdisciplinary approach and enduring commitment and adherence from the patient and family for successful outcome. Despite adherence to antiepileptic drugs, refractory epilepsy occurs in approximately 30% of children with epilepsy, and surgical treatment is an important intervention to consider. Surgical management of pediatric epilepsy is highly effective in selected patients with refractory epilepsy; however, an evidence-based protocol, including best methods of presurgical imaging assessments, and neurodevelopmental and/or behavioral health assessments, is not currently available for clinicians. Surgical treatment of epilepsy can be critical to avoid negative outcomes in functional, cognitive, and behavioral health status. Furthermore, it is often the only method to achieve seizure freedom in refractory epilepsy. Although a large literature base can be found for adults with refractory epilepsy undergoing surgical treatment, less is known about how surgical management affects outcomes in children with epilepsy. The purpose of the review was fourfold: (1) to evaluate the available literature regarding presurgical assessment and postsurgical outcomes in children with medically refractory epilepsy, (2) to identify gaps in our knowledge of surgical treatment and its outcomes in children with epilepsy, (3) to pose questions for further research, and (4) to advocate for a more unified presurgical evaluation protocol including earlier referral for surgical candidacy of pediatric patients with refractory epilepsy. Despite its effectiveness, epilepsy surgery remains an underutilized but evidence-based approach that could lead to positive short- and long-term outcomes for children with refractory epilepsy.

### One for all-can we have and Do we want a first-line monotherapy for epilepsy? [^113kCUyf]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

Commentary

The pathway to approval of new anti-seizure medications (ASMs) differs methodologically from the evaluation of best "first-line" monotherapy in epilepsy. Randomized placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trials of novel ASMs consist of rigorous placebo-controlled evaluations in patients with drug-resistant frequent seizures, while monotherapy has been evaluated through pragmatic open-label trials, which inform comparative effectiveness, often in "real world" practice. - This difference largely lies in the practical and ethical difficulties in performing a rigorous placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial of monotherapy in newly diagnosed epilepsy, where the primary outcome (persistent seizures) is infrequent, necessitating a large sample size to detect an effect, and a placebo group would be unethical, given the long double-blind period needed to assess the outcome and the lack of equipoise on the risks of delayed treatment in a newly diagnosed epilepsy. But how do we draw real world conclusions from real world study designs, and are the questions they are aiming to answer the right ones?

Epilepsy Currents (2018). Medium credibility.

Levetiracetam — pediatric treatment-resistant focal epilepsy evidence indicates benefit across two age strata: Two Class I studies compared LEV with placebo; in children and young adolescents aged 4–16 years the target dose was 60 mg/kg/d with significantly greater responder rates and median reductions in seizure frequency, and in children aged 1 month to < 4 years LEV dosing was 40 mg/kg/d if aged < 6 months or 50 mg/kg/d if aged ≥ 6 months with significantly greater responder rate and greater median percent reduction from baseline; consequently, LEV is probably effective as add-on therapy for TR focal epilepsy in children and adolescents (1 Class I study), and LEV is probably effective as add-on therapy in infants and children aged < 4 years (1 Class I study).

### Non-pharmacological interventions for epilepsy in people with intellectual disabilities [^111k4N3N]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 30% of epilepsy patients remain refractory to drug treatment and continue to experience seizures whilst taking one or more antiepileptic drugs. There are a number of non-pharmacological interventions available to refractory patients which may be used in conjunction with or as an alternative to antiepileptic medication. In view of the fact that seizures in intellectually disabled people are often complex and refractory to pharmacological interventions it is evident that good quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of alternatives or adjuncts to pharmacological interventions are needed in this population.

Objectives

The aim of our study was to assess the data available from randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological interventions in patients with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2006), MEDLINE OVID (1966 to October 2006) and PsychInfo OVID (1806 to October 2006).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological interventions for people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently applied inclusion criteria and extracted data.

Main Results

No RCTs were found for this study population.

Authors' Conclusions

This review has highlighted the need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to assess the effect of non-pharmacological interventions on seizure and behavioural outcomes in an intellectually disabled epilepsy population.

Pediatric treatment-resistant (TR) focal epilepsy — levetiracetam (LEV) as adjunctive therapy: Two Class I studies compared LEV with placebo, including children and young adolescents aged 4–16 years with a target dose of 60 mg/kg/d, where LEV showed significantly greater responder rates per week and median reductions in seizure frequency per week. A second Class I study randomized children aged 1 month to < 4 years to placebo or LEV at 40 mg/kg/d if aged < 6 months or 50 mg/kg/d if aged ≥ 6 months, with significantly greater responder rate in average daily seizure frequency and greater median percent reduction from baseline for LEV, and the most frequently reported LEV-related AEs including somnolence and irritability. Conclusions state LEV is probably effective as add-on therapy for TR focal epilepsy in children and adolescents (1 Class I study) and in infants and children aged < 4 years (1 Class I study).

### Drug-resistant epilepsy: definition, pathophysiology, and management [^115fKjP5]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2023). Medium credibility.

There are currently > 51 million people with epilepsy (PWE) in the world and every year > 4.9 million people develop new-onset epilepsy. The cornerstone of treatment in PWE is drug therapy with antiseizure medications (ASMs). However, about one-third of PWE do not achieve seizure control and do not respond well to drug therapy despite the use of appropriate ASMs [drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE)]. The aims of the current narrative review are to discuss the definition of DRE, explain the biological underpinnings and clinical biomarkers of this condition, and finally to suggest practical management strategies to tackle this issue appropriately, in a concise manner.

### Limitations of monotherapy trials in epilepsy [^115hikTj]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Monotherapy is considered optimal management for most patients with epilepsy, but designing monotherapy trials in epilepsy has proved to be a complex endeavor. Consideration of the validity of evidence for efficacy, potential risks to patients, clinical applicability of results, and effects of dosing and titration rates on efficacy and tolerability creates unique challenges. This article reviews pertinent aspects of trials of conversion to monotherapy in refractory patients and equivalence trials in newly diagnosed patients to better understand their limitations. Despite the inherent difficulties in designing monotherapy trials in epilepsy, previous monotherapy studies have provided important information for clinical management with new treatments.

### Risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy in patients given adjunctive antiepileptic treatment for refractory seizures: a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomised trials [^116uYuZd]. The Lancet: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Background

Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) represents the main cause of death in patients with refractory epilepsy. No evidence-based intervention to prevent SUDEP exists. We postulated that pooling data from randomised placebo-controlled trials in patients with refractory epilepsy might show a lower incidence of SUDEP in patients receiving antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at efficacious doses than in those receiving placebo.

Methods

We searched Medline and the Cochrane Library for randomised trials investigating any AED in the add-on treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy in adults. We extracted the number and causes of death in patients allocated to AEDs at doses that were more efficacious than placebo against seizures, AEDs at non-efficacious doses, and placebo. In our primary analysis, we compared the occurrence of definite or probable SUDEP between patients given efficacious AED doses and those given placebo using the Mantel-Haenszel method, with exclusion of trials with no event.

Findings

Data of 33 deaths, including 20 deemed as SUDEP, were extracted from 112 eligible randomised trials. 18 deaths were classified as definite or probable SUDEP and two as possible SUDEP. Definite or probable SUDEP, all SUDEP, and all causes of death were significantly less frequent in the efficacious AED group than in the placebo group, with odds ratios of 0.17 (95% CI 0.05–0.57, p = 0.0046), 0.17 (0.05–0.57, p = 0.0046), and 0.37 (0.17–0.81, p = 0.0131), respectively. Rates of definite or probable SUDEP per 1000 person-years were 0.9 (95% CI 0.2–2.7) in patients who received efficacious AED doses and 6.9 (3.8–11.6) in those allocated to placebo.

Interpretation

Treatment with adjunctive AEDs at efficacious doses may have reduced the incidence of definite or probable SUDEP by more than seven times compared with placebo in patients with previously uncontrolled seizures. This result provides evidence in favour of active treatment revision for patients with refractory epilepsy.

### Monotherapy clinical trial design [^115weWPj]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Monotherapy of epilepsy is usually preferable to polytherapy for a variety of reasons. However, investigational or newer antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are typically evaluated as add-on therapy in patients with refractory seizures. Because coadministered drugs are subject to drug interactions, add-on trials of AEDs do not necessarily address the utility of a new AED as monotherapy or its use in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy, in whom monotherapy is usually sufficient. Monotherapy clinical trials are difficult to design because randomizing epilepsy patients to placebo or pseudoplacebo is considered unethical, and results from active-drug noninferiority designs are difficult to interpret. Active-drug superiority designs have been developed in an attempt to provide useful information about the monotherapeutic efficacy of new AEDs. The conversion to monotherapy trial design, introduced in the late 1970s, provides for initial add-on of an investigational agent to a preexisting drug in patients with uncontrolled seizures, followed by gradual discontinuation of the preexisting treatment and an eventual monotherapy phase of the investigational agent. Conversion to monotherapy trials are typically of short duration and have been criticized for failing to provide adequate time for titration to optimal dose, an inability to examine tolerance development or long-term safety, and possibly placing enrolled patients at increased risk for morbidity, but they have been used to obtain data about monotherapy efficacy sufficient for regulatory authority approval. Relevant clinical trial data are needed to guide treatment choices in patients who have failed previous monotherapy. To date, large-scale prospective trials comparing monotherapy with old and new AEDs have not shown superior efficacy of the new AEDs but have demonstrated their better tolerability and safety. It is hoped that use of appropriately designed monotherapy clinical trials will help to identify a new generation of AEDs in the future for monotherapy in epilepsy patients.

### Effectiveness analysis of three-drug combination therapies for refractory focal epilepsy [^114PbV5q]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, approximately 15% of patients with refractory focal epilepsy achieved seizure freedom under three-drug combination therapies, with LTG/VPA/TPM and LTG/VPA/LEV showing notable efficacy. For patients with DRE who have not responded to dual therapy, rational selection of triple therapy may improve their prognosis. However, importantly, personalized factors should still be accounted for when considering the utilization of these treatment plans.

### Brivaracetam add-on therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy [^112XpPEY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. It is estimated that up to 30% of patients with epilepsy continue to have epileptic seizures despite treatment with an antiepileptic drug. These patients are classified as drug-resistant and require treatment with a combination of multiple antiepileptic drugs. Brivaracetam is a third-generation antiepileptic drug that is a high-affinity ligand for synaptic vesicle protein 2A. This review investigates the use of brivaracetam as add-on therapy for epilepsy.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of brivaracetam when used as add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant epilepsy.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases on 9 October 2018: the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Medline (Ovid) 1946 to 8 October 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Originally we also searched SCOPUS as a substitute for Embase, but this is no longer necessary, because randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials in Embase are now included in CENTRAL.

Selection Criteria

We sought randomised controlled trials with parallel-group design, recruiting people of any age with drug-resistant epilepsy. We accepted studies with any level of blinding (double-blind, single-blind, or unblind).

Data Collection and Analysis

In accordance with standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration, two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion before evaluating trial quality and extracting relevant data. The primary outcome to be assessed was 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. Secondary outcomes were: seizure freedom, treatment withdrawal for any reason, treatment withdrawal due to adverse events, the proportion of participants who experienced any adverse events, and drug interactions. We used an intention-to-treat (ITT) population for all primary analyses, and we presented results as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

The review included six trials representing 2411 participants. Only one study included participants with both focal and generalised onset seizures; the other five trials included participants with focal onset seizures only. All six studies included adult participants between 16 and 80 years old, and treatment periods ranged from 7 to 16 weeks. We judged two studies to have low risk of bias and four to have unclear risk of bias. One study failed to provide details on the method used for allocation concealment, and one did not report all outcomes prespecified in the trial protocol. One study did not describe how blinding was maintained, and another noted discrepancies in reporting. Participants receiving brivaracetam add-on were significantly more likely to experience a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency than those receiving placebo (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.14; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Participants receiving brivaracetam were also significantly more likely to attain seizure freedom (RR 5.89, 95% CI 2.30 to 15.13; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence). The incidence of treatment withdrawal for any reason (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.74; 6 studies; low-quality evidence), as well as the risk of participants experiencing one or more adverse events (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.17; 5 studies; moderate-quality evidence), was not significantly different following treatment with brivaracetam compared to placebo. However, participants receiving brivaracetam did appear to be significantly more likely to withdraw from treatment specifically because of adverse events compared with those receiving placebo (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.33; 6 studies; low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Brivaracetam, when used as add-on therapy for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, is effective in reducing seizure frequency and can aid patients in achieving seizure freedom. However, add-on brivaracetam is associated with a greater proportion of treatment withdrawals due to adverse events compared with placebo. It is important to note that only one of the eligible studies included participants with generalised epilepsy. None of the studies included participants under the age of 16, and all studies were of short duration. Consequently, these findings are mainly applicable to adult patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Future research should thus focus on investigating the tolerability and efficacy of brivaracetam during longer-term follow-up, and should also assess the efficacy and tolerability of add-on brivaracetam in managing other types of seizures and its use in other age groups.

### Practice advisory: the use of felbamate in the treatment of patients with intractable epilepsy: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society [^112kTf2Q]. Neurology (1999). Medium credibility.

Practice advisory recommendation categories — "Guideline" is defined as "A recommendation for patient management that reflects moderate clinical certainty (usually this requires Class II evidence or a strong consensus of Class III evidence)". "Practice option" is "A strategy for patient management for which the clinical utility is uncertain (inconclusive or conflicting evidence or opinion)". "Practice Advisory" is "A practice recommendation for emerging and/or newly approved therapies or technologies based on evidence from at least one Class I study. The evidence may demonstrate only a modest statistical effect or limited (partial) clinical response, or significant cost-benefit questions may exist. Substantial (or potential) disagreement among practitioners or between payers and practitioners may exist".

### Conversion to monotherapy: clinical trials in patients with refractory partial seizures [^116Tjqk7]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

The efficacy, tolerability, and safety of a potential antiepileptic drug (AED) are initially evaluated in clinical trials employing add-on designs. When positive, those trials allow us only to conclude that the study drug is efficacious when administered as adjunctive therapy. However, to demonstrate efficacy and safety as monotherapy, the drug must be evaluated using a monotherapy trial design. Such a design needs to take into account important methodologic issues that can affect clinical relevance and/or raise ethical concerns. This review critically assesses two monotherapy trial designs: outpatient conversion to monotherapy and presurgical conversion to monotherapy in patients with medically refractory seizures of partial onset. The efficacy and safety data derived from published studies of AED monotherapy in patients with partial-onset seizures that utilize these trial designs are evaluated and the advantages and disadvantages of each trial design are discussed.

### Practice guideline update summary: efficacy and tolerability of the new antiepileptic drugs II: treatment-resistant epilepsy: report of the American Epilepsy Society and the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^113jvdop]. Epilepsy Currents (2018). Low credibility.

Objective: To update the 2004 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guideline for managing treatment-resistant (TR) epilepsy with second- and third-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Methods: 2004 criteria were used to systematically review literature (January 2003 to November 2015), classify pertinent studies according to the therapeutic rating scheme, and link recommendations to evidence strength. Results: Forty-two articles were included. Recommendations: The following are established as effective to reduce seizure frequency (Level A): immediate-release pregabalin and perampanel for TR adult focal epilepsy (TRAFE); vigabatrin for TRAFE (not first-line treatment; rufinamide for Lennox-Gastuat syndrome (LGS) (add-on therapy). The following should be considered to decrease seizure frequency (Level B): lacosamide, eslicarbazepine, and extended-release topiramate for TRAFE (ezogabine production discontinued); immediate- and extended-release lamotrigine for generalized epilepsy with TR generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures in adults; levetiracetam (add-on therapy) for TR childhood focal epilepsy (TRCFE) (1 month to 16 years), TR GTC seizures, and TR juvenile myoclonic epilepsy; clobazam for LGS (add-on therapy); zonisamide for TRCFE (6–17 years); oxcarbazepine for TRCFE (1 month to 4 years). The text presents Level C recommendations. AED selection depends on seizure/syndrome type, patient age, concomitant medications, and AED tolerability, safety, and efficacy. This evidence-based assessment informs AED prescription guidelines for TR epilepsy and indicates seizure types and syndromes needing more evidence. A recent FDA strategy allows extrapolation of efficacy across populations; therefore, for focal epilepsy, eslicarbazepine and lacosamide (oral only for pediatric use) as add-on or monotherapy in persons ≥ 4 years of age and perampanel as monotherapy received FDA approval.

### Subpial transection surgery for epilepsy [^116k41Yn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nearly 30% of patients with epilepsy continue to have seizures despite using several antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Such patients are regarded as having refractory, or uncontrolled, epilepsy. While there is no universally accepted definition of uncontrolled, or medically refractory, epilepsy, for the purposes of this review we will consider seizures as drug resistant if they have failed to respond to a minimum of two AEDs. Specialists consider that early surgical intervention may prevent seizures at a younger age, which in turn may improve the intellectual and social status of children. Many types of surgery are available for treating refractory epilepsy; one such procedure is known as subpial transection.

Objectives

To assess the effects of subpial transection for focal-onset seizures and generalised tonic-clonic seizures in children and adults.

Search Methods

For the latest update we searched the following databases on 7 August 2018: the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to August 06, 2018), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We imposed no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered all randomised and quasi-randomised parallel-group studies, whether blinded or non-blinded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (BK and SR) independently screened trials identified by the search. The same two review authors planned to independently assess the methodological quality of studies. Had we identified studies for inclusion, one review author would have extracted the data, and the other would have verified the data.

Main Results

We found no relevant studies.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence to support or refute the use of subpial transection surgery for patients with medically refractory epilepsy. Well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed to guide clinical practice.

### Felbamate add-on therapy for drug-resistant focal epilepsy [^116Mt2Q3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review first published in 2011, and most recently updated in 2019. Epilepsy is a chronic and disabling neurological disorder, affecting approximately 1% of the population. Up to 30% of people with epilepsy have seizures that are resistant to currently available antiepileptic drugs and require treatment with multiple antiepileptic drugs in combination. Felbamate is a second-generation antiepileptic drug that can be used as add-on therapy to standard antiepileptic drugs.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of felbamate versus placebo when used as an add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant focal-onset epilepsy.

Search Methods

For the latest update, we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 13 July 2021) on 15 July 2021. There were no language or time restrictions. We reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies to search for additional reports of relevant studies. We also contacted the manufacturers of felbamate and experts in the field for information about any unpublished or ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised placebo-controlled add-on studies of people of any age with drug-resistant focal seizures. The studies could be double-blind, single-blind or unblinded and could be of parallel-group or cross-over design.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted information. In the case of disagreements, a third review author arbitrated. Review authors assessed the following outcomes: 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency; absolute or percentage reduction in seizure frequency; treatment withdrawal; adverse effects; quality of life.

Main Results

We included four randomised controlled trials, representing a total of 236 participants, in the review. Two trials had parallel-group design, the third had a two-period cross-over design, and the fourth had a three-period cross-over design. We judged all four studies to be at an unclear risk of bias overall. Bias arose from the incomplete reporting of methodological details, the incomplete and selective reporting of outcome data, and from participants having unstable drug regimens during experimental treatment in one trial. Due to significant methodological heterogeneity, clinical heterogeneity and differences in outcome measures, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis of the extracted data. Only one study reported the outcome of 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, whilst three studies reported percentage reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo. One study claimed an average seizure reduction of 35.8% with add-on felbamate whilst another study claimed a more modest reduction of 4.2%. Both studies reported that seizure frequency increased with add-on placebo and that there was a significant difference in seizure reduction between felbamate and placebo (P = 0.0005 and P = 0.018, respectively). The third study reported a 14% reduction in seizure frequency with add-on felbamate but stated that the difference between treatments was not significant. There were conflicting results regarding treatment withdrawal. One study reported a higher treatment withdrawal for placebo-randomised participants, whereas the other three studies reported higher treatment withdrawal rates for felbamate-randomised participants. Notably, the treatment withdrawal rates for felbamate treatment groups across all four studies remained reasonably low (less than 10%), suggesting that felbamate may be well tolerated. Felbamate-randomised participants most commonly withdrew from treatment due to adverse effects. The adverse effects consistently reported by all four studies were headache, dizziness and nausea. All three adverse effects were reported by 23% to 40% of felbamate-treated participants versus 3% to 15% of placebo-treated participants. We assessed the evidence for all outcomes using GRADE and rated the evidence as very low certainty, meaning that we have little confidence in the findings reported. We mainly downgraded evidence for imprecision due to the narrative synthesis conducted and the low number of events. We stress that the true effect of felbamate could likely be significantly different from that reported in this current review update.

Authors' Conclusions

In view of the methodological deficiencies, the limited number of included studies and the differences in outcome measures, we have found no reliable evidence to support the use of felbamate as an add-on therapy in people with drug-resistant focal-onset epilepsy. A large-scale, randomised controlled trial conducted over a longer period of time is required to inform clinical practice.

### Tiagabine add-on therapy for drug-resistant focal epilepsy [^113u9tHs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is a common neurological condition that affects up to 1% of the population. Nearly 30% of people with epilepsy are resistant to currently available antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and require treatment with multiple antiepileptic drugs in combination. Tiagabine is one of the newer AEDs that can be used as an adjunct (add-on) to standard AEDs.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of tiagabine when used as an add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant focal seizures.

Search Methods

This is an updated Cochrane review, last published in 2014. For the latest update, we searched the following databases on 22 January 2019: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to January 21, 2019), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We imposed no language restrictions. We also contacted the manufacturers of tiagabine and experts in the field to identify any ongoing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised placebo-controlled add-on trials conducted in people of any age with focal epilepsy. The studies could be double-, single-, or unblinded and of parallel or cross-over design. They had to have a minimum treatment period of eight weeks. We also included trials using an active drug control group.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data according to the standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration for this review update. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Outcomes investigated included 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, treatment withdrawal, adverse effects, effects on cognition and quality of life. The primary analyses were performed by intention-to-treat. We calculated worst-case and best-case analyses for seizure outcomes. We evaluated dose response using regression models. Two review authors assessed risk of bias in each study using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool.

Main Results

No further studies were added since the previous update in 2014. The review included six trials (four parallel-group and two cross-over group trials) consisting of 948 participants. For the main comparison, tiagabine versus placebo, all participants were aged between 12 and 77 years and the study treatment periods ranged from 12 to 22 weeks. The overall risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (tiagabine versus placebo) was 3.16 (95% CI 1.97 to 5.07; 3 trials; 769 participants; high-certainty evidence). Because of differences in response rates among trials, regression models were unable to provide reliable estimates of response to individual doses. The RR for treatment withdrawal (tiagabine versus placebo) was 1.81 (95% CI 1.25 to 2.62; 3 trials, 769 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Dizziness and tremor were significantly associated with tiagabine therapy. For cognitive and quality-of-life outcomes, the limited available data suggested no significant effects on cognition, mood, or adjustment. One trial comparing tiagabine with an active drug control group (tiagabine versus topiramate) found no significant differences between the two add-on drugs for a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.58; 1 trial; 41 participants) or for treatment withdrawal (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.74; one trial; 41 participants). We judged two of the six included studies to have low risk of bias, three studies to have an unclear risk of bias, and one study to have a high risk of bias. Methods for randomisation sequence generation were the least reported trial design factor and generated the most concerns regarding risk of bias. We rated the overall certainty of the evidence as largely moderate to high using the GRADE approach. We rated the evidence for two of the adverse effect outcomes, nausea and tremor, as low certainty.

Authors' Conclusions

Tiagabine reduced seizure frequency but was associated with some adverse effects when used as an add-on treatment in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The findings of the current review are mainly applicable to adults and adolescents, and may not necessarily be applicable to children as none of the trials included participants aged under 12 years. We found no significant differences between tiagabine and topiramate as add-on drugs; however, evidence was provided by a single trial and was therefore limited.

### Effectiveness analysis of three-drug combination therapies for refractory focal epilepsy [^113Mg85Z]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

With over 20 approved ASMs available on the market, there are more than 10,000 potential combinations of three drugs. Conducting rigorous drug trials to assess the efficacy of all these combination regimens is impractical. In this context, real-world studies provide a viable approach to comprehensively evaluate the drug regimens used by patients. In this study, a total of 511 three-drug trials involving 76 different drug combinations were conducted among 323 enrolled patients with DRE. Forty-eight patients (14.9%) achieved SF in these three-drug trials. After analyzing the seizure-free rate and within-patient SFR, we found that LTG/VPA/TPM and LTG/VPA/LEV showed significantly superior efficacy in patients with refractory focal epilepsy, especially in adult patients. In addition, LTG/VPA/PER displayed promising trends toward good efficacy in terms of the SFR.

### Is a separate monotherapy indication warranted for antiepileptic drugs? [^116TUPSv]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are the only neurotherapeutics for which regulatory approval is consistently separated into monotherapy or adjunctive-therapy indications. Because head-to-head comparisons of AEDs (used in the European Union to approve drugs for monotherapy) have not shown substantial differences in efficacy between drugs, FDA approval for use of an AED as monotherapy has typically been based on trials with novel designs that have been criticised for reasons of ethics and clinical relevance. Many new-generation AEDs have not been approved for monotherapy, causing drug labelling and real-world use to be increasingly inconsistent, with negative consequences for patients. The regulatory requirement for separate monotherapy and adjunctive-therapy indications in epilepsy is unnecessarily restrictive. We recommend that regulatory agencies approve AEDs for the treatment of specific seizure types or epilepsy syndromes, irrespective of concomitant drug use.

Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Adult treatment-resistant focal epilepsy (TRAFE) — conversion-to-monotherapy evidence and recommendations: In Class III studies, extended-release levetiracetam (LEV-XR), PGB, LCM, and ESL were used at 1,000 and 2,000 mg/d (LEV-XR), 150 and 600 mg/d (PGB), 300 and 400 mg/d (LCM), and 1,200 and 1,600 mg/d (ESL), and for all four drugs the predicted exit rate was significantly lower than historical controls. Conclusions state ESL is possibly effective as monotherapy for TRAFE (2 Class III studies) and evidence is insufficient for LCM, LEV-XR, or PGB as monotherapy for TRAFE (1 Class III study per drug). Recommendations state ESL use may be considered to decrease seizure frequency as monotherapy for TRAFE (Level C), and data are insufficient to recommend the use of second- and the other third-generation AEDs as monotherapy in TRAFE (Level U).

### Stiripentol add-on therapy for focal refractory epilepsy [^117NYCc6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the Cochrane review last published in 2015 (Issue 10). For nearly 30% of people with epilepsy, seizures are not controlled by current treatments. Stiripentol is a new antiepileptic drug (AED) that was developed in France and was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2007 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome as an adjunctive therapy with valproate and clobazam, with promising effects.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of stiripentol as add-on treatment for people with focal refractory epilepsy who are taking AEDs.

Search Methods

For the latest update, we searched the following databases on 21 August 2017: Cochrane Epilepsy Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We contacted Biocodex (the manufacturer of stiripentol) and epilepsy experts to identify published, unpublished and ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, controlled, add-on trials of stiripentol in people with focal refractory epilepsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes investigated included 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, seizure freedom, adverse effects, treatment withdrawal and changes in quality of life.

Main Results

On the basis of our selection criteria, we included no new studies in the present review. Only one study was included from the earlier review (32 children with focal epilepsy). This study adopted a 'responder enriched' design and found no clear evidence of a reduction in seizure frequency (≥ 50% seizure reduction) (risk ratio (RR) 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 2.82, low-quality evidence) nor evidence of seizure freedom (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.31 to 4.43, low-quality evidence) when add-on stiripentol was compared with placebo. Stiripentol led to a greater risk of adverse effects considered as a whole (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.08 to 6.47, low-quality evidence). When specific adverse events were considered, confidence intervals were very wide and showed the possibility of substantial increases and small reductions in risks of neurological (RR 2.65, 95% CI 0.88 to 8.01, low-quality evidence) or gastrointestinal adverse effects (RR 11.56, 95% CI 0.71 to 189.36, low-quality evidence). Researchers noted no clear reduction in the risk of study withdrawal (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.47, low-quality evidence), which was high in both groups (35.0% in add-on placebo and 53.3% in stiripentol group, low-quality evidence). The external validity of this study was limited because only responders to stiripentol (i.e. patients experiencing a ≥ 50% decrease in seizure frequency compared with baseline) were included in the randomised, add-on, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase. Furthermore, carry-over and withdrawal effects probably influenced outcomes related to seizure frequency. Very limited information derived from the only included study shows that adverse effects considered as a whole seemed to occur significantly more often with add-on stiripentol than with add-on placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

Since the last version of this review was published, we have found no new studies. Hence, we have made no changes to the conclusions of this update as presented in the initial review. We can draw no conclusions to support the use of stiripentol as add-on treatment for focal refractory epilepsy. Additional large, randomised, well-conducted trials are needed.

### Subpial transection surgery for epilepsy [^114Ctn8Y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nearly 30% of patients with epilepsy continue to have seizures in spite of several antiepileptic drug (AED) regimens. In such cases they are regarded as having refractory, or uncontrolled epilepsy. There is no universally accepted definition for uncontrolled or medically refractory epilepsy, but for the purpose of this review, we will consider seizures to be drug resistant if they failed to respond to a minimum of two AEDs. It is believed that early surgical intervention may prevent seizures at a younger age and improve the intellectual and social status of children. There are many types of surgery for refractory epilepsy with subpial transection being one.

Objectives

Our main aim is to determine the benefits and adverse effects of subpial transection for partial-onset seizures and generalised tonic-clonic seizures in children and adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (8 August 2013), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL Issue 7 of 12, The Cochrane Library July 2013), and MEDLINE (1946 to 8 August 2013). We did not impose any language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered all randomised and quasi-randomised parallel group studies either blinded or non-blinded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (BK and SR) independently screened the trials identified by the search. The same two authors planned to independently assess the methodological quality of studies. If studies had been identified for inclusion, one author would have extracted the data and the other would have verified it.

Main Results

No relevant studies were found.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence to support or refute the use of subpial transection surgery for medically refractory cases of epilepsy. Well designed randomised controlled trials are needed in future to guide clinical practice.

### The medical management of the epilepsies in children: conceptual and practical considerations [^111pAoYB]. The Lancet: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Epilepsy in children encompasses several syndromes. The cardinal feature of these syndromes is a predisposition to epileptic seizures but each is associated with different prognoses. The goals of treatment will clearly differ between children who become seizure-free on antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment and those children with refractory epilepsy. Treatment should be tailored to the needs of the patient, with a comprehensive approach that addresses the common additional morbidities in children with epilepsy. In this Review, we present an overview of the medical management of epilepsy in children and discuss the dilemmas of everyday practice, such as selection of AED, assessment of outcome, monitoring of treatment, and the decision to withdraw medication when the child is free from seizures. Furthermore, we emphasise the need to establish rational goals for treatment, such as aiming for the best possible quality of life rather than freedom from seizures at all costs.

Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the 2004 American Academy of Neurology guideline for managing treatment-resistant (TR) epilepsy with second- and third-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).

Methods

2004 criteria were used to systemically review literature (January 2003 to November 2015), classify pertinent studies according to the therapeutic rating scheme, and link recommendations to evidence strength.

Results

Forty-two articles were included.

Recommendations

The following are established as effective to reduce seizure frequency (Level A): immediate-release pregabalin and perampanel for TR adult focal epilepsy (TRAFE); vigabatrin for TRAFE (not first-line treatment); rufinamide for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) (add-on therapy). The following should be considered to decrease seizure frequency (Level B): lacosamide, eslicarbazepine, and extended-release topiramate for TRAFE (ezogabine production discontinued); immediate- and extended-release lamotrigine for generalized epilepsy with TR generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures in adults; levetiracetam (add-on therapy) for TR childhood focal epilepsy (TRCFE) (1 month-16 years), TR GTC seizures, and TR juvenile myoclonic epilepsy; clobazam for LGS (add-on therapy); zonisamide for TRCFE (6–17 years); oxcarbazepine for TRCFE (1 month-4 years). The text presents Level C recommendations. AED selection depends on seizure/syndrome type, patient age, concomitant medications, and AED tolerability, safety, and efficacy. This evidence-based assessment informs AED prescription guidelines for TR epilepsy and indicates seizure types and syndromes needing more evidence. A recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) strategy allows extrapolation of efficacy across populations; therefore, for focal epilepsy, eslicarbazepine and lacosamide (oral only for pediatric use) as add-on or monotherapy in persons ≥ 4 years of age and perampanel as monotherapy received FDA approval.

### Likelihood of seizure remission in an adult population with refractory epilepsy [^112UsnEY]. Annals of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

We aimed to determine the likelihood of remission and its clinical predictors in adult patients meeting a strict definition of refractory epilepsy. We also wanted to investigate the influence of treatment regimen on remission.

Methods

A total of 246 patients with treatment refractory epilepsy (having at least 1 seizure per month and having not responded positively to at least 2 antiepileptic drugs) were identified in 2000 and followed for 3 years. We used Kaplan-Meier methods to estimate the rate of achieving a 6-month terminal seizure remission and Cox regression analysis to evaluate clinical predictors for seizure remission.

Results

The estimated 6-month terminal seizure remission rate was 19% (95% confidence interval, 14–26%) for all cases and 14% (95% confidence interval, 10–21%) when limited to those treated only with medication. Negative predictors for remission included a history of status epilepticus, younger age at intractability, number of failed drug therapies, and presence of mental retardation. No specific drug was significantly associated with remission, and frequently, no clear intervention led to terminal remission.

Interpretation

Fifteen percent (approximately 5% per year) of a drug refractory epilepsy population obtained a 6-month terminal seizure remission. Our results signify that no matter how many antiepileptic drug therapies have failed, there is always hope of a meaningful seizure remission in this population. Furthermore, we have elucidated four clinical predictors that can aid the epileptologist in prognostication.

### Levetiracetam add-on for drug-resistant focal epilepsy: an updated cochrane review [^115Tz7Qz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is an important neurological condition and drug resistance in epilepsy is particularly common in individuals with focal seizures. In this review, we summarise the current evidence regarding a new antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam, when used as add-on treatment for controlling drug-resistant focal epilepsy. This is an update to a Cochrane Review that was originally published in 2001.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of levetiracetam, added on to usual care, in treating drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (August 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 7, 2012), and MEDLINE (1946 to August week 1, 2012). We also contacted the manufacturers of levetiracetam and researchers in the field to seek any ongoing or unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled trials of add-on levetiracetam treatment in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trials for bias, extracted data, and evaluated the overall quality of evidence. Outcomes investigated included 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency (response); less than 50% reduction in focal seizure frequency (non-response); treatment withdrawal; adverse effects (including a specific analysis of changes in behaviour); cognitive effects and quality of life (QoL). Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used as measures of effect (99% CIs for adverse effects). Primary analyses were Intention-to-Treat (ITT). Dose response and inter-trial heterogeneity were evaluated in regression models.

Main Results

Eleven trials (1861 participants) were included. They predominantly possessed low risks of bias. Participants were adults in nine trials (1565 participants) and children in the remaining two trials (296 participants). The dose of levetiracetam tested was 1000 to 4000 mg/day in adults, and 60 mg/kg/day in children. Treatment ranged from 12 to 24 weeks. For the 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency outcome, the RR was significantly in favour of levetiracetam at all doses. The naive estimates, ignoring dose, showed children (52% responded) as better responders than adults (39% responded) on levetiracetam. 25% of children and 16% of adults responded to placebo. The Number Needed to Treat for an additional beneficial outcome for children and adults was four (95% CI three to seven) and five (95% CI four to six), respectively. The significant levels of statistical heterogeneity between trials on adults precluded valid provision of an overall RR (ignoring dose). Results for the two trials that tested levetiracetam 2000 mg on adults were sufficiently similar to be combined to give an RR for 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency of 4.91 (95% CI 2.75 to 8.77), with an RR of 0.68 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.77) for non-response. At this dose, 37% and 8% of adults were responders in the levetiracetam and placebo groups, respectively. Regression analysis demonstrated that much of the heterogeneity between adult trials was likely to be explained by different doses of levetiracetam tested and different years of trial publication. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity between trials on children. For these trials, the RR for 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency was 1.91 (95% CI 1.38 to 2.63), with an RR of 0.68 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.81) for non-response. 27% of children responded. Participants were not significantly more likely to have levetiracetam withdrawn (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.32 and RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.43 to 1.46 for adults and children, respectively). For adults, somnolence (RR 1.51; 99% CI 1.06 to 2.17) and infection (RR 1.76; 99% CI 1.03 to 3.02) were significantly associated with levetiracetam. Accidental injury was significantly associated with placebo (RR 0.60; 99% CI 0.39 to 0.92). No individual adverse effect was significantly associated with levetiracetam in children. Changes in behaviour were negligible in adults (1% affected; RR 1.79; 99% CI 0.59 to 5.41) but significant in children (23% affected; RR 1.90; 99% CI 1.16 to 3.11). Cognitive effect and QoL outcomes suggested that levetiracetam had a positive effect on cognition and some aspects of QoL in adults. In children, levetiracetam did not appear to alter cognitive function but there was evidence of worsening in certain aspects of child behaviour. The overall quality of evidence used was high.

Authors' Conclusions

This update adds seven more trials to the original review, which contained four trials. At every dose analysed, levetiracetam significantly reduced focal seizure frequency relative to placebo. This indicates that levetiracetam can significantly reduce focal seizure frequency when it is used as an add-on treatment for both adults and children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. As there was evidence of significant levels of statistical heterogeneity within this positive effect it is difficult to be precise about the relative magnitude of the effect. At a dose of 2000 mg, levetiracetam may be expected to be 3.9 times more effective than placebo; with 30% of adults being responders at this dose. At a dose of 60 mg/kg/day, levetiracetam may be expected to be 0.9 times more effective than placebo; with 25% of children being responders at this dose. When dose was ignored, children were better responders than adults by around 4% to 13%. The results grossly suggest that one child or adult may respond to levetiracetam for every four or five children or adults, respectively, that have received levetiracetam rather than placebo. The drug seems to be well tolerated in both adults and children although non-specific changes in behaviour may be experienced in as high as 20% of children. This aspect of the adverse-effect profile of levetiracetam was analysed crudely and requires further investigation and validation. It seems reasonable to continue the use of levetiracetam in both adults and children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The results cannot be used to confirm longer-term or monotherapy effects of levetiracetam or its effects on generalised seizures. The conclusions are largely unchanged from those in the original review. The most significant contribution of this update is the addition of paediatric data into the analysis.

### Anaesthesia and epilepsy [^116Un6f9]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Epilepsy is the most common serious neurological disorder, with a prevalence of 0.5–1% of the population. While the traditional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) still play a significant role in treatment of seizures, there has been an influx of newer agents over the last 20 yr, which are now in common usage. Anaesthetists are frequently faced with patients with epilepsy undergoing emergency or elective surgery and patients suffering seizures and status epilepticus in the intensive care unit (ICU). This review examines perioperative epilepsy management, the mode of action of AEDs and their interaction with anaesthetic agents, potential adverse effects of anaesthetic agents, and the acute management of seizures and refractory status epilepticus on the ICU. Relevant literature was identified by a Pubmed search of epilepsy and status epilepticus in conjunction with individual anaesthetic agents.

Monotherapy evidence in adults with TR focal epilepsy — post-2004 studies — includes that since the 2004 guideline, 5 Class III conversion-to-monotherapy studies have been conducted using historical controls, with one evaluating extended-release levetiracetam (LEV-XR), 1 evaluating PGB, 1 evaluating LCM, and 2 evaluating ESL; in the LEV-XR study, 1,000-mg/d and 2,000-mg/d doses were used, and in the PGB study, 150-mg/d and 600-mg/d doses were used.

Treatment-resistant adult focal epilepsy (TRAFE) — monotherapy with second- and other third-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs): Eslicarbazepine (ESL) is possibly effective as monotherapy for TRAFE (2 Class III studies), but evidence is insufficient to determine the efficacy of lacosamide (LCM), levetiracetam extended-release (LEV-XR), or pregabalin (PGB) as monotherapy for TRAFE (1 Class III study per drug), and data are insufficient to recommend these agents as monotherapy in TRAFE (Level U).

### Precision therapy in the genetic epilepsies of childhood [^112xFQEN]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite recent advances in both the understanding and treatment of the epilepsies, the rate of refractory epilepsy has remained static for many years. However, given our greater understanding of the aetiology and genetic basis of many paediatric and adult epilepsies, there is now scope to expand treatment. In this review, we discuss the current and potential use of precision medicine in the genetic epilepsies of childhood. We will discuss how optimal control and a reduction in the rate of refractory seizures using targeted therapy could be developed and assessed. We propose a six-tier approach to defining precision therapeutics in epilepsy and discuss how this can be incorporated into a clinical trial design. The lower tiers (1–2) represent therapies in common usage that we know work for certain epilepsy syndromes but do not precisely target the underlying problem. They work to reduce seizures but do not directly or effectively attenuate the developmental phenotype. The higher tiers (5–6) are currently purely speculative and look to a future with highly disease-specific therapies based on correction of underlying genomic and proteomic issues. In order to achieve this, scientists will have to embark on a 'whole-omic' approach to understand the underlying pathophysiology in order to design a precision therapy. What this paper adds Epilepsy treatment is classified into six tiers depending on how precisely the mechanism of action addresses the aetiology. Tier 1 treatment is based on the historical response of certain epilepsy phenotypes to specific medication. Tier 6 concerns therapy targeting genes and networks that rescue the whole phenotype. Clinical trial infrastructure and population-based disease registries are necessary so that patients can participate in trials for novel precision therapies.

### New and forthcoming anti-epileptic drugs [^1155YVjM]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is a need for newer anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) with improved efficacy and tolerability. This article reviews AEDs introduced since 2007 and investigational compounds in clinical development.

Recent Findings

Two recently introduced AEDs, stiripentol and rufinamide, have been licensed exclusively for orphan indications, that is severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (stiripentol, Europe) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (rufinamide, Europe and the United States). This signals a welcome new trend to explore novel treatments in specific pediatric syndromes for which there are high therapeutic needs. Two additional AEDs, lacosamide and eslicarbazepine acetate, have been licensed recently for a more traditional indication, refractory partial-onset seizures. Although newly introduced agents given as adjunctive therapy have been found to be superior to placebo in reducing seizure frequency, the ultimate goal of sustained seizure freedom is rarely achieved. Therefore, the search for better agents should continue. Several investigational compounds are currently in various stages of clinical development.

Summary

The recent introduction of newer AEDs has enlarged the armamentarium against epilepsy. However, newer agents had only a modest impact on the probability of achieving long-term remission. Novel strategies for the discovery and development of truly innovative AEDs are sorely needed.

### Efficacy, tolerability and safety of add-on third-generation antiseizure medications in treating focal seizures worldwide: a network meta-analysis of randomised, placebo-controlled trials [^116suNDj]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this study is the most comprehensive quantitative synthesis to date, examining the use of third-generation ASMs as an add-on strategy in patients with treatment-resistant FOS, boasting the largest sample size. Compared to previous studies addressing the same issue, we provide an updated and detailed assessment of efficacy, tolerability, and safety outcomes for both ASMs and their different dosages. Our findings aim to inform clinical guidelines and support decision-making for patients and clinicians, helping to select the most appropriate treatment strategies in this critical clinical area.

Achieving seizure freedom is a primary objective in the treatment of epilepsy. However, only 50% of patients who receive their first antiepileptic drug treatment become seizure-free. This means that many patients require additional treatment in order to reach this goal. Unfortunately, more than a third of patients with epilepsy continue to experience uncontrolled seizures even after being treated with an antiepileptic drug. Additionally, very few patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy are able to achieve seizure freedom, even with the use of newer drugs. Uncontrolled epilepsy can have a profound impact on patients' lives, leading to psychological and social dysfunction, limited educational and employment opportunities, and a diminished quality of life. It also poses a risk of premature death, with persistent generalised tonic-clonic seizures being a particular risk factor for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Given these challenges, there is a critical need for new and more effective antiepileptic drugs that can reduce seizures in patients with uncontrolled epilepsy and help a greater number of individuals attain seizure freedom.

### Cenobamate add-on therapy for drug-resistant focal epilepsy [^113A6uwj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Although most people with epilepsy achieve complete seizure cessation, approximately one-third of those with the condition continue experiencing seizures despite the use of antiseizure medications (ASMs) given as monotherapy or polytherapy. In this review, we summarised the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) about cenobamate as an add-on treatment for focal epilepsy uncontrolled by one or more concomitant ASMs.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of add-on oral cenobamate for the treatment of drug-resistant focal-onset seizures, defined as seizures persisting despite treatment with one or more ASMs.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE Ovid (September 2022). In addition, we contacted the manufacturer of cenobamate and experts in the field to enquire after any ongoing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing add-on cenobamate to placebo or another ASM in people with focal epilepsy uncontrolled by one or more concomitant ASMs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, performed risk of bias assessment, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Our primary outcomes were at least a 50% reduction in total seizure frequency, seizure freedom, and the occurrence of adverse events. We used an intention-to-treat approach for our primary analyses. For each outcome we estimated summary risk ratios (RRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We summarised the estimates of effects and certainty of the evidence for each outcome in a summary of findings table.

Main Results

We included two studies (659 adult participants, 442 allocated to cenobamate and 217 to placebo). The overall RR for at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency for add-on cenobamate at any dose compared to placebo was 2.17 (52% versus 24%, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.84; 2 studies, 605 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The RR for seizure freedom for add-on cenobamate at any dose compared to placebo was 4.45 (16% versus 5%, 95% CI 2.25 to 8.78; 2 studies, 605 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The RR for the occurrence of adverse events for add-on cenobamate at any dose compared to placebo was 1.14 (77% versus 67%, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.27; 2 studies, 659 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We judged the two included RCTs as at low or unclear risk of bias. Both studies were sponsored by the drug company that produces cenobamate.

Authors' Conclusions

Add-on cenobamate is probably better than placebo in reducing the frequency of seizures by at least 50% and in achieving seizure freedom in adults with focal epilepsy uncontrolled by one or more concomitant ASMs (moderate level of certainty). Its use is probably associated with an increased risk of adverse events (moderate level of certainty). Further prospective, controlled trials are required to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of add-on cenobamate compared to other ASMs. The efficacy and tolerability of cenobamate as adjunctive treatment for focal epilepsy in children should be further investigated. Finally, the long-term efficacy and tolerability of add-on cenobamate treatment in people with other epilepsy types (e.g. generalised epilepsy) or specific epilepsy syndromes, as well as its use as monotherapy, require additional study.

### Lamotrigine add-on therapy for drug-resistant focal epilepsy [^111NzSnU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of a Cochrane Review last updated in 2020. Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, affecting 0.5% to 1% of the population. In nearly 30% of cases, epilepsy is resistant to currently available drugs. Pharmacological treatment remains the first choice to control epilepsy. Lamotrigine is a second-generation antiseizure medication. When used as an add-on (in combination with other antiseizure medications), lamotrigine can reduce seizures, but with some adverse effects.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of add-on lamotrigine, compared with add-on placebo or no add-on treatment in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE (Ovid) on 3 October 2022 with no language restrictions. CRS Web includes randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Specialised Registers of Cochrane Review Groups, including Epilepsy.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated add-on lamotrigine versus add-on placebo or no add-on treatment in people of any age with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. We used data from the first period of eligible cross-over trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

For this update, two review authors independently selected trials and extracted data. Our primary outcome was 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. Our secondary outcomes were treatment withdrawal, adverse effects, cognitive effects, and quality of life. Primary analyses were by intention-to-treat. We performed sensitivity best- and worse-case analyses to account for missing outcome data. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% Cls) for dichotomous outcomes.

Main Results

We identified no new studies for this update, so the results and conclusions of the review are unchanged. We included five parallel-group studies in adults or children, eight cross-over studies in adults or children, and one parallel study with a responder-enriched design in infants. In total, these 14 studies enroled 1806 eligible participants (38 infants, 199 children, 1569 adults). Baseline phases ranged from four to 12 weeks and treatment phases ranged from eight to 36 weeks. We rated 11 studies (1243 participants) at low overall risk of bias and three (697 participants) at unclear overall risk of bias due to lack of information on study design. Four studies (563 participants) reported effective blinding. Lamotrigine compared with placebo probably increases the likelihood of achieving 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.23; 12 trials, 1322 participants (adults and children); moderate-certainty evidence). There is probably little or no difference in risk of treatment withdrawal for any reason among people treated with lamotrigine versus people treated with placebo (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.37; 14 trials; 1806 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Lamotrigine compared with placebo is probably associated with a greater risk of ataxia (RR 3.34, 99% Cl 2.01 to 5.55; 12 trials; 1525 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), dizziness (RR 1.76, 99% Cl 1.28 to 2.43; 13 trials; 1768 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), nausea (RR 1.81, 99% CI 1.22 to 2.68; 12 studies, 1486 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and diplopia (RR 3.79, 99% Cl 2.15 to 6.68; 3 trials, 944 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There is probably little or no difference in the risk of fatigue between lamotrigine and placebo (RR 0.82, 99% CI 0.55 to 1.22; 12 studies, 1552 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Lamotrigine as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal seizures is probably effective for reducing seizure frequency. Certain adverse effects (ataxia, dizziness, diplopia, and nausea) are probably more likely to occur with lamotrigine compared with placebo. There is probably little or no difference in the number of people who withdraw from treatment with lamotrigine versus placebo. The trials were of relatively short duration and provided no long-term evidence. In addition, some trials had few participants. Further trials are needed to assess the long-term effects of lamotrigine and to compare lamotrigine with other add-on drugs.

### Comparative efficacy of combination drug therapy in refractory epilepsy [^115nquW5]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

We retrospectively examined treatment records of developmentally disabled adults with highly refractory epilepsy to determine whether any combinations of 8 of the most commonly used antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) possessed superior efficacy.

Methods

We obtained the treatment records from 148 developmentally disabled adults with refractory epilepsy cared for in 2 state-run institutions. These records charted monthly convulsive seizure occurrence and AED regimen over 30 years. We studied the effects of 8 commonly used AEDs alone and in combination on seizure frequency in within-patient comparisons.

Results

Out of the 32 most frequently used AED combinations, we found that only the combination of lamotrigine and valproate had superior efficacy, measured against both an aggregate measure of other AED regimens to which patients were exposed, and in head-to-head comparisons with other AED combinations. We also found that while use of 2 concurrent AEDs provided improved efficacy over monotherapy, use of 3 AEDs at a time provided no further benefit over two.

Conclusions

These results suggest that at least one AED regimen provides significantly better efficacy in refractory convulsive epilepsy, and that AEDs should be used no more than 2 at a time. Limitations of the study include its retrospective design, lack of randomization, and small sample sizes for some drug combinations. Future prospective trials are needed in this challenging clinical population.

### Brivaracetam add-on therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy [^112afHBt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review previously published in 2019. Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. It is estimated that up to 30% of individuals with epilepsy continue to have epileptic seizures despite treatment with an antiepileptic drug. These patients are classified as drug-resistant and require treatment with a combination of multiple antiepileptic drugs. Brivaracetam is a third-generation antiepileptic drug that is a high-affinity ligand for synaptic vesicle protein 2A. In this review we investigated the use of brivaracetam as add-on therapy for epilepsy.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of brivaracetam when used as add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant epilepsy.

Search Methods

For the latest update we searched the following databases on 7 September 2021: the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web); MEDLINE (Ovid) 1946 to 3 September 2021. CRS Web includes randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the specialised registers of Cochrane Review Groups including Cochrane Epilepsy.

Selection Criteria

We searched for parallel-group RCTs that recruited people of any age with drug-resistant epilepsy. We accepted studies with any level of blinding (double-blind, single-blind, or unblinded).

Data Collection and Analysis

In accordance with standard Cochrane methodological procedures, two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion before evaluating trial quality and extracting relevant data. The primary outcome to be assessed was 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. Secondary outcomes were: seizure freedom, treatment withdrawal for any reason, treatment withdrawal due to adverse events, the proportion of participants who experienced any adverse events, and drug interactions. We used an intention-to-treat population for all primary analyses, and presented results as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

We did not identify any new studies for this update, therefore the results and conclusions of the review are unchanged. The previous review included six studies involving a total of 2411 participants. Only one study included participants with both focal and generalised onset seizures; the other five trials included participants with focal onset seizures only. Study participants were aged 16 to 80 years. Treatment periods ranged from 7 to 16 weeks. We judged two studies to have low risk of bias and four to have unclear risk of bias. Details on the method used for allocation concealment and how blinding was maintained were insufficient in one study each. One study did not report all outcomes prespecified in the trial protocol, and there were discrepancies in reporting in a further study. Participants receiving brivaracetam add-on were more likely to experience a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency than those receiving placebo (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.14; 6 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Participants receiving brivaracetam were more likely to attain seizure freedom; however, the evidence is of low certainty (RR 5.89, 95% CI 2.30 to 15.13; 6 studies). The incidence of treatment withdrawal for any reason was slightly greater for participants receiving brivaracetam compared to those receiving placebo (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.74; 6 studies; low-certainty evidence). The risk of participants experiencing one or more adverse events did not differ significantly following treatment with brivaracetam compared to placebo (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.17; 5 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). However, participants receiving brivaracetam did appear to be more likely to withdraw from treatment due to adverse events compared with those receiving placebo (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.33; 6 studies; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

When used as add-on therapy for individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy, brivaracetam may be effective in reducing seizure frequency and may aid patients in achieving seizure freedom. However, add-on brivaracetam is probably associated with a greater proportion of treatment withdrawals due to adverse events compared with placebo. It is important to note that only one of the eligible studies included participants with generalised epilepsy. None of the included studies involved participants under the age of 16, and all studies were of short duration. Consequently, the findings of this review are mainly applicable to adult patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Future research should focus on investigating the tolerability and efficacy of brivaracetam during longer-term follow-up, as well as assess the efficacy and tolerability of add-on brivaracetam in managing other types of seizures and in other age groups.

### Refractory juvenile myoclonic epilepsy: a meta-analysis of prevalence and risk factors [^116GNQUe]. European Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

One‐third of the described subjects with JME were refractory (Fig. 2). The estimates of refractoriness were comparable when assessing 1‐, 2‐ and 5‐year seizure freedom (Fig. 3), suggesting that people who are seizure‐free for at least 1 year are likely to remain so. This is consistent with studies that reported 1‐ and 2‐year or 1‐ and 5‐year seizure freedom in the same subjects, which showed minor differences between outcomes at different follow‐up intervals 20, 21.

We found no evidence for a decrease in the proportion of refractory JME over the last decades. Valproate, marketed as an AED since 1967, is still considered the most effective drug for people with JME 9, 22, 23. Thus, there is still much room for improvement.

Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Analysis of evidence — adult treatment-resistant focal epilepsy (TRAFE) adjunctive pregabalin: Pregabalin immediate release (PGB-IR) was evaluated in 2 Class I and 2 Class II studies, and controlled-release pregabalin (PGB-CR) in 1 Class I study. PGB was significantly superior to placebo at daily doses of 150, 300, and 600 mg, with > 50% responder rates and greater median percent seizure reduction, in a dose-related manner, and dizziness and sedation were the most frequently reported adverse events and were related to higher doses. In a Class I study, placebo was compared with PGB-CR 165 and 330 mg/d and the 3 arms failed to differ, with AEs and AE-related discontinuation rates higher in the high-dose arm. Conclusions state that PGB-IR is effective as add-on therapy for TR adult focal epilepsy (TRAFE) (2 Class I studies), that efficacy and AEs increased with higher doses, and that PGB-CR is probably not effective (1 Class I study). Clinical context notes that initial PGB-IR doses were higher than typically used in clinical practice (25–50 mg/d) and may have led to higher AE occurrence, and that lack of PGB-CR efficacy may be due to an exceptionally high placebo responder rate or failure to use maximal doses (e.g., 600 mg/d).

Pediatric treatment-resistant focal epilepsy — recommendations state that for add-on therapy, LEV use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency (Level B for ages 1 month to 16 years), ZNS use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency (Level B for ages 6–17 years), and OXC use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency (Level B for ages 1 month to 4 years); data are unavailable on the efficacy of CLB, ESL, LCM, PER, PGB, RFN, TGB, or VGB as add-on therapy for these children or adolescents (Level U).

Vigabatrin (VGB) add-on therapy in TRAFE — efficacy and risk context — is effective as add-on therapy in TRAFE (2 Class I studies), and benefits of VGB should be weighed against the risks, particularly risk of irreversible retinopathy.

### Treatment changes in a cohort of people with apparently drug-resistant epilepsy: an extended follow-up [^114wj9V7]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The seizure response to the addition of a previously unused antiepileptic drug in a cohort of 155 people with refractory epilepsy was previously reported after a median of 18 months follow-up.

Methods

The authors followed 139 (90%) of the original cohort for a median follow-up of 6.9 years to determine the longer term outcome in people with refractory epilepsy.

Results

During the 6.9 year follow-up period, a total of 448 medication changes were made. Eight per cent of these resulted in 12 months or more of seizure freedom and a further 17% of changes resulted in at least 50% improvement in seizure frequency. At the last follow-up, 26 (19%) of individuals had been seizure-free for 12 months or more, and 41 (29%) had 50%-99% improvement in seizure frequency. Terminal seizure freedom was correlated with having no seizures at the time of the previous report (p = 0.03), a lower number of previous antiepileptic drugs taken (p = 0.052) and a lower number of concomitant antiepileptic drugs (p = 0.03). In those who entered remission the probability of remaining seizure-free 5 years later was 0.48 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.63).

Discussion

This suggests that about half of people with apparent drug-resistant epilepsy can have significant improvements in seizure control with further drug changes. Some will subsequently relapse, but long periods of seizure freedom or significantly improved seizure control in the absence of complete seizure control can occur. Such valuable improvements suggest that the recently proposed International League against Epilepsy definition of refractory epilepsy may be too restrictive.

### Effectiveness analysis of three-drug combination therapies for refractory focal epilepsy [^114oBXtG]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

For rational selection of ASMs in polytherapy, physicians need to consider not only factors such as patient age, sex, seizure type, comorbidities, tolerability, and social factors that must be accounted for in monotherapy but also pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions. This poses an immense challenge in selecting suitable ASMs for combination therapy, especially for triple or higher therapies. To address these challenges, researchers are dedicated to developing novel medications with different mechanisms of action and minimal drug–drug interactions. In recent years, pharmacotherapy for epilepsy has developed rapidly, and several new third-generation ASMs have been released into the market. However, the efficacy of three-drug combination therapies has not been updated through research. Very few studies have demonstrated that specific triple regimens, such as VPA/LTG/LEV, CBZ/LTG/LEV and clobazam/LEV/LTG, are effective at achieving SF in certain patients. Nevertheless, these studies were either cross-sectional or involved a limited number of patients receiving triple therapies. Moreover, none of them were specifically designed to investigate the efficacy of three-drug combinations. Therefore, we conducted this study to update and fill the gap in real-world pharmacotherapy research on the efficacy of triple therapies for epilepsy.

The present study aimed to (1) identify the clinical characteristics of patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who were treated with three-drug regimens; (2) explore the optimal three-drug regimens; (3) investigate potential factors related to the therapeutic efficacy of the optimal regimens; and (4) analyze the overall drug loads and side effects of various regimens.

### Pharmacological interventions for epilepsy in people with intellectual disabilities [^116ctAwh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of epilepsy among people with intellectual disabilities is much higher than in the general population. Seizures in this population are often complex and refractory to treatment and antiepileptic medication may have a profound effect upon behaviour (Kerr 1997). This is an updated version of a Cochrane Review first published in Issue 3, 2007.

Objectives

To assess the data available from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the efficacy of antiepileptic drug (AED) interventions in people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities.

Search Methods

For the latest update of this review, we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (2 September 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO) (2 September 2014), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 3 September 2014) and PsycINFO (EBSCOhost, 1887 to 3 September 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological interventions for people with epilepsy and a learning disability.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed epilepsy/seizure, behavioural and cognitive outcomes, as well as quality of life and adverse effects.

Main Results

We included 14 RCTs (1116 participants) in the present review. Data were heterogenous and a descriptive analysis is presented. In the majority of cases where antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were trialled in this population, we found moderate reductions in seizure frequency in that there was a significantly higher rate of responders (reduction of 50% or more) in the treatment group compared with the placebo group, with some studies reporting a higher incidence of seizure freedom in the treatment group. In general, AEDs that are proven to be effective in the general epilepsy population are also effective for refractory epilepsy in people with intellectual disability. It is not possible to comment on the relative efficacy of medications, making clinical decisions difficult. In trial settings patients continued on treatment in the majority of cases. Placebo groups often experienced fewer adverse events. Where adverse events were experienced they appeared similar to those in the general population. The methods by which adverse events were recorded and reported appeared to be inconsistent, resulting in very large variation between studies. This is problematic as clinically relevant interpretation of these findings is limited. The quality of evidence provided in the present review is low to moderate. Additionally the majority of studies lacked or used non-reliable measures of behavioural exacerbation. However, where measured, little obvious impact on behaviour was seen in terms of behaviour disorder.

Authors' Conclusions

This review broadly supports the use of AEDs to reduce seizure frequency in people with refractory epilepsy and intellectual disability. The evidence suggests that adverse events are similar to those in the general population and that behavioural adverse events leading to discontinuation are rare; however, other adverse effects are under-researched.

Epilepsy Currents (2017). Medium credibility.

Additional conclusions — very low or conflicting evidence on factors and SUDEP risk: The evidence is very low or conflicting that the following factors are associated with altering SUDEP risk: overall seizure frequency when evaluated by using all seizure types; medically refractory epilepsy vs not having well-controlled seizures defined as no seizures for the past year; monotherapy vs polytherapy; carbamazepine, phenytoin, or sodium valproate levels that are above, below, or within the reference range; psychotropic drug use; mental health disorders, lung disorders, or alcohol use; lamotrigine use in people with highly refractory epilepsy; frequent changes in AEDs; therapeutic drug monitoring; undergoing a resective epilepsy surgical procedure (although current research does not rule out the possibility of a beneficial effect, or further, the potential effect of epilepsy surgery on reducing GTCS frequency and epilepsy severity on reducing SUDEP risk); and Engel outcome of epilepsy surgery.

### Guidelines for specialized epilepsy centers: executive summary of the report of the national association of epilepsy centers guideline panel [^113w9mKZ]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Background

Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurologic conditions worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 3.4 million persons in the United States. Epilepsy is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, decreased quality of life, and far-reaching socioeconomic implications. These risks are further elevated for approximately 30% of patients with epilepsy who have refractory seizures despite treatment with antiseizure medications (ASMs), categorized as drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). As such, national and international professional organizations advocate for comprehensive epilepsy centers to provide both routine and highly specialized care for people with epilepsy (PWE).

Comprehensive epilepsy care requires infrastructure encompassing inpatient and outpatient settings, as well as organization of a multidisciplinary care team spanning both environments. Patient-centered care begins with accurate diagnosis and pharmacologic treatment of seizures, epilepsy-related education, screening and/or management of comorbid conditions, and provision of psychosocial resources for patients and caregivers.

The National Association of Epilepsy Centers (NAEC) is a nonprofit association in the United States with a current membership of more than 260 epilepsy centers. NAEC published its first guidelines in 1990 to provide a basic framework for services, personnel, and facilities for in-patient care. Each decade since then, updated guidelines have expanded content to include epilepsy surgery considerations, interdisciplinary care approaches, and safety and quality measures. The 2023 Guidelines, solely funded by NAEC, present a further evolution in this process as the first guidelines founded in an evidence-informed, consensus-based process, drawing on a broad cross-section of stakeholders including patients and caregivers. These guidelines also reflect a broader scope than previous iterations, including outpatient care, care coordination, and emphasis on the patient perspective. The full Guidelines for Specialized Epilepsy Centers: Report of the National Association of Epilepsy Centers Guideline Panel with discussion of supporting evidence can be found in eAppendix 1.

### Effectiveness analysis of three-drug combination therapies for refractory focal epilepsy [^116DL1a3]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although the overall treatment outcomes of epilepsy have not improved with the emergence of new antiseizure medications (ASMs), some patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) can still achieve seizure freedom (SF) through continuous adjustment of drug regimens. Patients with epilepsy (PWEs) who fail to respond to monotherapy often receive combination therapy comprising two or more ASMs. Stephen et al. evaluated 1617 and 2379 PWEs who were seizure free for at least one year in 2000 and 2010 and found that 20.5% and 20.4% of them received polytherapy (two, three, or even four ASMs), respectively. However, the evidence for guiding drug selection in polytherapy is insufficient, making the process of choosing suitable ASMs for combination therapy a complex task that requires an empirical approach. The dual-combination regimens of valproic acid (VPA) with lamotrigine (LTG) and levetiracetam (LEV) with carbamazepine (CBZ), among others, have been proven to have promising synergistic effects. Among the adult outpatients at the Kork Epilepsy Centre, nearly 20% of PWEs achieved SF under dual therapies. Nevertheless, a proportion of patients with ultrarefractory epilepsy, who often experience greater disease severity and worse quality of life, still have the opportunity to benefit from three-drug combination therapies when they do not obtain satisfactory outcomes with dual therapies. Some experts believe that patients with "severe" DRE are more likely to achieve SF through three-drug schedules and that add-on therapy is preferred. Indeed, approximately 20% of PWEs using three or more ASMs simultaneously achieve better seizure control. In cases of focal DRE, this proportion reaches 30%. However, unlike for dual-ASM treatment, even fewer formal recommendations exist for guiding drug selection via triple combinations.

### Practice guideline update summary: efficacy and tolerability of the new antiepileptic drugs II: treatment-resistant epilepsy: report of the American Epilepsy Society and the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^117LoFZa]. Epilepsy Currents (2018). Medium credibility.

Treatment-resistant generalized epilepsy (GE) adjunctive therapy — lamotrigine (LTG) and levetiracetam (LEV): Both LTG-XR and immediate-release LTG are probably effective as add-on therapy for TR GTC seizures (1 Class I study for LTG-XR; 2 Class II studies for immediate-release LTG). For LEV, two Class I studies compared 3,000 mg/d of LEV and placebo in TR GE, including one with patients aged 4–65 years, and in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) or juvenile absence epilepsy, significantly more patients on LEV had a > 50% reduction in the number of days per week with myoclonic seizures, became free of myoclonic seizures, and became free of all seizure types. Recommendations specify that for add-on therapy for GE, immediate-release and LTG-XR should be considered as add-on therapy to decrease seizure frequency in treating adults with TR GTC seizures secondary to GE (Level B), and levetiracetam should be considered to decrease seizure frequency as add-on therapy for TR GTC seizures and for JME (Level B); a clinical context note states that only high LEV doses were used.

Epilepsy Currents (2018). Medium credibility.

American Epilepsy Society and American Academy of Neurology guideline update — treatment-resistant epilepsy (TR epilepsy) links recommendations to evidence strength and identifies antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) with efficacy signals. Established as effective to reduce seizure frequency (Level A) are immediate-release pregabalin and perampanel for TR adult focal epilepsy (TRAFE), vigabatrin for TRAFE (not first-line treatment), and rufinamide for Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS) (add-on therapy). Therapies that should be considered to decrease seizure frequency (Level B) include lacosamide, eslicarbazepine, and extended-release topiramate for TRAFE (ezogabine production discontinued); immediate- and extended-release lamotrigine for generalized epilepsy with TR generalized tonic–clonic (GTC) seizures in adults; levetiracetam (add-on therapy) for TR childhood focal epilepsy (TRCFE) (1 month to 16 years), TR GTC seizures, and TR juvenile myoclonic epilepsy; clobazam for LGS (add-on therapy); zonisamide for TRCFE (6–17 years); and oxcarbazepine for TRCFE (1 month to 4 years). Methods used 2004 criteria to review literature from January 2003 to November 2015, and Forty-two articles were included. The guideline notes an FDA strategy allowing extrapolation of efficacy such that, for focal epilepsy, eslicarbazepine and lacosamide (oral only for pediatric use) as add-on or monotherapy in persons ≥ 4 years of age and perampanel as monotherapy received FDA approval.

### Treatment of refractory status epilepticus with continuous intravenous anesthetic drugs… [^115EFe5R]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question How is the choice of initial continuous intravenous anesthetic drug associated with treatment failure, adverse events, and mortality. Findings In this systematic review including 66 studies, significant differences among CIVAD groups were observed in short-term failure, hypotension, and change in CIVAD during treatment. Choice of initial CIVAD was not associated with mortality, and a trend toward decreasing mortality over time was observed. Meaning Choice of initial CIVAD was associated with treatment failure and adverse events but not mortality; advances in neurocritical care may have decreased mortality of refractory status epilepticus over time. Importance Multiple continuous intravenous anesthetic drugs are available for the treatment of refractory status epilepticus. There is a paucity of data comparing the different types of CIVADs used for RSE.

Objective To systematically review and compare outcome measures associated with the initial CIVAD choice in RSE in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Evidence Review. Findings A total of 66 studies with 1637 patients were included. Significant differences among CIVAD groups in short-term failure, hypotension, and CIVAD substitution during treatment were observed. Non–epilepsy-related RSE was associated with a higher rate of CIVAD substitution and mortality. Conclusions and Relevance Epilepsy-related RSE was associated with lower mortality compared with other RSE etiologies. A trend of decreasing mortality over time was observed, which may suggest an effect of advances in neurocritical care.

The overall data are heterogeneous, which limits definitive conclusions on the choice of optimal initial CIVAD in RSE treatment. © 2025 JAMA+ AI Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Treatment of refractory status epilepticus with inhalational anesthetic agents isoflurane and desflurane… [^113Lq6ws]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Refractory status epilepticus is usually defined as seizure activity that continues after first- and second-line therapy has failed. 1 Definitions differ primarily in the number of antiepileptic drugs that have been used or the duration of seizures. We defined RSE as clinical and/or electrographic seizures refractory to loading or protracted maintenance doses of at least 3 AEDs. All patients had either continuous EEG monitoring before and during IA or a minimum of 2 EEGs per day for a minimum of 2 h/d. The following EEG features were documented: background activity, interictal epileptic activities, clinical and electrographic seizures, and periods of burst suppression. This allowed adjustment of the patient's parenteral anticonvulsant therapy as guided by drug levels or titration paradigms.

For example, standard AEDs initiated before the anesthetic agent were maintained in therapeutic doses, and additional agents were administered as indicated clinically. The minimum dose of anesthetic agent to achieve suppression of EEG seizures was determined daily, and the anesthetic agent was gradually discontinued once it was determined that the patient's current parenteral anticonvulsant regimen was achieving adequate suppression of seizures. Prior to IA use, RSE continued for a mean of 19 days. Patients received a mean of 10 AEDs in addition to the IA. One patient received desflurane anesthesia 21 days after RSE for a total of 19 days. All patients required volume resuscitation and vasopressors/inotropes before, during, and after IA; however, the doses required were higher during isoflurane or desflurane administration. Atelectasis was also pres ent in all patients before, during, and after IA.

All patients developed an infection while in the intensive care unit; however, infections occurred in 5 of 7 patients during IA therapy. Most intravenous agents used to treat RSE are expected to produce a degree of hypotension; therefore, hemodynamic consequences must be considered in choosing any AED. There is no evidence of toxic effects on the central nervous system with isoflurane, and experimental studies have generally shown a favorable effect of isoflurane on cerebral metabolism. 36–38.

### Treatment of patients with refractory seizures… [^115U7cDQ]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Control of epilepsy is achieved with a single agent in most patients. However, seizures are refractory in approximately 20 percent of patients with generalized epilepsy and 35 percent of those with partial epilepsy. In a review article, Devinsky discusses therapeutic considerations for patients who have refractory seizures. The author suggests that magnetic resonance imaging be performed to exclude a structural lesion when the severity or frequency of seizures continues to increase despite stable, therapeutic plasma levels of the antiepileptic drug. MRI can also identify surgically treatable causes of seizures, including cavernous angiomas and low-grade gliomas. The choice of antiepileptic drug is based on the type of seizure and, if possible, the epileptic syndrome. A single agent should initially be used, with systematic increases in the dosage and plasma level until the seizures are controlled or the side effects become intolerable.

Before a drug is stopped because of a perceived lack of efficacy, the dosing schedule and any other seizure-provoking events should be assessed. According to the author, the adequacy of the trial is defined not by time but by frequency of the seizures: the more frequent the seizures, the less time is required for determining drug efficacy in a particular patient. Four new antiepileptic medications for adjunctive treatment of partial epilepsy have been introduced since 1993. These include gabapentin, lamotrigine, topiramate and tiagabine; the efficacy of these drugs is uncertain. Another new agent, felbamate, was found to cause aplastic anemia and hepatic failure in one in 2, 500 users. These adverse effects have limited its use. The author states that referral to a neurologist should be considered for patients whose seizures are not controlled within three months. If control is not achieved by one year, referral to a specialized epilepsy center is indicated.

Surgery is an underused option in patients with refractory epilepsy. It is effective in controlling seizures in two thirds of carefully selected patients and reduces the frequency and severity of seizures in many additional patients. The vagus nerve stimulator, a new therapy, is an implantable, programmable, pacemaker-like device that connects two electrodes to the left vagus nerve. In a randomized controlled trial, 30 percent of patients had a reduction of more than 50 percent in the frequency of their seizures.

### Association between treatment, refractoriness, and burden in patients with status epilepticus… [^1114aK25]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Among patients with status epilepticus, increased refractoriness appears to be associated with worse outcomes and higher costs. Importance Status epilepticus is associated with poor clinical outcomes and high cost. Increased levels of refractory SE require treatment with additional medications and carry increased morbidity and mortality, but the associations between SE refractoriness, clinical outcomes, and cost remain poorly characterized. Main Outcomes and Measures Outcomes included discharge disposition, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, hospital-acquired conditions, and cost. Results. Patients with SE often require treatment with multiple antiseizure drugs in an intensive care unit setting to terminate seizures, leading to high costs and likely associated morbidity. 9 Studies examining outcomes after first- and second-line treatment with benzodiazepines and intravenous ASDs suggest that seizures continue in.

Three patient cohorts were defined according to the number and type of intravenous medication used for treatment. We labeled these cohorts low, moderate, and highly refractory SE under the assumption that patients with more refractory disease receive more intravenous ASDs and infusions. Midazolam is used as first-line therapy as an injection or third-line therapy as a continuous infusion. We recorded midazolam as a third-line intravenous anesthetic if administered in the ICU on the same day as or following administration of an intravenous ASD. Low refractory SE was defined as treatment with none or 1 intravenous ASD and no third-line intravenous anesthetic. Moderate refractory SE was defined as treatment with more than 1 intravenous ASD and no third-line intravenous anesthetic. Highly refractory SE was defined as treatment with at least 1 intravenous ASD and at least 1 third-line intravenous anesthetic.

The latter cohort is reflective of RSE and SRSE, but we did not have data about seizure recurrence to determine whether patients truly met criteria for RSE or SRSE. By using medication treatment as opposed to detailed clinical information to characterize SE, the cohorts approximated but did not directly correspond to clinically defined early SE, RSE, and SRSE. The highly refractory cohort best resembled patients with RSE and SRSE, who require third-line intravenous anesthetics, and our observed mortality in this cohort was consistent with previous studies of RSE and SRSE, in which mortality rates ranged from 17% to 39%. 12, 30–32 The observed mortality rate remained consistent when we included patients who were discharged to hospice, who represented an additional 6% of this cohort.
