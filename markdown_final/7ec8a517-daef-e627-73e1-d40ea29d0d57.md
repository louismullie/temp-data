## Question

Topical steroid with dose for atopic dermatitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about topical steroid selection and dosing for atopic dermatitis, including potency, frequency, duration, quantity, safety, and maintenance strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity stratification. Then, I should verify potency selection by age, site, and severity. Next, I will examine application frequency and duration, followed by quantity estimation using fingertip units. After that, I need to check safety monitoring and adverse effect mitigation. Finally, I will consider proactive maintenance therapy and special scenarios like occlusion and treatment failure, and I will close with a concise, practical summary anchored to guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity framework, because potency and dosing hinge on disease severity, anatomic site, and patient age. Atopic dermatitis is chronic and relapsing, so treatment is typically staged into induction for flares and maintenance to prevent relapses, with severity commonly categorized as mild, moderate, or severe based on clinical signs, body surface area, and impact on quality of life, which guides potency and strategy selection [^69e52156] [^59809387].

> I need to verify potency selection next. For adults with moderate-to-severe disease, medium-potency topical corticosteroids (US classes 3–5) are generally recommended for induction, whereas low-potency agents (classes 6–7) are preferred for the face, intertriginous areas, and thin skin, and for infants and young children. High-potency agents (classes 1–2) are reserved for short courses on thick skin or refractory plaques, with explicit avoidance of prolonged continuous use on sensitive sites [^a8a99f4d] [^61971a5b] [^3f170fdc] [^454afcb2]. Hold on, I should double-check the comparative effectiveness signal: potent and moderate-potency steroids outperform mild-potency steroids for treatment success in moderate-to-severe eczema, but there is insufficient evidence that very potent steroids outperform potent ones, reinforcing a stepwise approach rather than routine escalation to superpotent agents [^04928447] [^c6ee7271].

> Next, I should review application frequency. Wait, let me verify the once-versus-twice-daily question because many patients are told to apply twice daily by default. High-certainty evidence and contemporary guidelines indicate that once-daily application of mid-to-high potency topical steroids is probably noninferior to twice daily for short-term flare control, with little to no difference in local adverse effects, so once daily is reasonable for many patients, reserving twice daily for more severe or refractory flares or when faster improvement is prioritized [^1c1781c4] [^374e5cb3] [^04928447]. I should confirm that this applies across ages; yes, the comparative trials and guidelines encompass adults and children, supporting once-daily as a standard option in routine practice [^04928447] [^1c1781c4].

> I will now examine duration of therapy. For induction of a flare, typical courses are about 2 to 3 weeks, with reassessment at that point. Super-high-potency agents should not be used continuously beyond about 3 weeks, whereas medium- and high-potency agents can be used for up to about 12 weeks if needed with careful monitoring, and low-potency agents have no strict maximum duration, though continuous use still warrants periodic review [^d7b7fc47] [^94b7dd3d]. Hold on, I should verify that these limits align with safety data; yes, the risk of atrophy and other local effects rises with potency, duration, occlusion, and thin-skin sites, which is why tapering and rotation are advised after control is achieved [^d7b7fc47] [^3f170fdc].

> Let me think about quantity and the fingertip unit method, because underdosing and overdosing are common. One fingertip unit equals about 0.5 g and treats roughly 2% of adult body surface area; practical dispensing can be estimated as 15 g for the entire body surface for one application, with larger tubs (227–454 g) appropriate when treating extensive disease or for maintenance courses, and smaller tubes for localized disease. Pediatric quantities scale down with body size and surface area [^d7b7fc47] [^454afcb2]. I should double-check that this aligns with real-world use patterns; observational data show substantial monthly TCS use in moderate-to-severe AD, underscoring the need to pair quantity with potency, duration, and safety counseling [^2d8570ab].

> Next, I should review safety monitoring and adverse effect mitigation. Local adverse effects include atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, and periorificial dermatitis, with risk modulated by potency, duration, occlusion, and site. Systemic effects are uncommon with appropriate use but can occur with very potent agents, large surface area, prolonged duration, or impaired barrier, so I need to ensure we avoid continuous high-potency use on sensitive sites and reassess regularly [^d7b7fc47] [^3f170fdc]. But wait, what if the patient reports "steroid addiction" or rebound? I should confirm the diagnostic features of topical steroid withdrawal and counsel on gradual taper and steroid-sparing maintenance to mitigate rebound flares [^e38b9715].

> I will now examine proactive maintenance therapy, because AD is relapsing and maintenance reduces flares. After induction clears active disease, applying a medium-potency topical steroid once or twice weekly to previously involved, frequently flaring areas reduces relapse risk substantially, with moderate-certainty evidence and strong guideline support. Alternatives include topical calcineurin inhibitors 2–3 times weekly, and the choice should be individualized to potency, site, and patient preference [^3a58b3aa] [^61971a5b] [^dc12c02c]. Hold on, I should verify duration; European guidance supports continuing proactive therapy for at least 20 weeks, and many trials span 16–20 weeks, which aligns with clinical practice patterns [^9a32f695] [^04928447].

> Let me consider special scenarios. For localized, recalcitrant lesions unresponsive to mid-to-high potency topicals, a time- and area-limited trial of occluded low-to-mid potency steroid for 4–7 days can be considered, with explicit instructions to avoid prolonged occlusion and to monitor closely for atrophy or infection. This is a conditional suggestion due to low-certainty evidence, so shared decision-making is essential [^93e9b5cb] [^af100511]. I should also confirm that vehicle selection matters; ointments enhance potency and occlusion, whereas creams are more cosmetically acceptable, and solutions or foams are useful for scalp involvement, which can influence both efficacy and adherence [^bbdce8af] [^d7b7fc47].

> I need to ensure I address treatment failure and escalation. If there is inadequate response after 2–3 weeks of appropriately potent, correctly applied therapy, I should verify adherence, technique, and the presence of secondary infection or undertreated inflammation, then consider increasing potency briefly, switching class, or adding nonsteroidal topicals such as calcineurin inhibitors or crisaborole, reserving systemic therapies for refractory moderate-to-severe disease and avoiding systemic corticosteroids except as short-term bridges in exceptional circumstances [^b74d110f] [^e0eb84c0]. Hold on, I should verify that systemic steroids are discouraged; yes, multiple high-credibility guidelines advise against routine systemic corticosteroids for AD due to rebound and adverse effects, limiting their role to rare, short-term bridges when no alternatives exist [^e0eb84c0] [^8cff525e].

> Let me reconsider the practical, stepwise approach to synthesize this. For a typical adult with a moderate flare, I would prescribe a medium-potency steroid once daily to affected areas for about 2–3 weeks, using fingertip units to guide quantity, then transition to proactive maintenance with the same medium-potency agent applied once or twice weekly to previously involved sites, while avoiding continuous use on the face or folds and reassessing periodically. For a child with a moderate flare, I would favor a low-to-medium potency agent for a shorter duration with close follow-up, and for sensitive sites I would use low-potency or nonsteroidal options, escalating only if needed and with explicit safety counseling [^a8a99f4d] [^61971a5b] [^d7b7fc47] [^454afcb2]. I should double-check that this aligns with both safety and effectiveness data; yes, this approach balances the evidence that once-daily dosing is effective, that potency should match severity and site, and that proactive maintenance reduces relapses with acceptable safety when monitored appropriately [^04928447] [^3a58b3aa] [^b74d110f].

Topical corticosteroids are the **first-line therapy** for atopic dermatitis flares, with potency and dose tailored to age, severity, and treatment area [^a8a99f4d] [^b74d110f]. For adults, use **medium-potency agents (classes 3–5)** [^61971a5b] once daily for 2–3 weeks, then taper to the lowest effective dose; for children, use **low-potency agents (classes 6–7)** [^454afcb2] for 7–14 days. On sensitive areas (face, intertriginous sites), use low-potency agents and limit duration to ≤ 7 days. Apply a thin layer using the fingertip unit method (1 FTU = 0.5 g = 2% BSA) [^d7b7fc47], and use proactive therapy (e.g. twice weekly) to prevent relapses [^3a58b3aa] [^dc12c02c]. Monitor for skin atrophy, striae, and systemic effects with prolonged use or high potency [^d7b7fc47] [^3f170fdc].

## Potency classification

Topical corticosteroids are classified by potency into **seven classes** [^15259cb7], with class I being the most potent and class VII the least potent [^59809387]:

| **Class** | **Potency** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| I | Very high | - Clobetasol propionate 0.05% [^15259cb7] |
| II | High | - Fluocinonide 0.05% [^notfound] |
| III-V | Medium | - Mometasone furoate 0.1% [^15259cb7] <br/> - Fluticasone propionate 0.005% [^15259cb7] |
| VI | Low | - Desonide 0.05% [^15259cb7] |
| VII | Lowest | - Hydrocortisone 1% [^15259cb7] |

---

## General dosing principles

- **Frequency**: Once or twice daily [^d7b7fc47]; once daily is often sufficient and may improve adherence [^1c1781c4].
- **Duration**: Short courses (7–14 days) are typical; limit high-potency agents to ≤ 3 weeks and avoid prolonged continuous use [^d7b7fc47] [^94b7dd3d].
- **Quantity**: Use the fingertip unit (FTU) method [^d7b7fc47]; 1 FTU = 0.5 g and treats ~2% of adult BSA [^d7b7fc47].

---

## Dosing by age and severity

| **Age group** | **Severity** | **Recommended potency** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Infants | Mild | Class VII (hydrocortisone 1%) | 7–10 days |
| Children | Mild-to-moderate | Class VI (desonide 0.05%) | 7–14 days |
| Adolescents | Moderate | Class III-V (mometasone 0.1%) | 2–3 weeks |
| Adults | Moderate-to-severe | Class III-V (mometasone 0.1%) | 2–3 weeks |

---

## Special considerations

- **Sensitive areas**: Use low-potency agents (class VI-VII) and limit duration to ≤ 7 days [^d7b7fc47] [^3f170fdc].
- **Proactive therapy**: Apply mid-potency agents twice weekly to previously involved areas to prevent relapses [^3a58b3aa] [^dc12c02c].
- **Occlusion**: Increases potency and absorption; use cautiously and limit duration [^d7b7fc47].

---

## Safety monitoring

- **Local effects**: Watch for atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, and secondary infections [^d7b7fc47].
- **Systemic effects**: Rare with proper use; risk rises with high potency, prolonged use, or large areas [^d7b7fc47].
- **Growth**: Monitor children on prolonged or high-potency therapy [^c6ee7271].

---

## Patient education

Emphasize **adherence**, proper application technique, and the importance of emollients [^d7b7fc47]. Address steroid phobia by explaining risks are low with appropriate use and monitoring [^f2807b9f]. Provide written instructions on potency, duration, and tapering to support safe, effective use [^notfound].

---

Topical corticosteroids are effective and safe when used appropriately: select potency based on age and severity, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, and employ proactive therapy to maintain control [^a8a99f4d] [^3a58b3aa].

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^04928447]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Eczema is a common skin condition. Although topical corticosteroids have been a first-line treatment for eczema for decades, there are uncertainties over their optimal use.

Objectives

To establish the effectiveness and safety of different ways of using topical corticosteroids for treating eczema.

Search Methods

We searched databases to January 2021 (Cochrane Skin Specialised Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; GREAT) and five clinical trials registers. We checked bibliographies from included trials to identify further trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in adults and children with eczema that compared at least two strategies of topical corticosteroid use. We excluded placebo comparisons, other than for trials that evaluated proactive versus reactive treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods, with GRADE certainty of evidence for key findings. Primary outcomes were changes in clinician-reported signs and relevant local adverse events. Secondary outcomes were patient-reported symptoms and relevant systemic adverse events. For local adverse events, we prioritised abnormal skin thinning as a key area of concern for healthcare professionals and patients.

Main Results

We included 104 trials (8443 participants). Most trials were conducted in high-income countries (81/104), most likely in outpatient or other hospital settings. We judged only one trial to be low risk of bias across all domains. Fifty-five trials had high risk of bias in at least one domain, mostly due to lack of blinding or missing outcome data. Stronger-potency versus weaker-potency topical corticosteroids Sixty-three trials compared different potencies of topical corticosteroids: 12 moderate versus mild, 22 potent versus mild, 25 potent versus moderate, and 6 very potent versus potent. Trials were usually in children with moderate or severe eczema, where specified, lasting one to five weeks. The most reported outcome was Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of clinician-reported signs of eczema. We pooled four trials that compared moderate- versus mild-potency topical corticosteroids (420 participants). Moderate-potency topical corticosteroids probably result in more participants achieving treatment success, defined as cleared or marked improvement on IGA (52% versus 34%; odds ratio (OR) 2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 3.04; moderate-certainty evidence). We pooled nine trials that compared potent versus mild-potency topical corticosteroids (392 participants). Potent topical corticosteroids probably result in a large increase in number achieving treatment success (70% versus 39%; OR 3.71, 95% CI 2.04 to 6.72; moderate-certainty evidence). We pooled 15 trials that compared potent versus moderate-potency topical corticosteroids (1053 participants). There was insufficient evidence of a benefit of potent topical corticosteroids compared to moderate topical corticosteroids (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.89; moderate-certainty evidence). We pooled three trials that compared very potent versus potent topical corticosteroids (216 participants). The evidence is uncertain with a wide confidence interval (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.09; low-certainty evidence). Twice daily or more versus once daily application We pooled 15 of 25 trials in this comparison (1821 participants, all reported IGA). The trials usually assessed adults and children with moderate or severe eczema, where specified, using potent topical corticosteroids, lasting two to six weeks. Applying potent topical corticosteroids only once a day probably does not decrease the number achieving treatment success compared to twice daily application (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.38; 15 trials, 1821 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Local adverse events Within the trials that tested 'treating eczema flare-up' strategies, we identified only 26 cases of abnormal skin thinning from 2266 participants (1% across 22 trials). Most cases were from the use of higher-potency topical corticosteroids (16 with very potent, 6 with potent, 2 with moderate and 2 with mild). We assessed this evidence as low certainty, except for very potent versus potent topical corticosteroids, which was very low-certainty evidence. Longer versus shorter-term duration of application for induction of remission No trials were identified. Twice weekly application (weekend, or 'proactive therapy') to prevent relapse (flare-ups) versus no topical corticosteroids/reactive application Nine trials assessed this comparison, generally lasting 16 to 20 weeks. We pooled seven trials that compared weekend (proactive) topical corticosteroids therapy versus no topical corticosteroids (1179 participants, children and adults with a range of eczema severities, though mainly moderate or severe). Weekend (proactive) therapy probably results in a large decrease in likelihood of a relapse from 58% to 25% (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.57; 7 trials, 1149 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Local adverse events We did not identify any cases of abnormal skin thinning in seven trials that assessed skin thinning (1050 participants) at the end of treatment. We assessed this evidence as low certainty. Other comparisons Other comparisons included newer versus older preparations of topical corticosteroids (15 trials), cream versus ointment (7 trials), topical corticosteroids with wet wrap versus no wet wrap (6 trials), number of days per week applied (4 trials), different concentrations of the same topical corticosteroids (2 trials), time of day applied (2 trials), topical corticosteroids alternating with topical calcineurin inhibitors versus topical corticosteroids alone (1 trial), application to wet versus dry skin (1 trial) and application before versus after emollient (1 trial). No trials compared branded versus generic topical corticosteroids and time between application of emollient and topical corticosteroids.

Authors' Conclusions

Potent and moderate topical corticosteroids are probably more effective than mild topical corticosteroids, primarily in moderate or severe eczema; however, there is uncertain evidence to support any advantage of very potent over potent topical corticosteroids. Effectiveness is similar between once daily and twice daily (or more) frequent use of potent topical corticosteroids to treat eczema flare-ups, and topical corticosteroids weekend (proactive) therapy is probably better than no topical corticosteroids/reactive use to prevent eczema relapse (flare-ups). Adverse events were not well reported and came largely from low- or very low-certainty, short-term trials. In trials that reported abnormal skin thinning, frequency was low overall and increased with increasing potency. We found no trials on the optimum duration of treatment of a flare, branded versus generic topical corticosteroids, and time to leave between application of topical corticosteroids and emollient. There is a need for longer-term trials, in people with mild eczema.

### Expert perspectives on management of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: a multidisciplinary consensus addressing current and emerging therapies [^8bd1e97a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disease that affects children and adults. Until recently, the only Food and Drug Administration-approved systemic treatment option for patients with moderate-to-severe AD was systemic steroids, which are not recommended by current guidelines and are commonly associated with disease rebound. Instead, clinicians choose from several off-label immunosuppressants, which can have serious adverse effects. A significant number of these patients go untreated. Research on the immunopathogenesis of AD has paved the way for new, targeted, systemic therapies for moderate-to-severe AD. In early 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved dupilumab for adults with moderate-to-severe AD whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical therapies. Although the national guidelines can be very helpful to clinicians, the process for updating them does not allow for timely incorporation of novel therapies. A steering committee of AD experts, including dermatologists, allergists, and a patient advocacy group representative, developed recommendations on the basis of a literature review and expert opinion to help clinicians understand how new therapies fit into the current treatment paradigm and to provide practical recommendations for assessing AD severity, treatment response, and treatment failure.

### Topical therapy for atopic dermatitis: what is new and the new paradigm [^a8c83ad3]. Dermatologic Clinics (2024). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that requires a complex management strategy, which often involves multiple and diverse topicals and systemic treatment regimens. While topical steroids and more recently calcineurin inhibitors have been the mainstay therapy for mild-to-moderate disease, recent advances in the understanding of AD pathogenesis have led to the development of different new targets, rapidly widening our therapeutic armamentarium. This review summarizes their efficacy and safety data. We also review topical optimization strategies, including the recently published topical volume calculator, to maximize long-term disease control, especially when using multiple agents at the same time.

### Topical steroids for atopic dermatitis in primary care [^b54cfe62]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is very common. In most instances, the condition is relatively mild and can be managed in primary care. Topical corticosteroids are the standard therapy for controlling acute 'flares' of dermatitis. However, poor communication between doctors and patients often results in suboptimal use of such therapy. Here, we review the efficacy and safety of topical corticosteroids for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. We discuss their optimal use in primary care, and the advice and information that patients or parents of children need when using such treatment.

### Executive summary: American Academy of Dermatology guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^ad4086ed]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

These guidelines update the 2014 recommendations for management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies. A multidisciplinary workgroup employed best practices for guideline development, including a systematic review of the evidence and application of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for assessing the certainty of the evidence and formulating and grading recommendations. The evidence on atopic dermatitis treatment supported strong recommendations for the use of nonprescription moisturizers, topical calcineurin inhibitors, topical corticosteroids, and topical PDE-4 and JAK inhibitors. Conditional recommendations are made for the use of bathing and wet wrap therapy and against the use of topical antimicrobials, antiseptics, and antihistamines.

### Practical algorithm to inform clinical decision-making in the topical treatment of atopic dermatitis [^64bcd8bb]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic relapsing, inflammatory skin disorder associated with skin barrier dysfunction, the prevalence of which has increased dramatically in developing countries. In this article, we propose a treatment algorithm for patients with mild-to-moderate and severe atopic dermatitis flares in daily clinical practice. An international panel of 15 dermatology and allergy experts from eight countries was formed to develop a practical algorithm for the treatment of patients with atopic dermatitis, with a particular focus on topical therapies. In cases of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis involving sensitive skin areas, the topical calcineurin inhibitor pimecrolimus should be applied twice daily at the first signs of atopic dermatitis. For other body locations, patients should apply a topical calcineurin inhibitor, either pimecrolimus or tacrolimus, twice daily at the first signs of atopic dermatitis, such as pruritus, or twice weekly in previously affected skin areas. Emollients should be used regularly. Patients experiencing acute atopic dermatitis flares in sensitive skin areas should apply a topical corticosteroid twice daily or alternate once-daily topical corticosteroid/topical calcineurin inhibitor until symptoms improve. Following improvement, topical corticosteroid therapy should be discontinued and patients switched to a topical calcineurin inhibitor. Maintenance therapy should include the use of pimecrolimus once daily for sensitive areas and tacrolimus for other body locations.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for atopic dermatitis [^338cd8c8]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Clinical Question

Which topical anti-inflammatory treatments are most effective and safe for managing atopic dermatitis?

Bottom Line

In a network meta-analyses, very potent/potent topical corticosteroids; tacrolimus, 0.1%; and topical Janus kinase inhibitors were among the most effective treatments for short-term control of atopic dermatitis symptoms, while phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors were among the least effective. Topical calcineurin inhibitors and crisaborole were associated with application-site irritation, and short-term topical steroid use was not associated with skin thinning. However, these findings were of low to moderate certainty, and longer-term data remain limited for many agents.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

The recommendations for the use of topical corticosteroids related to the main comparisons reported within this review, (results reported in the summary of findings tables), were extracted from four international guidelines for the management of atopic dermatitis (from the UK, USA, Europe and Japan). The recommendations are reported in Table 16 with a summary of the results of the review.

Comparison of recommendations for topical corticosteroid use from international guidelines

All but one of the guidelines consulted recommended a specific potency or potencies for different severities of atopic dermatitis, however the potency or potencies that were recommended for a particular severity varied between guidelines. This is likely to be related to the different severity and potency classifications used in different countries. Most guidelines suggested topical corticosteroids could be applied once or twice daily, but three out of the four guidelines mentioned twice daily use first and then said once daily use "can" be used. All of the guidelines recommended weekend (proactive) use of topical corticosteroid, however the level of support for this approach varied between the regions. This may have been related to the age of the different guidelines. Most of the guidelines, (3 out of 4), suggested patients should be monitored for cutaneous effects. With regards to systemic effects, most guidelines did not specifically mention the need for monitoring, but usually included either restrictions on the use of certain potencies in some circumstances, or warnings about the need to consider the potential for adverse effects when using certain potencies.

We used the Centre of Evidence Based Dermatology map and an overview of systematic reviews (Axon 2021), to identify key literature. Below, the results of this review are compared to UK guidelines and relevant systematic reviews:

### Clinical dose and adverse effects of topical steroids in daily management of atopic dermatitis [^d9e8191f]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Topical steroids are used as the first-line therapy for atopic dermatitis.

Objectives

To determine the clinical doses of topical steroids for the daily treatment of atopic dermatitis in clinics and to elucidate their adverse effects.

Patients and Methods

A multicentre retrospective analysis of a series of 1271 patients (210 infants, 546 children, and 515 adolescents and adults) with atopic dermatitis.

Results

Less than 89.5 g, 135 g and 304 g of topical steroid were applied in 90% of the patients in the infant, childhood, and adolescent and adult AD groups, respectively, on the entire body during the 6-month treatment period. The majority of patients were controlled well; however, 7% of infant, 10% of childhood and 19% of adolescent and adult patients remained in a very severe or severe state or experienced exacerbation even though they applied larger amounts of topical steroids. With regard to adverse effects, the incidence of telangiectasia on cheeks tended to increase in patients who had a longer duration of disease and who applied more than 20 g to the face during the 6-month treatment period. The steroid-induced atrophy of the antecubital and popliteal fossae was more frequently observed in males than in females.

Conclusions

Topical steroids are useful for treating atopic dermatitis, but a substantial percentage of patients cannot be satisfactorily treated with topical steroids. For such patients, adjustments of dose and rank of topical steroids and other therapeutic adjuncts are necessary.

How often to apply topical corticosteroid?

See: Table 5; Table 6; and Table 7.

Applying topical corticosteroid twice daily probably does not increase the proportion of participants (adults and children) who achieve clinician‐reported treatment success for treating a flare (1 to 4 weeks) compared to once daily application (moderate‐certainty evidence). This still applied when restricting to trials where the same topical corticosteroid was used in both arms; however, most of those trials were in participants with moderate to severe eczema, using a potent or very potent topical corticosteroid. It also applied in the trials that spanned more than one strategy, comparing higher‐potency, often newer, second‐generation topical corticosteroid applied once a day with lower‐potency topical corticosteroid applied more frequently.

The evidence suggests that frequency of application results in little to no difference between strategies in the risk of developing skin thinning (low‐certainty evidence). The number of reported cases was low, and more than three‐quarters of cases were seen in participants using very potent topical corticosteroid. The evidence addressing whether using topical corticosteroids more than once daily affects cortisol levels is very uncertain and there were no data on clinically relevant effects.

No trials looked at longer‐ versus shorter‐term duration of treatment for induction of remission from a flare.

Weekend, or 'proactive' therapy, in which topical corticosteroids are applied twice a week for two consecutive days in between flares, aims to prevent rather than treat eczema flares. Weekend therapy likely results in a large decrease in the likelihood of experiencing a new flare compared to no topical corticosteroid application, with moderate‐certainty evidence. This effect was seen in children and adults and across all eczema severities, although most evidence was in moderate to severe eczema. With regard to safety, no cases of skin thinning, or new cases of abnormal cortisol levels were reported (low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence), but there were no data on clinically relevant adrenal suppression or impact on growth. The trials of weekend therapy were significantly longer in duration (16 weeks to 12 months) than trials identified for other strategies, primarily because of the need to detect the number of new flares rather than treating the existing flare. Whilst these trials may be better designed to detect adverse events that take longer to manifest, such as skin thinning, it should be noted that the data are not necessarily comparable with the other strategy comparisons as the topical corticosteroid use was intermittent (two days per week) rather than daily as is normal for treating a flare.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Topical corticosteroids (TCS) — topical corticosteroids (also called topical steroids) are the mainstay of therapy for AD, and in patients with uncontrolled AD refractory to moisturization alone, the JTF panel recommends addition of a TCS with high-certainty evidence. In randomized clinical trials mostly for 2 to 6 weeks, TCS probably did not importantly increase adverse effects. Avoid high-potency (classes 1 and 2) TCS for prolonged continuous periods of time (> 4 weeks) and limit use on sensitive areas (face, folds, groin); continuous and prolonged use of lower potency TCS on sensitive areas can also cause these effects. After addressing active disease, TCSs are strongly recommended for continued intermittent therapy to prevent future flares.

This is the English version of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Atopic Dermatitis 2021. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a disease characterized by relapsing eczema with pruritus as a primary lesion. In Japan, from the perspective of evidence-based medicine, the current strategies for the treatment of AD consist of three primary measures: (i) use of topical corticosteroids, tacrolimus ointment, and delgocitinib ointment as the main treatment of the inflammation; (ii) topical application of emollients to treat the cutaneous barrier dysfunction; and (iii) avoidance of apparent exacerbating factors, psychological counseling, and advice about daily life. In the present revised guidelines, descriptions of three new drugs, namely, dupilumab, delgocitinib, and baricitinib, have been added. The guidelines present recommendations to review clinical research articles, evaluate the balance between the advantages and disadvantages of medical activities, and optimize medical activity-related patient outcomes with respect to several important points requiring decision-making in clinical practice.

### Developing drugs for treatment of atopic dermatitis in children (≥ 3 months to… [^f9e8f6f9]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is the most common chronic skin disease, and it primarily affects children. Although atopic dermatitis (AD) has the highest effect on burden of skin disease, no high-level studies have defined optimal therapy for severe disease. Corticosteroids have been used to treat AD since the 1950s and remain the only systemic medication with Food and Drug Administration approval for this indication in children, despite published guidelines of care that recommend against this option. Several clinical trials with level 1 evidence have supported the use of topical treatments for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in adults and children, but these trials have had little consistency in protocol design. Consensus recommendations will help standardize clinical development and trial design for children. The Food and Drug Administration issues guidance documents for industry as a source for "the Agency's current thinking on a particular subject". Although they are nonbinding, industry considers these documents to be the standard for clinical development and trial design. Our consensus group is the first to specifically address clinical trial design in this population. We developed a draft guidance document for industry, Developing Drugs for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis in Children (≥ 3 months to < 18 years of age). This draft guidance has been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration based on a provision in the Federal Register (Good Guidance Practices).

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: international eczema council consensus statement [^513ae84c]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Summary

Background

Guidelines discourage the use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis, but their use remains widespread.

Objectives

To reach consensus among an international group ofexperts on the use of systemic corticosteroids for.

Methods

A survey consisting of statements accompanied by visual analogue scales ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'neutral' to 'strongly agree' was distributed to the International Eczema Council. Consensus was reached in agreement on a statement if < 30% of respondents marked to the left of 'neutral' towards 'strongly disagree'.

Results

Sixty of 77 (78%)members participated. Consensus was reached on 12 statements, including that systemic corticosteroids should generally be avoided but can be used rarely for severeunder certain circumstances, including a lack of other treatment options, as a bridge to other systemic therapies or phototherapy, during acute flares in need of immediate relief, in anticipation of a major life event or in the most severe cases. If used, treatment should be limited to the short term. Most respondents agreed that systemic corticosteroids should never be used in children, but consensus was not reached on that statement. The conclusions of our expert group are limited by a dearth of high‐quality published evidence. If more stringent consensus criteria were applied (e.g. requiring < 20% of respondents marking towards 'strongly disagree'), consensus would have been reached on fewer statements.

Conclusions

Based on expert opinion from the, routine use of systemic corticosteroids foris generally discouraged and should be reserved for special circumstances.

### Efficacy and safety of topical brepocitinib for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis: a phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, dose-ranging and parallel-group study [^3b971bb4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory, pruritic skin disease that affects up to 10% of adults and 20% of children in developed countries. AD negatively impacts the health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients and their caregivers/families, with greater disease severity being associated with poorer HRQoL. Due to the complex pathophysiology of AD, guidelines recommend regimented hygiene, the use of moisturizers, topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors, which can be used in combination with other treatments such as phototherapy for moderate‐to‐severe or refractory AD. The ultimate goals for treatment are to repair and maintain the skin barrier, to reduce sensations of itching and burning, and to prevent AD relapse. Despite current treatments, there is still an unmet need for safe and effective therapies to improve disease management and long‐term patient outcomes.

Once-daily versus twice-daily application of topical corticosteroids (TCS) or topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) — in patients with uncontrolled atopic dermatitis using mid-to-high-potency topical treatments, the JTF panel suggests applying the medication once per day over twice per day application (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence); evidence from Nine RCTs comprising 1507 participants showed high-certainty evidence for a small difference between regimens (MD −3.33 [−4.28 to −2.39] on SCORAD scale 0–103; RD to improve by 50% from baseline 5 more per 100 [1–9 more]), which is just above the a priori threshold of 3 per 100 set by the guideline panel, and harms were no different between groups; patient-centered considerations include that patients who value a simpler treatment routine and using less overall medication may prefer once per day application, whereas patients with a more severe flare or who might value resolving it more quickly may prefer twice per day application, and once per day application would use less overall TCS and TCI and could lead to less resource use compared with twice per day application.

### Topical treatments for atopic dermatitis (eczema): systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized trials [^db1b498b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common skin condition with multiple topical treatment options, but uncertain comparative effects.

Objective

We sought to systematically synthesize the benefits and harms of AD prescription topical treatments.

Methods

For the 2023 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology and American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters AD guidelines, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, LILACS, ICTRP, and GREAT databases to September 5, 2022, for randomized trials addressing AD topical treatments. Paired reviewers independently screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Random-effects network meta-analyses addressed AD severity, itch, sleep, AD-related quality of life, flares, and harms. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach informed certainty of evidence ratings. We classified topical corticosteroids (TCS) using 7 groups-group 1 being most potent. This review is registered in the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/q5m6s).

Results

The 219 included trials (43,123 patients) evaluated 68 interventions. With high-certainty evidence, pimecrolimus improved 6 of 7 outcomes-among the best for 2; high-dose tacrolimus (0.1%) improved 5-among the best for 2; low-dose tacrolimus (0.03%) improved 5-among the best for 1. With moderate- to high-certainty evidence, group 5 TCS improved 6-among the best for 3; group 4 TCS and delgocitinib improved 4-among the best for 2; ruxolitinib improved 4-among the best for 1; group 1 TCS improved 3-among the best for 2. These interventions did not increase harm. Crisaborole and difamilast were intermediately effective, but with uncertain harm. Topical antibiotics alone or in combination may be among the least effective. To maintain AD control, group 5 TCS were among the most effective, followed by tacrolimus and pimecrolimus.

Conclusions

For individuals with AD, pimecrolimus, tacrolimus, and moderate-potency TCS are among the most effective in improving and maintaining multiple AD outcomes. Topical antibiotics may be among the least effective.

### Treatment of atopic dermatitis-AAP… [^94b7dd3d]. AAP (2021). Medium credibility.

Treating Inflammation To treat inflammation during a flare of atopic dermatitis, apply a topical corticosteroid twice daily to affected areas until improvement occurs. Ointments are preferred over creams because they tend to be more effective and better tolerated, although some patients prefer creams because they are less greasy. Choosing a topical corticosteroid depends on the age of the child and the area to be treated. Once symptoms have improved, the corticosteroid is withdrawn and a moisturizer continued regularly. Super-high-potency topical corticosteroids should not be used for longer than 3 weeks. High- or mid-potency topical corticosteroids can be used for up to 12 weeks. Low-potency preparations have no maximum use recommendations.

Although topical corticosteroid use should be avoided in the absence of symptoms, applying a corticosteroid once or twice weekly at locations prone to exacerbations has been shown to reduce relapses and increase the time to the next flare. Generally, a topical corticosteroid is prescribed for 2 to 3 weeks. The family should be instructed to contact the physician if no improvement occurs in that time. Treatment failure can be due to
- Too low of a potency for the age of the child and skin site
- Incorrect application of treatment by the family
- Bacterial infection. S aureus), keratoconjunctivitis, and, rarely, viral dissemination with multiple organ involvement, meningitis, or encephalitis.

Pityriasis Alba
- Apply an appropriate topical corticosteroid twice daily for 2 to 3 weeks to treat any existing inflammation.
- Sun protection may be used to reduce the contrast between unaffected skin and affected skin.
- The patient and family should be counseled that several months might be required for typical pigmentation to return.
- Once symptoms have improved, application of a topical calcineurin inhibitor 2 to 3 times weekly at locations prone to exacerbations has been shown to reduce relapses.
- TCIs are used as second-line agents in patients older than 2 years for whom topical corticosteroids fail or when avoidance of more potent topical corticosteroids is desired.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^c6ee7271]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A total of 104 trials and 8443 participants were included in this review. These covered a wide range of clinically plausible strategies for using topical corticosteroids in treating eczema, which fell into three broad categories:

which topical corticosteroid to use;
how often and how long to use topical corticosteroid for; and
how best to apply the topical corticosteroid.

Summary of main results

The main findings, for which we have drawn up summary of findings tables, address 1. which topical corticosteroid to use, and 2. how often and how long to use topical corticosteroid for.

Which topical corticosteroid to use

See: Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4.

Our review focused on four comparisons of topical corticosteroid of one potency with another topical corticosteroid of a different potency (moderate versus mild topical corticosteroid, potent versus mild topical corticosteroid, potent versus moderate topical corticosteroid, and very potent versus potent topical corticosteroid) for treating eczema flare‐ups, which reflects clinical practice decision making based on a stepped approach. In mainly moderate to severe eczema, potent and moderately potent topical corticosteroid probably result in an increased number of participants achieving clinician‐reported treatment success compared to mild‐potency topical corticosteroid (moderate‐certainty evidence), with insufficient data to determine whether this applied to people with mild disease. There was also insufficient evidence of a benefit of potent topical corticosteroid compared to moderate‐potency topical corticosteroid (moderate‐certainty evidence). Again, the trials were mainly in moderate to severe eczema but perhaps more representative of the population that may be offered these higher‐potency topical corticosteroids There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate any advantage of very potent over potent topical corticosteroid, with only three small trials included in the meta‐analysis (low‐certainty evidence). These trials usually included more children than adults. The number of reported cases of skin thinning was very low, with a relatively even spread across groups but tending towards more events with increasing potency of topical corticosteroid. Most trials were of short duration so may not detect longer‐term adverse events (low‐certainty evidence for local adverse events, except for the comparison of very potent versus potent topical corticosteroid which we assessed as very low‐certainty.)

In six trials involving 188 participants, 16 participants had levels of cortisol outside of the normal range (very low‐certainty evidence). There were minimal data on whether the levels returned to normal once the topical corticosteroids were stopped, minimal data on clinically relevant adrenal suppression, and no data regarding impact on growth (see: Completeness of outcomes; safety).

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^e5b08d2d]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

New evidence has emerged since the 2014 guidelines that further informs the management of atopic dermatitis (AD) with topical therapies. These guidelines update the 2014 recommendations for management of AD with topical therapies.

Objective

To provide evidence-based recommendations related to management of AD in adults using topical treatments.

Methods

A multidisciplinary workgroup conducted a systematic review and applied the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) approach for assessing the certainty of evidence and formulating and grading recommendations.

Results

The workgroup developed 12 recommendations on the management of AD in adults with topical therapies, including nonprescription agents and prescription topical corticosteroids (TCS), calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors (PDE-4), antimicrobials, and antihistamines.

Limitations

The pragmatic decision to limit the literature review to English-language randomized trials may have excluded data published in other languages and relevant long-term follow-up data.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations are made for the use of moisturizers, TCIs, TCS, and topical PDE-4 and JAK inhibitors. Conditional recommendations are made for the use of bathing and wet wrap therapy and against the use of topical antimicrobials, antiseptics, and antihistamines.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a disease characterized by relapsing eczema with pruritus as a primary lesion. Most patients have an atopic predisposition. The definitive diagnosis of AD requires the presence of all three features: (i) pruritus; (ii) typical morphology and distribution of the eczema; and (iii) chronic and chronically relapsing course. The current strategies to treat AD in Japan from the perspective of evidence-based medicine consist of three primary measures: (i) the use of topical corticosteroids and tacrolimus ointment as the main treatment for the inflammation; (ii) topical application of emollients to treat the cutaneous barrier dysfunction; and (iii) avoidance of apparent exacerbating factors, psychological counseling and advice about daily life. The guidelines present recommendations to review clinical research articles, evaluate the balance between the advantages and disadvantages of medical activities, and optimize medical activity-related patient outcomes with respect to several important points requiring decision-making in clinical practice.

### Choosing topical corticosteroids [^fe18cb96]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are one of the oldest and most useful treatments for dermatologic conditions. There are many topical steroids available, and they differ in potency and formulation. Successful treatment depends on an accurate diagnosis and consideration of the steroid's delivery vehicle, potency, frequency of application, duration of treatment, and side effects. Although use of topical steroids is common, evidence of effectiveness exists only for select conditions, such as psoriasis, vitiligo, eczema, atopic dermatitis, phimosis, acute radiation dermatitis, and lichen sclerosus. Evidence is limited for use in melasma, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and alopecia areata.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: international eczema council consensus statement [^a0062276]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

We were unable to reach consensus on many issues related to dosing and duration of systemic CS use. However, the clear majority of participants (94%) agreed that the use of systemic CS should be limited to short periods of time. This is in keeping with clinical practice guidelines. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Our group did not reach consensus on a definition of short‐term use. The European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis/European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology task force position statement on the treatment of AD suggests that a typical regimen of systemic CS might be methylprednisolone 0·5 mg kg −1 daily for 1–2 weeks tapered over 1 month, 3 but there is no RCT evidence for the safety or efficacy of this specific regimen.

Most respondents (but not enough for consensus) agreed that systemic CS should never be used in children. Further, while the circumstances agreed upon for the use of systemic CS in AD can be applied to patients of all ages, they are less likely to be applicable for young children. Most children will have fewer comorbidities complicating the use of immunomodulatory agents such as ciclosporin. As such, while systemic CS should be used rarely for severe AD in general, their use should be even more limited in children, particularly given concerns regarding infection, growth delay and increased rates of obesity. 18

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Topical corticosteroids (TCS) potency classification and safe-use considerations — TCS are classified in multiple ways, with 1 to 7 in the US system and 1 representing the most potent; the US system is best used in research but in clinical practice there are effectively 4 classes of potency of topical treatments, so both systems must be known to interpret and apply the literature. Avoid high-potency (classes 1 and 2) TCS for prolonged periods of time (> 4 weeks) and limit use on sensitive areas (face, folds, groin), and continuous and prolonged use of low-potency TCS on sensitive areas can also cause these effects.

### Rapid, successful treatment of atopic dermatitis recalcitrant to topical corticosteroids [^685c85fc]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is responsive to midpotency topical corticosteroids, which are the mainstay of treatment, yet many patients have disease that is "resistant" to triamcinolone prescribed for outpatient use. Such resistance is often due to poor adherence, but patients and caregivers may remain adamant that the steroid was ineffective and assure the physician that it was applied as recommended. We describe the case of a young girl with a 2-year history of atopic dermatitis resistant to triamcinolone whose condition rapidly improved with continued use of triamcinolone. Our case raises the ethical dilemma of whether physicians should base treatment plans on what patients report or what evidence on adherence suggests.

### New topical and systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis [^6ec06a13]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Topical Treatments

Topical treatment options for atopic dermatitis have greatly expanded over the past 25 years. Topical corticosteroids have been the mainstay of therapy for decades and remain important first‐line treatments for most children and adults with atopic dermatitis. However, their clinical benefit is limited in some instances by the potential for local adverse events (AEs), particularly in sensitive anatomic locations such as the face and folds. Additionally, while topical corticosteroids are safe and effective for most people when used properly, patient concerns over AEs may negatively impact adherence.

The introduction of the topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, in the early 2000s was a major development for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, giving patients the first non‐corticosteroid topical anti‐inflammatory treatment option. TCIs work by blocking both Th(T helper cell)1 and Th2 immune responses and reduce inflammation and improve the skin barrier without the risk of atrophy. TCIs are not effective for all patients, particularly for more severe lesions of atopic dermatitis, and are limited by application‐site discomfort. Fortunately, the development of TCIs paved the way for other non‐steroidal targeted topical therapies.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: international eczema council consensus statement [^b3378638]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The divergence between guidelines discouraging systemic CS use vs. their frequent use in routine clinical practice are a concern. Ease of use, a rapid response in a distressed patient, cost and familiarity of primary care physicians with systemic CS for other conditions are all likely to contribute. The divergence between treatments physicians suggest in guidelines in a hypothetical clinical scenario and decisions they make when dealing with an individual patient in one‐to‐one consultations has been studied using a behavioural economics approach. 27 Physicians often deviate from agreed best practice when confronted with a distressed patient. Systematic approaches to better understand the implementation gaps between guidelines and practice have been advanced in a recent white paper by the healthcare quality organization Joint Commission International, and may be applicable to systemic CS use for AD. 28

The major strength of our study is the large, geographically diverse group of IEC expert AD clinicians and researchers who participated in the consensus process. During the panel discussion preceding the formal consensus survey, it was clear that clinical practice, even among experts, differed significantly from country to country. Particularly given the sparsity of RCT and high‐quality nonrandomized study evidence to support any one viewpoint, keeping an open mind to different practices is important. Despite the diversity of respondents, there was over‐representation from some countries, including the U.S. A. which may have biased the results, and we would have benefited from a higher response rate.

The major limitation of this project is the limited evidence to support the consensus statements. While RCT evidence would be ideal, many in the IEC would deem it unethical to subject trial participants to systemic CS at this point. Additionally, RCT follow‐up is not likely to be long enough to detect many of the long‐term consequences of systemic CS use. The lack of data likely also contributed to our inability to reach consensus on specific dosing and duration recommendations for systemic CS. Nonrandomized prospective registry studies being planned or currently under way may help to answer some comparative efficacy and safety questions in the AD population. 20, 29

As with any consensus project, our results are influenced by the rules chosen to reach consensus. Using rules chosen a priori, we reached consensus on 12 statements. However, if we had used stricter rules, as in our second sensitivity analysis, we would have only reached consensus on three statements, limiting the recommendations we could make. Another limitation is the broad age range (0–12 years) used to define the youngest group of children. More precise age categorization may have yielded different results.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis — proactive topical therapy versus reactive use: In patients with atopic dermatitis and a relapsing course, the JTF panel recommends use of proactive therapy with a topical calcineurin inhibitor or mid‑potency topical corticosteroid (US classes 3–5) over applying treatments only in reaction to flares (strong recommendation, moderate‑certainty evidence). A topical treatments systematic review and meta‑analysis including 1964 patients across 14 RCTs, 4 to 12 months in duration, found proactive therapy reduced incidence of flare (69 per 100 vs 38 per 100, RD −31 [−40 to −20], relative risk: 0.55 [95% CI, 0.42–0.71]) with little to no adverse effects (24% vs 27%; RD 3 [−2 to 9]). After inducing remission, proactive therapy was best studied as application once per day on 2 consecutive days of per week for several months to maintain AD control, and once‑daily mid‑potency topical medications may help facilitate proactive therapy. Values and preferences emphasized high value on safe and effective therapies and preference of self‑efficacy, and contextual factors note proactive therapy is widely accessible and uses less overall topical medication compared with a reactive strategy.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: international eczema council consensus statement [^f264266c]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines discourage the use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis (AD), but their use remains widespread.

Objectives

To reach consensus among an international group of AD experts on the use of systemic corticosteroids for AD.

Methods

A survey consisting of statements accompanied by visual analogue scales ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'neutral' to 'strongly agree' was distributed to the International Eczema Council (IEC). Consensus was reached in agreement on a statement if < 30% of respondents marked to the left of 'neutral' towards 'strongly disagree'.

Results

Sixty of 77 (78%) IEC members participated. Consensus was reached on 12 statements, including that systemic corticosteroids should generally be avoided but can be used rarely for severe AD under certain circumstances, including a lack of other treatment options, as a bridge to other systemic therapies or phototherapy, during acute flares in need of immediate relief, in anticipation of a major life event or in the most severe cases. If used, treatment should be limited to the short term. Most respondents agreed that systemic corticosteroids should never be used in children, but consensus was not reached on that statement. The conclusions of our expert group are limited by a dearth of high-quality published evidence. If more stringent consensus criteria were applied (e.g. requiring < 20% of respondents marking towards 'strongly disagree'), consensus would have been reached on fewer statements.

Conclusions

Based on expert opinion from the IEC, routine use of systemic corticosteroids for AD is generally discouraged and should be reserved for special circumstances.

### Topical corticosteroids in dermatology [^51305032]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are the most commonly prescribed agents in the treatment of dermatologic conditions. They are used primarily as monotherapy or in combination with other agents for enhanced efficacy. Several stronger preparations are now available since their first introduction. They are also available in various vehicles altering the potency and giving the option of tailoring them for use based on specific anatomic locations, area of involvement, age of the patient, and most importantly, severity of the condition. Several local and systemic side effects have been associated with their inadvertent use. Allergic contact dermatitis to most of the preparations has also been noticed. Judicious use with reinforced patient education lowers such risk for side effects, and can be of great use in treating dermatologic conditions.

### Atopic dermatitis guidelines: diagnosis, systemic therapy, and adjunctive care [^48a07864]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is an important and chronic skin condition that has recently been the subject of enormous volumes of basic science, clinical, and epidemiologic research. This field is undergoing rapid expansion, making it vitally important to integrate the emerging data with our current body of knowledge. In 2014, the American Academy of Dermatology published Guidelines of Care for the Management of Atopic Dermatitis, composed of four parts, reflecting the work of 17 experts from North America and the United Kingdom. 1–4 It uses a patient-oriented system, SORT (Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy), to provide evidence-based guidance in the management of this common, vexing dermatitis. These guidelines join a series of similar efforts published recently across the world, reflecting universal interest in distilling the tremendous volume of basic scientific and clinical data previously generated. 5–7 With new therapies rapidly emerging, clinicians require a current understanding of the field to be able to incorporate new treatments in their practice.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^5dcb09ae]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where randomisation is at any level (including cluster and within‐participant trials).

Types of participants

Participants of any age and gender with a diagnosis of eczema (also known as atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema) of any severity by a healthcare professional, or using established diagnostic criteria for eczema, e.g. the standardised diagnostic criteria of Hanifin and Rajka (Hanifin 1980) or the UK Working Party diagnostic criteria for atopic dermatitis (Williams 1994). We also accepted modified versions of standard diagnostic criteria. Where it was unclear whether a trial included participants with atopic eczema, a senior clinician (HCW) made a judgement as to whether the trial was to be included. This was primarily based upon the pattern of symptoms described in the paper.

We included trials that included participants with other types of eczema such as contact dermatitis, varicose eczema, and seborrhoeic eczema, or other inflammatory or 'steroid‐responsive' skin conditions such as psoriasis, only if the trial also included people with eczema and the data were reported separately.

Types of interventions

The intervention was any topical corticosteroid of any preparation and potency in a trial where one strategy of using the topical corticosteroid was compared to a different strategy. This included the following strategies (see Figure 1).

1
Overview of strategies included in the review. Figure created by Dr Natasha Rogers, Centre of Evidence Based Dermatology, University of Nottingham

Which topical corticosteroid to use?

Stronger‐potency topical corticosteroid versus weaker‐potency topical corticosteroid Moderate‐ versus mild‐potency topical corticosteroid Potent versus mild‐potency topical corticosteroid Potent versus moderate‐potency topical corticosteroid Very potent versus potent topical corticosteroid
Topical corticosteroid cream versus topical corticosteroid ointment
Different concentrations of the same topical corticosteroid
Second‐generation topical corticosteroid (mometasone furoate and fluticasone propionate) versus older topical corticosteroid
Branded topical corticosteroid versus generic topical corticosteroid

How often to apply topical corticosteroid?

Twice or more versus once daily application of topical corticosteroid
Daily application versus less frequent application per week
Longer‐ (more than seven days) versus shorter‐term (7 days) duration of use for induction of remission
Topical corticosteroid alternating with topical calcineurin inhibitor versus topical corticosteroid alone
Weekend therapy (proactive topical corticosteroid) versus no proactive topical corticosteroid (e.g. twice per week versus 'as required')

### Corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis-AAP… [^454afcb2]. AAP (2021). Medium credibility.

Selecting a Corticosteroid Consider the following factors when selecting a topical corticosteroid:

- How old is the patient.
- In general, a less potent preparation is required in infants than in older children or adolescents. For example, for the management of flares of atopic dermatitis, a low-potency preparation usually is sufficient in an infant, while in an adolescent, a mid-potency or high-potency product is needed.
- What area will be treated.
- Absorption of steroids varies with the thickness of the skin in various regions of the body.
- Absorption is greatest in areas where the skin is thin and lowest where the skin is thick. Thus, only a low-potency preparation should be used on the face, while a mid-potency product will be needed to manage dermatitis on the feet. How much should you dispense.

For treatment of a small area, prescribing a small tube is sufficient; however, larger amounts may be needed. Some rules that help determine the amount to prescribe include the following:

- In an older child, it takes
- 2 FTU to cover the face and neck
- 2. 5 FTU to cover the hand and arm
- 3. 5 FTU to cover the chest and abdomen
- 4. 5 FTU to cover the foot and leg
- When managing atopic dermatitis that involves a significant portion of the body, prescribing amounts of 227 or 454 g, rather than small tubes, may be necessary.
- **Local adverse effects**: atrophy, striae, easy bruising, hypertrichosis, and acne-like eruptions. To prevent these effects, use only low-potency preparations on the face, axillae, and groin; limit the duration of use of all corticosteroids; and use high-potency preparations very discriminately.

### Corticosteroids: options in the era of steroid-sparing therapy [^22e9446c]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids remain the most commonly used topical treatments for inflammatory dermatoses, including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Topical corticosteroids are available in a variety of vehicles-creams, ointments, lotions, gels, and, more recently, foam. The vehicle used can substantially affect the individual agent's clinical action, potency, and acceptability to the patient. Moreover, some vehicles are better suited for specific body areas. Selection of the appropriate product should be determined by area of usage, physician experience, cost, and patient preference, particularly regarding vehicle. Although topical corticosteroids are associated with several side effects, including skin atrophy, telangiectases, purpura, and striae formation, appropriate usage can minimize these occurrences. Judicious use includes short-term, appropriate application as initial monotherapy or in combination strategies with other therapeutic agents that ideally possess complementing mechanisms of action. Examples include pulsing with high-potency topical corticosteroids and combination regimens with other topical agents such as topical calcineurin inhibitors, calcipotriene, or tazarotene. Appropriate education of patients and caregivers alike will facilitate the optimal use of these medications.

### Dosage and adverse effects of topical tacrolimus and steroids in daily management of atopic dermatitis [^3d2d62d3]. The Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Since 1999, combination therapy with tacrolimus and topical steroids has been widely used for the treatment of adolescent/adult-type atopic dermatitis. In order to determine the clinical doses of topical tacrolimus and steroids for daily treatment of atopic dermatitis and to elucidate their beneficial and adverse effects, we analyzed the clinical data from 215 patients with atopic dermatitis who were more than 16 years old. Less than 70 g of tacrolimus and less than 15 g of steroids were applied to 90% of the patients on the face and neck, and less than 75.8 g of tacrolimus and less than 322 g of steroids were applied to 90% of the patients on the trunk and extremities during the six-month treatment period. Topical tacrolimus is much more frequently used on face and neck lesions (99.1%); in only 39.5% of cases was it used on the trunk and extremities. The majority of patients improved after six months of the combination topical therapy; however, atopic dermatitis was not controlled in 6% of the patients. The combination therapy did not seem to increase the risk of cutaneous infections; however, the incidence of herpes simplex infection on the face and neck was 2.8% at pre-treatment and slightly increased to 4.7% during the therapy. The incidence of all steroid-induced adverse effects was reduced both in frequency and intensity with a decrease in the dose of topical steroids through simultaneous tacrolimus application. Combination therapy with topical tacrolimus and steroids is useful for treating atopic dermatitis, but a small percentage of the patients still cannot be satisfactorily treated. For such patients, adjustments of the dose and rank of topical steroids and tacrolimus and other therapeutic adjuncts are necessary.

### Topical corticosteroids: choice and application [^d7b7fc47]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are an essential tool for treating inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Topical corticosteroids are classified by strength and the risk of adverse effects such as atrophy, striae, rosacea, telangiectasias, purpura, and other cutaneous and systemic reactions. The risk of adverse effects increases with prolonged use, a large area of application, higher potency, occlusion, and application to areas of thinner skin such as the face and genitals. When prescribing topical corticosteroids for use in children, lower potencies and shorter durations should be used. Topical corticosteroids can work safely and effectively in patients who are pregnant or lactating. They are available in formulations such as ointments, creams, lotions, gels, foams, oils, solutions, and shampoos. The quantity of corticosteroid prescribed depends on the duration of treatment, the frequency of application, the skin location, and the total surface area treated. Correct patient application is critical to successful use. Patients may be taught application using the fingertip unit method. One fingertip unit is the amount of medication dispensed from the tip of the index finger to the crease of the distal interphalangeal joint and covers approximately 2% body surface area on an adult. Topical corticosteroids are applied once or twice per day for up to three weeks for super-high-potency corticosteroids or up to 12 weeks for high- or medium-potency corticosteroids. There is no specified time limit for low-potency topical corticosteroid use.

Topical ruxolitinib — patient preferences and implementation in mild atopic dermatitis (AD): The panel inferred that most well-informed patients with mild AD would prefer to avoid the uncertain small increase in serious harms over the modest benefits of adding topical ruxolitinib compared with standard care, and use might be minimized when used on less than 20% body surface area, in nonimmunocompromised nor immunosuppressed patients, and in a short-term or noncontinuous manner. Although the panel did not yet render an official recommendation for topical corticosteroids (TCS) or topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) vs ruxolitinib and many clinical experts and patients still want TCS or TCI first, experts expressed that although most patients may not prefer ruxolitinib as first-line treatment, it might be a resource to consider for those for whom TCS and TCI do not yield sufficient control.

In conclusion, it is the consensus of the IEC that systemic CS have a limited role in the treatment of severe AD in children and adults. Clinicians should limit their use to special circumstances and always consider other treatment options. If they are prescribed, they should be limited to short‐term use with a long‐term treatment plan not involving systemic CS. We hope that this serves to curb the overprescription of these medications for patients with AD.

### Topical tacrolimus for atopic dermatitis [^b7658ae7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Atopic dermatitis (AD) (or atopic eczema) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects children and adults and has an important impact on quality of life. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are the first-line therapy for this condition; however, they can be associated with significant adverse effects when used chronically. Tacrolimus ointment (in its 2 manufactured strengths of 0.1% and 0.03%) might be an alternative treatment. Tacrolimus, together with pimecrolimus, are drugs called topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs).

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of topical tacrolimus for moderate and severe atopic dermatitis compared with other active treatments.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 3 June 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library (Issue 5, 2015), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), and the Global Resource of Eczema Trials (GREAT database). We searched six trials registers and checked the bibliographies of included studies for further references to relevant trials. We contacted specialists in the field for unpublished data. A separate search for adverse effects of topical tacrolimus was undertaken in MEDLINE and EMBASE on 30 July 2013. We also scrutinised the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) websites for adverse effects information.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of participants with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (both children and adults) using topical tacrolimus at any dose, course duration, and follow-up time compared with other active treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened and examined the full text of selected studies for compliance with eligibility criteria, risk of bias, and data extraction. Our three prespecified primary outcomes were physician's assessment, participant's self-assessment of improvement, and adverse effects. Our secondary outcomes included assessment of improvement of the disease by validated or objective measures, such as SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis), the EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index), and BSA (Body Surface Area) scores.

Main Results

We included 20 studies, with 5885 participants. The variability of drug doses, outcomes, and follow-up periods made it difficult to carry out meta-analyses. A single trial showed that tacrolimus 0.1% was better than low-potency TCS by the physician's assessment (risk ratio (RR) 3.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.14 to 4.45, 1 study, n = 371, moderate-quality evidence). It was also marginally better than low-potency TCS on face and neck areas and moderate-potency TCS on the trunk and extremities by the physician's assessment (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.49, 1 study, n = 972, moderate level of evidence) and for some of the secondary outcomes. Compared with pimecrolimus 1%, people treated with tacrolimus were almost twice as likely to improve by the physician's assessment (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.42, 2 studies, n = 506, moderate quality of evidence). Compared with the lower concentration of 0.03%, the tacrolimus 0.1% formulation reduced the risk of not having an improvement by 18% as evaluated by the physician's assessment (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.92, 6 studies, n = 1640, high-quality evidence). Tacrolimus 0.1% compared with moderate-to-potent TCS showed no difference by the physician's assessment, and 2 secondary outcomes (1 study, 377 participants) and a marginal benefit favouring tacrolimus 0.1% was found by the participant's assessment (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.29, 1 study, n = 974, low quality of evidence) and SCORAD. Based on data from 2 trials, tacrolimus 0.03% was superior to mild TCS for the physician's assessment (RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.96 to 3.38, 2 studies, n = 790, moderate-quality evidence) and the participant's self-assessment (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.90, 1 study, n = 416, moderate quality of evidence). One trial showed moderate benefit of tacrolimus 0.03% compared with pimecrolimus 1% on the physician's assessment (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.98, 1 study, n = 139, low-quality evidence), but the effects were equivocal when evaluating BSA. In the comparison of tacrolimus 0.03% with moderate-to-potent corticosteroids, no difference was found in most of the outcomes measured (including physician's and participant's assessment and also for the secondary outcomes), but in two studies, a marginal benefit favouring the corticosteroid group was found for the EASI and BSA scores. Burning was more frequent in those using calcineurin inhibitors than those using corticosteroid tacrolimus 0.03% (RR 2.48, 95% CI 1.96 to 3.14, 5 studies, 1883 participants, high-quality evidence), but no difference was found for skin infections. Symptoms observed were mild and transient. The comparison between the two calcineurin inhibitors (pimecrolimus and tacrolimus) showed the same overall incidence of adverse events, but with a small difference in the frequency of local effects. Serious adverse events were rare; occurred in both the tacrolimus and corticosteroid groups; and in most cases, were considered to be unrelated to the treatment. No cases of lymphoma were noted in the included studies nor in the non-comparative studies. Cases were only noted in spontaneous reports, cohorts, and case-control studies. Systemic absorption was rarely detectable, only in low levels, and this decreased with time. Exception is made for diseases with severe barrier defects, such as Netherton's syndrome, lamellar ichthyosis, and a few others, with case reports of a higher absorption. We evaluated clinical trials; case reports; and in vivo, in vitro, and animal studies; and didn't find any evidence that topical tacrolimus could cause skin atrophy.

Authors' Conclusions

Tacrolimus 0.1% was better than low-potency corticosteroids, pimecrolimus 1%, and tacrolimus 0.03%. Results were equivocal when comparing both dose formulations to moderate-to-potent corticosteroids. Tacrolimus 0.03% was superior to mild corticosteroids and pimecrolimus. Both tacrolimus formulations seemed to be safe, and no evidence was found to support the possible increased risk of malignancies or skin atrophy with their use. The reliability and strength of the evidence was limited by the lack of data; thus, findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. We did not evaluate costs.

### Quantitative analysis of topical treatments in atopic dermatitis: unexpectedly low use of emollients and strong correlation of topical corticosteroid use both with depression and concurrent asthma [^2d8570ab]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite decades of use, the actual amounts of topical corticosteroids (TCS) and emollients used in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) under real-world conditions are unknown. Thus, it remains unclear whether inadequate use is widespread.

Objectives

To quantify the use of TCS and emollients in moderate-to-severe AD.

Methods

Double-blinded drug prescribing was recorded prospectively at the point of drug dispensing within a catchment area of approximately 450 000 people over a 31-year period in a population-based cohort marked by failure of disease control in primary care (n = 844). For each patient, prescribing was recorded over a 12-month period in order to minimize fluctuations.

Results

This approach resulted in a near-complete dataset, which was essentially free of reporting bias and recording bias. Atopic comorbidities matched expected frequencies. Median use of TCS was statistically significantly higher in juvenile patients (age < 16 years) compared with adult patients (49·2 vs. 38·1 g per month), in male vs. female patients (46·8 vs. 29·7 g per month) and in patients receiving concurrent asthma treatment (40·4 vs. 26·7 g per month). TCS use was strongly associated with antidepressant treatment. Emollient use was unexpectedly low with a median of 9·6 g per day (range 1·4–30·1). Results were replicated in an independent validation cohort.

Conclusions

Deficient use of emollients may be a factor contributing to AD severity. Our analysis showed that the use of TCS does not exceed current guidelines. Accurate quantification of topical treatments provides a widely accessible strategy to measure the real-world impact of novel AD treatments. What's already known about this topic? Both emollient and topical corticosteroid (TCS) use have been a mainstay of atopic dermatitis (AD) treatment for over 60 years. The actual quantities used by patients under real-world conditions are unknown. What does this study add? The real-world use of emollients is fourfold lower than the amount recommended in current guidelines. Underuse of emollients may be a significant factor in disease exacerbation. The use of TCS is significantly higher in male patients and is higher in patients with AD who also have asthma. The use of TCS is strongly associated with concurrent antidepressant treatment.

### A clinician's paradigm in the treatment of atopic dermatitis [^354acd6e]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Successful management of atopic dermatitis requires a multipronged approach that includes skin barrier function care, use of topical or systemic agents, and identification and elimination of precipitating or exacerbating factors. Because the origin of atopic dermatitis is multifactorial and trigger factors differ among patients, treatment plans must be specific to the individual patient. This article offers an example of a permutational, or flexible, treatment paradigm. The approach utilizes 4 topical regimens — high-potency topical corticosteroids, lowest effective potency topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), or topical corticosteroid/TCI combinations — as initial therapy in a variety of induction protocols, as determined by the severity of a patient's condition and history. The paradigm permits treatment to progress from a chosen induction therapy to maintenance therapy. During the patient's induction therapy, as soon as an acceptable level of clearance is achieved, therapy should be adjusted to a maintenance regimen, such as monotherapy with either a TCI or a lowest effective potency topical corticosteroid (the latter used intermittently) or an alternation of the two agents. If there is no clearance or positive response with the initial induction protocol, the clinician should move to one of the alternative regimens.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence

We created summary of findings tables for our main comparisons. We selected the following four most relevant and important comparisons, from both clinician and patient perspectives, to be included in the summary of findings tables.

Stronger potency versus weaker potency for treatment of eczema flare‐ups
Twice daily versus once daily application for treatment of eczema flare‐ups
Longer‐ versus shorter‐term application for induction of remission
Twice weekly application to prevent relapse (weekend therapy) versus no application

We included both primary outcomes and secondary outcomes in each summary of findings table. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each primary and secondary outcome for our main comparisons. GRADE includes the assessment of five factors: trial limitations (risk of bias); inconsistency of results; indirectness of evidence; imprecision; and publication bias (Schünemann 2013). Each outcome can be downgraded by one or two levels for each domain, and we classed the overall certainty as high, moderate, low or very low. We used GRADEpro GDT to create our summary of findings tables and undertake our GRADE assessments.

### Topical tacrolimus in the management of atopic dermatitis in Japan [^02b78ceb]. Dermatologic Therapy (2006). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic, relapsing, severely pruritic, eczematous skin disease. Topical steroids are the mainstay of treatment. However, the adverse effects of steroids on hormonal function are the major obstacle for their use as long-term topical therapy. Topical calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus, not only complement existing treatment options but also overcome some of the drawbacks of topical steroid therapy and fulfill the long-term needs of patients in preventing disease progression. Short- and long-term efficacy and safety of topical tacrolimus has been widely recognized and it is also accepted as a first-line treatment for the inflammation of AD. In order to reduce the possible long-term adverse effects, it is important to monitor the clinical dose in daily clinics.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: international eczema council consensus statement [^cb765e3d]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The majority (65%) disagreed that nonresponse to topical therapy was an indication for use of systemic CS. Consensus was reached that among the appropriate circumstances for the use of systemic CS in AD were a lack of other viable treatment options, as a bridge to other systemic therapies or phototherapy, acute flares in need of immediate relief, in anticipation of a major life event or in cases that were the most severe. Consensus was reached that, if used, systemic CS treatment of severe AD should be limited to short‐term use.

In their responses to the open‐ended questions, individual participants qualified their responses in several ways. Some expressed strong support for the use of systemic CS, whereas others expressed strong opposition.

In the sensitivity analysis using < 20% disagreement as a more stringent cut‐off, only five statements would have reached consensus (Box S1; see Supporting Information). In the sensitivity analysis in which no more than 30% of voters marked within the left two‐thirds of the VAS (counting more of the 'neutral' range as disagreement), only three statements would have reached consensus (Box S2; see Supporting Information).

### Atopic dermatitis: an overview [^ec9573a4]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema, is a chronic pruritic skin condition affecting approximately 17.8 million persons in the United States. It can lead to significant morbidity. A simplified version of the U.K. Working Party's Diagnostic Criteria can help make the diagnosis. Asking about the presence and frequency of symptoms can allow physicians to grade the severity of the disease and response to treatment. Management consists of relieving symptoms and lengthening time between flare-ups. Regular, liberal use of emollients is recommended. The primary pharmacologic treatment is topical corticosteroids. Twice-daily or more frequent application has not been shown to be more effective than once-daily application. A maintenance regimen of topical corticosteroids may reduce relapse rates in patients who have recurrent moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Pimecrolimus and tacrolimus are calcineurin inhibitors that are recommended as second-line treatment for persons with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and who are at risk of atrophy from topical corticosteroids. Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a boxed warning about a possible link between these medications and skin malignancies and lymphoma, studies have not demonstrated a clear link. Topical and oral antibiotics may be used to treat secondary bacterial infections, but are not effective in preventing atopic dermatitis flare-ups. The effectiveness of alternative therapies, such as Chinese herbal preparations, homeopathy, hypnotherapy/biofeedback, and massage therapy, has not been established.

Atopic dermatitis — definition and diagnosis note that AD (also known as atopic eczema) is a chronic, pruritic inflammatory skin disease that occurs most frequently in children but also affects many adults and follows a relapsing course, and it is often associated with a personal or family history of allergic rhinitis and asthma. Although the diagnosis of AD is usually made clinically, alternative or concomitant causes of dermatitis such as allergic contact dermatitis or irritant contact dermatitis should be considered and evaluated via comprehensive history and physical exam, and other diagnostic tests such as biopsy or patch testing should be performed if warranted.

This is an exciting time in the management of atopic dermatitis due to the development of several biologics, Janus Kinase inhibitors, and new topical therapies. Furthermore, evidence-based guidelines allow provision of individualized patient care. Management includes education on trigger avoidance, appropriate use of topicals to ensure efficacy and avoid side effects while attending to the psychosocial needs and priorities of the patient/caregivers. The synthesis of this information facilitates a balanced discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives to allow for shared decision-making. Together these options provide an opportunity to improve the quality of life of patients with atopic dermatitis.

Topical calcineurin inhibitor (TCI) safety and acceptability — evidence states there was "no credible increase in cancer" with typical TCI use across infants, children, and adults, and that "minor harms of TCIs include local irritation/burning"; willingness to use on a scale of 1–9 was higher with counseling that the sensation signals efficacy (mean [SD] 6.9 [1.8]) than with counseling about potential sensation alone (5.3 [1.9]) or with no counseling (4.9 [1.9]); clinicians should consider that topical corticosteroids (TCS) generally come in larger dispensing sizes than TCI (eg, 454 g tubs vs 100 g tubes).
