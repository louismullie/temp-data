## Question

Cocaine use and chest pain treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing cocaine-associated chest pain in the emergency setting. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and airway, breathing, circulation. Then, I should verify the focused history, including timing and route of cocaine use and co-ingestants. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology to guide therapy. After that, I need to check the diagnostic workup, including ECG, biomarkers, and imaging. Then, I will review risk stratification and disposition. Finally, I will synthesize pharmacologic management, including benzodiazepines, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, alpha-blockers, and the controversial role of beta-blockers, and close with special populations and disposition planning.

> Let me first confirm the priorities in the first few minutes: establish ABCs, obtain IV access, continuous cardiac monitoring, pulse oximetry, and a 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes, because cocaine users can deteriorate rapidly with arrhythmias, ischemia, or hypertensive crises, and early ECG interpretation is essential to detect STEMI or dynamic ischemia patterns that mandate reperfusion pathways [^111DVS1a].

> I need to check the history elements that change management, and I should not forget to ask explicitly about cocaine and methamphetamine use because patients often underreport; guidelines recommend routinely assessing for stimulant use in acute chest pain, and urine testing can be informative for 1–4 days after use, though I should confirm unexpected positives with confirmatory testing to avoid false positives that could misdirect care [^11764TxU] [^112zQ3MU] [^1111pPSc] [^113LWzsZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism before I review pathophysiology: cocaine increases myocardial oxygen demand via catecholamine surge while simultaneously decreasing supply through coronary vasospasm, platelet activation, and thrombosis; it also has sodium channel blockade effects that can widen QRS, so I should anticipate both ischemic and arrhythmic presentations and tailor therapy accordingly [^113sH5cL] [^112HjJid] [^111DVS1a].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup with attention to cocaine-specific pitfalls: obtain serial high-sensitivity troponins at 0 and 3–6 hours, recognizing that cocaine-associated ACS is less common than perceived and that many patients have nonischemic pain; if the ECG is normal or nondiagnostic and the patient is low risk, SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging or coronary CTA can safely reduce unnecessary admissions, and in selected low-risk patients a negative coronary CTA can support discharge with very low 30-day event rates [^117PvQVC] [^114VR4ev] [^1162hXPX].

> I will now examine risk stratification and disposition: the HEART Pathway performs well in cocaine-associated chest pain, with very low missed MACE in low-risk patients, and a 9–12 hour observation strategy is validated for low-to-intermediate risk cocaine-associated chest pain without ischemia, with 30-day cardiovascular mortality near zero and MI around 1–2% when discharged after a negative protocol; I should double-check that any residual ischemic symptoms or positive biomarkers prompt admission and further workup [^114ZCth7] [^114HiQaY].

> Let me think about first-line pharmacotherapy for hyperadrenergic symptoms and chest pain: benzodiazepines are foundational to blunt sympathetic drive, reduce heart rate and blood pressure, and relieve chest discomfort; lorazepam 1–2 mg IV every 5–10 minutes titrated to effect is reasonable, and combining benzodiazepines with nitrates provides superior analgesia compared with nitrates alone in small randomized data, so I should favor combination therapy when pain persists [^115iWjP6] [^117CiSRF] [^114j1z7j].

> Wait, let me verify the role of nitrates and calcium channel blockers: nitrates relieve vasospasm and ischemic pain and should be used if SBP is above about 100 mmHg, while non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem or verapamil can be added for refractory vasospasm or persistent tachycardia; if vasospasm dominates and standard therapy fails, phentolamine, an alpha-blocker, can be considered as rescue, though evidence is limited and I should involve cardiology early in complex cases [^111DVS1a] [^115QoxCv] [^111Wph89].

> Now, the beta-blocker question is contentious, so I should double-check the balance of evidence: historically, nonselective beta-blockade was avoided due to theoretical unopposed alpha-agonism worsening vasospasm, and the 2014 ACC/AHA NSTE-ACS guideline advises against beta-blockers in patients with recent cocaine use and signs of intoxication unless adequate vasodilator therapy is on board; however, more recent observational data and meta-analyses suggest no increase in MI or mortality with beta-blockers in cocaine-associated chest pain, and some cohorts even signal improved long-term cardiovascular outcomes with outpatient beta-blockade, so if I use a beta-blocker at all in the acute setting, I should prefer agents with alpha-1 blockade such as carvedilol or labetalol and ensure concurrent vasodilator coverage, reserving pure beta-1 selective agents only after intoxication has resolved and with cardiology input [^111PFkLv] [^1169n5TJ] [^112negw3] [^111Se8kD] [^111Wph89] [^112jdMS3].

> But wait, what if the ECG shows STEMI or there is ongoing ischemia despite medical therapy? I should activate the cath lab for primary PCI when available and avoid fibrinolysis if the presentation is within 24 hours of cocaine use due to the risk of coronary spasm masquerading as thrombosis; if PCI is not available and the patient is high risk with clear STEMI, fibrinolysis may be considered, but I need to ensure meticulous antithrombotic management and anticipate higher stent thrombosis risk in active users, which may influence stent choice toward bare metal stents and shorter dual antiplatelet therapy when feasible [^114QZCd9].

> I should confirm that I am not missing alternative etiologies of chest pain that are more common in stimulant users: aortic dissection, pneumothorax, myocarditis, and pulmonary embolism should remain on the differential, and if dissection is suspected, I need emergent CTA of the chest because cocaine can precipitate dissection even without classic risk factors; similarly, cocaine can cause pseudo-Wellens pattern from LAD vasospasm, so I must correlate ECG evolution with biomarkers and clinical context before labeling an occlusion [^117X7tay] [^113YMFNk].

> Let me reconsider disposition and follow-up: for low-risk patients with a nondiagnostic ECG, negative serial troponins, and no complications during observation, discharge with strict return precautions and addiction referral is appropriate, whereas intermediate-risk patients benefit from provocative testing or coronary CTA prior to discharge; I need to ensure all patients receive counseling on cocaine abstinence, arrange close follow-up, and consider that continued use predicts recurrence and worse outcomes, which strengthens the case for integrated addiction treatment linkage [^114HiQaY] [^115nDaHG] [^112TNRnP].

> Finally, I should double-check special populations and long-term cardiac care: in patients who develop cocaine-related cardiomyopathy, initiating guideline-directed therapy for LV dysfunction, including beta-blockers, is reasonable only after a period of demonstrated abstinence, and in those at risk for relapse, nonselective beta-blockers with alpha-1 antagonism may mitigate unopposed alpha effects; throughout, I must communicate uncertainty where evidence is limited and involve cardiology and toxicology early for complex or refractory cases [^115pzFEG] [^116EQEZb] [^1162WbvW] [^111Wph89].

Cocaine-associated chest pain is common and often benign, but it carries a real risk of ACS [^117PvQVC] [^114HiQaY]. Immediate priorities are to **stabilize ABCs**, control pain, and reduce sympathetic tone with **benzodiazepines and nitrates** [^115iWjP6] [^115MCkgm]. Avoid **beta-blockers** in the acute setting due to the risk of unopposed alpha stimulation and vasospasm [^111PFkLv]; if needed, use labetalol or carvedilol only with vasodilators [^111Wph89] [^1169n5TJ]. Evaluate for ACS with ECG, troponins, and risk stratification; use coronary CTA or stress testing for low-risk patients [^1162hXPX] [^114VR4ev]. Most patients can be discharged after 9–12 hours if no ischemia is found, but ensure addiction treatment referral and close follow-up [^114HiQaY] [^112TNRnP].

## Pathophysiology of cocaine-associated chest pain

Cocaine causes chest pain through **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Coronary vasospasm**: Direct alpha-adrenergic stimulation causes vasoconstriction and ischemia [^112dGA8F].

- **Increased myocardial oxygen demand**: Sympathetic surge raises heart rate, blood pressure, and contractility [^112HjJid].

- **Thrombosis**: Platelet activation and aggregation promote thrombus formation [^116HbsSE].

- **Direct myocardial toxicity**: Chronic use can cause cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias [^116uB5s2].

---

## Initial evaluation and diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic tool** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | History and physical exam | Identify cocaine use, risk factors, and alternative causes [^11764TxU] |
| 2 | 12-lead ECG | Detect ischemia, arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities [^115vaFyJ] |
| 3 | Cardiac biomarkers (troponin) | Identify myocardial injury [^115JPCFA] |
| 4 | Chest X-ray | Exclude pneumothorax, aortic injury, pulmonary edema [^notfound] |
| 5 | Urine toxicology | Confirm recent cocaine use [^1111pPSc] |
| 6 | Risk stratification (HEART, TIMI) | Guide disposition and testing [^114ZCth7] [^1162hXPX] |

---

For low-risk patients, **coronary CTA or stress testing** can safely reduce admissions and identify significant CAD [^1162hXPX] [^114VR4ev].

---

## Pharmacological management

### First-line agents

- **Benzodiazepines**: Reduce sympathetic tone, relieve chest pain, and lower heart rate and blood pressure [^115iWjP6] [^114j1z7j].

- **Nitrates**: Relieve vasospasm and ischemic pain; use if SBP > 100 mmHg [^111DVS1a].

---

### Second-line agents

Calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) can be used for **persistent vasospasm or ischemia** [^113H24q9]. Alpha-blockers such as **phentolamine** may be considered for refractory vasospasm [^115QoxCv].

---

### Medications to avoid

Avoid **beta-blockers** in the acute setting due to the risk of unopposed alpha stimulation and vasospasm; if needed, use labetalol or carvedilol only with vasodilators [^111PFkLv] [^112jdMS3]. Avoid **tricyclic antidepressants** because they can exacerbate cocaine toxicity.

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions include **continuous cardiac monitoring** to detect arrhythmias or ischemia and supportive care with oxygen, IV access, and sedation for agitation [^111DVS1a]. Addiction treatment referral should be arranged for counseling and follow-up [^112TNRnP].

---

## Risk stratification and disposition

Use validated tools (**HEART, TIMI**) to stratify risk and guide disposition [^114ZCth7]. Low-risk patients with normal ECG and negative troponins can be discharged after 9–12 hours with close follow-up [^114HiQaY]. High-risk patients with ischemia or elevated troponins require admission and cardiology consultation [^notfound].

---

## Long-term outcomes and follow-up

Long-term outcomes depend on **cocaine cessation** and cardiovascular risk management. Continued use increases recurrence and complications [^114HiQaY] [^115nDaHG]. Beta-blockers may be considered after detoxification for secondary prevention [^115pzFEG].

---

## Special considerations

- **Aortic dissection**: Cocaine use increases risk; maintain high suspicion [^117X7tay].

- **Arrhythmias**: Monitor for wide-complex tachycardias and treat with sodium bicarbonate if QRS > 100 ms [^111DVS1a].

- **Pregnancy**: Cocaine-associated chest pain in pregnancy requires obstetric and cardiology input due to unique risks.

---

Cocaine-associated chest pain requires a **structured approach**: stabilize, control pain, reduce sympathetic tone, and risk-stratify. Avoid beta-blockers acutely; use benzodiazepines and nitrates first-line, and reserve calcium channel blockers or alpha-blockers for refractory cases. Most low-risk patients can be discharged after observation, but ensure addiction treatment referral and close follow-up.

Current estimates establish that more than 30 million people in the United States use cocaine. Cardiovascular complaints commonly occur among patients who present to emergency departments(EDs) after cocaine use, with chest pain the most common complaint in several studies. Although myocardial ischemia and infarction account for only a small percentage of cocaine-associated chest-pain, physicians must understand the pathophysiology of cocaine and appropriate diagnostic and treatment strategies to best manage these patients and minimize adverse outcomes. This article reviews the pharmacology of cocaine, its role in the pathogenesis of chest pain with specific emphasis on inducing myocardial ischemia and infarction, and current diagnostic and management strategies for cocaine-associated chest pain encountered in the ED.

Background

Recent guidelines have suggested avoiding beta-blockers in the setting of cocaine-associated acute coronary syndrome. However, the available evidence is both scarce and conflicted. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate the evidence pertaining to the use of beta-blockers in the setting of acute cocaine-related chest pain and its implication on clinical outcomes.

Methods

Electronic databases were systematically searched to identify literature relevant to patients with cocaine-associated chest pain who were treated with or without beta-blockers. We examined the end-points of in-hospital all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction. Pooled risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for all outcomes using a random-effects model.

Results

Five studies with a total of 1447 patients were included. Our analyses found no differences between patients treated with or without beta-blockers for either myocardial infarction (RR 1.08; 95% CI, 0.61–1.91) or all-cause mortality (RR 0.75; 95% CI, 0.46–1.24). Heterogeneity among included studies was low to moderate.

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that beta-blocker use is not associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients presenting with acute chest pain related to cocaine use.

Cocaine use continues to be prevalent among all races and socioeconomic groups in the United States. Patients presenting to emergency departments after cocaine ingestion frequently present with a chief complaint of chest pain. Although acute myocardial infarction is perhaps the most concerning diagnosis in this setting, there are many other potential causes of chest pain after cocaine ingestion. This article reviews the pharmacology of cocaine, as well as the etiologies and treatment of cocaine-associated chest pain, with an emphasis on this drug's range of cardiovascular effects.

### Comparison of in-hospital outcomes for β-blocker use versus non-beta blocker use in patients presenting with cocaine-associated chest pain [^113dJQFo]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Beta blockers are indicated for management of acute coronary syndromes, but they generally are withheld in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain because of concerns for adverse outcomes related to the unique physiological effects of cocaine. Because few clinical studies have evaluated this interaction, we identified patients with toxicology screen results positive for cocaine treated for chest pain at 2 academic hospitals. Clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes were compared between patients with and without β-blocker therapy. We then constructed propensity scores to evaluate the independent relation between β-blocker use and the composite primary end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, ventricular arrhythmia, or all-cause mortality after adjusting for clinical characteristics. Of 376 consecutive patients with cocaine-related chest pain, β blockers were used in 164 (44%). Compared with no β blockers, patients treated with β blockers were more likely to describe anginal chest pain, to have known cardiovascular risk factors, and to receive other antiatherosclerotic therapies. Despite these higher risk clinical characteristics, patients treated with β blockers experienced similar peak troponin levels, individual adverse events, and rates of the composite primary end point (15.9% vs 12.3%, p = 0.32). The primary end point also was similar after propensity score analysis (odds ratio 1.37, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 2.93, p = 0.42), including specific comparisons of beta-1 selective (odds ratio 1.83, 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 4.24) and nonselective (odds ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.33 to 2.42) β blockers, when compared with patients not receiving β blockers. In conclusion, no differences in outcomes were observed between patients treated versus not treated with β-blocker therapy in the setting of cocaine-related chest pain.

### Cocaine use and acute myocardial infarction [^112TNRnP]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Cocaine use in the United States is widespread, affecting more than 30 million Americans. Although many of these persons do not seek healthcare, the overriding cause for hospitalization is cocaine-associated chest pain. Because only a minority of these patients suffer myocardial injury, it is important to exclude even rarer life-threatening causes for chest pain, such as aortic dissection or pneumothorax. Following that, a thorough knowledge of the pathophysiology and existing literature helps to provide cost-effective care, which focuses resources on those patients most likely to suffer complications. Regardless of the severity of complications, referral to cocaine detoxification programs, counseling, social support, and outpatient follow-up care for modification of cardiac risk factors is a fundamental component of long-term patient care.

### Best evidence topic report. beta-blockers in cocaine induced acute coronary syndrome [^113YaGmB]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether beta blockers should be used in the treatment of chest pain associated with cocaine use. 12 papers were found, of which two presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. The clinical bottom line is that Beta Blockers should not be used in the treatment of cocaine induced myocardial ischaemia.

### Should β-blockers be used in the treatment of cocaine-associated acute coronary syndrome? [^114z35UG]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To critically evaluate the 30 year debate of beta-blocker use in cocaine-induced acute coronary syndrome (CIACS).

Data Sources

An Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, and Ovid MEDLINE (1966-August 21, 2007) search of the medical literature was conducted using the key terms cocaine, myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, and adrenergic beta-antagonists.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All clinical trials, case reports, national cardiovascular guidelines, and reviews published in English were evaluated. Case reports were included based on whether (1) acute coronary syndrome was suspected, (2) a beta-blocker was used during the treatment course, and (3) objective and subjective patient-specific information was documented.

Data Synthesis

Three case reports and 2 placebo-controlled trials were identified that used 4 beta-blockers (atenolol, labetalol, metoprolol, propranolol). Three national guidelines addressed beta-blocker use. Although published data are limited, propranolol and labetalol exert minimal to no effect on alleviating cocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction. None of the evaluated national guidelines recommends beta-blockers as first-line agents in CIACS management.

Conclusion

Beta-blockers should not be considered first-line agents for controlling chest pain in patients with documented CIACS. If long-term beta-blockade is warranted, its benefits should be weighed against recurrent use of cocaine and possible exacerbation of acute coronary syndrome. Given that carvedilol exhibits ancillary pharmacologic proprieties beneficial in CIACS, and post-myocardial infarction mortality data are available regarding its use, this agent could be considered to be appropriate therapy.

### Characteristics of cocaine users presenting to an emergency department chest pain observation unit [^112Zcy5Q]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

This report examines the sociodemographic and substance use characteristics, co-occurring psychological status, substance abuse consequences, and prior experiences with substance abuse treatment among patients with cocaine-associated chest pain presenting to an emergency department chest pain observation unit.

Methods

This was a consecutive cohort of patients in the emergency department chest pain observation unit aged 18–60 years with low to moderate risk for acute coronary syndrome and recent cocaine use. Responses on standardized and validated instruments were used to examine demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample and to compare patients who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for past three-month substance abuse or substance dependence with patients who did not.

Results

Of 145 eligible patients identified between June 1, 2002, and February 29, 2004, 86% met criteria for a lifetime DSM-IV substance use disorder and 50% met past three-month criteria. Approximately one half of the total sample reported substantial symptoms of depression. Substance use frequency and consequences, depression, and psychological distress were significantly more severe among those with past three-month substance use diagnoses; however, most sociodemographic characteristics were not associated with substance use diagnoses. Interest in treatment services and treatment history was also significantly associated with the presence of a substance use disorder diagnosis.

Conclusions

Findings regarding diversity in alcohol and drug involvement, current level of psychological functioning, depressive symptomatology, and interest in treatment services provide useful information for designing emergency department-based interventions for this population.

### Outcomes of beta blocker use in cocaine-associated chest pain: a meta-analysis [^1163DpLa]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Beta blockers (β-blockers) remain a standard therapy in the early treatment of acute coronary syndromes. However, β-blocker therapy in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain (CACP) continues to be an area of debate due to the potential risk of unopposed α-adrenergic stimulation and coronary vasospasm. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of available studies to compare outcomes of β-blocker versus no β-blocker use among patients with CACP.

Methods

We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through September 2016 using the keywords 'beta blocker', 'cocaine' and commonly used β-blockers ('atenolol', 'bisoprolol', 'carvedilol', 'esmolol', 'metoprolol' and 'propranolol') to identify studies evaluating β-blocker use among patients with CACP. We specifically focused on studies comparing outcomes between β-blocker versus no β-blocker usage in patients with CACP. Studies without a comparison between β-blocker and no β-blocker use were excluded. Outcomes of interest included non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and all-cause mortality. Quantitative data synthesis was performed using a random-effects model and heterogeneity was assessed using Q and I 2 statistics.

Results

A total of five studies evaluating 1794 subjects were included. Overall, there was no significant difference on MI in patients with CACP on β-blocker versus no β-blocker (OR 1.36, 95%CI 0.68 to 2.75; p = 0.39). Similarly, there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality in patients on β-blocker versus no β-blocker (OR 0.68, 95%CI 0.26 to 1.79; p = 0.43).

Conclusions

In patients presenting with acute chest pain and underlying cocaine, β-blocker use does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of MI or all-cause mortality.

Introduction

Cocaine is the only drug to show a rise in misuse between 1996 and 2007 in England and Wales. It can cause chest pain and myocardial infarction. This study assessed the prevalence of cocaine use in patients presenting with chest pain, and determined the association between cocaine use and chest pain.

Methods

Patients presenting with chest pain had a urine sample collected at presentation. Each patient with chest pain was matched with a non-chest pain control. Demographic detail, drug history and clinical outcome was recorded, samples anonymised and subsequently tested for cocaine and metabolites.

Results

Of the 1469 patients, 101 (6.9%) tested positive for cocaine compared with 3.8% of controls (p < 0.001). Men (8%) were more likely than women (5.1%) to test positive for cocaine. Two patients developed a myocardial infarction. Cocaine use was highest in those aged 18–30 years for both sexes and decreased with age. Cocaine-positive patients with chest pain were more likely to present in the evening, after midnight or at the weekend. Only 18% of all patients presenting with chest pain had a specific drug history recorded in their notes.

Conclusions

As many patients do not admit to use of an illegal drug, routine testing would enable cocaine-related ischaemic events to be identified more easily but this remains controversial. As management of cocaine-induced chest pain is different from other causes of chest pain, doctors should routinely question patients with chest pain about cocaine use in addition to well recognised risk factors.

### Best evidence topic report. cocaine induced myocardial ischaemia: nitrates versus benzodiazepines [^1111AFHD]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether nitrates are better than benzodiazepines in the treatment of cocaine induced chest pain. Seven citations were reviewed of which two answered the three part question. The clinical bottom line is that in patients with cocaine induced chest pain it appears that nitrates or benzodiazepines are effective in combination or alone in resolving chest pain and improving cardiac performance. We recommend that the agent of choice may be influenced by the presence or absence of concurrent CNS symptoms.

### Safety of β-blockers in the acute management of cocaine-associated chest pain [^117Angnk]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Cocaine is the most commonly abused illegal drug in patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) because of chest pain and accounts for almost 40% of all drug-related visits. It is not known whether all β-blockers (BB) and β1-selective agents or mixed α1/β-adrenergic antagonists (α1/β-BB) are safe in the acute management of cocaine-associated chest pain, due to concerns of unopposed α-receptor activity resulting in coronary artery spasm and hypertensive urgency.

Methods

Patients who presented to the EDs of 2 large inner city hospitals because of chest pain and who tested positive for cocaine were identified by retrospective chart review. Demographic characteristics, symptoms, vital signs, electrocardiographic abnormalities, medication use, comorbidities, and troponin values were documented. The presence and type of BB used were studied in relation to peak elevation in troponin T and troponin I. Troponin elevation was defined as a troponin I greater than 0.6 ng/mL and troponin T greater than 0.1 ng/mL if serum creatinine was less than 2 mg/dL.

Results

A total of 378 patients were included in the study; of these, 78% (n = 296) were black; 12% (n = 44), white; and 10% (n = 38), of other race. Twelve percent (n = 46) of the patients had typical chest pain, 22% (n = 84) had coronary artery disease, 56% (n = 213) had hypertension, and 21% (n = 79) had diabetes mellitus. The admission electrocardiogram showed changes (ST elevation, ST depression, or T-wave inversion) in 43% (n = 163) of the patients. β-Blockers were used in 43% (n = 162) of the encounters. Troponin elevation occurred in 11% (n = 42) of patients. There was no difference in the number of patients with troponin rise in the BB and non-BB groups, 22 of 162 vs 20 of 213 (P = 0.2). There was no difference in mean peak troponin levels in patients with troponin rise who were treated with BB vs no BB, 6.7 vs 5.7 ng/mL (P = 0.6). There was no difference in mean peak troponin levels in patients with troponin rise who were treated with a β1-selective agents vs a α1/β-BB, 7.5 vs 4.1 ng/mL (P = 0.4). No cases of hypertensive urgency were identified after taking any BB.

Conclusion

Troponin rise is not uncommon in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain and occurred in 11% of the patients. In patients with cocaine-associated chest pain, BBs did not appear to change the incidence of troponin rise. β1-Selective BBs did not appear to worsen troponin levels compared with mixed α1/β-BB.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116uB5s2]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Cocaine-related cardiomyopathy — Definition, prevalence, and treatment considerations: Long-term cocaine use has been associated with global dilated cardiomyopathy without the presence of coronary artery disease or segmental infarct pattern; this has been termed cocaine-related cardiomyopathy and implies direct toxicity of cocaine on the myocardium. Depressed left ventricular function has been reported in 4% to 18% of asymptomatic cocaine users without evidence of myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease. Other than abstinence, very little is known about treatment, although there are case reports of reversibility of cardiac function after cessation of drug use. Early reports of unopposed α-effects of β1-adrenergic blocking agents in cocaine-related chest pain resulted in caution against the use of β-blockers in cocaine-related cardiac presentations, and the routine use of propranolol and subsequently all β1-specific blockers was not recommended in the acute setting of cocaine-related acute coronary syndrome. The safety and efficacy of β-blockers in patients with chronic heart failure or cardiomyopathy related to cocaine are unknown, but β-blockers with α-blocking properties such as carvedilol (an α1-, β1-, and β2-receptor antagonist) might not have significant unopposed α-agonism with cocaine and might be beneficial in patients with cocaine-associated cardiomyopathy, especially after declaration of abstinence.

### Physician variability in history taking when evaluating patients presenting with chest pain in the emergency department [^116ybeif]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to examine how physicians in the emergency department ask questions of patients presenting with chest pain and whether this varies by patient demographics.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional study with convenience sampling. A survey was administered to adult emergency department patients presenting with chest pain after emergency physicians obtained the history and performed the physical examination. No identifying data were collected from the patients. In addition to demographics, patients were asked whether or not their physician asked them about factors related to coronary syndrome and myocardial infarction etiology.

Results

A total of 308 of 332 patients (93%) participated. Patients had a mean age of 52 years, 54% were male, and 85% spoke English; classification by race was 31% African American, 28% white, 19% Hispanic, and 13% other. History taking did not differ by gender. Patients who reported being asked about the following were statistically significantly younger than those who reported not being asked: family history, other medical problems, smoking, cocaine use, and alcohol use. Nonwhite patients reported being asked about the following more frequently than white patients: smoking (94% vs. 84%), alcohol use (81% vs. 70%), and cocaine use (64% vs. 42%). In multivariate logistic regression controlling for age, nonwhite patients were more likely than white patients to be asked about smoking (odds ratio [OR], 2.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26 to 6.19), cocaine use (OR, 2.49; 95% CI = 1.50 to 4.12), and alcohol use (OR, 1.77; 95% CI = 1.0 to 3.09).

Conclusions

The variability in questions about behavioral factors associated with chest pain etiology as reported by patients may indicate a possible cultural bias by physicians. Differences in risk identification may lead to differences in treatment decisions.

### Towards evidence based emergency medicine: best BETs from the manchester royal infirmary. acute myocardial infarction in cocaine induced chest pain presenting as an emergency [^113WNpDd]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish the incidence of acute myocardial infarction in patients presenting as emergencies with post-cocaine chest pain. Altogether 198 papers were found using the reported search, of which eight presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. A clinical bottom line is stated.

### Cardiovascular consequences of cocaine use [^113sH5cL]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The cardiovascular consequences of cocaine use are numerous and can be severe, with mechanisms of cardiotoxicity unique to cocaine that include sympathomimetic effects, blockade of sodium and potassium channels, oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage, and disruption of excitation-contraction coupling. In combination, these effects increase myocardial oxygen demand while simultaneously decreasing oxygen supply. Cocaine-associated chest pain is particularly common and, in some instances, associated with a more severe cardiac syndrome, such as myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, aortic dissection, or endocarditis. Therapy for cocaine-associated chest pain and myocardial infarction is similar to treatment in non-cocaine users, except for differences in the use of benzodiazepines and phentolamine and avoidance of beta-blockers in the acute setting. In this review, we discuss the most up-to-date literature regarding the mechanisms of cocaine-associated cardiotoxicity and clinical consequences, diagnosis, and treatment; we also discuss relevant controversies while proposing several important areas for future research.

### Validation of a brief observation period for patients with cocaine-associated chest pain [^114HiQaY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Retrospective studies of patients with cocaine-associated chest pain suggest that a strategy of discharging patients from the emergency department after a 12-hour observation period if they do not have evidence of ischemia should be associated with a very low rate of complications.

Methods

We prospectively evaluated the safety of a 9-to-12-hour observation period in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain who were at low-to-intermediate risk of cardiovascular events. Consecutive patients who reported or tested positive for cocaine use and who received protocol-driven care in a chest-pain observation unit were included. Patients who had normal levels of troponin I, without new ischemic changes on electrocardiography, and who had no cardiovascular complications (dysrhythmias, acute myocardial infarction, or recurrent symptoms) during the 9-to-12-hour observation period were discharged from the unit. The main outcome was death from cardiovascular causes at 30 days.

Results

Three hundred forty-four patients with cocaine-associated chest pain were evaluated. Forty-two of these patients (12 percent) were directly admitted to the hospital. The study cohort comprised the remaining 302 patients. During the 30-day follow-up period, none of the patients died of a cardiovascular event (0 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 0.99), and only 4 of the 256 patients for whom detailed follow-up data were available had a nonfatal myocardial infarction (1.6 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 3.1). All four nonfatal myocardial infarctions occurred in patients who continued to use cocaine.

Conclusions

Patients with cocaine-associated chest pain who do not have evidence of ischemia or cardiovascular complications over a 9-to-12-hour period in a chest-pain observation unit have a very low risk of death or myocardial infarction during the 30 days after discharge.

### Complexities of cocaine users presenting to the emergency department with chest pain: interactions between depression symptoms, alcohol use, and race [^114whbNs]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chest pain is the most frequent cocaine-related medical event for which patients seek treatment in inner-city emergency departments (EDs). Given that depression increases risk for poor substance use and cardiac outcomes, knowledge of correlates of depressive symptoms among these out-of-treatment cocaine users is crucial to developing interventions for these inner-city populations that frequently present to the ED. A total of 219 individuals presenting to an inner-city ED with chest pain and recent cocaine use were divided into 2 groups based on scoring positive (42%) for moderate-to-severe depression on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The depression symptoms group reported a significantly greater number of standard drinks per drinking occasion (7.1 versus 4.6) and a greater number of heavy drinking days (9 versus 5). A significant 3-way interaction effect found males and non-white females reporting a greater number of heavy drinking days were more likely to be in the depression symptoms group, whereas white females with a greater number of heavy drinking days were more likely to be in the nondepression symptoms group. Depression is clearly a problem among not-in-treatment cocaine users presenting to an inner-city ED; heavy drinking in concert with cocaine use increases the risk for depression, with important interactions by race and gender.

Regarding specific circumstances for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to cocaine and methamphetamine users, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to do not administer β-blockers in patients with ACS with a recent history of cocaine or methamphetamine use demonstrating signs of acute intoxication because of the risk of potentiating coronary spasm.

### One-year medical outcomes and emergency department recidivism after emergency department observation for cocaine-associated chest pain [^115nDaHG]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Chest pain is the most common complaint among cocaine users who present to the emergency department (ED) seeking care, and many hospital resources are applied to stratify cocaine users in regard to future cardiac morbidity and mortality. Little is known about the longitudinal cardiac and noncardiac medical outcomes of cocaine users who have been stratified to an ED observation period after their ED visit. We examine 1-year cardiac outcomes in a low- to intermediate-risk sample of patients with cocaine-associated chest pain in an urban ED, as well as examine ED recidivism at 1 year for cardiac and noncardiac complaints.

Methods

Prospective consecutive cohort study of patients (18 to 60 years) who presented to an urban Level I ED with cocaine-associated chest pain and were risk stratified to low to intermediate cardiac risk. Exclusion criteria were ECG suggestive of acute myocardial infarction, increased serum cardiac markers, history of acute myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass graft, hemodynamic instability, or unstable angina. Baseline interviews using validated measures of health functioning and substance use were conducted during chest pain observation unit stay and at 3, 6, and 12 months. ED utilization during the study year was abstracted from the medical chart. Zero-inflated Poisson regression analyses were conducted to predict recurrent ED visits.

Results

Two hundred nineteen participants (73%) were enrolled, 65% returned to the ED post-index visit, and 23% returned for chest pain; of these, 66% had a positive cocaine urine screening result. No patient had an acute myocardial infarction within the 1-year follow-up period. Patients with continued cocaine use were more likely to have a recurrent ED visit (P < .001), but these repeated visits were most often related to musculoskeletal pain (21%) and injury (30%), rather than potential cardiac complaints.

Conclusion

Patients with cocaine-associated chest pain who have low to intermediate cardiac risk and complete a chest pain observation unit protocol have a less than 1% rate of myocardial infarction in the subsequent 12 months.

Regarding medical management for stimulant use disorder, more specifically with respect to management of acute coronary syndrome, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to do not administer β-blockers in patients with acute coronary syndrome with a recent history of cocaine or methamphetamine use demonstrating signs of acute intoxication because of the risk of potentiating coronary spasm.

### Cocaine-using patients with a normal or nondiagnostic electrocardiogram: single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging and outcome [^114VR4ev]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Few trials have examined the outcomes of patients who use cocaine with chest pain and who have a normal or nondiagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG) and the use of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI).

Hypothesis

We sought to compare the characteristics and overall outcomes in cocaine users vs non-cocaine users presenting to the emergency department with a normal/nondiagnostic ECG and to assess the value of rest MPI in both of these populations.

Methods

Patients with symptoms compatible with myocardial ischemia, suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and a normal/nondiagnostic ECG were enrolled in the Emergency Room Assessment of Sestamibi for Evaluation of Chest Pain (ERASE Chest Pain) trial, a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the impact of rest MPI on triage decisions. Cocaine users (n = 294) were compared to non-cocaine users (n = 2180). Cocaine users were younger than non-cocaine users, and 72% were male.

Results

Among the cocaine users, 2.4% had a myocardial infarction, 1.4% required percutaneous coronary intervention, and none of the patients underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Among cocaine users with a final diagnosis of not ACS, randomization of patients to rest SPECT MPI resulted in an appropriate reduction in hospital admissions in both the cocaine users (P = 0.011) and the non-cocaine users (P < 0.001), suggesting improved triage when MPI was used.

Conclusions

Cocaine users with a normal/nondiagnostic ECG are at low risk of cardiac events. Even though cocaine users are at low risk of cardiac events, SPECT MPI remains effective in the risk stratification and improves triage management decisions resulting in lower admission rates and more discharges to home.

Acute aortic syndrome — presentation and imaging: Acute aortic syndrome describes diseases involving disruptions in the aortic wall, including aortic dissection, intramural hematoma, and penetrating aortic ulcer, with an annual incidence of 2 to 4 cases/100000; prominent risk factors include hypertension, atherosclerosis, and connective tissue disease, and cocaine use may provoke dissection even without other risk factors. Acute onset of severe chest or back pain heralds acute aortic dissection in 80% to 90% of patients, and progression can produce end-organ hypoperfusion with potential tamponade, severe acute aortic regurgitation, or, rarely, STEMI; intramural hematomas differ by absence of an identifiable intimal flap but are typically evaluated and treated similarly. A high index of suspicion in appropriate patients, and a coordinated, multidisciplinary evaluation is needed to optimize outcomes; in stable patients, computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the diagnostic modality of choice and is both highly sensitive and specific, chest radiographs can show mediastinal widening but may be normal, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can show pericardial effusion or aortic regurgitation and sometimes a dissection flap, more complete imaging of the aortic arch requires transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or computed tomography (CT), and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is sensitive and specific but CT is usually more expeditious.

There is currently no guideline directed medical therapy for SCAD. However, there is expert consensus that since the pathophysiology and disease progression differ greatly, medical treatment of SCAD cannot be extrapolated from treatment of usual atherosclerotic coronary disease. The routine use of heparin and dual antiplatelet therapy may result in increased intramural bleeding and further complications in SCAD patients. The recommendation is to give single agent antiplatelet therapy instead, and continuation beyond 1 year should be made on a case‐by‐case basis, taking into account the bleeding risk and benefits of therapy. Dual antiplatelet therapy is indicated if SCAD patients had coronary stents implanted to prevent stent‐related thrombosis. Regarding anticoagulation, heparin may be used during revascularization with PCI if indicated. However, long‐term anticoagulation therapy is recommended only where there is a clear clinical indication such as left ventricular thrombus formation or atrial fibrillation. Statin therapy should not be routine in SCAD and should be initiated according to guideline‐based indications for primary prevention of atherosclerosis. Beta‐blockers for those with depressed left ventricular function, hypertension, or arrhythmias have been shown to be helpful. Lastly, antianginals have been shown to have a role in symptomatic treatment of chest pain syndromes post‐SCAD, but routine use is not required in asymptomatic patients. 1

Recurrent de novo SCAD has been reported in 10% of patients. A 2‐fold increase of recurrent SCAD is seen in those with hypertension. Secondary prevention with beta‐blocker should be considered. By reducing arterial shear stress, hypertension, and myocardial contractility beta‐blockers seem to play a pivotal role in protecting patients from further coronary dissection. Management of emotional and physical stressors through tailored exercise programs and psychosocial counseling also help. Illicit drug use of methamphetamine and cocaine should be addressed. Further pregnancy after a diagnosis of SCAD has usually been discouraged by the medical community, although this life changing advice has been based on few case reports and series. 10

Cardiac rehabilitation is fundamental in recovery. Patients reported less chest pain and improved quality of life scores in depression, anxiety and stress level at the end of a dedicated rehabilitation program. 24 There was also lower MACE rates in rehabilitation participants (4.3%) vs the nonparticipating group (26.2%). Long‐term prognosis is usually good for those who survive the initial episode, although the risk of recurrence has been reported to be up to 22%. 3 Pregnancy is generally discouraged in patients diagnosed with SCAD, and strict contraceptive advice should be given if the affected women are in the reproductive age group.

### Hospital admissions for chest pain associated with cocaine use in the United States [^1113nmCf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The outcomes related to chest pain associated with cocaine use and its burden on the healthcare system are not well studied.

Methods

Data were collected from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2001–2012). Subjects were identified by using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Primary outcome was a composite of mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac arrest.

Results

We identified 363,143 admissions for cocaine-induced chest pain. Mean age was 44.9 (± 21.1) years with male predominance. Left heart catheterizations were performed in 6.7%, whereas the frequency of acute myocardial infarction and percutaneous coronary interventions were 0.69% and 0.22%, respectively. The in-hospital mortality was 0.09%, and the primary outcome occurred in 1.19% of patients. Statistically significant predictors of primary outcome included female sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.16; confidence interval, 1.00–1.35; p = 0.046), age > 50 years (OR, 1.24, CI, 1.07–1.43; p = 0.004), history of heart failure (OR, 1.63, CI, 1.37–1.93; P < .001), supraventricular tachycardia (OR, 2.94, CI, 1.34–6.42; p = 0.007), endocarditis (OR, 3.5, CI, 1.50–8.18, P = 0.004), tobacco use (OR, 1.3, CI, 1.13–1.49; P < .001), dyslipidemia (OR, 1.5, CI, 1.29–1.77; P < .001), coronary artery disease (OR, 2.37, CI, 2.03–2.76; P < .001), and renal failure (OR, 1.27, CI, 1.08–1.50; p = 0.005). The total annual projected economic burden ranged from $155 to $226 million with a cumulative accruement of more than $2 billion over a decade.

Conclusion

Hospital admissions due to chest pain and concomitant cocaine use are associated with low rates of adverse outcomes. For the low-risk cohort in whom acute coronary syndrome has been ruled out, hospitalization may not be beneficial and may result in unnecessary cardiac procedures.

### A prospective, randomized, controlled trial of benzodiazepines and nitroglycerine or nitroglycerine alone in the treatment of cocaine-associated acute coronary syndromes [^114j1z7j]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of the present study was to compare the use of lorazepam plus nitroglycerine (NTG) versus NTG alone in the reduction of cocaine induced chest pain in the emergency department. The secondary objective of the study was to help determine the safety of lorazepam in the treatment of cocaine- associated chest pain. The study was a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial conducted at an university-affiliated urban emergency department (ED). All patients who presented with cocaine-associated chest pain were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included age greater than 45 years, documented coronary artery disease, chest pain of more than 72 hours duration, or pretreatment with nitroglycerin. Patients were given either sublingual nitroglycerine (SL NTG) (Group 1) or SL NTG plus 1 mg of lorazepam intravenously (Group 2) every 5 minutes for a total of 2 doses. Chest pain was recorded on an ordinal scale of 0 to 10 at baseline, and then at 5 minutes after each dose. Adverse reactions to medication were also recorded. Twenty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. The average age of these subjects was 34.1 years, and 67% were men. The NTG-only group consisted of 15 patients and the NTG-plus-lorazepam group consisted of 12 patients. Baseline mean chest-pain scores were 6.87 in Group 1 and 6.54 in Group 2, with no differences between groups. Five minutes after initial treatment, mean scores for the two groups were 5.2 and 3.9, respectively, with a difference in means of 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.8–3.8). Five minutes after the second treatment, the mean scores were 4.6 and 1.5, respectively, with a difference in means of 3.1 (95% CI 1.2–5). Kruskal-Wallis testing showed a significant difference in pain relief between the two study groups (P = 0.003), with greater pain relief noted at 5 and 10 minutes in the NTG-plus-lorazepam group (P = 0.02 and P = 0.005, respectively). All patients in the study were admitted to the hospital, but no patient in either group had an acute myocardial infarction or cardiac complications in the ED. No adverse side effects were noted for either group. The early use of lorazepam with NTG was more efficacious than NTG alone, and appears to be safe in relieving cocaine-associated chest pain.

### A prehospital acute coronary syndrome in a cocaine user: an unstable clinical situation [^111AGMUx]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2012). Low credibility.

Chest pain is a common reason why cocaine-addicted patients call the emergency department, and acute coronary syndromes are difficult to diagnose in these situations. A 30-year-old cocaine-user patient contacts the Emergency Medical Assistance Service with constrictive chest pain. A doctor is sent out to the patient at home. The initial ECG is normal. No other aetiology of chest pain is revealed, except nicotine and cocaine addictions. First, a coronary artery spasm is suggested, caused by the injection of cocaine. During the journey, the patient indicates that the chest pain has returned. A 12-lead ECG shows repolarisation abnormality in the form of a subepicardial ischaemia. Fibrinolysis is not prescribed in view of the patient's history and of the proximity of the interventional cardiology team. The coronary angiogram enables the diagnosis of myocardial bridging in the middle anterior interventricular artery, and no significant lesion of the coronary arteries is noted. A particular feature of prehospital management in France is that medical care can be given in the early stages by a physician who is called by the patient. This case report discusses the specific care requirements of which the emergency physician needs to be aware in the context of this unstable clinical situation due to the urgency associated with the difficulties of ECG diagnosis of ST-segment elevation in cocaine users.

### Characteristics and outcomes of young adults who present to the emergency department with chest pain [^115J1nfg]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Most studies of emergency department (ED) chest pain patients exclude patients < 30–40 years old. As a result, the clinical course of these patients is poorly described.

Objective

To study the clinical characteristics, hospital course, and 30-day outcomes of ED chest pain patients < 40 years old. The hypothesis was that patients < 40 years old without a cardiac history and with normal electro-cardiograms (ECGs) or no cardiac risk factors would be at a < 1% risk for acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) and 30-day adverse cardiovascular (CV) events.

Methods

This was a prospective cohort study of non-cocaine-using ED patients, 24–39 years old, who received an ECG for chest pain between July 9, 1999, and October 23, 2000. Structured data collection at presentation included demographics, chest pain description, history, laboratory, and ECG data. Hospital course was followed daily. Thirty-day follow-up was performed by telephone. The main outcomes were discharge diagnosis and 30-day adverse CV events [acute myocardial infarction (AMI), death, percutaneous intervention (PCI), or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)].

Results

A total of 487 patients presented 527 times and comprised the study group. Patients were most often 30–39 years old (71%), female (60%), and African-American (73%). Thirty-two percent were admitted. Five hundred seven of 527 patient visits (96%) had 30-day follow-up. Patients had the following cardiac risk factors: tobacco, 37%; hypertension, 22%; family history, 19%; diabetes mellitus, 6%; cholesterol, 6%; prior angina, 3%; known coronary artery disease, 3%; and prior AMI, 2%. Patients usually had unremarkable ECGs (61% normal, 98% nonischemic). Overall, 11 of 527 patients had adverse CV events (2.1%; 95% CI = 0.9% to 3.3%): 8 AMIs (1.5%), 4 deaths (0.8%), 5 PCIs (0.9%), and no CABG. Twenty-five patients had a final diagnosis of ACS (4.7%; 95% CI = 2.9% to 6.5%). The incidence of ACS in the 210 patients without a cardiac history and without cardiac risk factors was 0.5% (95% CI = 0% to 1.4%). At 30 days, none of these 210 patients had AMI, PCI, CABG, or death (0%, 95% CI = 0% to 1.4%). The incidence of ACS in the 312 patients with normal ECGs and a negative cardiac history was 0.3% (95% CI = 0% to 0.9%). At 30 days, there was no AMI, PCI, or CABG in these 312 patients, and one patient with metastatic cancer died (adverse CV event 0.3%, 95% CI = 0% to 0.9%).

Conclusions

Although young patients, as a whole, have a 4.7% risk of ACSs and a 2.1% risk of adverse CV events at 30 days, those without known cardiac disease or any cardiac risk factors had a < 1% risk of ACSs and were free from adverse CV events over 30 days. Likewise, young patients without a cardiac history and with a normal ECG had a < 1% risk of ACSs and adverse CV events at 30 days. It may be reasonable to expedite outpatient management and limit unnecessary admissions in these cohorts.

### Transient cocaine-induced chest pain: a case series [^114WBcHz]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Acute chest pain and myocardial infarction are frequent complications of cocaine use. Indeed, these represent 40% of emergency department visits associated with cocaine use and 2% to 7% of all patients attending the emergency department for chest pain. Nevertheless, the prevalence of past cocaine-associated chest pain has never been evaluated in an outpatient facility for addiction. Our objective was to assess lifetime episodes of cocaine-associated chest pain in current cocaine users in an outpatient facility.

Methods

Fifty consecutive, nonselected current cocaine users were retrospectively evaluated with a standardized interview and a medical assessment. The patients and the pain characteristics are described, and clinical and biological factors associated with experiencing cocaine-associated chest pain are studied with univariate and logistic regressions analyses.

Results

Twenty-six subjects (52%) reported a history of chest pain associated with cocaine use. This pain was frequently described as oppressive (28%) and located in the retrosternal area (61.5%). The mean (± SD) time between cocaine use and the occurrence of the pain was 8 (± 8) minutes and the mean duration was 22 (± 236) minutes. Subjects who reported cocaine-associated chest pain reported an average of 12 (± 7) distinct episodes. Patients describing chest pain could be predicted with one independent factor in our sample: age of onset of cocaine use (P = 0.042).

Conclusions

Transient cocaine-associated chest pains are frequent in current cocaine users attending specialized addiction facilities. Cardiological explorations and monitoring and risk-reduction interventions need to be provided to this specific population.

### The clinical impact of a false-positive urine cocaine screening result on a patient's pain management [^113LWzsZ]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The urine of a patient admitted for chest and epigastric pain tested positive for cocaine using an immunoassay-based drug screening method (positive/negative cutoff concentration 150ng/mL). Despite the patient's denial of recent cocaine use, this positive cocaine screening result in conjunction with a remote history of drug misuse impacted the patient's recommended pain therapy. Specifically, these factors prompted the clinical team to question the appropriateness of opioids and other potentially addictive therapeutics during the treatment of cancer pain from previously undetected advanced pancreatic carcinoma.

Objective

After pain management and clinical pathology consultation, it was decided that the positive cocaine screening result should be confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) testing.

Results

This more sensitive and specific analytical technique revealed that both cocaine and its primary metabolite benzoylecgonine were undetectable (i.e., less than the assay detection limit of 50ng/mL), thus indicating that the positive urine screening result was falsely positive. With this confirmation, the pain management service team was reassured in offering intrathecal pump (ITP) therapy for pain control. ITP implantation was well tolerated, and the patient eventually achieved excellent pain relief. However, ITP therapy most likely would not have been utilized without the GC-MS confirmation testing unless alternative options failed and extensive vigilant monitoring was initiated.

Conclusion

As exemplified in this case, confirmatory drug testing should be performed on specimens with unexpected immunoassay-based drug screening results. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a false-positive urine cocaine screening result and its impact on patient management.

### Young patients with chest pain: 1-year outcomes [^113mz17Q]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Prior studies found that young adult chest pain patients without known cardiac disease with either no cardiac risk factors or a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) are at low risk (< 1%) for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and 30-day cardiovascular events. Longer-term event rates in this subset of patients are unknown. We hypothesized that patients younger than 40 years without past cardiac history and a normal ECG are at less than 1% risk for 1-year adverse cardiovascular events.

Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study in an urban university emergency department evaluating patients younger than 40 years who received an ECG for evaluation of potential ACS. Cocaine users, cancer patients, and patients with a history of myocardial infarction or revascularization were excluded. Structured data collection at presentation included demographics, chest pain description, history, laboratory results, and ECG data. Hospital course was followed. Follow-up was obtained by telephone, record review, and social security death index search. Our main outcome was 1-year adverse cardiovascular events (death; acute myocardial infarction [AMI]; or revascularization-percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] or coronary artery bypass graft). Descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals were used.

Results

Of 3846 chest pain patients, 609 met criteria. Of those, 35.5% were admitted. Patients had a mean age of 34.8 years (SD, 3.8 years). They were most often female (57.6%) and black (69.5%). There were 7 patients (1.1%; 95% CI, 0.5%-2.4%) with adverse cardiovascular events over the year. Of the subset of 560 patients with a normal/nonspecific ECG, there were 2 deaths (0.4%), 3 AMI (0.5%), and 2 PCIs (0.4%) by 1 year for a composite adverse cardiovascular event rate of 6 (1.1%; 95% CI, 0.4%-2.3%). Of the subset of 269 patients with no cardiac risk factors and a normal/nonspecific ECG, there were no deaths, 1 AMI, and 1 PCI for a composite adverse cardiovascular event rate at 1 year of 0.3% (0.01%-2.1%). The addition of an initial cardiac marker to this group resulted in a cohort that was event-free at 1 year (95% CI, 0%-1.4%).

Conclusions

Patients younger than 40 years without a cardiac history who present to the ED with symptoms consistent with ACS but have either no risk factors or a normal or nonspecific ECG have a very low rate of adverse events during the subsequent year.

Regarding specific circumstances for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to cocaine and methamphetamine users, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to manage patients with NSTEMI and a recent history of cocaine or methamphetamine use in the same manner as patients without cocaine- or methamphetamine-related NSTEMI, except for patients with signs of acute intoxication (such as euphoria, tachycardia, and/or hypertension) and β-blocker use unless receiving coronary vasodilator therapy.

### Evaluation of a clinical decision rule for young adult patients with chest pain [^1176B3CC]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

The authors sought to validate a clinical decision rule that young adult (younger than 40 years) chest pain patients without known cardiac disease who had either no cardiac risk factors and/or a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) are at low risk (< 1%) for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and 30-day adverse cardiovascular (CV) events.

Methods

A prospective cohort study of patients 24–39 years old who received an ECG for chest pain from July 1999 to March 2002 were included. Cocaine users were excluded. Data collection was structured at presentation, hospital course was followed daily, and 30-day follow-up was obtained by telephone. The main outcome was 30-day adverse CV events (death, acute myocardial infarction, percutaneous intervention, and coronary artery bypass graft). Descriptive statistics were used.

Results

Of 4,492 visits for chest pain, 1,023 met criteria. Patients were most often female (61%) and African American (73%). Ninety-eight percent were available for 30-day follow-up. The overall risks of ACS and 30-day adverse CV events were 5.4% and 2.2%, respectively, in our entire cohort. For patients with no cardiac history and no cardiac risk factors, the risk of ACS and 30-day adverse CV events was 1.8%. The risk in patients with no cardiac history and a normal ECG was 1.3%. Patients with no cardiac history, no cardiac risk factors, and a normal ECG had a risk of 1.0%. A modified clinical decision rule found that in young adult patients without a known cardiac history, either no classic cardiac risk factors or a normal ECG, and initially normal cardiac marker studies, the risk of ACS was also extremely low (0.14%) and there were no adverse CV events at 30-day follow-up (95% confidence interval = 0.1% to 0.2%).

Conclusions

A modified clinical decision rule described a group of patients with a 0.14% risk of ACS that was free from 30-day adverse CV events.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^111Wph89]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Chest pain during stimulant intoxication — For patients experiencing chest pain during stimulant intoxication, clinicians should initiate treatment for the underlying intoxication with GABAergic agents (eg, benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, propofol) as long as there are no clinical contraindications (Moderate certainty, Conditional Recommendation). Alternative agents (eg, calcium channel blockers, vasodilators) are generally preferred for management of cardiac ischemia in patients experiencing stimulant intoxication; however, if beta blockers are used in patients with stimulant intoxication, clinicians should consider using a medication with concomitant alpha-1 antagonism (eg, carvedilol, labetalol), and if an unopposed beta blocker was used, clinicians should also consider providing a coronary vasodilator (eg, nitroglycerin, calcium channel blocker); for complex cases, consult with cardiology and/or medical toxicology (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation). While treating underlying stimulant intoxication in patients experiencing chest pain, clinicians should concomitantly evaluate for ACS and other causes of acute chest pain in stimulant intoxication, and chest pain that does not fully resolve as signs and symptoms of stimulant intoxication improve should be evaluated and treated following current standards of care (Moderate certainty, Strong Recommendation).

### Coronary computerized tomography angiography for rapid discharge of low-risk patients with cocaine-associated chest pain [^1162hXPX]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Most patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with cocaine-associated chest pain are admitted for at least 12 hours and receive a "rule out acute coronary syndrome" protocol, often with noninvasive testing prior to discharge. In patients without cocaine use, coronary computerized tomography angiography (CTA) has been shown to be useful for identifying a group of patients at low risk for cardiac events who can be safely discharged. It is unclear whether a coronary CTA strategy would be efficacious in cocaine-associated chest pain, as coronary vasospasm may account for some of the ischemia. We studied whether a negative coronary CTA in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain could identify a subset safe for discharge.

Methods

We prospectively evaluated the safety of coronary CTA for low-risk patients who presented to the ED with cocaineassociated chest pain (self-reported or positive urine test). Consecutive patients received either immediate coronary CTA in the ED (without serial markers) or underwent coronary CTA after a brief observation period with serial cardiac marker measurements. Patients with negative coronary CTA (maximal stenosis less than 50%) were discharged. The main outcome was 30-day cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction.

Results

A total of 59 patients with cocaine-associated chest pain were evaluated. Patients had a mean age of 45.6 ± 6.6 yrs and were 86% black, 66% male. Seventy-nine percent had a normal or nonspecific ECG and 85% had a TIMI score < 2. Twenty patients received coronary CTA immediately in the ED, 18 of whom were discharged following CTA (90%). Thirty-nine received coronary CTA after a brief observation period, with 37 discharged home following CTA (95%). Six patients had coronary stenosis ≥ 50%. During the 30-day follow-up period, no patients died of a cardiovascular event (0%; 95% CI, 0–6.1%) and no patient sustained a nonfatal myocardial infarction (0%; 95% CI, 0–6.1%).

Conclusions

Although cocaine-associated myocardial ischemia can result from coronary vasoconstriction, patients with cocaine associated chest pain, a non-ischemic ECG, and a TIMI risk score < 2 may be safely discharged from the ED after a negative coronary CTA with a low risk of 30-day adverse events.

### Acute left main coronary artery thrombosis due to cocaine use [^114m3Uii]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Our presentation is one of the rare cases reported in literature referring in AMI due to thrombosis of LM related to cocaine use, in a young patient with normal CA, successfully operated. Drug-abusers seem to have increased mortality and morbidity because of their usually coexistent several problems of general health. Furthermore, a majority of patients that suffer ST continue cocaine and are noncompliant with medical therapy. Improved handling techniques and postoperative long term dual antiplatelet therapy additionally to special consultation services could reduce the incidence of this terrible event. The lack of specific guidelines about treatment of thrombus formation in CA, especially in LM, a catastrophic consequence of cocaine use, leads to a unique and individualized approach to these patients. The small number of reported cases prevents the development of an evidence-based management, but due to high probability of post PCI ST, as mentioned before, we strongly recommend that all these patients should be treated surgically.

### Cocaine and the heart [^112J1RBc]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The use of cocaine may be associated with either acute or chronic toxicity, and approximately 5% to 10% of emergency department visits in the United States are believed to be secondary to cocaine usage. Chest pain is the most common cocaine-related medical problem, leading to the evaluation of approximately 64,000 patients annually for possible myocardial infarction, of which approximately 57% are admitted to the hospital, resulting in an annual cost greater than $83 million. There is a plethora of cocaine-related cardiovascular complications, including acute myocardial ischemia and infarction, arrhythmias, sudden death, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, hypertension, aortic ruptures, and endocarditis. There is no evidence to suggest that preexisting vascular disease is a prerequisite for the development of a cocaine-related cardiovascular event, although it may be a potentiating factor, as may be nicotine and alcohol.

### Acute left main coronary artery thrombosis due to cocaine use [^1151n1ya]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

It is common knowledge that cocaine has been linked to the development of various acute and chronic cardiovascular complications including acute coronary syndromes. We present a young, male patient, drug abuser who underwent CABG due to anterolateral myocardial infarction. Our presentation is one of the very rare cases reported in literature regarding acute thrombosis of left main coronary artery related to cocaine use, in a patient with normal coronary arteries, successfully operated. Drug-abusers seem to have increased mortality and morbidity after surgery and high possibility for stent thrombosis after percutaneous coronary interventions, because of their usually terrible medical compliance and coexistent several problems of general health. There are no specific guidelines about treatment of thrombus formation in coronary arteries, as a consequence of cocaine use. So, any decision making concerning the final treatment of these patient is a unique and individualized approach. We strongly recommend that all these patients should be treated surgically, especially patients with thrombus into the left main artery.

### Acute myocardial infarction: etiologies and mimickers in young patients [^112HjJid]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Drug Use

An important risk factor for AMI in young adults is illicit drug abuse, which is associated with a poor prognosis. For this reason, a detailed history of illicit drug use is a necessary part of assessment of a young individual with an AMI. The most implicated substances are stimulants such as cocaine, amphetamines, and 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy). Mechanisms that lead to cardiac complications with these drugs typically involve vessel damage, prothrombotic effects and direct myocardial injury. In contrast, cocaine may increase myocardial oxygen demand because of increase in blood pressure and heart rate, while also promoting platelet activationor coronary vasospasm, resulting in acute myocardial ischemia. The exact pathophysiological mechanism of AMI following amphetamine use is not well understood but likely because of a combination of coronary vasospasm, intracoronary thrombus formation, and increased myocardial oxygen demand. Management of AMI secondary to amphetamine and cocaine abuse is not clearly defined but includes calcium channel blockers for treatment of suspected coronary vasospasm or thrombolytics/anticoagulants for coronary thrombi. Selective beta‐1 adrenergic receptor blockade is generally avoided until the absence of illicit drug use is confirmed as it may exacerbate coronary vasospasm via unopposed alpha adrenergic agonism. The incidence of cocaine‐induced AMI has been reported as high as 25% among AMI patients aged 18 to 45 years, particularly in those with other cardiac risk factors. When there is clear thrombus, plaque disruption, or occlusive disease the treatment of ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction in patients with recent substance use within 6 hours of onset of chest pain follows standard protocol with immediate PCI or thrombolytic therapy if PCI is not available.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^112hBhzx]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

ASAM/AAAP stimulant intoxication and withdrawal — patients with stimulant intoxication and withdrawal should be managed in a setting that provides the intensity of care necessary to address the anticipated severity of their intoxication or withdrawal syndrome, and the CGC recommended the use of a multidimensional assessment — such as that described in The ASAM Criteria — to determine the appropriate clinical setting for the management of a given patient's stimulant intoxication or withdrawal. Individuals presenting with stimulant intoxication or withdrawal may be treated in lower acuity clinical settings if emergency interventions are not indicated, and clinical features that typically indicate the need for emergency medical treatment include high fever, seizure, chest pain, psychosis, and suicidality. Some patients should be managed in higher acuity settings because they require close monitoring in a setting that has the capacity to manage evolving clinical presentations; serious co-occurring medical or psychiatric health concerns can be exacerbated by stimulant intoxication or withdrawal, and co-intoxication with opioids, alcohol, or other sedatives can alter both the time course and severity of intoxication and cause effects in unexpected ways. Individuals who have concealed stimulants by consuming or inserting packages in a body cavity (ie, body stuffing or packing) should be observed in an acute care setting with ready access to emergency treatment, as it is difficult to know the actual amount of substance consumed, quality of the packaging, and risk of exposure. An appropriate treatment setting allows for assessment of acute issues and complications, screening for acute intoxication potential, monitoring of the intoxication syndrome, and administration of appropriate clinical interventions, and if any of these are not possible in the current setting due to patient agitation or limitations in staff capability or resources, the patient should be transferred to a more intensive level of care with the appropriate capabilities; however, transfers involve some risk, as patients may choose to leave treatment rather than initiate and engage in treatment elsewhere, and the use of health information technologies and patient navigators may help facilitate effective transfers by bridging care between settings.

### Epidemiology, clinical features and management of patients presenting to European emergency departments with acute cocaine toxicity: comparison between powder cocaine and crack cocaine cases [^1164iF5r]. Clinical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective: To analyse the epidemiology, clinical picture and emergency department (ED) management of a large series of patients who presented to European EDs after cocaine consumption, comparing data from powder (C 1 group) and crack (C 2 group) consumers. Methods: Between October 2013 and December 2016, the Euro-DEN Plus Registry recorded 17,371 consecutive acute recreational drug toxicity presentations to 22 EDs in 14 European countries. Epidemiological and demographic data, co-ingestion of alcohol and other drugs, clinical features, ED management and outcome (death) were analysed for cocaine cases, and comparison of clinical picture in C 1 and C 2 patients were performed adjusting for alcohol and other drug co-ingestion. Results: We included 3002 cases (C 1: 2600; C 2: 376; mixed consumption: 26): mean age 32(9) years, 23% female. The proportion of presentations involving cocaine varied significantly between countries (> 30% in Malta, Spain, France, Denmark) and only centres in France, United Kingdom, Poland, Ireland and Malta recorded crack-related cases. Cocaine was frequently used with ethanol (74.3%, C 1 > C 2) and other drugs (56.8%, C 2 > C 1), the most frequent amphetamine (19.4%, C 1 > C 2) and opioids (18.9%, C 2 > C 1). C 2 patients were more likely to have clinically significant episodes of hypotension (adjusted OR = 2.35; 95%CI = 1.42–3.89), and bradypnea (1.81; 1.03–3.16) and systolic blood pressure > 180mmHg on ED arrival (2.59; 1.28–5.25); while less likely anxiety (0.51; 0.38–0.70), chest pain (0.47; 0.31–0.70), palpitations (0.57; 0.38–0.84), vomiting (0.54; 0.32–0.90), and tachycardia on ED arrival (0.52; 0.39–0.67). Sedative drugs were given in 29.3%. The median length of hospital stay was 4:02h, 22.1% patients were hospitalized, and 0.4% (n = 12) died. Conclusion: Cocaine is commonly involved in European ED presentations with acute recreational drug toxicity, but there is variation across Europe not just in the involvement of cocaine but in the proportion related to powder versus crack. Some differences in clinical picture and ED management exist between powder cocaine and crack consumers.

### Death temporally related to the use of a beta adrenergic receptor antagonist in cocaine associated myocardial infarction [^112dGA8F]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although it is commonly stated that the use of beta adrenergic receptor antagonists is contraindicated in patients with cocaine toxicity, actual clinical evidence of harm is lacking. This case helps to highlight the risks of beta adrenergic receptor antagonists in patients with chest pain associated with cocaine use.

Case Report

A 54-year-old man was brought to the emergency department (ED) complaining of chest pain after using approximately 1 gram of intranasal cocaine. Aspirin and nitroglycerin spray relieved his pain. Although he remained pain free, tachycardia persisted despite 15 mg of diazepam intravenously. Nearly two hours after presentation, a total of 5 mg of metoprolol was given for persistent tachycardia (115/minute) and an elevated troponin. Shortly thereafter, the patient complained of crushing substernal chest pain, developed pulseless electrical activity, and could not be resuscitated.

Discussion

The administration of beta adrenergic receptor antagonists exacerbates cocaine-induced lethality in animals. In humans given smaller doses of cocaine, beta adrenergic receptor antagonists exacerbate coronary vasoconstriction. Both effects are presumed to occur through unopposed alpha adrenergic receptor agonism. Despite these data, actual cases describing adverse effects in cocaine users given beta adrenergic receptor antagonists are uncommon. This case supports the potential lethality of a cocaine-beta adrenergic receptor antagonist interaction.

### A pilot study to assess the safety of dobutamine stress echocardiography in the emergency department evaluation of cocaine-associated chest pain [^117UPDxv]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Chest pain in the setting of cocaine use poses a diagnostic dilemma. Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is a widely available and sensitive test for evaluating cardiac ischemia. Because of the theoretical concern regarding administration of dobutamine in the setting of cocaine use, we conducted a pilot study to assess the safety of DSE in emergency department patients with cocaine-associated chest pain.

Methods

A prospective case series was conducted in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit in the ED of an urban tertiary-care teaching hospital. Patients were eligible for DSE if they had used cocaine within 24 hours preceding the onset of chest pain and had a normal ECG and tropinin I level. Patients exhibiting signs of continuing cocaine toxicity were excluded from the study. All patients were admitted to the hospital for serial testing after the DSE testing in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit.

Results

Twenty-four patients were enrolled. Two patients had inadequate resting images, one DSE was terminated because of inferior hypokinesis, another DSE was terminated because of a rate-related atrial conduction deficit, and 1 patient did not reach the target heart rate. Thus, 19 patients completed a DSE and reached their target heart rates. None of the patients experienced signs of exaggerated adrenergic response, which was defined as a systolic blood pressure of greater than 200 mm Hg or the occurrence of tachydysrhythmias (excluding sinus tachycardia). Further suggesting lack of exaggerated adrenergic response, 13 (65%) of 20 patients required supplemental atropine to reach their target heart rates.

Conclusion

No exaggerated adrenergic response was detected when dobutamine was administered to patients with cocaine-related chest pain.

### Phentolamine therapy for cocaine-association acute coronary syndrome (CAACS) [^115QoxCv]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

The emergency department (ED) evaluation of cocaine-associated acute coronary syndrome (CAACS) is often a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.

Case Report

We are reporting on the treatment of a patient with cocaine-associated acute coronary syndrome (CAACS) who did not benefit from standard therapy, but who eventually responded positively to phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist.

Discussion

This report should encourage physicians to add phentolamine to their pharmacotherapeutic armamentarium in the treatment of CAACS.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^111DVS1a]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — stimulant poisoning/overdose key considerations emphasize that recognition and treatment of hyperthermia (including sedatives to decrease heat production from muscular activity) is essential as many deaths are attributable to hyperthermia. If law enforcement has placed the patient in handcuffs, this patient needs ongoing physical security for safe transport. Have law enforcement in back of ambulance for the handcuffed patient or make sure proper non-handcuff physical management devices are in place before law enforcement leaves and ambulance departs from scene. If patient has signs and symptoms of ACS, consider giving nitroglycerin sublingual (SL) q 3–5 minutes if SBP greater than 100 mmHg and until pain resolves (if range not desired, use q 3 minutes). Vasospasm is often the problem in this case as opposed to a fixed coronary artery lesion, and consider administration of benzodiazepines as if to treat anxiety. Maintaining IV access, cardiac monitor, and SpO2/EtCO2 monitors are key to being able to catch and intervene decompensations in a timely manner. If agitated, consider restraining the patient to facilitate patient assessment and lessen likelihood of vascular access or monitor displacements. Cocaine has sodium channel blocking effects and can cause significant cardiac conduction abnormalities with a widened QRS. Treatment is with sodium bicarbonate similar to a tricyclic antidepressant. Check a 12-lead EKG to assess for these complications.

The study population was 102,952 patients enrolled in the American College of Cardiology ACTION Registry-GWTG from July 2008 to March 31, 2010 from 460 sites across the United States. Cocaine exposure was defined as self-reported cocaine use within the last 72 hours or a positive urine test for cocaine. Demographics and medical history, presenting characteristics, treatments, and in-hospital outcomes were reported on a standard case record form. A total of 924 patients (0.9%) were cocaine positive. Compared with cocaine-negative patients, cocaine-positive patients were younger and predominantly men with fewer cardiovascular risk factors. There was a higher percentage of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (46.3% vs 39.7%) and cardiogenic shock at presentation in the cocaine-positive group, but the percentage of multivessel coronary artery disease was lower (53.3% vs 64.5%). Beta blockers within 24 hours (85.8% vs 90.1%, p < 0.0001) and drug-eluting stents (40.1% vs 68.8%, p < 0.0001 in patients with non-STEMI; 27.6% vs 54.6%, p < 0.0001 in patients with STEMI) were used less commonly in cocaine-positive patients. Multivariable-adjusted in-hospital mortality was similar between cocaine-positive and cocaine-negative patients (adjusted odds ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.69 to 1.44, p value = 0.98). In conclusion cocaine-positive patients with acute coronary syndrome are younger with fewer risk factors, multivessel coronary artery disease and lower drug-eluting stent and β-blocker usage. Cocaine use was not associated with in-hospital mortality.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) — analgesics: Patients presenting with known or suspected ACS often experience chest pain or other uncomfortable symptoms, and rapid and effective pain relief remains an important treatment goal to prevent sympathetic activation and adverse clinical sequelae. Analgesic therapies may provide symptomatic relief, but they have not been shown to improve clinical outcomes in patients with ACS. Nitrates and opiate medications remain effective treatment options for management of pain in ACS but should be thoughtfully utilized to prevent potential harm, and rapid coronary revascularization should be pursued for patients with ongoing ischemic symptoms that are not relieved with nitrates.

### Cocaine-induced very late stent thrombosis [^114QZCd9]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Cocaine misuse is a known cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Management of these patients has always been a challenge due to medication compliance and eventual risk of stent thrombosis. However, even cocaine misusers who are compliant with dual antiplatelet therapy have been reported to have stent thrombosis. All cases of cocaine-induced stent thrombosis reported in the literature have occurred within first year of stent placement (acute, subacute or late). We report a first case of very late stent thrombosis in a 54-year-old active cocaine misuser who presented with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, which was successfully managed with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. A review of all the reported cases of cocaine-induced stent thrombosis is also discussed. Given the high mortality associated with stent thrombosis, treatment option for cocaine misusers presenting with ACS should be conservative when possible. If percutaneous coronary intervention is needed, bare metal stent should be preferred.

Regarding medical management for stimulant use disorder, more specifically with respect to management of chest pain, AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend to prefer alternative agents, such as CCBs or vasodilators, for the management of cardiac ischemia in patients with stimulant intoxication. Consider using a β-blocker with concomitant α-1 antagonism, such as carvedilol or labetalol. Consider administering a coronary vasodilator, such as nitroglycerin or a CCB, if an unopposed β-blocker was used in a patient who is or was recently stimulant intoxicated.

### Comparative evaluation of the ability to detect major cardiac events with the modified cocaine history, electrocardiogram, age, risk factors and troponin (HEART) score, HEART pathway and original HEART score in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain presenting at the emergency department [^114ZCth7]. Clinical Toxicology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This study primarily aimed to assess the ability to detect major cardiac events using the history, electrocardiogram, age, risk factors and troponin (HEART) pathway, modified cocaine HEART score, and HEART score among patients with cocaine-associated chest pain.

Methods

This single-centre retrospective study included consecutive patients with cocaine-associated chest pain admitted between January 2016 and December 2022 who were age and sex-matched in a 1:2 ratio to patients with chest pain not associated with cocaine use. The primary outcome was the percentage of major adverse cardiovascular events within 30days.

Results

In total, 1,412 patients were included, with 1,653 presentations, of whom 551 presented with cocaine-associated chest pain and were ≥ 18 years old. Most presentations involved male patients (84%). Major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 139 presentations: 50 (9.1%) among patients with cocaine-associated chest pain and 89 (8.1%) among patients with non-cocaine-associated chest pain. The number of low-risk presentations of cocaine-associated chest pain patients was 409 (74.2%), 345 (62.6%) and 394 (71.5%) according to the HEART score, modified cocaine HEART score and HEART pathway, respectively. The HEART pathway had the lowest percentage of observed major adverse cardiac events in low-risk patients (0%; 95% CI: 0–0.9%), followed by the modified cocaine HEART score (0.3%; 95% CI: 0.007–1.6%) and the HEART score (0.7%; 95% CI: 0.2–2.1%). Sensitivity, negative predictive value, and area under the curves were very similar between the three scores.

Discussion

The occurrence of missed major adverse cardiovascular events in low-risk patients was below 0.7% (95% CI: 0.2%-2.1%) in all three risk stratification scores. The HEART pathway was the safest risk stratification tool with a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100%. Nevertheless the differences with the other risk stratification scores were non-significant.

Conclusions

All three risk stratification scores performed well in a low-risk population with cocaine-associated chest pain, with a percentage of 0.7% of patients with a missed major adverse cardiovascular event.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^11722fHQ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Beta blocker use in cocaine intoxication — risk context and consultation: Historically, beta blockers have been avoided when treating cocaine intoxication due to case reports theorizing risks associated with unopposed alpha stimulation, which can result in an acute increase in blood pressure and/or coronary artery vasoconstriction following beta blocker administration. Evidence suggests that this risk is lower than hypothesized, and a systematic review and meta-analysis found beta blockers were not associated with adverse events — including myocardial infarction (MI), myocardial necrosis, or death — during hospitalization and long-term follow-up; however, this issue remains an area of controversy in the field and for complex cases, consult with cardiology and/or medical toxicology.

### Myeloperoxidase and C-reactive protein in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain [^1134RJvc]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are markers of inflammation and elevated levels have been found in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) unrelated to cocaine. We evaluated the utility of MPO and CRP for diagnosis of ACS and the prediction of 30-day adverse cardiovascular events in patients with cocaine-related chest pain.

Methods

This is a secondary analysis from a prospective cohort study of ED patients who received evaluation for ACS. Structured data collection at presentation included demographics, chest pain history, laboratory results, and electrocardiographic data. Our primary outcome was diagnosis of ACS at index visit and 30-day adverse events. As a secondary analysis, we provide data on a matched cohort without cocaine use.

Results

Baseline data and CRP were available for 95 cocaine users; 82 had MPO data also. Patients had a mean age of 46.6 (SD 8.1) years, 90% were black, and 62% were male. Acute coronary syndrome occurred in 7% of cocaine users. With respect to diagnosis of ACS, the area under the curve was poor for both MPO (0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.40–0.91) and CRP (0.63; 95% CI: 0.39–0.88). Similar results were found for 30-day events. With respect to prognosis of 30-day adverse cardiovascular events, the area under the curve was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.45–0.91) for MPO and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.45–0.90) for CRP. Similar results were found for 30-day events. In the matched cohort of patients who were not cocaine users, performance of MPO (n = 66) and CRP (n = 86) was also poor.

Conclusions

Myeloperoxidase and CRP are not useful for diagnosis or prognosis of patients with cocaine-associated chest pain.

### Multisite validation of a strategy to identify very low risk emergency department patients without troponin [^115VrAR7]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

While this study supports forgoing routine troponin measures in very low risk patients, there are caveats that clinicians should be aware of. Having a HEAR score ≤ 1 had an NPV of 99.3% for 30-day MACE. However, it is important to note that the lower bound of the 95% CI was 98.7%, which is below the accepted ≥ 99% NPV safety threshold. While performance at 30 days is the currently accepted safety metric for risk stratification pathways, it is noteworthy that a HEAR score ≤ 1 had both an NPV point estimate and lower bound of the 95% CI above 99% for index MI. Given the low event rate for 30-day MACE, it is likely that a massive, multi-health system chest pain cohort will be required to definitively determine if troponin is needed among very low risk patients. However, our team is establishing a large multi-health system chest pain registry, which may be able to address this question in the future.

Despite this limitation, based on our detailed further review of individual patients with missed events, we believe that our test characteristics likely underestimate the true safety of this approach. Most of the missed MACE events were due to the treating clinician failing to recognize known cardiovascular disease risk factors or misinterpreting a clearly ischemic ECG. Furthermore, clinicians should exercise their best judgment when treating unique patient populations, such as the postpartum patient who had a spontaneous coronary artery dissection. In addition, our previous analysis of very low risk patients and troponin testing also identified a missed event in a patient with recent cocaine use. Therefore, clinicians should be cautious before generalizing these findings to special patient populations, such as pregnant patients and those with recent sympathomimetic use. Ultimately, no risk score is perfect, and expert clinical judgment must be used when considering a patient's risk of ACS.

Women with chest pain — Most patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain are women, particularly among those ≥ 65 years of age, and women are less likely to have timely and appropriate care. Women may present with accompanying symptoms (eg, nausea, fatigue, and shortness of breath) more often than men, yet chest pain remains the predominant symptom among those ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), occurring with a frequency equal to men. Traditional risk score tools and physician assessments often underestimate risk in women and misclassify them as having nonischemic chest pain. In the VIRGO (Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients) study, men and women ≤ 55 years of age were equally likely to present with chest pain, and women were more likely to report ≥ 3 associated symptoms than men.

### Treatment of cocaine cardiovascular toxicity: a systematic review [^113H24q9]. Clinical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cocaine abuse is a major worldwide health problem. Patients with acute cocaine toxicity presenting to the emergency department may require urgent treatment for tachycardia, dysrhythmia, hypertension, and coronary vasospasm, leading to pathological sequelae such as acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and death.

Objective

The objective of this study is to review the current evidence for pharmacological treatment of cardiovascular toxicity resulting from cocaine abuse.

Methods

MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), OpenGrey, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to November 2015. Articles on pharmacological treatment involving human subjects and cocaine were selected and reviewed. Evidence was graded using Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine guidelines. Treatment recommendations were compared to current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines. Special attention was given to adverse drug events or treatment failure. The search resulted in 2376 articles with 120 eligible involving 2358 human subjects. Benzodiazepines and other GABA-active agents: There were five high-quality (CEBM Level I/II) studies, three retrospective (Level III), and 25 case series/reports (Level IV/V) supporting the use of benzodiazepines and other GABA-active agents in 234 subjects with eight treatment failures. Benzodiazepines may not always effectively mitigate tachycardia, hypertension, and vasospasm from cocaine toxicity. Calcium channel blockers: There were seven Level I/II, one Level III, and seven Level IV/V studies involving 107 subjects and one treatment failure. Calcium channel blockers may decrease hypertension and coronary vasospasm, but not necessarily tachycardia. Nitric oxide-mediated vasodilators: There were six Level I/II, one Level III, and 25 Level IV/V studies conducted in 246 subjects with 11 treatment failures and two adverse drug events. Nitroglycerin may lead to severe hypotension and reflex tachycardia. Alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drugs: There were two Level I studies and three case reports. Alpha-1 blockers may improve hypertension and vasospasm, but not tachycardia, although evidence is limited. Alpha-2-adrenoceptor agonists: There were two high-quality studies and one case report detailing the successful use of dexmedetomidine. Beta-blockers and β/α-blockers: There were nine Level I/II, seven Level III, and 34 Level IV/V studies of β-blockers, with 1744 subjects, seven adverse drug events, and three treatment failures. No adverse events were reported for use of combined β/α-blockers such as labetalol and carvedilol, which were effective in attenuating both hypertension and tachycardia. Antipsychotics: Seven Level I/II studies, three Level III studies, and seven Level IV/V case series and reports involving 168 subjects have been published. Antipsychotics may improve agitation and psychosis, but with inconsistent reduction in tachycardia and hypertension and risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects. Other agents: There was only one high level study of morphine, which reversed cocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction but increased heart rate. Other agents reviewed included lidocaine, sodium bicarbonate, amiodarone, procainamide, propofol, intravenous lipid emulsion, propofol, and ketamine.

Conclusions

High-quality evidence for pharmacological treatment of cocaine cardiovascular toxicity is limited but can guide acute management of associated tachycardia, dysrhythmia, hypertension, and coronary vasospasm. Future randomized prospective trials are needed to evaluate new agents and further define optimal treatment of cocaine-toxic patients.

Patient-centric considerations — emergency medical services (EMS) activation state that in patients with acute chest pain, it is recommended that 9–1–1 be activated by patients or bystanders to initiate transport to the closest emergency department (ED) by EMS. To ensure the timely delivery of appropriate care, especially reperfusion therapy, it is strongly recommended that patients with acute chest pain be transported to the ED by trained EMS personnel; EMS transportation is associated with substantial reductions in ischemic time and treatment delays, and 1 in 300 patients with chest pain transported to the ED by private vehicle suffers a cardiac arrest en route.

### Percutaneous interventions in patients with cocaine-associated myocardial infarction: a case series and review [^116dHQzS]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2002). Low credibility.

Cocaine-associated myocardial infarction (CAMI) is a well-reported entity. Most previous reports on CAMI have been limited to conservative care utilizing benzodiazepines, aspirin, nitroglycerin, calcium channel blockers, and thrombolytics. Current guidelines on CAMI advocate immediate use of angiography and angioplasty if available rather than routine administration of thrombolytics. However, based on literature search from 1966 to 2001 (using keywords "cocaine", "myocardial infarction", and "angioplasty"), there have been only two case reports of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with cocaine-associated myocardial infarction. Both were notable for complications either during or immediately after the procedure. We report a series of 10 patients with cocaine-associated myocardial infarction who were treated with percutaneous interventions, which included angioplasty, stenting, and AngioJet mechanical extraction of thrombus. Despite the different arteriopathic process involved, our findings suggest that PCI can be performed safely and with a high degree of procedural success in patients with CAMI.

### Screening electrocardiograms in cocaine-positive chest pain-free psychiatric patients requiring medical screening [^111XRmbb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The current practice at a large urban academic emergency department (ED) is to obtain screening electrocardiograms (ECGs) as part of the medical screening on all psychiatric patients who test positive for cocaine.

Objective

We sought to examine the impact of an ECG in the medical screening of chest pain-free psychiatric patients who test positive for cocaine.

Methods

An institutional review board-approved retrospective chart review from January 2014 to December 2015 was performed on charts of adult ED patients requiring medical screening before transfer to a psychiatric facility. Patients who tested positive for cocaine on urine drug screens were included in this study. Patients with chest pain or those who did not have an ECG recorded were excluded. Outcomes evaluated included disposition and subsequent cardiac work-up.

Results

One thousand nine hundred sixty-eight ED patients were identified who tested positive for cocaine on a urine toxicology screen, and 853 met the inclusion criteria. ECGs were normal in 812 patients (95% [95% confidence interval 93–96%]) and abnormal in 41 patients (5% [95% confidence interval 4–7%]). Of 41 patients with abnormal ECGs, 4 were admitted for cardiac work-up. Two patients had positive troponin values in the ED, 2 had cardiology consultations, and 3 had further cardiac stress testing, all of which were negative or nondiagnostic. No cardiac catheterizations were performed.

Conclusions

Most ED patients with recent cocaine use but without chest pain have a normal ECG. Of the minority with an abnormal ECG, no cases of acute myocardial ischemia or infarction were identified.

### Cocaine-induced pseudo-wellens' syndrome: a wellens' phenocopy [^113YMFNk]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Wellens' syndrome represents critical occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. Electrocardiographic changes similar to Wellens' wave are not exceptional to acute coronary occlusion and can also be seen in cardiac and non-cardiac conditions, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, persistent juvenile T wave, bundle branch blocks, cerebral haemorrhage, pulmonary oedema, pulmonary embolism, pheochromocytoma, Takotsubo syndrome, digitalis and cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm. Cocaine-induced pseudo-Wellens' syndrome should be considered as one of the differentials, since cocaine is used frequently by young adults and can cause left anterior descending coronary vasospasm mimicking Wellens' syndrome. Initiation of the beta-blocking agent in pseudo-Wellens' syndrome as a part of acute coronary syndrome management can be disastrous. We illustrated a case of cocaine-induced pseudo-Wellens' syndrome presented with typical chest pain associated with Wellenoid ECG.

### Assessment of cocaine use in patients with chest pain syndromes… [^112hCTtZ]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

The evidence that cocaine use may result in myocardial ischemia, along with the recognition that the pharmacologic treatment and disposition of patients with myocardial ischemia14, 18, 40–43 may differ depending on whether the patient has recently used cocaine, has led to recommendations by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research44 and the American College of Emergency Physicians45 that patients with chest pain syndromes be questioned about recent cocaine use. We selected this patient cohort because these patients are more likely to sustain a myocardial infarction and because sicker patients would be more likely to have their treatment altered by knowledge of recent cocaine use. In phase 1, a total of 133 patients presented to the ED with a chief complaint of chest pain during the study period. Four patients did not have medical records available for review. The remaining 129 patients made up the study group. The mean age of the patients was 52. 9 ± 16.

6 years; 114 patients were white and 74 were male. Ninety-four patients were admitted. Seventeen patients sustained an acute myocardial infarction during this visit. The marked increase in recreational cocaine use in the past decade, combined with the recognition that cocaine can induce myocardial ischemia26, 27 and infarction, 12–18, 43, 50, 55 has fundamentally altered the treatment of patients with chest pain. Patients who have myocardial ischemia secondary to cocaine use are treated differently from patients who have myocardial ischemia unrelated to cocaine use. Recommendations for the treatment of patients with cocaine-associated myocardial ischemia include early use of benzodiazepines, 42, 43, 55 avoidance of β-antagonists, 16, 18, 42, 43 and more cautious use of thrombolytic agents40, 48 and lidocaine.

41 In patients with cocaine-associated chest pain, electrocardiograms, clinical history, and laboratory markers of myocardial infarction appear to be less specific for acute infarction. 14, 18, 46, 47, 56–58. Both the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research44 and the American College of Emergency Physicians45 list cocaine as an important historical item to be assessed in patients with chest pain and potential myocardial ischemia. 44, 45 One 4-center study found that ED physicians significantly underestimated the prevalence of cocaine use at their own institutions. 59 In that study, physicians estimated that 2% to 10% of ED patients with chest pain had recently used cocaine.

### Β-blockers for chest pain associated with recent cocaine use… [^111Se8kD]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Of 331 patients with chest pain in the setting of recent cocaine use, 151 received a β-blocker in the emergency department. There were no meaningful differences in electrocardiographic changes, troponin levels, length of stay, use of vasopressor agents, intubation, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, or death between those who did and did not receive a β-blocker. Over a median follow-up of 972 days, after adjusting for potential confounders, patients discharged on a β-blocker regimen exhibited a significant reduction in cardiovascular death. Previous studies suggest that β-blockers may exacerbate coronary vasospasm and the toxic effects of cocaine by creating "unopposed" α-adrenergic stimulation. 5, 6 Recommendations against β-blockers in the setting of cocaine-associated chest pain are common3, 7 and have been introduced into recent cardiology guidelines.

A recent study found a decreased incidence of MI among cocaine users given β-blockers in the emergency department. 16 However, only a small proportion of these patients were admitted with chest pain, and long-term mortality was not assessed. Therefore, to test the hypothesis that β-blockers are safe when administered to patients with chest pain and recent cocaine use, we studied short-term outcomes and long-term mortality in a cohort of patients with chest pain with positive urine toxicologic test results for cocaine, who did and did not receive β-blockers. This finding persisted after restricting the analysis to those who received β-blockers within the first 6 hours of presentation. In addition, patients with cocaine-associated chest pain discharged on a β-blocker regimen exhibited a nonsignificant point estimate in favor of decreased overall mortality, and, after adjustment for potential confounders, exhibited a statistically significant 70% reduction in cardiovascular mortality.

Finally, we were unable to assess interim behaviors and treatments after discharge and relied only on data obtained from the index hospitalization and the National Death Index to determine long-term mortality. Only a prospective randomized trial can definitely address the majority of these limitations. In conclusion, administration of β-blockers to patients with cocaine-associated chest pain appears to be safe and may even be beneficial. Our patients with cocaine-associated chest pain exhibited a high mortality rate, and outpatient β-blockers may help protect against cardiovascular death.

### Pain in the chest in a user of cocaine… [^113GWnvP]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

History A 21-year-old man presented with pleuritic substernal chest pain of one hour's duration. The pain was exacerbated in a supine position and did not radiate. He denied fever, cough, vomiting, or palpitations. No history of blunt or penetrating trauma was obtained. Further questioning revealed that he was a recreational user of cocaine and had inhaled free-based cocaine via a pipe the previous evening and as recently as two hours before admission to the hospital. Physical examination demonstrated an anxious young man with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute and shallow. He was afebrile with normal heart rate and blood pressure. His sternum was tender to palpation, and auscultation revealed precordial crepitus synchronous with systole. The remainder of the physical examination showed no abnormality. His electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 62 beats per minute. Posteroanterior and lateral roentgenograms of the chest were. Wiener MD, Putman CE.

### Topiramate for the treatment of cocaine addiction… [^1177qxss]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Interventions Topiramate or placebo in escalating doses from 50 mg/d to the target maintenance dose of 300 mg/d in weeks 6 to 12, combined with weekly cognitive-behavioral treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures For the efficacy period, weeks 6 to 12, the primary outcome was the weekly difference from baseline in the proportion of cocaine nonuse days; the secondary outcome was urinary cocaine-free weeks, and exploratory outcomes included craving and self- and observer-rated global functioning on the Clinical Global Impression scales. Finally, a recent laboratory study in humans by Johnson and colleagues37 showed that topiramate reduced cocaine craving and decreased the monetary value of experimenter-administered high-dose cocaine, effects suggesting that topiramate can suppress cocaine's reinforcing effects and abuse liability. Sixty topiramate recipients and 57 placebo recipients experienced adverse events during the trial. The 6 most commonly reported adverse events with 1 or more occurrences in topiramate and placebo recipients were decreased weight, fatigue, headache, paresthesia, taste perversion, and diarrhea. Difficulty with concentration also was significantly different between the treatment groups. No serious adverse events were reported, no pregnancy test in women was positive, and no deaths occurred. Topiramate also was significantly more efficacious than placebo at achieving the secondary outcome during the efficacy period of increasing the likelihood of urinary cocaine-free weeks.

Furthermore, topiramate compared with placebo was significantly associated with reductions in the intensity and frequency of craving in the past 24 hours as well as improvements in observer-rated global functioning during the same period.

### Comparison of treatments for cocaine use disorder among adults… [^111mJeov]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Results A total of 157 studies comprising 402 treatment groups and 15 842 participants were included. Excluding other therapies, the largest treatment groups across all studies were psychotherapy and contingency management programs. Only contingency management programs were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of having a negative test result for the presence of cocaine, and this association remained significant in all sensitivity analyses.

Eleven treatment categories were defined based on categories used in previous systematic reviews of treatments for cocaine use disorders13–19, 22–25, 27–29, 31, 32; these categories comprised psychotherapy, contingency management programs, placebo, opioids, psychostimulants, anticonvulsants, dopamine agonists, antidepressants, antipsychotics, miscellaneous medications, and other therapies. This statistical significance persisted across all sensitivity testing. After contingency management programs, the treatment category that was significantly associated with the ITT likelihood of producing a negative urinalysis result across most analyses was opioids.

Opioid agonist therapies were significantly associated with a reduction in cocaine use in 6 of 9 analyses that did not include completion rate as a covariate and in 1 of 8 analyses that included completion rate as a covariate. After contingency management programs, the treatment category associated with the most benefit across analyses was opioids. Opioid agonist therapies were significantly associated with a reduction in cocaine use in 6 of 9 analyses that did not include completion rate as a covariate and 1 of 8 analyses that included completion rate as a covariate, suggesting that the benefit of opioids for reducing ITT cocaine use was enhanced through an increase in retention rate. Notably, all studies that included opioid therapies as treatments were conducted among populations with concomitant opioid use disorders.

These medications have been significantly associated with increases in retention rates7 and, consistent with our findings, the only other meta-analysis to examine the treatment of cocaine use disorder using opioid therapies did not find a significant association outside of this increased retention rate. 23.
