## Question

Formulate a care plan for an inconclusive mammogram with abnormal findings that includes: - a follow-up mammogram with ultrasound - follow-up with results or sooner if needed.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to formulate a care plan for an inconclusive mammogram with abnormal findings, including a follow-up mammogram with ultrasound and follow-up with results or sooner if needed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the imaging finding and stratify risk. Then, I should verify the appropriate follow-up intervals for BI-RADS 3 versus when to favor biopsy for BI-RADS 4A. Next, I will examine triggers for earlier re-evaluation, communication strategies to improve adherence, and system workflows to prevent loss to follow-up. After that, I need to detail the diagnostic imaging protocol at follow-up and consider special populations such as dense breasts or disadvantaged patients. Finally, I will define quality metrics and a pragmatic algorithm, double-checking that each step aligns with established guidelines and data on patient preferences and outcomes.

> Let me first confirm classification and initial risk stratification, because everything downstream depends on getting the BI-RADS category right and documenting patient risk factors. BI-RADS 3 denotes a probably benign finding with a malignancy risk up to about 2%, typically warranting short-interval follow-up rather than immediate biopsy, whereas BI-RADS 4 carries a suspicion for malignancy and is generally subdivided into 4A (low suspicion), 4B (moderate), and 4C (high), with tissue diagnosis commonly recommended for 4 subcategories, especially beyond 4A; hold on, I should verify that 4A can sometimes be managed with short-interval follow-up when the radiologist advises so, but the default is to consider core biopsy given the non-negligible risk [^116GWZ17] [^116j5rLf]. I need to check patient-level factors that influence recall and follow-up urgency, including younger age, dense breasts, first mammogram or long interval since prior mammogram (≥ 5 years), first-degree family history, and prior biopsy, all of which can increase recall probability and complicate adherence planning [^112BjXB4] [^1134dR45]. I should also confirm we are anchoring this in a diagnostic, not screening, context and ensure digital mammography quality and comparison with priors whenever available [^111fvsjd].

> Next, I should review the standard follow-up protocol for BI-RADS 3, and I need to ensure I'm precise about intervals. Initially, I almost wrote that stability at 12 months alone is enough to return to routine screening; wait, that's incomplete, because the conventional pathway is 6-month, then 12-month, then 24-month diagnostic surveillance, and if stable across these checkpoints, transition to routine screening thereafter [^116GWZ17]. Short-interval follow-up for probably benign findings is common in practice and carries a low but non-zero cancer yield, which supports the necessity of actually completing the surveillance windows and not truncating them [^115Evgx6]. I should double-check that any interval change in size or morphology necessitates category upgrade and potentially biopsy rather than continuing surveillance [^116j5rLf].

> For BI-RADS 4A, let me consider the balance between biopsy versus short-interval imaging, and I should confirm accuracy data for image-guided core biopsy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — although some 4A findings may be followed at short intervals in select situations, the evidence-based default is to proceed with image-guided core needle biopsy because the malignancy probability exceeds the "probably benign" threshold; if short-interval follow-up is selected, a 3-month diagnostic re-evaluation can be considered in close coordination with the interpreting radiologist's judgment and patient preference [^116j5rLf]. Let me verify that large-core needle biopsy has high diagnostic accuracy and that concordant benign results can be observed with interval imaging, while discordant results should be excised or re-biopsied to avoid delayed diagnosis [^116j5rLf] [^1169PYpu].

> Now, I will examine "sooner if needed" triggers for expedited reassessment, because delays in the setting of new symptoms or upgraded imaging concern are unacceptable. I need to ensure immediate re-evaluation if the patient develops a new or enlarging palpable mass, worrisome skin or nipple changes, or axillary fullness, irrespective of the surveillance clock, and I should remember that targeted ultrasound and diagnostic mammography are first-line tools in this context, with MRI reserved for specific diagnostic gaps such as suspicious nipple discharge with negative mammogram and ultrasound or complex cases [^117CzBg3] [^113nKxsi]. But wait, what if the prior ultrasound was "normal"? Hmm, wait a minute — false negatives and workup delays do occur, which means any upgraded clinical concern should prompt prompt imaging and potential tissue diagnosis rather than reassurance alone, particularly given documented intervals where cancers emerged after prior assessments including ultrasound [^1155gWWw]. I should also confirm that unnecessary ultrasound in very low-risk scenarios can increase false positives and biopsies, so indications should be clear and targeted [^117PDYsC].

> Next, I should review communication and patient education elements that demonstrably improve adherence, and I need to check which factors most strongly correlate with appropriate follow-up. Let me verify that two modifiable communication factors stand out: explicit physician documentation of the follow-up plan and patient understanding of the need for follow-up, both independently associated with higher completion rates, which argues for same-day verbal counseling plus a written plan and verification using teach-back methods [^111RZffv]. I should confirm patient preferences for being contacted and scheduling logistics; more than half prefer phone calls and rapid scheduling within 48 hours when possible, suggesting we should avoid first-line email for initial abnormal results if it impedes timely action and patient trust in the process [^113bBG6i]. Hold on, I should also ensure informed, balanced counseling about benefits and potential harms like overdiagnosis to support patient-centered decisions and reduce decisional conflict during surveillance or biopsy choices [^114DRF5j]. Finally, when additional testing is indicated, there should be no procedural barriers to arranging it promptly at the visit if feasible [^111rs3ga].

> I will now examine implementation and tracking, because system failure is a major source of delayed cancer diagnoses, and I need to ensure robust safeguards. Scheduling the next diagnostic appointment before the patient leaves, placing orders in the EHR immediately, and activating multi-touch reminders reduce loss to follow-up and directly address the high proportion of diagnostic delays attributable to failures in ordering, scheduling, and executing tests, especially in imaging pathways for cancer detection [^116GWZ17]. Let me double-check the evidence that patient navigation improves adherence and timeliness; indeed, navigation programs significantly increase appropriate follow-up after abnormal mammograms, particularly for BI-RADS 3, and shorten time to follow-up in disadvantaged populations, which supports a tiered navigation strategy for high-risk or barrier-laden patients [^112hWj1k]. Additionally, structured tracking programs like FIND improve adherence to recommended timeframes for incidental findings management and can be adapted to mammography recall tracking to reduce missed or late re-evaluations [^111bwvWR]. For sites with capacity, immediate interpretation and same-day diagnostic workup for higher-recall-risk subgroups can reduce anxiety and prevent attrition between visits, so I should verify risk-stratified scheduling options based on age, interval since prior mammogram, density, baseline exam status, and family history [^112BjXB4] [^1134dR45].

> Let me detail the 6-, 12-, and 24-month diagnostic imaging protocol for BI-RADS 3, and I should confirm the technical elements that help avoid misclassification. Diagnostic mammography should include standard and problem-solving views with strict side-by-side comparison to baselines and prior surveillance studies, followed by targeted ultrasound of the area of concern; documentation should include measurements and representative images, with explicit correlation statements in the report to support concordance assessment and detect subtle interval change that would prompt category upgrade and biopsy [^116j5rLf]. I need to check that technique quality matters for ultrasound reproducibility and second opinions, reinforcing the value of targeted, well-documented exams performed in quality-assured centers and adherence to best practices in acquisition and annotation to minimize variability and omissions [^116BeaC3] [^117PDYsC]. If imaging features progress or suspicion increases, I should verify that the pathway shifts to image-guided core biopsy rather than continued short-interval observation, leveraging the high diagnostic accuracy of modern stereotactic or ultrasound-guided techniques and ensuring radiology-pathology concordance to close the loop safely [^117CzBg3].

> But wait, I should consider special populations to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach, especially regarding dense breasts, high-risk genetics, or access barriers. For women with dense breasts or multiple risk factors, I need to think about adjunct imaging; although adjunct ultrasound can detect additional cancers, it increases false positives and biopsies, so shared decision-making is key, and in select higher-risk scenarios, contrast-enhanced MRI may be appropriate when diagnostic questions persist despite mammography and ultrasound, albeit with attention to evidence quality and local resources [^111ycDSR] [^113Z3CDB]. Hold on, for disadvantaged women facing transportation or housing instability, on-site or mobile mammography, coupled with navigation, can improve uptake and reduce loss to follow-up; I should confirm ongoing barriers, such as transportation, and integrate social work support to operationalize timely diagnostics and surveillance [^114AkcMx]. I should also double-check aesthetic surgery contexts and dense-breast perioperative evaluations, where specialist breast assessment and consideration of adjunct ultrasound are recommended when concerns arise, to avoid missing clinically significant findings in altered anatomy [^113iUZet] [^111JoTTZ].

> Next, I should define quality assurance metrics and continuous improvement steps, and I need to ensure they track what matters clinically. Follow-up completion rates for BI-RADS 3 should target high adherence, time-to-follow-up should approximate the intended intervals, and lost-to-follow-up should be minimized; root-cause analyses for interval cancers must differentiate biological aggressiveness from system lapses like missed orders, delayed scheduling, or inadequate communication plans [^116GWZ17]. I should confirm that late-stage presentations continue to occur due to breakdowns in screening implementation and follow-up, which underscores why these metrics must be routinely monitored and acted upon to reduce preventable delays in diagnosis [^112UZGxt].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified algorithm and verify it aligns with patient preferences and operational realities. Classify the abnormal finding using BI-RADS; for BI-RADS 3, arrange 6-, 12-, and 24-month diagnostic imaging with automatic scheduling and reminders, emphasize return precautions for new symptoms, and transition to routine screening after 24-month stability; for BI-RADS 4A, discuss biopsy as the default and consider short-interval re-evaluation at 3 months only when the radiologist and patient agree it is appropriate based on low-suspicion features and patient values, with clear contingency for biopsy upon any progression or discordance, all while documenting the plan and confirming understanding using teach-back to improve adherence [^116j5rLf] [^116GWZ17] [^111RZffv]. Where feasible, apply immediate interpretation for women at highest risk of recall to reduce delays and loss to follow-up, and deploy patient navigation for those with barriers to care, since these operational strategies measurably improve timely completion of recommended diagnostics and reduce the risk of missed cancers or prolonged anxiety [^112BjXB4] [^1134dR45] [^112hWj1k].

For an inconclusive mammogram with abnormal findings, the plan of care is to **schedule diagnostic mammogram with targeted ultrasound within 2 weeks** and **escalate to MRI or biopsy if suspicious** [^116ksDaa]. Communicate results promptly, document the plan [^111RZffv], and ensure **follow-up within 48 hours**; if benign, return to routine screening, and if probably benign, repeat imaging at 6 months.

---

## Immediate follow-up imaging

Schedule a **diagnostic mammogram within 2 weeks** to further characterize the abnormality, with a concurrent **targeted breast ultrasound** [^117PDYsC] to characterize the lesion and guide next steps [^116j5rLf].

---

## Additional imaging or biopsy

Use **MRI** when mammogram/ultrasound are inconclusive or the patient is high-risk [^113nKxsi], and proceed to **image-guided biopsy** [^116ksDaa] when imaging suggests malignancy (BI-RADS 4/5) or when imaging and clinical findings are discordant.

---

## Communication and documentation

Provide **prompt communication** — inform the patient of results and next steps within 48 hours [^113bBG6i] [^112BjXB4] — and ensure **clear documentation**, recording the follow-up plan and confirming understanding to support adherence [^111RZffv].

---

## Follow-up timeline

Plan **short-interval follow-up** with repeat imaging at 6 months [^116GWZ17] for probably benign findings (BI-RADS 3), and return to **routine screening** per guidelines [^111fvsjd] if benign.

---

## Patient education and support

Provide **education** explaining the meaning of inconclusive results and the rationale for further testing, and **support** to address anxiety and offer emotional reassurance during follow-up [^114DRF5j].

---

## Escalation of care

Refer promptly to a **breast specialist** for definitive diagnosis and management when suspicious findings are confirmed [^117CzBg3].

---

This plan ensures **timely, evidence-based follow-up**, clear communication, and appropriate escalation to minimize diagnostic delay and patient anxiety [^112UZGxt] [^112hWj1k].

### Factors associated with optimal follow-up in women with BI-RADS 3 breast findings [^116GWZ17]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Optimal diagnostic follow-up is critical to address the National Academy of Medicine's mandate for health care professionals to improve the diagnostic testing process. A published study analyzing litigation cases from 2009 to 2013 showed that 20% alleged a diagnosis-related error as the primary reason for a lawsuit. Thirty-one percent of diagnosis-related errors involve a failure or delay in ordering, scheduling, and executing diagnostic tests, including 45% involving diagnostic imaging. Cancer is one of the leading missed diagnoses resulting from this failure or delay in diagnostic imaging.

Breast cancer screening is a mainstay of public health in the United States. Over 33 million women a year receive mammograms, representing an estimated 60% of all women age 40 and over. Previous studies have demonstrated a 20–30% reduction in breast cancer mortality with regular screening that results in further management. A study performed between 1995 and 1997 at an academic medical center found that the most common Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment leading to a breast lesion biopsy was a BI-RADS category 3.

Recommendations for category 3 breast findings on mammography typically include 6-month follow-up imaging, followed by 12- and then 24-month follow-up imaging. However, follow-up imaging has been sub-optimal in many women, with breast imaging not performed to follow up BI-RADS 3 lesions in the recommended time frame. Since BI-RADS 3 breast lesions have up to a 2% likelihood of malignancy (BI-RADS lexicon 5th ed), it is imperative that optimal follow-up is conducted.

### Communication factors in the follow-up of abnormal mammograms [^111RZffv]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To identify the communication factors that are significantly associated with the appropriate short-term follow-up of abnormal mammograms.

- **Design**: Prospective longitudinal study involving medical record review and patient survey.

- **Setting**: Ten academically affiliated ambulatory medical practices in the Boston metropolitan area.

- **Participants**: One hundred twenty-six women with abnormal mammograms requiring short-term (6 months) follow-up imaging.

- **Measurements**: Proportion of women in the study who received appropriate follow-up care.

- **Results**: Eighty-one (64%) of the women with abnormal mammograms requiring short-term follow-up imaging received the appropriate follow-up care. After adjusting for patients' age and insurance status, two communication factors were found to be independently associated with the delivery of appropriate follow-up care: (1) physicians' documentation of a follow-up plan in the medical record (adjusted odds ratio, 2.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 6.98; p = 0.029) and (2) patients' understanding of the need for follow-up (adjusted odds ratio, 3.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.50 to 9.96; p = 0.006). None of the patients' clinical or psychological characteristics were associated with the delivery of appropriate follow-up care.

- **Conclusions**: Follow-up care for women with abnormal mammograms requiring short-term follow-up imaging is suboptimal. Documentation of the follow-up plan by the physician and understanding of the follow-up plan by the patient are important factors that are correlated with the receipt of appropriate follow-up care.

### Communicating mammography results: By what method and how quickly do women want their screening mammogram results [^113bBG6i]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

The purpose of the survey study was to understand the majority preference regarding the wait time for screening mammogram results, whether prompt communication of mammogram results was important to patients, whether the time frame to schedule an additional imaging follow-up appointment after an abnormal screening mammogram was important to patients, and how patients preferred to be given their screening mammogram results. A total of 2,245 patients participated in the survey.

A majority of patients preferred to receive screening mammogram results on Friday (n = 1,868, 85.4%), even if their mammogram was abnormal, requiring a follow-up appointment that could not be scheduled until the following week. Most individuals preferred to schedule their follow-up appointments soon after their initial appointment, either the next day or within 1 to 2 days. Over half of the sample preferred to be contacted via a telephone call, with letter and text messaging being the next most preferred methods, and e-mail being the least preferred.

Survey results suggest that the preferred wait time for screening mammogram results was either at the time of the screening mammogram appointment or within 48 hours. These suggestions can help clinics and providers make changes to how they communicate screening mammogram results. The strong preference of patients receiving their screening mammogram results more promptly should help trigger alternative methods for improving communication between the radiologist and the patient.

### Performance goals for an adjunct diagnostic test to reduce unnecessary biopsies after screening mammography: Analysis of costs, benefits, and consequences [^115m9k6z]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study addresses the issue that benign biopsies resulting from false-positive mammographic findings are a known harm of breast cancer screening. Physicians and test manufacturers are searching for methods to reduce their frequency. The aim was to estimate potential costs and consequences associated with using an adjunct diagnostic test for triaging women with suspicious mammographic findings before biopsy.

Methods included developing a decision model to compare the use of an adjunct test before biopsy to the standard of care for suspicious mammographic findings. The decision analysis was performed from the perspective of a national health payer, with a 1-year time horizon among women representative of the US screening population aged 40 to 79 years. Three primary outcomes were assessed: incremental costs, number of benign biopsies avoided, and number of missed opportunities for diagnosing cancer per million women screened. Input parameters were obtained from the medical literature and expert opinion. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the effects of uncertainty in parameter estimates.

Results showed that the base-case analysis demonstrated that the use of an adjunct diagnostic test with 95% sensitivity, 75% specificity, and a cost of $1,000 would eliminate 8,127 unnecessary breast biopsies per million women screened. However, this would increase costs to the US health care system by $6,462,977 and result in 255 missed opportunities for diagnosing cancer per million women screened.

The conclusions highlight that adding an adjunct test for triaging women for breast biopsies would have both financial and diagnostic implications.

### Estrace [^1157dZfP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Clinical surveillance of all women taking estrogen/progestin combinations is important (see PRECAUTIONS). Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.

- **Breast cancer**: The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was not fully provided.

### The paradox of MRI for breast cancer screening: High-risk and dense breasts-available evidence and current practice [^113Z3CDB]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

To understand the above-mentioned EBM conceptual framework that guides the adoption of screening tests, we take into consideration the oldest example in radiology, i.e. screening mammography. In 1998, the UK National Screening Committee defined screening as the systematic application of a test to identify apparently healthy individuals at increased risk of a specific disorder in order to offer information, further investigation, or treatment, as appropriate. As recently stated by the World Health Organization, a specific target population is invited from central records to perform simple tests to detect individuals with a disease who do not yet exhibit symptoms.

Furthermore, screening programs should be implemented only after establishing their effectiveness, ensuring adequate resources, having facilities for diagnoses, as well as for treatment and follow-up, and when the prevalence of the disease justifies the costs associated with screening. Finally, screening efforts should be justified by the considerable advantages it may offer (in terms of disease secondary prevention and disability/mortality reduction), which significantly outweigh any potential negative consequence. This document clearly distinguishes between "screening" as applied to apparently healthy individuals, and "early diagnosis" as applied to individuals with signs or symptoms (the "clinical" or "diagnostic" context).

In fact, screening addresses disorders that, while occurring with varying frequencies in the lives of individuals, remain consistently uncommon.

### Prioritizing screening mammograms for immediate interpretation and diagnostic evaluation on the basis of risk for recall [^113HkChk]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Age, time since prior mammogram (if any), first-degree family history of breast cancer, and history of breast biopsy were collected from self-administered health history questionnaires at the time of mammography or extracted from electronic health records.

- **Time since prior mammogram**: Categorized as first mammogram, 1 year (9–18 months), 2 years (19–30 months), 3 years (31–42 months), 4 years (43–54 months), or 5 years or longer (> 54 months). Mammograms were considered first mammograms if no previous mammogram was identified in the database and individuals self-reported that they did not have prior mammograms. Mammograms were considered subsequent examinations if a previous mammogram was identified in the database or a prior mammogram date was self-reported. Mammograms with no previous mammogram in the database and missing self-reported information on time since last mammogram were excluded. Examinations with mammograms in the prior 9 months were excluded to avoid misclassifying diagnostic mammograms as screening.

- **History of breast biopsy**: History of benign breast biopsy result and high-risk lesion diagnoses (atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ) were obtained via self-report and linkage with pathology databases. Diagnoses of lobular carcinoma in situ were also obtained by linkage with state or regional cancer registries, regardless of enrollment in the BCSC at the time of diagnosis.

Self-reported race/ethnicity was categorized as Hispanic/Latina or non-Hispanic Asian, Black, White, other, or multiracial (if non-Hispanic).

### Mammography: An update of the EUSOBI recommendations on information for women [^111fvsjd]. Insights into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Mammography plays a crucial role in breast cancer detection and diagnosis. The primary goal is to facilitate early treatment, enhance survival rates, and minimize the necessity for aggressive treatments like mastectomy, even amidst modern therapies. It can be conducted in either a screening or diagnostic setting. Whenever possible, full-field digital mammography is preferred over phosphor-plate computer radiography or film-screen mammography due to several advantages. These include a lower X-ray dose, superior image quality, the ability for post-processing, digital archiving, image transmission, and the absence of chemical pollution.

Screening mammography is conducted periodically to detect small cancers before they can be identified through self-palpation or clinical breast examination. It is typically performed every 1 to 3 years for women aged 40–50 years up to approximately 70–75 years, depending on national or regional screening programs. European guidelines recommend a two-year interval for women aged 50 to 70. Differences in screening programs across Europe — such as reporting methods — stem from cultural, technical, financial, and prevalence factors. Women with a high family frequency of breast cancer should begin screening earlier.

### How reassuring is a normal breast ultrasound in assessment of a screen-detected mammographic abnormality? A review of interval cancers after assessment that included ultrasound evaluation [^1155gWWw]. Clinical Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to review factors resulting in a false-negative outcome or delayed cancer diagnosis in women recalled for further evaluation, including ultrasound, after an abnormal screening mammogram.

Of 646,692 screening mammograms performed between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2004, 34,533 women were recalled for further assessment. Nine hundred and sixty-four interval cancers were reported during this period. Forty-six of these women had been recalled for further assessment, which specifically included ultrasound evaluation in the preceding 24 months, and therefore met the inclusion criteria for this study. Screening mammograms, further mammographic views, ultrasound scans, clinical findings, and histopathology results were retrospectively reviewed by two consultant breast radiologists.

- **Results**: The interval cancer developed in the contralateral breast (n = 9), ipsilateral breast but at a different site (n = 6), and ipsilateral breast at the same site (n = 31) as the abnormality for which they had recently been recalled. In the latter group, 10 were retrospectively classified as a false-negative outcome, nine had a delay in obtaining a biopsy, and 12 had a delay due to a non-diagnostic initial biopsy. Various factors relating to these outcomes are discussed.

- **Conclusion**: Out of 34,533 women who attended for an assessment visit, and the 46 women who subsequently developed an interval breast cancer, 15 were true interval cancers, 10 had a false-negative assessment outcome, and 21 had a delay in cancer diagnosis based on a number of factors.

### Three- to six-year follow-up for 379 benign image-guided large-core needle biopsies of nonpalpable breast abnormalities [^1169PYpu]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2002). Low credibility.

Determining the negative predictive value of benign large-core needle biopsy of nonpalpable mammographically detected breast abnormalities has been difficult because benign results generally preclude surgical excision. Long-term follow-up of these patients is important to ensure timely diagnosis of new abnormalities and to identify false negatives.

- **Study design**: This cohort study comprised 379 patients, all with benign diagnoses following imaging-guided large-core needle biopsy of nonpalpable mammographically detected abnormalities. Mammographic, clinical, and laboratory records (when appropriate) were reviewed for all patients followed at our institution. For patients followed elsewhere, these data were provided by each patient's primary-care physician after obtaining written informed consent from the patient.

- **Results**: We obtained follow-up for 312 patients (82.3% of 379), for whom the mean follow-up period was 55 months. Sixty-seven patients were either lost to follow-up (44, 11.6%), had no follow-up by patient choice (18, 4.7%), or died of causes other than breast cancer (5, 1.3%). Of these 312 patients, we found only 1 (0.3%) false negative in which a 4-mm lesion was observed to have grown to approximately 11 mm eight months later and was found to be an infiltrating ductal cancer at rebiopsy. The negative predictive value was calculated as 0.997 (311/312). Analysis of core histologies indicated the follow-up group was a representative sample.

- **Conclusions**: These data suggest that benign mammographically detected abnormalities can be diagnosed with a high level of accuracy.

### Reason for late-stage breast cancer: Absence of screening or detection, or breakdown in follow-up [^112UZGxt]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2004). Low credibility.

Mammography screening increases the detection of early-stage breast cancers; therefore, implementing screening should reduce the percentage of women who are diagnosed with late-stage disease. However, despite high national mammography screening rates, late-stage breast cancers still occur, possibly because of failures in screening implementation.

- **Methods**: Using data from seven health care plans that included 1.5 million women aged 50 years or older, we conducted retrospective reviews of chart and automated data for 3 years before 1995–1999 diagnoses of late-stage (metastatic and/or tumor size ≥ 3 cm; case subjects, n = 1347) and early-stage breast cancers (control subjects, n = 1347). We categorized the earliest screening mammogram during the period 13–36 months before diagnosis as none (absence of screening), negative (absence of detection), or positive (potential breakdown in follow-up). We compared the proportion of case and control subjects in each category of screening implementation and estimated the likelihood (odds ratio [OR] with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of late-stage breast cancer. We also evaluated demographic characteristics associated with absence of screening in women with late-stage disease. All statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: Absence of screening, absence of detection, and potential breakdown in follow-up were distributed differently among case (52.1%, 39.5%, and 8.4%, respectively) and control subjects (34.4%, 56.9%, and 8.8%, respectively) (P = 0.03). Among all women, the odds of having late-stage cancer were higher among

- **Materials and methods**: Following Institutional Review Board approval, a retrospective search identified 38 patients who presented for conventional breast imaging following a thermography-detected abnormality. Study criteria included women who had a mammogram and/or breast ultrasound performed for evaluation of a thermography-detected abnormality between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2015. Patients whose mammograms and ultrasounds were initiated at an outside institution or who did not have imaging at our institution were excluded. Records were reviewed for clinical history, thermography results, mammogram and/or ultrasound findings, and pathology. Mammograms and ultrasounds were prospectively interpreted by one of 14 Mammography Quality Standards Act-certified breast imaging radiologists with 3–30 years of experience. Patient outcomes were determined by biopsy or at least 1 year of follow-up, with patient ages ranging from 23 to 70 years (mean = 50 years).

- **Results**: Ninety-five percent (36 of 38) of patients did not have breast cancer. The two patients diagnosed with breast cancer had suspicious clinical symptoms, including palpable mass and erythema. No asymptomatic woman had breast cancer. The negative predictive value was 100%. Of the 38 patients, 79% (30 of 38) had Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 1 or 2 assessments; 5% (2 of 38) had BI-RADS 3; and 16% (6 of 38) had BI-RADS 4 (n = 5) or BI-RADS 5 (n = 1) assessments.

### Conclusions for mammography screening after 25-year follow-up of the Canadian National Breast Cancer Screening Study (CNBSS) [^1132mEMR]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The twenty-five-year follow-up data of the Canadian National Breast Cancer Screening Study (CNBSS) indicated no reduction in mortality. What conclusions should be drawn from this? After conducting a systematic literature search and narrative analysis, we wish to recapitulate important details of this study, which may have been neglected. Sixty-eight percent of all included cancers were palpable, a situation that does not allow testing the value of early detection. Randomization was performed at the sites after palpation, while blinding was not guaranteed. In the first round, this "randomization" assigned 19 out of 24 late-stage cancers to the mammography group and only five to the control group, supporting the suspicion of severe errors in the randomization process. The responsible physicist rated the mammography quality as "far below state of the art of that time". Radiological advisors resigned during the study due to unacceptable image quality, training, and medical quality assurance. Each described problem may strongly influence the results between study and control groups. Twenty-five years of follow-up cannot heal these fundamental problems, and this study is inappropriate for evidence-based conclusions. The technology and quality assurance of the diagnostic chain are shown to be contrary to today's screening programs, rendering the results of the CNBSS inapplicable to them.

- **Key points**:

- **The evidence base of the Canadian study (CNBSS) has to be questioned**: Severe flaws in the randomization process and test methods occurred.
- **Problems were criticized during and after conclusion of the study**.

### Pregnancy at age 35 years or older: ACOG obstetric care consensus no. 11 [^111rcToj]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for advanced maternal age pregnancy, specifically with respect to screening for congenital anomalies, ACOG 2022 guidelines recommend considering a detailed fetal anatomic ultrasound in pregnant patients with anticipated delivery at age ≥ 35 years. This recommendation is due to the increased risk of aneuploidy and the potential increased risk of congenital anomalies.

### Diagnostic accuracy of breast MRI for patients with suspicious nipple discharge and negative mammography and ultrasound: A prospective study [^113nKxsi]. European Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of breast MRI in identifying lesions requiring excision for patients with suspicious nipple discharge but normal mammograms and ultrasounds, a prospective multicenter study was conducted.

Between September 2013 and May 2019, 106 female participants (mean age 57.9 years) were consecutively included; 102 were retained for analysis. MRI was considered negative in the absence of suspicious enhancement and positive in cases of ipsilateral abnormal enhancement (BI-RADS 3 to 5). Final diagnoses were based on histological findings of surgical or percutaneous biopsies or at 1-year follow-up. All lesions requiring excision found on pathology (papilloma, atypia, nipple adenomatosis, or cancer) were considered as positive results. Spontaneous resolution of the discharge at 1 year was considered a negative result.

MRI showed ipsilateral abnormal enhancement in 54 patients (53%), revealing 46 lesions requiring excision (31 benign papillomas, 5 papillomas with atypia, 2 nipple adenomatosis, and 8 cancers) and 8 benign lesions not requiring excision. No suspicious enhancement was found in the remaining 48 participants (47%). Forty-two were followed up at 1 year with spontaneous resolution of the discharge, and six underwent surgery, revealing 2 benign papillomas. MRI diagnostic accuracy for the detection of a lesion requiring excision was as follows: sensitivity 96%, specificity 85%, positive predictive value 85%, and negative predictive value 96%.

### Breast ultrasound: Recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European Society of Breast Imaging [^117PDYsC]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

No. If breast ultrasound (US) is not indicated and is performed, for example, for screening in very young women at average risk for breast cancer, there is a non-negligible chance of false positive findings. This could require unnecessary further work-up, including needle biopsy or additional imaging procedures, causing anxiety to the woman and costs to the healthcare system. In addition, women should not forget that if US is used as a stand-alone screening tool instead of mammography, cancers could be missed, especially in fatty breasts.

After receiving the result of a breast handheld US, can women try to get a reliable second opinion on the test?

This possibility is limited by important technical reasons. If the original examiner missed a lesion, no documentation exists of this. Thus, in the vast majority of cases, the only way to get a real second opinion is for the breast US examination to be repeated by another examiner. This underlines the importance of selecting quality-assured or certified breast imaging centers for the original breast US examination. Notably, this is not true for mammography, which can be read by a second radiologist without it being necessary to repeat the test, with only a few exceptions due to technical deficits of the original mammogram.

### Informing women about overdetection in breast cancer screening: Two-year outcomes from a randomized trial [^114DRF5j]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2021). High credibility.

Mammography screening can reduce a woman's risk of dying from breast cancer but entails the risk of having a cancer diagnosed that would not have presented clinically in her lifetime — termed overdetection or overdiagnosis. Such a diagnosis, and the resulting overtreatment, can harm women physically and emotionally, for example, through treatment side effects and psychosocial consequences of being labeled with a diagnosis of cancer.

Growing scientific attention to overdetection has highlighted the importance of ensuring that women invited to breast screening are informed about the potential for harm in addition to benefit. After a thorough evidence review, the Independent UK Panel on Breast Cancer Screening wrote that "information should be made available in a transparent and objective way to women invited to screening so that they can make informed decisions". Momentum is shifting from persuasive approaches to screening communication toward more balanced information, giving people the opportunity to make informed choices whether to screen or not based on their personal assessment of the trade-offs between potential outcomes.

Decision aids are tools to communicate evidence-based information about the benefits and harms of different healthcare options to help people make informed decisions. Numerous randomized trials show decision aids improve knowledge and facilitate informed choice in various settings, including cancer screening. However, earlier breast screening decision aid trials did not involve women aged 50 years (when screening is initiated in many countries).

### ACOG committee opinion. Follow-up of abnormal screening mammography, number 272, May 2002 [^111rs3ga]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Screening mammography facilitates the early diagnosis of breast carcinoma in women. Timely follow-up can optimize the diagnosis and treatment of women with abnormal screening test results. When test results reveal that additional studies are needed, no barriers should prohibit testing during the screening mammography visit.

### The FIND program: Improving follow-up of incidental imaging findings [^111bwvWR]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

The results of this study indicate that the implementation of a structured tracking program for reported incidental imaging findings resulted in improved follow-up and adherence to recommended time intervals for imaging examinations. This study found statistically significantly improved rates of follow-up after the implementation of the FIND program, including follow-ups within the recommended timeframe.

The benefits of identifying incidental findings are rooted in the idea that earlier diagnosis of a medical condition can result in improved outcomes. These benefits need to be considered against the number of cases that receive follow-up for benign findings, findings which do not alter clinical outcomes or are untreatable, and cases where treating the incidental finding results in adverse health outcomes. Increased follow-up of incidental findings is most beneficial in organ systems which have the highest rate of malignancy, such as the breast. Using evidence-based guidelines and evaluating the individual patient case when determining which incidental findings to follow-up will maximize the benefits of programs similar to FIND, while minimizing the consequences of unnecessary imaging. It is important to note that although the ACR white papers utilized in this study include recommendations for incidental findings across most major organ systems, these consensus guidelines are often flexible and used as suggestions for future follow-up, rather than providing evidence-based rigid timeframes.

### Assessing mode of recurrence in breast cancer to identify an optimised follow-up pathway: 10-year institutional review [^114kWDBg]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

The findings of this study certainly support the provision of mammography as the primary surveillance tool in breast cancer survivors, as only 2 patients out of 81 who were diagnosed through clinical exam had a normal mammogram. Conversely, over half of recurrences within the study period were detected through annual mammography. Separately, the need for ongoing annual mammography and the age at which radiological surveillance should cease remain controversial. Other national guidelines, such as those published by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence in the UK, have argued that as the risk of recurrence in many patients falls over time to risk levels in line with unaffected females, many of these breast cancer survivors could be managed under the auspices of the national breast screening programme.

Although previous evidence has demonstrated that clinical examination has a lower sensitivity when compared with mammography for the diagnosis of locoregional recurrence, there remains a group of patients that present to the breast clinic with new symptoms outside of their scheduled radiological/clinical surveillance programme. The majority (n = 57) of the 81 patients diagnosed clinically presented with having noticed the symptom(s) themselves. This is in keeping with published evidence demonstrating that 80% or more patients with breast cancer will identify locoregional recurrence themselves outside of scheduled clinical surveillance. Previous studies have also demonstrated that breast cancer survivors are increasingly likely to take full personal responsibility for their own monitoring and follow-up care.

### How often are previously undetected radiographic abnormalities detected at the time of CT simulation for breast cancer patients [^117SA4VA]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

In most institutions, planning computed tomography (CT) scans are not interpreted by diagnostic radiologists. The purpose of this analysis was to determine the percentage of cases in which a previously undetected radiographic finding was found on review of CT simulation images by diagnostic radiology.

At the Henry Ford West Bloomfield Center, CT simulations are prospectively interpreted by diagnostic radiologists, and a formal report is generated. CT simulation scan reports of 332 consecutive breast cancer patients from 2000 to 2006 were reviewed. The percentage of these reports in which a previously undetected abnormality was noted on the planning CT was determined. Prior and subsequent diagnostic CT scans were also reviewed to determine the clinical relevance of these diagnostic abnormalities.

Of 332 patients with CT simulations for breast cancer treatment planning, 52 patients (16%) had a newly detected abnormality noted. Of these, 31 patients (60% of the abnormal findings) were deemed by diagnostic radiology to have potentially significant findings (e.g. "cannot exclude metastatic disease"), and a follow-up CT or magnetic resonance imaging scan was recommended. Abnormalities in this category included previously undetected lung nodules, liver lesions, kidney/adrenal lesions, and sclerotic bony lesions. On follow-up, however, at the time of writing, these findings have demonstrated no clinical significance, although further follow-up is needed in many patients.

### Does biopsy, aspiration or six-month follow-up of a false-positive mammogram reduce future screening or have large psychosocial effects [^1136u32u]. Academic Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

To determine the differences in the psychosocial effects and future mammography screening behavior between women who had an abnormal mammogram followed either by percutaneous or open surgical breast biopsy or cyst aspiration, or by short-term follow-up mammography to provide insight to radiologists making decisions regarding work-up.

- **Materials and methods**: A structured interview was administered to women who recently had abnormal mammograms, leading to biopsy or aspiration (170 cases), or short-term follow-up (176 controls), by telephone within a month of the eligibility event and again approximately 15 months later. Information was collected on perceived pain/discomfort, interactions with medical staff, emotional impact, general breast cancer knowledge, patient attitude towards early diagnosis of breast cancer, perceived risk, previous and intended screening behavior, and subjective health status. The Wilcoxon rank sum statistical test was used to compare the two groups at the time of both interviews.

- **Results**: Cases and controls had similar demographics. There were no significant differences in the examined psychosocial effects and reported intention to undergo future screening mammography between cases and controls. The overwhelming majority of both cases and controls reported intention to undergo and underwent routine screening 15 months after the eligibility event.

- **Conclusion**: Undergoing a biopsy, cyst aspiration, or 6-month follow-up following a positive mammogram does not have large psychosocial effects, nor does it deter women from undergoing screening.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for adrenal incidentaloma, specifically concerning imaging follow-up, the ACR 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining non-contrast MRI or non-contrast/contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen for the 12-month follow-up imaging of patients with no prior history of malignancy. This is advised for patients with an incidentally detected indeterminate adrenal mass of 1–2 cm without diagnostic benign imaging characteristics.

### Patient navigation to improve follow-up of abnormal mammograms among disadvantaged women [^112hWj1k]. Journal of Women's Health (2015). Low credibility.

Patient navigation (PN) can improve breast cancer care among disadvantaged women. We evaluated the impact of a PN program on follow-up after an abnormal mammogram.

- **Methods**: Between 2007 and 2010, disadvantaged women with an abnormal mammogram (Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] codes 0, 3, 4, 5) cared for in a community health center (CHC) with PN were compared to those receiving care in 11 network practices without PN. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling were used to compare the percentages receiving appropriate follow-up and time to follow-up between the groups.

- **Results**: Abnormal mammography findings were reported for 132 women in the CHC with PN and 168 from practices without PN. The percentage of women with appropriate follow-up care was higher in the practice with PN than in non-PN practices (90.4% vs. 75.3%, adjusted p = 0.006). Results varied by BI-RADS score for women in PN and non-PN practices (BI-RADS 0, 93.7% vs. 90.2%, p = 0.24; BI-RADS 3, 85.7% vs. 49.2%, p = 0.003; BI-RADS 4/5, 95.1% vs. 82.8%, p = 0.26). Time to follow-up was similar for BI-RADS 0 and occurred sooner for women in the PN practice than in non-PN practices for BI-RADS 3 and 4/5 (BI-RADS 3, adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.41 [1.36–4.27]; BI-RADS 4/5, aHR [95% CI]: 1.41 [0.88–2.24]).

- **Conclusions**: Disadvantaged women from a CHC with PN were more likely to receive appropriate follow-up after an abnormal mammogram than were those from practices without PN. Expanding PN to include all disadvantaged women within primary care settings could potentially improve timely follow-up care and breast cancer outcomes.

### Performance goals for an adjunct diagnostic test to reduce unnecessary biopsies after screening mammography: Analysis of costs, benefits, and consequences [^115qSHyC]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The study aimed to address the known harm of benign biopsies resulting from false-positive mammographic findings, a concern in breast cancer screening. Physicians and test manufacturers are exploring methods to reduce the frequency of these unnecessary biopsies. The study's primary objective was to estimate the potential costs and consequences of using an adjunct diagnostic test to triage women with suspicious mammographic findings before recommending a biopsy.

A decision model was created to compare the use of an adjunct test prior to biopsy with the standard of care for suspicious mammographic findings. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of a national health payer and involved a 1-year time horizon among women representative of the US screening population aged 40 to 79 years. Three primary outcomes were assessed: incremental costs, the number of benign biopsies avoided, and the number of missed opportunities for diagnosing cancer per million women screened. Input parameters were sourced from medical literature and expert opinion, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of uncertainty in parameter estimates.

The base-case analysis revealed that using an adjunct diagnostic test with 95% sensitivity, 75% specificity, and a cost of $1,000 would prevent 8,127 unnecessary breast biopsies per million women screened. However, this would also impose an additional cost of $6,462,977 on the US health care system and lead to 255 missed opportunities for diagnosing cancer per million women screened.

### Risk-stratified screening: A simulation study of scheduling templates on daily mammography recalls [^114tiyVU]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Institutional review board approval was obtained at the University of California, Los Angeles. We followed four key steps: planning, modeling, verification and validation (refer to the Results section), and analysis to develop and validate the simulation models. We built from previous models to compare RSS and non-RSS templates. In this study, the term "recall" refers to the diagnostic care following a potentially abnormal screening mammogram, which may involve either same-day diagnostics or follow-up diagnostic workups at a later date.

Our simulations used data from the highest-volume breast imaging center within our health system, which conducts approximately 20% of all breast imaging examinations. This site offers all types of breast examinations and procedures, including screening mammography and ultrasound, breast MRI, diagnostic breast imaging, and multimodality image-guided biopsies. Practice and patient volume served as the baseline workflow. A team expert in imaging, informatics, and implementation science developed a hypothetical workflow incorporating AI interpretation of screening mammograms, immediate radiologist review of flagged results, and same-day diagnostic imaging.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® on nonpalpable mammographic findings (excluding calcifications) [^116j5rLf]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Screening mammography can detect breast cancer before it becomes clinically apparent. However, the screening process identifies many false-positive findings for each cancer eventually confirmed. Additional tools are available to help differentiate spurious findings from real ones and to help determine when tissue sampling is required, when short-term follow-up will suffice, or whether the finding can be dismissed as benign. These tools include additional diagnostic mammographic views, breast ultrasound, breast MRI, and, when histologic evaluation is required, percutaneous biopsy.

The imaging evaluation of a finding detected at screening mammography proceeds most efficiently, cost-effectively, and with minimization of radiation dose when approached in an evidence-based manner. The appropriateness of the above-referenced tools is presented here as they apply to a variety of findings often encountered on screening mammography; an algorithmic approach to workup of these potential scenarios is also included. The recommendations put forth represent a compilation of evidence-based data and expert opinion of the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® Expert Panel on Breast Imaging.

### Practical guidance for planning resources required to support publicly-funded adaptive clinical trials [^111dWKkG]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **Step 4 – Funder expectations**: Currently, most funders of academic or public sector trials in the UK provide limited flexibility in specifying the costs requested in a funding application. A single figure is required, considered by the funding panel, to determine whether the research offers value for money. Typically, this figure represents the maximum amount required by the trial. If an adaptive trial exhibits significant cost variability (e.g. depending on how many arms stop early or whether the recruitment target increases following a sample size re-estimation), this maximum may make the research appear expensive. However, it minimizes the risk of needing to return to a funder for additional resources to complete the trial and reduces the risk of an inconclusive trial result. In the CAT project, CTUs presented this maximum amount to ensure the research could be delivered in the 'worst-case scenario' requiring the maximum sample size.

There should be opportunities to insert more details in the application form to provide an estimate of cost savings if specific changes occur. Most funders include a justification of costs section, allowing for the estimation of cost savings in particular scenarios. Additionally, some trial funders, such as the Medical Research Council (MRC) Developmental Pathway Funding Scheme (DPFS), require projects to be split into milestones, each with an associated cost. This approach may better specify the uncertainty in the cost of an adaptive design if milestones are linked to interim analyses.

### Cancer prevention for women experiencing homelessness: Onsite mammography, navigation, and education [^114AkcMx]. JCO Oncology Practice (2024). Low credibility.

Persons experiencing homelessness (PEHs) represent a medically underserved population with a disproportionately high rate of late-stage cancer diagnoses and cancer mortality. During mobile onsite mammography and breast health education events, we studied PEH's barriers to and uptake of cancer screenings.

This study used patient surveys and reviews of the electronic health record. The main outcome measures included mammogram and diagnostic imaging (as needed) results. A questionnaire assessed patients' views and barriers related to social determinants of health. The study included women accessing community organization resources who were 40 years or older or who met the criteria for screening mammography.

Forty-six individuals completed mammograms and 41 individuals participated in the survey, resulting in a response rate of 89%. Thirty-five participants (85%) were covered by health insurance provided by a Medicaid managed plan. Thirty-six participants (87%) received a negative mammogram result, while five participants (12%) required follow-up for abnormal results. Of these five, two participants completed diagnostic follow-up with negative results, and three did not complete diagnostic follow-up. In addition to barriers related to housing insecurity, five patients (12%) reported transportation barriers. A majority (n = 28, 68%) disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement, "I'm afraid the mammogram will be painful". A majority (n = 31, 76%) disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement, "I'm busy and do not have time". Nearly all participants (n = 37, 90%) responded favorably, indicating a general willingness to engage in screenings despite barriers.

Early detection of breast cancer has been shown to decrease the mortality rate. Technology continues to evolve to improve the accuracy of detection. In addition, the process of individual risk assessment is evolving, and new factors that affect risk are being identified. The purpose of this document is to clarify the rationale for breast cancer screening guidelines and evaluate the evidence regarding screening techniques. It also focuses on mammography and other detection techniques as screening tools to identify nonpalpable lesions; the use of mammography for diagnostic purposes when a lesion is palpated is addressed briefly.

### American Society of Clinical Oncology 2006 update of the breast cancer follow-up and management guidelines in the adjuvant setting [^114T9ufp]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this update is to revise the 1999 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline on breast cancer follow-up and management in the adjuvant setting.

- **Methods**: An ASCO Expert Panel reviewed pertinent information from the literature through March 2006. More weight was given to studies that tested a hypothesis directly relating testing to one of the primary outcomes in a randomized design.

- **Results**: The evidence supports regular history, physical examination, and mammography as the cornerstone of appropriate breast cancer follow-up. All patients should have a careful history and physical examination performed by a physician experienced in the surveillance of cancer patients and in breast examination. These examinations should be performed every 3 to 6 months for the first 3 years, every 6 to 12 months for years 4 and 5, and annually thereafter. For those who have undergone breast-conserving surgery, a post-treatment mammogram should be obtained 1 year after the initial mammogram and at least 6 months after the completion of radiation therapy. Thereafter, unless otherwise indicated, a yearly mammographic evaluation should be performed. Patients at high risk for familial breast cancer syndromes should be referred for genetic counseling. The use of CBCs, chemistry panels, bone scans, chest radiographs, liver ultrasounds, computed tomography scans, 18Ffluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, or tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 15–3, and CA 27.29) is not recommended for routine breast cancer follow-up in an otherwise asymptomatic patient.

### Twenty five year follow-up for breast cancer incidence and mortality of the Canadian National Breast Screening Study: randomised screening trial [^113cRYsu]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

For women enrolled in the final year of recruitment, a total of four annual screens were offered. The screening period was defined as the first five years from randomisation for each woman, and the follow-up period was considered to be years 6 to 25. As previously reported, in the mammography arm, full compliance with screening after screen 1 (when compliance was 100%) varied from 86% (for screen 5) to 90% (for screen 2). Additionally, a small proportion (up to 3%) of the women attended and accepted breast examination but refused mammography. Of the women who failed to attend, 3% to 7% submitted questionnaires. Over 93% of participants in the control arm aged 40–49 returned their annual questionnaire, whereas compliance with annual breast examination screening for those in the control arm aged 50–59 varied between 89% (for screen 2) and 85% (for screen 5); only questionnaires were obtained for 3% to 7% of the women.

Women with abnormal findings either on physical examination or on mammography were referred to a special review clinic directed by the surgeon affiliated with the study center.

### Evaluating the age-based recommendations for long-term follow-up in breast cancer [^114nrq7g]. The Oncologist (2020). Low credibility.

The probability of recurrence was compared with the risk of a primary tumor in the healthy population and not the hazard rate, as with competing risks, the one-to-one relationship between rate and risk is lost (i.e. the hazard of recurrence will not be equal to the risk of recurrence) [33]. Consequently, the way in which covariates (like age) are associated with the outcome may not coincide. The comparison with the healthy screening population was made with different incidence years (2005–2009) than women at risk for recurrence (2008–2013 for 2003 and 2010–2015 for 2005). This could have led to slight changes in risk, but it is unlikely that this has led to different results.

With the alternative age cutoff, the recommendations for women aged 50–69 after five years of follow-up would be the same in both the follow-up and the screening setting (biennial). The risk of both LRR and SP combined resulted in at least twice the risk of recurrence in women with a history of breast cancer compared with the risk of a primary tumor in the healthy screening population. This means that patients in the follow-up aged 60–74 undergo the same frequency of visits as patients in the screening setting, who have half the risk. This does not necessarily mean that follow-up should be intensified or that screening should be less intensive; rather, it points out that there is a lot to be gained from personalization. Personalizing screening is of increasing interest and is currently being studied [34, 35].

Furthermore, there are some differences between screening and follow-up, as for example, women with…

### Stereotactic and sonographic large-core biopsy of nonpalpable breast lesions: Results of the Radiologic Diagnostic Oncology Group V study [^116ksDaa]. Academic Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of stereotactically and sonographically guided core biopsy (CB) for diagnosing nonpalpable breast lesions, a study was conducted.

Twenty-two institutions enrolled 2,403 women who underwent imaging-guided fine needle aspiration followed by imaging-guided large-CB of nonpalpable breast abnormalities. All mammograms were reviewed for study eligibility by one of two breast imaging radiologists. The protocol for image-guided biopsy, using either ultrasound (USCB) or stereotactic (SCB) guidance, was standardized across all institutions, and all biopsy specimens were over-read by one of three expert pathologists. Patients with atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), atypical lobular hyperplasia, or lobular neoplasia on CB underwent surgical excision. Patients with a negative CB but suspicious ("discordant") pre-biopsy mammography also underwent surgical excision. Patients with a negative CB that was concordant with pre-biopsy mammography suspicion were assigned to follow-up mammography at 6, 12, and 24 months following CB.

A gold standard diagnosis based on definitive histopathologic diagnosis, mammography follow-up, or an imputed gold standard diagnosis was established for 1,681 patients. Of 310 cases with a gold standard diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma, 261 (84.2%) were invasive carcinoma, 31 (10%) were ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), four (1.3%) were ADH, one (0.3%) was a non-breast cancer, and 13 (4.2%) were benign on CB. For 138 cases with a gold standard diagnosis of DCIS, 113 (81.9%) were DCIS.

### Prioritizing screening mammograms for immediate interpretation and diagnostic evaluation on the basis of risk for recall [^112BjXB4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Screening mammography reduces breast cancer mortality, but this benefit must be weighed against potential harms. The most common potential harm for women is being recalled for additional workup, which occurs in approximately 12% of screening mammograms, the majority of which are false-positive findings. Overall, 36% to 56% of women may expect to experience at least one false-positive recall over 10 years of annual or biennial screening. Being recalled for additional imaging leads to anxiety, requires women to return for another visit, and incurs financial strain and opportunity costs. Having to schedule additional imaging on a future date also contributes to delays in diagnosis for women with cancer and the possibility of women not returning, which may result in even longer delays in diagnosis.

Some facilities now offer immediate interpretation of screening mammograms while women wait and provide diagnostic imaging workup as needed during the same visit. This approach may greatly reduce psychological anxiety associated with the anticipation of additional imaging evaluation and decrease gaps in follow-up care among women who would not return for additional imaging at a later date. For facilities that can only offer immediate interpretation to a subset of women, prioritizing those most likely to be recalled may considerably reduce the number of women being recalled for diagnostic imaging at a follow-up visit. Prior research has shown higher recall rates on baseline mammograms and in younger women or those with longer screening intervals and a family history of breast cancer.

### Screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities: ACOG practice bulletin, number 226 [^113GaYH6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for prenatal screening for chromosomal abnormalities, specifically concerning further evaluation, ACOG/SMFM 2020 guidelines recommend providing genetic counseling and conducting a comprehensive ultrasound evaluation. This should be accompanied by an opportunity for diagnostic testing to confirm results in patients with a positive screening test result for fetal aneuploidy.

### Determination of factors associated with upstage in atypical ductal hyperplasia to identify low-risk patients where active surveillance may be an alternative [^112M1y11]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

Radiologic and procedural factors collected included:

- **Lesion characteristics**: lesion size, lesion morphology, and distribution on mammography.
- **Core biopsy needle caliber**: small (11–18 gauge), large (7–9 gauge).
- **Type of image guidance**: stereotactic versus ultrasound.

Existing pre and post-biopsy mammograms for all subjects were prospectively reexamined by a board-certified breast radiologist on high-resolution monitors from stored electronic image files to confirm various features:

- **Lesion size**: single greatest dimension of calcification/mass.
- **Calcification morphology**: benign, amorphous, coarse heterogeneous, fine pleomorphic, fine linear, fine linear branching.
- **Calcification distribution**: diffuse, regional, grouped, linear, segmental.
- **Proportion of lesion biopsied**:
	- 10% or less of the lesion removed
	- 11–50% of lesion removed
	- 51–89% of lesion removed
	- 90% or greater of the lesion removed

Each radiologist performing the reexamination of films underwent brief training on definitions and coding of lesional size and proportion biopsied. Calcification morphology and distribution patterns were classified using the descriptors outlined by the American College of Radiology.

Pathologic factors included histologic results from the core needle biopsy report:

- **Suspicion and findings**: suspicion of ductal carcinoma in situ, number of ADH foci, presence of lobular or flat epithelial atypia.

Figure 1 depicted radiographic examples of calcification distribution, such as a grouped pattern in a right mediolateral view of a 62-year-old woman, who presented with grouped calcifications in the right breast and underwent stereotactic biopsy.

### Does digital mammography suppose an advance in early diagnosis? Trends in performance indicators 6 years after digitalization [^113Wd2aW]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

The screening program maintains mammogram registers with data from participants and the final outcome of the screening. Two results of a screening test are possible: normal findings, for which screening mammography at 2 years is recommended, and abnormal findings, which require further assessments to confirm or exclude malignancy. If a tumor is found after further assessments — either ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive cancer — the result is considered a true positive. Otherwise, the result is considered a false positive.

Further assessments can include non-invasive procedures such as additional mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging, as well as invasive procedures like fine-needle aspiration, core-needle biopsy, and open biopsy. Once a malignant tumor is histologically confirmed, the woman is referred to a hospital for treatment and follow-up. These women are not invited to further screenings.

After a negative result in a screening episode, with or without further assessments, a woman may still be diagnosed with interval breast cancer before the next screening invitation. Interval cancers were identified by merging data from the screening program register with data from the hospital-based cancer registry and through telephone contact with women who underwent mammography in the last scheduled screening. This procedure accounted for 98% of women lost to follow-up from the program. In our study, we extended the definition of interval cancer until the 30th month, because each screening round can last up to 6 months.

### Follow-up strategies for women treated for early breast cancer [^115W92xA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Follow-up examinations are commonly performed after primary treatment for women with breast cancer and are used to detect recurrences at an early (asymptomatic) stage. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2000.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of different policies of follow-up for distant metastases on mortality, morbidity, and quality of life in women treated for stage I, II, or III breast cancer.

- **Search methods**: For this 2014 review update, we searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register (4 July 2014), MEDLINE (4 July 2014), Embase (4 July 2014), CENTRAL (2014, Issue 3), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (4 July 2014), and ClinicalTrials.gov (4 July 2014). References from retrieved articles were also checked.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of different policies of follow-up after primary treatment were reviewed for inclusion.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility for inclusion in the review and risk of bias. Data were pooled in an individual patient data meta-analysis for the two RCTs testing the effectiveness of different follow-up schemes. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age, tumour size, and lymph node status.

- **Main results**: Since 2000, one new trial has been published. The updated review now includes five RCTs involving 4023 women with breast cancer (clinical stage I, II, or III). Two trials involving 2563 women compared follow-up based on clinical assessment and imaging versus clinical assessment alone.

### Prioritizing screening mammograms for immediate interpretation and diagnostic evaluation on the basis of risk for recall [^1134dR45]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

We used data from 126 US-based radiology facilities in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) to identify subgroups of mammograms with combinations of individual characteristics including age, family history of breast cancer, prior false-positive recall, prior benign biopsy result, breast density, time since prior mammogram, and screening modality associated with very high, high, moderate, and low recall rates. Radiology facilities could use our results to schedule women for immediate mammographic interpretation and possible same-day diagnostic evaluation based on their capacity to do so.

- **Prioritization by capacity**:
	- Facilities with the capacity to offer immediate interpretation to only 5% of mammograms could prioritize first mammograms, which consistently had the highest recall rates of 20% to 23%. Facilities with the capacity to offer immediate interpretation to 9% of mammograms could add mammograms in women with ≥ 5 years since the prior mammogram. Those with the capacity to offer immediate interpretation to 20% of screening mammograms could add women < 50 years of age with 1 to 4 years since the prior mammogram and dense breasts.

- **Simplified prioritization for scheduling**:
	- If facilities prefer a simpler prioritization method to alleviate the burden on the scheduling team eliciting health history questions from the patient or the medical records, they could additionally prioritize all women < 50 years of age regardless of breast density. This would include the small group of women < 50 years of age with fatty breasts (0.8%) despite being at low risk for recall, thereby considerably reducing the number of women being recalled for diagnostic imaging at a follow-up visit.

### Frequency and predictive value of a mammographic recommendation for short-interval follow-up [^115Evgx6]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2003). Low credibility.

A recommendation for short-interval follow-up of "probably benign finding" is associated with up to 11% of screening mammograms, but its predictive value for breast cancer is unclear. We examined the predictive values (i.e. the percentage of women with a diagnosis of breast cancer 2 years following a short-interval follow-up recommendation) and likelihood ratios (derived from the pretest and post-test odds of breast cancer in the Women's Health Initiative sample) for breast cancer that are associated with a recommendation for short-interval follow-up among postmenopausal women.

- **Methods**: We performed a longitudinal analysis of a prospective cohort of 68,126 postmenopausal women (aged 50–79 years) who were participating in clinical trials as part of the Women's Health Initiative at 40 centers across the United States. Eligible participants had screening mammograms at baseline and at least 2 years of follow-up that included a repeat mammography. Outcomes measured were breast cancer events at 1 and 2 years after baseline and the results of subsequent mammograms. All P values were two-sided.

- **Results**: A total of 2,927 (5%) of the 58,408 eligible women had baseline mammograms that included recommendations for short-interval follow-up. The incidence of breast cancer for women with a short-interval follow-up recommendation was 1.0% at 2 years after the baseline mammogram compared with breast cancer incidences of 0.6% and 0.5% for women whose baseline mammograms were described as "benign" and "negative", respectively. Across the 40 participating centers, the prevalence of short-interval follow-up recommendations varied.

### A consensus statement on acromegaly therapeutic outcomes [^113Zayaa]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2018). High credibility.

### Study protocol: Childhood outcomes of fetal genomic variants: The prenatal microarray (PALM) cohort study [^115yyCk7]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

The translation plan for this research will depend on the final results. We anticipate that there may be new recommendations for clinical practice, including the structured follow-up for children diagnosed prenatally with VUS. Parents will be offered the option of re-analysis of the CMA result after the child reaches two years of postnatal age. Additionally, development of patient information resources for pregnant women and their partners will be prioritized after receiving a result of uncertain significance. Furthermore, existing genomic annotation resources, such as the Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in Humans using Ensembl (DECIPHER), will be updated with new genotype-phenotype correlations.

- **Potential risks related to study conduct**: Creation of new clinically relevant information during the study presents several potential opportunities for information to be disclosed that may require clinical action.

- **Poorer than expected results on the developmental assessments**: Participants will receive a summary report of their child's results by email or standard mail, as preferred, with a qualitative description of their child's scores. They will be encouraged to contact the study coordinator if they have concerns regarding the report. Additionally, they may have the full results sent to their child's healthcare provider or education provider following receipt of a signed consent form. If the participant requires a follow-up or a new referral to a clinical service, our study pediatrician or psychologist will facilitate this for them.

Reclassification of the child's genomic variant by the laboratory may bring benefits, such as reassurance if a VUS is reclassified.

### Breast ultrasound: Recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European Society of Breast Imaging [^111ycDSR]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

A recent study showed that the ability of US to detect breast cancers is comparable to that of mammography in asymptomatic women with heterogeneously or extremely dense breast tissue in at least one quadrant and at least one other risk factor for breast cancer, even though there is a trade-off in terms of a higher rate of false positive recall and biopsy. Disease-free and overall survival after detection with screening US were reported to be comparable with those after mammography in Chinese women. However, the performance of breast US in a population with a high prevalence of women with small and dense breasts cannot be translated to the European or American population. In summary, adjunctive US screening can detect biologically important cancers, but there is not sufficient evidence in favor of adopting adjunctive US screening as a general policy. Well-designed large studies with sufficient follow-up are needed.

When considering US screening, one relevant issue is the risk of false positive findings. Only fewer than one of ten biopsies prompted by US turns out to be malignant. The high rate of biopsy poses major problems when applying this method to a population every one or two years: every woman might undergo one or two biopsies during her lifetime. Moreover, US screening is more time-consuming than mammography for both the patient and the radiologist. Whereas breast US screening takes about 20 minutes to perform, the acquisition of a screening mammogram by a radiographer is completed in 5 minutes and it takes approximately 1–2 minutes to be interpreted by the radiologist.

### Contrast-enhanced mammography for the assessment of screening recalls: A two-centre study [^1159PdJW]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

The study's SA results were categorized according to the BI-RADS classification, and women were either referred for a biopsy or entered a two-year follow-up with routine screening mammography and/or breast ultrasound. Since the reader interpreting CEM had access to the original mammographic images — and because CEM low-energy images are technically equivalent to a standard mammographic exam in providing a morphologic evaluation of suspicious findings — CEM interpretation focused on the recombined images (rCEM) to investigate the added value of the functional information provided by these contrast-enhanced images.

- **Negative and positive findings**: On the basis of rCEM readings, the reader assessing CEM defined negative findings (i.e. those not needing a biopsy according to rCEM evaluation) and positive findings (those warranting a biopsy referral according to rCEM evaluation).

If the reader interpreting CEM identified suspicious lesions different from those that prompted the recall and required a dedicated work-up, this information was disclosed to the colleague performing SA. The work-up of these additional abnormalities was immediately performed according to the clinical practice currently used for additional findings at breast CE-MRI, such as targeted ultrasound, additional mammograms/tomosynthesis views, and image-guided biopsy.

- **Study design considerations**: Of note, as this design aims to evaluate the potential of rCEM to reduce the biopsy rate, CEM results could only be used to refer women to biopsy for suspicious findings that were not detectable at SA. Biopsies recommended by SA were always performed, even with negative rCEM results.

### Evaluation of abnormal mammography results and palpable breast abnormalities [^117CzBg3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Because approximately 1 in 10 women with a breast lump or abnormal mammography result will have breast cancer, a series of decisions must be taken by a primary care practitioner to exclude or establish a diagnosis of breast cancer among these women.

- **Purpose**: To determine the most accurate and least invasive means to evaluate an abnormal mammography result and a palpable breast abnormality.

- **Data source**: MEDLINE search (January 1966 to March 2003) for articles and reviews describing the accuracy of clinical examination, biopsy procedures, and radiographic examination for patients with abnormal mammography results or palpable breast abnormalities.

- **Study selection**: The authors reviewed abstracts and selected articles that provided relevant primary data. Studies were included if:
	1. Mammography, fine-needle aspiration biopsy, or core-needle biopsy was performed before a definitive diagnosis was obtained.
	2. The study sample included 100 or more women.
	3. Breast cancer status was determined from histopathology review of excisional biopsy specimens, from linkage with a state cancer registry or the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, or from clinical follow-up of 95% or more of the study sample.

- **Data extraction**: One investigator abstracted results. Methods were evaluated for major potential biases, but methodological scoring was not performed.

- **Data synthesis**: Likelihood ratios for first screening mammography were 0.1 for the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment category "negative or benign finding" and 1.2 for "probably benign" findings.

### Clinical utility of a hand-held scanner for breast cancer early detection and patient triage [^114Z1R9u]. JCO Global Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Methods - Study design**: This study was designed to assess whether iBE can be used to reduce the pool of women who need follow-up and diagnostic services by correctly screening out women with normal mammograms without missing patients with clinically significant invasive cancers. We hypothesized that iBE would adequately identify these normal or true negatives in this population, reported here as specificity. Those patients with abnormal findings on mammography — not limited to cancers — were classified as positive in this study. Adequate identification of positive patients in this population was reported here as sensitivity. As this was an asymptomatic screening population in a Western center, the study was not powered to determine cancer detection precision; however, our results for the few malignancies identified are reported below.

This single-site prospective nonrandomized study was approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board (protocol #821412) and the Abramson Cancer Center Clinical Trials Scientific Review Committee (University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center #24114). All patients signed informed consent forms before participation. Patients presenting to the University of Pennsylvania's imaging center for a screening, diagnostic, and interventional procedure were eligible to participate. Patients younger than age 18 years were excluded. Enrolled patients were brought to an exam room where first a bilateral iBE exam and then a bilateral CBE were performed by the same trained technologist who was blinded to all radiologic exam results.

### ACOG practice bulletin. Breast cancer screening. Number 42, April 2003 [^111miafm]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2003). Low credibility.

Early detection of breast cancer has been shown to decrease the mortality rate. Technology continues to evolve to improve the accuracy of detection. Additionally, the process of individual risk assessment is evolving, and new factors that affect risk are being identified. The purpose of this document is to clarify the rationale for breast cancer screening guidelines and evaluate the evidence regarding screening techniques. It also focuses on mammography and other detection techniques as screening tools to identify nonpalpable lesions; the use of mammography for diagnostic purposes when a lesion is palpated is addressed briefly.

### Breast ultrasound: Recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European Society of Breast Imaging [^116BeaC3]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Clear instructions and explanations regarding the entire procedure should be provided to the woman. The optimal protocol for performing breast ultrasound requires the patient to lie in the supine position with the chest undressed and with arms flexed behind the head to flatten the breast, or in the oblique position for scanning the lateral part of the breast and, when needed, the axilla. Breast ultrasound can even be performed in women who cannot lie down or flex the arms behind the head, although under these conditions it becomes more difficult to perform the examination, and the results might be suboptimal.

A clinical ultrasound scanner with dedicated linear probes working from 10 to 15–18 MHz for the superficial details or small breasts, and from 4 to 8 MHz for deeper areas or very large breasts, should be employed. A contact gel is always applied to the breast to allow the ultrasound waves to be sent from the probe to the breast tissues. The probe is placed on the breast and moved in multiple directions, with gentle pressure that makes the ultrasound usually painless and well-tolerated.

Importantly, for many indications, breast ultrasound is aimed at evaluating specific clinical findings or findings detected through other imaging modalities. In many cases, only a unilateral, targeted breast ultrasound examination is performed and not a bilateral whole breast ultrasound. Thus, whether both breasts, only one breast, or just a part of one breast will be scanned depends on the indication, mammographic breast density, and local policies. The axilla will be scanned in women with clinical or radiological abnormalities detected.

### Estrace [^114qntrG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Use of estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.

- **Ovarian cancer**: The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77 to 3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years.

A meta-analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women who used hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer. The primary analysis, using case-control comparisons, included 12,110 cancer cases from the 17 prospective studies. The relative risks associated with the use of hormonal therapy were 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32 to 1.50); there was no difference in the risk estimates by duration of the exposure (less than 5 years [median of 3 years] vs. greater than 5 years [median of 10 years] of use before the cancer diagnosis). The relative risk associated with combined and recent use (discontinued use within 5 years before cancer diagnosis) was 1.37 (95% CI 1.27 to 1.48), and the elevated risk was significant for both estr.

### Evaluating the age-based recommendations for long-term follow-up in breast cancer [^117CPium]. The Oncologist (2020). Low credibility.

The follow-up in The Netherlands consists of annual follow-up visits in the hospital for a minimum of five years, with clinical examination and mammography [3]. This is comparable to follow-up schedules in other countries, such as the UK [11], Australia [12], and the US [13]. Dutch recommendations on monitoring after five years of follow-up are based on consensus. The age after five years of follow-up determines the schedule: for women aged 75 years, the guideline suggests considering stopping follow-up.

With these age-based recommendations, implicit assumptions are made regarding the appropriate level of risk for the frequency of follow-up visits. It is uncertain whether the recommendations accurately capture the differences in developing a locoregional recurrence (LRR) or second primary (SP) between age groups after five years. Ideally, risk groups should clearly differentiate in risk, and the frequency of follow-up visits should match the recurrence risk, with higher-risk patients receiving more follow-up visits unless the aforementioned lack of value in follow-up becomes translated into practice.

Women without a history of breast cancer aged 50–75 years are invited by the national breast cancer screening program to undergo biennial screening. It is unclear how the risk for primary breast cancer in the healthy screening population and the corresponding recommendations relate to women with a history of breast cancer who are at risk for recurrence.

### Conclusions for mammography screening after 25-year follow-up of the Canadian National Breast Cancer Screening Study (CNBSS) [^117DWJLq]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Twenty-five-year follow-up data of the Canadian National Breast Cancer Screening Study (CNBSS) indicated no mortality reduction. What conclusions should be drawn? After conducting a systematic literature search and narrative analysis, we wish to recapitulate important details of this study, which may have been neglected. Sixty-eight percent of all included cancers were palpable, a situation that does not allow testing the value of early detection. Randomization was performed at the sites after palpation, while blinding was not guaranteed. In the first round, this "randomization" assigned 19 out of 24 late-stage cancers to the mammography group and only five to the control group, supporting the suspicion of severe errors in the randomization process. The responsible physicist rated mammography quality as "far below state of the art of that time". Radiological advisors resigned during the study due to unacceptable image quality, training, and medical quality assurance. Each described problem may strongly influence the results between study and control groups. Twenty-five years of follow-up cannot heal these fundamental problems. This study is inappropriate for evidence-based conclusions. The technology and quality assurance of the diagnostic chain is shown to be contrary to today's screening programmes, and the results of the CNBSS are not applicable to them.

- **Key points**:
	- The evidence base of the Canadian study (CNBSS) has to be questioned.
	- Severe flaws in the randomization process and test methods occurred.
	- Problems were criticized during and after conclusion of the trial.
