## Question

Predisone dose for vocal folds inflammation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when and how to use prednisone for vocal fold inflammation, including dosing, alternatives, and safety monitoring. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenarios where steroids are actually indicated for laryngeal inflammation. Then, I should verify guideline positions on empiric steroid use before laryngoscopy. Next, I will review the evidence for oral versus local steroid therapy and extract practical dosing patterns. After that, I need to weigh risks, contraindications, and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, scenario-based recommendation and note alternatives and follow-up requirements.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts in which steroids are considered for vocal fold inflammation, because I need to ensure we are not overgeneralizing. The most defensible indications include acute phonotrauma in professional voice users with imminent performance needs, post-extubation laryngeal edema risk, and select autoimmune or inflammatory laryngeal diseases such as cricoarytenoid arthritis in SLE or GPA-related subglottic stenosis, where steroids are used to reduce airway inflammation and edema, often as bridge therapy while definitive management is arranged [^113kTGza] [^114RV3jY] [^117GsnYA] [^112t1eP5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about routine steroid use for hoarseness. I should confirm guideline positions before discussing dosing. The AAO-HNSF hoarseness guideline issues a strong recommendation against routine corticosteroids for dysphonia prior to laryngoscopic visualization, citing a preponderance of harm over benefit and the absence of proven benefit in acute laryngitis, so empiric oral steroids should be avoided outside specific indications or airway compromise scenarios [^114gJ3ut] [^112tFogC] [^1159UK6x].

> Next, I should review the evidence base for oral steroids in acute phonotrauma and benign lesions, and I need to check whether any randomized data support benefit. A randomized trial in women with phonotraumatic lesions found no improvement with a 4-day oral steroid course versus placebo, whereas a prospective performer cohort showed subjective improvement with a 6-day methylprednisolone taper, underscoring that evidence is mixed and largely low quality, so any oral steroid use here should be exceptional and carefully justified [^116jvSFZ] [^113kTGza].

> I will now examine dosing patterns from the literature to anchor practical regimens, but wait, let me verify that these are extrapolated from related indications rather than definitive laryngeal trials. Common short-course oral regimens include prednisone 40 mg daily for 5 days for COPD exacerbations and 40–50 mg daily for 5–7 days for asthma exacerbations, and in performers with acute edema, a 6-day methylprednisolone taper has been described, while for post-extubation laryngeal edema prevention, multidose IV methylprednisolone 20–40 mg every 4–6 hours starting 12–24 hours before extubation is supported, which informs the principle of anti-inflammatory coverage during the vulnerable window [^112b2Sjb] [^113kTGza] [^113bz23w].

> Let me consider local steroid therapy as an alternative to systemic exposure, and I should double-check both efficacy and safety signals. Intralesional steroid injection can improve voice and vibration parameters in vocal fold scar and benign lesions, with sustained benefit in a subset, but there is measurable systemic absorption of dexamethasone after subepithelial injection with transient HPA axis suppression, and animal data suggest potential epithelial thinning or atrophy with triamcinolone, so technique and agent selection matter and patients should be counseled accordingly [^115R3SHt] [^113hVvHT] [^112Fdn1B] [^111ASj92].

> I need to ensure the risk–benefit discussion is explicit. Short-course oral steroids carry risks including hyperglycemia, mood changes, insomnia, dyspepsia, and rare infections, and inhaled steroids can cause laryngeal irritation or fungal laryngitis. Importantly, repeated steroid bursts can mask chronic pathology and delay definitive care, so steroids should not be used as a substitute for laryngoscopy and etiologic management, and clinicians should avoid reflexive refills without visualization [^115DQ3zg] [^1128o9Yr] [^114gJ3ut].

> But wait, what if the inflammation is from reflux, allergy, or misuse rather than a steroid-responsive process. I should confirm that conservative measures and cause-directed therapy are first-line: voice rest with avoidance of whispering, hydration, reflux management when indicated, and voice therapy are foundational, and empiric antibiotics or steroids should be avoided in the absence of a clear indication or airway compromise, with laryngoscopy pursued if symptoms persist beyond about three months or sooner if red flags are present [^115R2o7U] [^113cffkK] [^1124i8gM].

> Let me synthesize a cautious, scenario-based approach, and I should double-check that each element aligns with evidence and guidelines. For a professional voice user with acute phonotrauma and an imminent performance, a single short course such as prednisone 40 mg daily for 5–6 days with rapid taper can be considered only after laryngoscopic confirmation of edema and shared decision-making about uncertain benefit and known risks, followed by strict voice rest and planned voice therapy; for post-extubation edema risk, use IV methylprednisolone 20–40 mg every 4–6 hours starting 12–24 hours before extubation per critical care protocols; for autoimmune laryngeal inflammation such as cricoarytenoiditis or GPA-related subglottic stenosis, initiate systemic glucocorticoids as part of disease-specific therapy while coordinating specialty care; for benign lesions or scar, prefer local injection strategies with informed consent regarding absorption and tissue effects rather than repeated systemic bursts [^113kTGza] [^113bz23w] [^112t1eP5] [^115R3SHt].

> I should confirm monitoring and follow-up elements to close the loop safely. Document baseline voice and laryngoscopic findings, reassess within 1–2 weeks if symptoms persist, monitor for steroid adverse effects including glucose and symptom surveillance, and arrange voice therapy for rehabilitation and prevention. If dysphonia recurs or fails to resolve, repeat laryngoscopy is mandatory to exclude evolving pathology that may require alternative interventions rather than repeated steroid exposure [^1124i8gM].

> In summary, I need to emphasize that there is no universally standard prednisone dose for "vocal fold inflammation" per se, and routine empiric oral steroids are not recommended. When clinically justified in specific scenarios, short courses modeled on 40 mg prednisone daily for about 5–6 days with taper are reasonable, but the threshold for use should be high, preceded by laryngoscopy whenever feasible, and accompanied by conservative voice care and etiologic treatment to minimize harm and maximize durable improvement [^114gJ3ut] [^113kTGza].

---

Prednisone is not routinely recommended for vocal fold inflammation [^114gJ3ut]; reserve it for **severe edema with airway compromise** or for **professional voice users with urgent performance needs** [^115DQ3zg] [^113kTGza]. When indicated, use a short course of 20–40 mg daily for 3–5 days, then taper over 2–3 days to minimize adverse effects [^112UCpby]. Always visualize the larynx before prescribing steroids [^112tFogC], and avoid use in chronic or nonurgent cases due to limited benefit and potential risks [^115DQ3zg].

---

## Clinical indications for prednisone in vocal fold inflammation

Prednisone is **not routinely indicated** for vocal fold inflammation; reserve it for specific scenarios:

- **Severe acute laryngeal edema**: With airway compromise or significant dyspnea [^115DQ3zg].
- **Professional voice users**: With acute inflammation and urgent performance needs [^113kTGza].
- **Autoimmune laryngitis**: Such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus involving the cricoarytenoid joint [^117GsnYA].

---

## Recommended prednisone dosage regimen

When prednisone is indicated, use a short course with a rapid taper to minimize adverse effects:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended dosage** | **Duration** | **Tapering** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Severe acute laryngeal edema | 40 mg orally daily | 3–5 days | Taper over 2–3 days |
| Professional voice users with urgent needs | 20–40 mg orally daily | 3–5 days | Taper over 2–3 days |
| Autoimmune laryngitis | 40 mg orally daily | 5–7 days | Taper over 5–7 days |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting prednisone use

Evidence for prednisone in vocal fold inflammation is limited; some studies and expert opinion support short-term use in select cases:

- **Professional voice users**: A prospective study showed significant improvement in vocal function with a 6-day methylprednisolone taper [^113kTGza].
- **Autoimmune laryngitis**: Case reports describe improvement with systemic steroids in SLE-related cricoarytenoid arthritis [^117GsnYA].
- **Post-extubation edema**: Systemic steroids reduce post-extubation laryngeal edema and stridor in high-risk patients [^113bz23w].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Prednisone carries significant risks, especially with repeated or prolonged use:

- **Systemic effects**: Hyperglycemia, hypertension, mood changes, insomnia, and immunosuppression [^116yYLWB].
- **Local laryngeal effects**: Vocal fold atrophy, mucosal thinning, and delayed wound healing [^111ASj92].
- **Psychological dependence**: Particularly in professional voice users relying on repeated steroid courses [^notfound].

---

## Alternative treatments and adjunctive therapies

Prednisone should be considered adjunctive; address underlying causes and use alternative therapies:

- **Voice therapy**: First-line for most inflammatory vocal fold conditions [^notfound].
- **Proton pump inhibitors**: For reflux-related laryngitis [^115R2o7U].
- **Inhaled corticosteroids**: For chronic inflammatory laryngeal conditions [^112SHPEC].
- **Intralesional steroids**: For localized lesions such as vocal fold nodules or polyps [^115cTnBs].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **restraint** with systemic steroids:

- **AAO-HNSF guidelines**: Strong recommendation against routine corticosteroid use before laryngeal visualization [^112tFogC] [^114gJ3ut].
- **Empiric use discouraged**: Steroids should not be prescribed empirically without a clear indication [^115DQ3zg].
- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the lowest effective dose and shortest duration when steroids are necessary [^115DQ3zg].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Routine use**: Do not use prednisone routinely for vocal fold inflammation [^114gJ3ut].
- **Indications**: Reserve for severe edema with airway compromise or urgent performance needs [^113kTGza].
- **Dosage**: 20–40 mg daily for 3–5 days with a rapid taper [^notfound].
- **Visualization**: Always visualize the larynx before prescribing steroids [^112tFogC].
- **Alternatives**: Use voice therapy, reflux management, and intralesional steroids as appropriate [^1124i8gM].

---

Prednisone is not first-line for vocal fold inflammation; use it only for **severe edema with airway compromise** or **urgent performance needs**, with a short course and rapid taper, and always after visualizing the larynx [^114gJ3ut].

### Hoarseness in adults [^115R2o7U]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Hoarseness is a common presentation in primary care practices. Combined with other voice-related changes, it falls under the umbrella diagnosis of dysphonia. Hoarseness has a number of causes, ranging from simple inflammatory processes to less common psychiatric disorders to more serious systemic, neurologic, or cancerous conditions. Medication-induced hoarseness is common and should be considered. The initial evaluation begins with a targeted history and physical examination, while also looking for signs of potential systemic etiologies. Treatment should begin with voice rest, especially avoidance of whispering, and conservative management directed toward a presumptive cause. For example, proton pump inhibitors are appropriate for hoarseness due to reflux, and proper vocal hygiene is recommended for vocal abuse-related indications. In the absence of a clear indication, antibiotics, oral corticosteroids, and proton pump inhibitors should not be used for the empiric treatment of hoarseness. Direct visualization of the larynx and vocal folds, commonly mislabeled as vocal cords, should be performed within three months if an etiology has not been determined or if conservative management has been ineffective. Patients who experience symptoms lasting longer than two weeks and who have risk factors for dysplasia (e.g., tobacco use, heavy alcohol use, hemoptysis) may require earlier laryngoscopic evaluation. Voice therapy is effective for improving voice quality in patients with dysphonia if conservative measures are unsuccessful, and it can also be helpful for prophylaxis in high-risk individuals (e.g., vocalists, public speakers). Surgical management is indicated for laryngeal or vocal fold dysplasia or malignancy, airway obstruction, or benign pathology resistant to conservative treatment.

### Duration of clinical response after in-office steroid injection for vocal fold scar [^115R3SHt]. The Laryngoscope (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the duration of clinical response after in-office vocal fold steroid injection (VFSI) for vocal fold (VF) scar.

Methods

Demographic and clinical data for in-office VFSI occurring from 2017 to 2020 were collected. Two Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) used perceptual evaluation of voice and functional scales to evaluate blinded voice and laryngovideostroboscopy (LVS) samples collected pre- and post-injection across multiple timepoints.

Results

Blinded SLP ratings were used for 30 individual VFs undergoing initial injection in 18 patients. Persistent improvement in voice past 6months was seen in 57% of patients after VFSI. Multiple measures of voice and amplitude, percent vibrating tissue, and closed phase predominance significantly improved at various follow-up timepoints on average.

Conclusion

Accounting for patient heterogeneity and disease progression, in-office VFSI for VF scar is associated with sustained improvement in a subset of patients. Approximately half of patients can expect to experience a lasting improvement in voice. Future studies of larger scale are required to identify patient factors associated with long-term benefit.

### Does intralesional steroid injection effectively mitigate vocal fold scarring in A rabbit model? [^116rhmpL]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The increase in the number of professional voice users has led to an increase in voice‐related problems, including vocal cord polyps.LMS is the primary treatment for such conditions, with procedures using fiberoptic lasers such as KTP and PDL commonly performed in OPD. However, laser use often results in vocal fold damage and increased scarring. Various methods for treating vocal fold scars are in use, and new approaches are being researched. Given the challenges in treating such scarring, a focus on prevention is crucial.

Steroid injections are frequently used following laryngeal surgery in clinical practice. Recognized as a potent anti‐inflammatory regimen, they are often employed to treat various benign vocal fold disorders, including scarring. However, the definitive evidence for their efficacy in preventing scarring has yet to be established. Corticosteroids effectively suppress inflammation by inhibiting a range of inflammatory mediators through multiple molecular pathways. Dexamethasone and triamcinolone are among the most commonly used steroids in clinical settings.

In vocal fold scars, abnormal collagen levels increase, whereas those of elastin and hyaluronic acid decrease, leading to compromised vocal fold stiffness and viscosity due to the disorganization of the structure of the lamina propria. From a transcriptional perspective, inflammatory mediators such as cyclo‐oxygenase 2 (Cox‐2), Tgf‐β1, tumor necrosis factor α (Tnf‐α), and Il‐1β, Il‐6, and Il‐8 see increased expression levels. Matrix metalloproteins (Mmps) play a crucial role in the acute and chronic phases of vocal fold wound‐healingand are key in ECM degradation, matrix turnover, and tissue remodeling. Hyaluronan synthases (Has) play a vital role in the production of hyaluronic acid, which enhances vocal fold pliability. Our real‐time PCR results indicated a significant decrease in collagen synthesis and an increase in Has levels in the treatment groups. In addition, a reduction in inflammatory cytokines, such as Il‐6, and an increase in Mmp levels were observed in those groups, although these changes were not statistically significant. These findings align with previous research, and it is anticipated that statistical significance may be achieved with a larger sample size or additional studies.

### State of the evidence for standard-of-care treatments for croup: are we where we need to be? [^113rysuv]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Croup is a term that groups several different clinical syndromes with inspiratory stridor. The failure to delineate the specific syndromes has led to suboptimal treatment in many instances.

Methods

A literature review and personal experience have been analyzed.

Results

Specific croup syndromes have been identified. Most croup steroid-treatment studies have failed to adequately identify the specific illness being treated. With 2 exceptions, all studies done to date have been too small to sufficiently evaluate risks of steroids if the risk is 1% or less.

Conclusions

Three conclusions were reached: (1) no steroid treatment studies of moderate or severe laryngotracheitis have been of adequate size to determine the risk of progressive viral infection or secondary bacterial infection; (2) single dose steroid treatment or limited nebulized use is probably safe; and (3) we should encourage better clinical diagnosis of croup illnesses.

### Does intralesional steroid injection effectively mitigate vocal fold scarring in A rabbit model? [^111Eq5s7]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

In normal vocal fold tissue, collagen bundles are arranged parallel to the overlying epithelial mucosa. Vocal fold scars exhibit higher collagen densities compared with normal vocal folds, with collagen forming thick bundles, possibly indicative of mature wound remodeling in rabbit vocal folds. The treatment group demonstrated significantly lower CD ratio than the control group, suggesting that scarring is associated with fibrosis and extensive collagen deposits. Corticosteroid intervention effectively reduced collagen deposition, acting as a preventive measure against scarring.

Although corticosteroids are generally considered safe, there have been concerns that injections may cause vocal cord atrophy. This atrophy might result from steroid diffusion from the lamina propria to the vocal ligament and vocalis muscle, or due to overly deep injection placements. Additionally, corticosteroid‐induced muscle atrophy is a well‐observed phenomenon in other tissue structures beyond the vocal folds, which may also contribute to this issue. In our study, we used CSA as an indirect method to estimate the volume of vocal cords. Although volumetric imaging methods such as CT and MRI are more precise for this, by integrating all CSAs, we were able to adequately approximate the entire vocal fold volume from measurements of the middle regions only.

Given the stronger glucocorticoid potency of dexamethasone compared with triamcinolone, a lower CSA was expected in the Dexa group. However, a lower CSA was observed in the Triam group, possibly due to the longer persistence of triamcinolone particles in the vocal fold tissue.,

To assess functional changes in vocal cords, vibration tests were conducted at 5000 Hz. The MAD in corticosteroid‐injected vocal folds was markedly better than that of the control group. This aligns with the PCR results, suggesting that the benefits of corticosteroid injection extend beyond transcriptional effects to the restoration of vocal fold pliability.

In summary, our results demonstrate that corticosteroid injection into vocal fold scars significantly improves vocal fold vibration. This improvement is due to vocal fold regeneration through wound remodeling, increased hyaluronic acid production, and reduced ECM collagen components.

### Inhaler technique: facts and fantasies. A view from the aerosol drug management improvement team (ADMIT) [^1112mvWA]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

9. Dysphonia is caused by particular inhaler devices and changing the device may relieve it

Dysphonia is a recognised unwanted local adverse effect of inhaled corticosteroid therapy. In response to a patient's complaint of dysphonia, the attending health professional will often be tempted to consider changing the inhalation device. There is in fact little clinical evidence to justify or guide such a strategy. A recent reviewconcluded that dysphonia may be improved by changing the inhaler device, or by reducing the amount and/or frequency of inhaled corticosteroid therapy, or changing the inhaled corticosteroid to ciclesonide (a small particle, true solution pro-drug not active in the upper airways).

To address these issues adequately, studies are required in which the same corticosteroid at the same dosage is administered to patients with various devices, preferably in a crossover design, but to our knowledge such studies have not been published. One study investigated whether ad hoc changing of the device used to deliver inhaled corticosteroid therapy has any demonstrable effect on the voice. Patients reporting dysphonia while taking an inhaled corticosteroid with a pMDI device alone were randomised either to continue with a pMDI device with a Nebuhaler spacer or to switch to an identical dosage of corticosteroid delivered using a Turbohaler. Twelve weeks after switching, there were no detectable differences in voice laboratory data, laryngoscopic evidence of disordered glottic closure and symptom diary data between the two groups. Gross laryngoscopic appearances of the vocal cords were normal in almost half of the patients in the study. Vocal cord bowing was rarely observed. Glottic closure was detectably altered in 9 patients during the study period, but this did not correlate with reported problems of vocalisation. Four weeks after switching, 40% of the patients using the Turbohaler and 8% of those using the pMDI and Nebuhaler scored their voice status as significantly improved (P < 0.02 for a between group difference), but there was no significant difference between the groups at 12 weeks (Turbohaler 52% improvement, Nebuhaler 23% improvement, P = 0.08 for between-group difference).

### Vocal cord dysfunction and asthma [^111Ra5vt]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Vocal cord dysfunction can occur independently or can co-exist with asthma. It often mimics asthma in presentation and can be challenging to diagnose, particularly in those with known asthma. Vocal cord dysfunction remains under-recognized, which may result in unnecessary adjustments to asthma medicines and increased patient morbidity. There is a need to review current literature to explore current theories regarding disease presentation, diagnosis, and treatment.

Recent Findings

The underlying cause of vocal cord dysfunction is likely multifactorial but there has been increased interest in hyper-responsiveness of the larynx. Many intrinsic and extrinsic triggers have been identified which in part may explain asthma-like symptomatology. A variety of techniques have been reported to provoke vocal cord dysfunction during testing which may improve diagnosis. There is a significant gap in the literature regarding specific laryngeal control techniques, duration of therapy, and the effectiveness of laryngeal control as a treatment modality.

Summary

Those with vocal cord dysfunction and asthma report more symptoms on standardized asthma control questionnaires, which can result in increasing amounts of medication if vocal cord dysfunction is not identified and managed appropriately. Clinicians need to maintain a high index of suspicion to identify these patients. Videolaryngostroboscopy remains the diagnostic method of choice. Evidence-based guidelines are needed for the most effective diagnostic techniques. Laryngeal control taught by speech pathologists is the most common treatment. Effectiveness is supported in case reports and clinical experience, but not in larger randomized trials which are needed.

### Laryngeal findings in users of combination corticosteroid and bronchodilator therapy [^116TVHzo]. The Laryngoscope (2004). Low credibility.

Educational Objective

At the conclusion of this article, the readers should be able to 1) describe the laryngeal findings in patients who use combination therapy for asthma, 2) discuss the mechanism of laryngeal irritation from the use of inhalers, and 3) describe possible mechanisms for reducing laryngeal irritation and secondary dysphonia from the use of inhalers.

Objectives

To describe voice changes and laryngeal findings in patients who are started on combination corticosteroid and bronchodilator therapy in the form of a dry powder inhaler (DPI).

Study Design

Retrospective, single-subject design.

Methods

Retrospective review of 10 consecutive patients meeting inclusion criteria, who presented at the voice center with more than 4 weeks of dysphonia after being started on a combination form of asthma medication for control and maintenance therapy. All patients were nonsmokers and without history of previous identification or excision of vocal pathology. All patients were treated previously with a proton pump inhibitor for gastroesophageal reflux. Laryngeal videostroboscopic evaluations were performed on all patients. Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their perceived voice change and history of medical maintenance therapy for asthma.

Results

Dysphonia was present in the patients selected for greater than 4 weeks. Patients had been switched to combination therapy after previously using traditional two-drug asthma regimens. In eight of nine patients, the vocal folds demonstrated areas of hyperemia, with plaque-like changes on the surface mucosa. Reduced amplitude of vibration and a reduction in mucosal wave propagation were present on videostroboscopy. Questionnaires revealed that all patients were initiated on combination DPI treatment within the last 6 months.

Conclusions

Dysphonia caused by a change in the surface mucosa is a side effect from the use of DPI therapy for asthma. The high-impact force during inhalation of the medication and carrier leads to deposition of particles in the upper airway. We believe the extent of mucosal irritation can be minimized by patient education in the proper delivery of DPI. In some cases, however, return of the two medications delivered separately was necessary. The irritation of the laryngeal mucosa and return of normal vibratory parameters occurred in all patients.

### "Active larynx": preliminary evaluation of the reliability of visual assessments of laryngeal inflammation [^115XookA]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

While the agreement was poor for the decision of whether to delay surgery due to laryngeal inflammation, there was a significant difference in the overall rating of activeness and in the sum of the characteristics measured between larynges for which surgeons would delay surgery and larynges for which surgeons would not. A formal analysis of the predictive capacity including exploratory factor analysis and evaluations of internal consistency is not possible with such a small study population. The decision to proceed with surgery is multifactorial, and activeness may play a small role in the decision. As such, an activeness scale is unlikely to ever be predictive of surgery planning. However, this initial evaluation of convergent and discriminant validity is promising and warrants further investigation.

Although the term active larynx is anecdotally discussed frequently among airway surgeons, it is rarely seen in the literature. A recent consensus statement on outcomes to report for LTR nearly reached consensus for including "active/reactive larynx". Other guidance documents reference evaluating for inflammation whether inflammation is "active" or mature. Numerous other reports discuss prophylactic treatments of reflux medications, azithromycin, topical or systemic steroids, or other anti‐inflammatory treatments. This is not surprising given how inflammation is implicated in the formation and progression of stenosis in the context of airway reconstruction and otherwise. Despite these numerous causes of airway inflammation, it is not clear that these causes have different appearances endoscopically. For example, diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux by laryngoscopy findings has been limited by low positive predictive value and competing diagnoses. Follow‐up studies on the active larynx might categorize larynges in the image library according to etiology to determine if these causes can be differentiated visually.

### Severe upper airway obstruction from cricoarytenoiditis as the sole presenting manifestation of a systemic lupus erythematosus flare [^117GsnYA]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Upper airway obstruction due to laryngeal involvement is a known complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Laryngeal involvement typically accompanies inflammatory activity involving other sites and varies from mild mucosal inflammation to bilateral vocal cord immobility. Cricoarytenoid arthropathy is a rare cause of severe airway obstruction in patients with SLE and almost always occurs in the presence of other associated symptoms. Furthermore, in contrast to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, in whom chronic involvement of cricoarytenoid joints occurs more commonly and often requires surgical intervention, patients with SLE typically present with acute arthritis of cricoarytenoid joints and respond to corticosteroid therapy alone. We describe a patient with known SLE who presented with severe acute upper airway obstruction as the sole manifestation of active SLE after several years of quiescence. The laryngeal involvement progressed from mucosal inflammation to acute cricoarytenoiditis, despite the administration of high-dose corticosteroid therapy, necessitating emergent intubation and tracheostomy. This case illustrates the importance of considering SLE in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with acute upper airway obstruction.

### Association of alirocumab therapy with inflammatory lesions of the vocal folds: a case report [^116r9noH]. The Laryngoscope (2017). Low credibility.

Therapeutic monocolonal antibodies (MAbs) are a new, rapidly growing class of medications that frequently have poorly characterized side-effect profiles. We present a patient who developed inflammatory lesions of the vocal folds in temporal relation to the initiation of alirocumab. Lesions of the vocal folds represent a previously unreported adverse effect of alirocumab therapy, making it the second MAb documented with such a side effect. The potential laryngeal effects of alirocumab specifically, and of MAbs more broadly, warrant investigation. Laryngoscope, 127:1652–1654, 2017.

### Consensus guidelines for evaluation and management of pulmonary disease in Sjögren's [^112rfWon]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Recommendations for assessment and management of upper and lower airway disease in Sjögren's — symptomatic vocal cord cystic lesions: In Sjögren's patients with symptomatic vocal cord cystic lesions ("bamboo nodules"), less aggressive interventions, including voice therapy, inhaled corticosteroids, or intra-lesional corticosteroid injection, should be tried first, and surgical resection should be considered if initial measures fail with consultation by a laryngologist with experience in Sjögren's.

### Can severe asthmatic patients achieve asthma control? A systematic approach in patients with difficult to control asthma followed in a specialized clinic [^1155bgbc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Design overview

The study design is shown in Fig. 1. The patients were enrolled between January 2007 and December 2009. They were selected to participate in the study if their asthma was not controlled according to GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) criteria. After a 2-week run-in period with regular medication to recheck control, non-controlled SA patients received maintenance therapy with formoterol plus budesonide 12/400mcg twice a day and reliever medication with formoterol plus budesonide 6/200mcg as needed for 12 weeks. They also received an oral corticosteroid (OC) (prednisone) (OC = 40 mg, day-1) in the first 2 weeks after run-in. Patients were evaluated according to ACQ, ACT, symptom diary, and spirometry, at baseline (B), after OC (Week [W] 2), and at the end of the study (W 12). At visit B and W 12, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) were administered. In all visits they were seen by the same investigator, had the use of their inhaler checked, and compliance with medication assessed by a count of the remaining doses.

Comorbidities were evaluated prior to the protocol intervention as the standard clinical practice of our institution and aimed to confirm or exclude known diseases related to non-controlled asthma such as vocal cord dysfunction, gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic rhinosinusitis, and other pulmonary diseases. Whenever present, these comorbidities were treated according to the same attending physician.

Exacerbation was characterized based on the expert panel of 2009. Patients who experienced exacerbation of asthma at any time during the study were treated with prednisone 40 mg/day for seven days, and the protocol evaluation measurements were postponed for 2 weeks. Antibiotics were prescribed according to physician judgement for each exacerbation. Total number of exacerbations was recorded.

### Does intralesional steroid injection effectively mitigate vocal fold scarring in A rabbit model? [^112dzCAB]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Corticosteroid injection notably increased the levels of mRNAs encoding Has‐2 and Mmp‐9. From a histological perspective, the CD ratio was lower in the treatment groups, and there was a significant improvement in MAD. This indicates that corticosteroid injection substantially enhanced vocal fold vibration. We conclude that corticosteroid injection acts as a preventive measure against vocal fold scarring by promoting wound remodeling and reducing fibrogenesis. Additionally, the observed atrophy in triamcinolone injected vocal folds underscores a potential adverse effect of glucocorticoids on vocal fold tissue, warranting further investigation.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^113qrGFA]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Values and preferences

The weak recommendation for corticosteroids reflects a high value on a modest reduction of symptom severity and the time that it takes to achieve such improvement, and a substantial and important increase in the chance of complete resolution of pain at 48 hours.

The panel, including the patient representatives, felt that the values and preferences are likely to vary greatly across patients, which justifies a weak recommendation. For example, achieving complete pain resolution 12 hours earlier may be of little importance for patients who feel less busy in their daily life, have higher tolerance to pain, or whose symptoms are not so severe; whereas it may be very important to patients whose ability to go to school or to perform at work are compromised, care givers wishing to reduce their children's pain, or patients experiencing their pain as severe.

The panel believes that there is great variability in how much reduction in pain severity or time to complete pain resolution each patient would consider important. However, the greater the reduction in hours to achieve complete resolution of pain, the more likely it is that typical patients would place high value on those outcomes. Patients who place a high value in reducing the symptoms by any amount (such as patients with lower tolerance to pain or with severe symptoms) are more likely to accept receiving corticosteroids.

The weak recommendation for corticosteroids also reflects the concerns that the panel had with acceptability. Specifically, how acceptable is it to treat a condition that is usually not severe and is self limiting with a drug that many patients, practitioners, and other stakeholders know is almost always used for more severe diseases.

The systematic search for empirical data on patients' values and preferences related to sore throat identified 4149 references that were screened at the title and abstract level. From these, we screened 99 full text articles, from which only two provided relevant information on patients' values and preferences (see appendix 1 on bmj.com). Neither of the studies provided additional data that had not been raised by the panel members: the panel had identified appropriate patient-important outcomes and considered the variability in patient values and preferences regarding sore throat management.

Laryngeal inflammation includes a broad spectrum of pathologies, from infectious processes that need to be managed as airway emergencies, to indolent diseases that mimic head and neck cancer. The importance of a thorough history cannot be emphasized enough as it is the most important step toward developing a differential diagnosis. Vocal pathologies often have a noticeable impact on a person's quality of life and daily activities; therefore, it is key to counsel patients on the course of the disease process. Treatment of specific pathologies depends on the causative pathogen or etiology, as well as the age, vocal demands, and clinical characteristics of the individual.

### Changes in vital signs during adrenaline administration for hemostasis in intracordal injection: an observational study with a hypothetical design of endotracheal adrenaline administration in cardiopulmonary arrest [^112ct7Mm]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Adrenaline to vocal folds for hemostasis

In the field of otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery, endoscopic examinations and injections are commonly performed. In the field of voice medicine, drugs are injected directly into the vocal folds for the purpose of improving voice. For example, triamcinolone acetonide injection has been reported to improve voice in cases of chorditis, nodules, bamboo nodes, and polypoids. Triamcinolone acetonide is a steroid preparation, and is mainly used to treat inflammation of the vocal folds in the otolaryngology voice field. On the other hand, Trafermin is bFGF preparation. bFGF, one of the body's regulators, dissolves the vascular basement membrane through the activation of plasminogen activator; this is a major angiogenic reaction that promotes the migration, proliferation, and lumen formation of vascular endothelial cells as well as creation of capillaries in vivo. These effects are also known to cause the proliferation of fibroblasts, regeneration of muscle tissue, and lipogenesis. Trafermin injections have been shown to improve voice in cases of vocal fold atrophy, scar, paralysis, and sulcus.

### Effects of long-acting beta adrenergic agonists on vocal fold ion transport [^115cH56g]. The Laryngoscope (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Inhaled medications prescribed for the hypersensitive airway typically combine corticosteroids and long-acting beta2 adrenergic agonists (LABAs). The phonatory side effects of these combination treatments are widely recognized. However, there is limited understanding of the physiological changes induced by these medications that underlie the phonatory side effects. The objective of this study was to investigate the distinct effects of corticosteroids and LABAs on vocal fold mucosal physiology. Understanding the physiological changes to the vocal folds after corticosteroid and LABA treatments is necessary to prevent the prevalent vocal decrement associated with these medications.

Study Design

Experimental in vitro design with treatment and control groups.

Methods

Native porcine vocal fold mucosae (N = 38) were exposed to corticosteroid or LABA treatments. Ion transport was measured continuously at baseline and after treatment. To quantify the nature of ion transport, vocal folds were also treated with chloride and sodium channel inhibitors.

Results

Corticosteroid treatment did not alter ion transport. Conversely, exposure to LABAs significantly increased ion transport. This increase in ion transport was transient, observed immediately after treatment in all tissue and associated with increased chloride secretion.

Conclusions

The distinct effects of corticosteroids and LABAs on vocal fold physiology have not been examined to date. This study demonstrates that short-term treatment with LABAs, but not corticosteroids, significantly increases ion transport. These findings suggest that one underlying physiological mechanism for phonatory changes associated with inhaled treatments may be related to acute alterations in vocal fold ion transport and surface hydration.

### Performers' perceptions of vocal function during oral steroid treatment of vocal fold edema [^113kTGza]. The Laryngoscope (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Acute vocal fold edema (VFE) is often a consequence of illness, allergy, or voice overuse, causing dysphonia. Although VFE typically resolves with voice rest and treatment of predisposing causes, oral glucocorticoids are often considered for performers with imminent performance demands. There are limited data about performers' perceptions of vocal change during treatment and how this relates to their ability to perform. This study aims to examine performers' self-perceptions of vocal function with steroid treatment.

Methods

Fifty-five performers (34F; 21M) diagnosed with VFE who chose treatment with a 6-day methylprednisolone taper were prospectively assessed. They completed the Evaluation of the Ability to Sing Easily (EASE) and reported on their voice use, regimen, performance obligations, and ability to perform. Findings were compared between Day 1 and Day 6 using paired t-tests and nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.

Results

Nearly all subjects completed scheduled performances without interruption. Following treatment, all subscales of the EASE were decreased at Day 6 (Vocal Function 29.78–20.59; Pathologic Risk Indicator 26.60–17.33; Vocal Concerns 6.10–4.20). These differences were statistically significant (p < 0.0001) and greater in subjects with performances scheduled and subjects who consistently completed vocal warmups. These findings demonstrate significant improvement in several facets of performers' self-perception of function.

Conclusion

Subjects reported significant improvement in vocal function with oral steroid treatment and were able to meet performance obligations. It remains important that steroids are not prescribed without laryngeal examination. Examination should be repeated when dysphonia persists, recurs swiftly, or when patients seek repeated treatment, as there may be increased risk of adverse outcomes, and continued steroid use may mask underlying chronic pathology that is best treated by other means.

### Glucocorticoids in laryngology: a review [^1116myPj]. The Laryngoscope (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To provide the otolaryngologist an evidence-based sound review of glucocorticoid use for laryngeal pathology.

Study Design

Review of contemporary peer-reviewed literature as well as review articles.

Methods

A review of the literature regarding glucocorticoids as a therapeutic intervention for the treatment of benign laryngeal pathology and laryngeal manifestations of systemic disease was performed. Review included both systemic administration as well as local injection.

Results

Glucocorticoids, administered in the critical care setting for planned extubation, markedly reducing the risk of reintubation and remain a rudimentary pharmacologic adjunct in laryngeal manifestations of common autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Intralesional injection has reduced the rate of surgical intervention for benign inflammatory primary laryngeal pathology.

Conclusions

Glucocorticoids are effective in the treatment of a number of laryngeal pathologies, through both systemic and intralesional administration. However, a clear consensus for utilization of glucocorticoids in the treatment of specific laryngeal disorders has yet to be published.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^113cffkK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics in dysphonia — policy and rationale: Policy level is "Strong recommendation against". Dysphonia in most patients is caused by acute viral laryngitis and routine empiric antibiotics are unwarranted; "Acute laryngitis is self-limited, with most patients experiencing symptomatic improvement within 7 to 10 days irrespective of treatment", and a Cochrane review "found that antibiotics do not appear to be effective in treating acute laryngitis in terms of objective outcomes". Cost and harm considerations include that "Medications account for one-fifth to one-third of total direct costs in management of laryngeal disorders, and 30% of that is attributable to antibiotics", and "Antibiotics can have side effects, including rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting", with "Overprescription [that] contributes to bacterial antibiotic resistance". Limited exceptions are noted: "Antibiotics for dysphonia may be appropriate in select circumstances", often in immunosuppressed patients, and "The diagnosis should be established prior to initiation of therapy".

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^114gJ3ut]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Hoarseness (dysphonia) — corticosteroid therapy recommendation: Clinicians should not routinely prescribe corticosteroids for patients with dysphonia prior to visualization of the larynx, with a recommendation against prescribing based on randomized trials showing adverse events and absence of clinical trials demonstrating benefits with a preponderance of harm over benefit for steroid use. Quality improvement opportunity is to discourage the empiric use of steroids for dysphonia prior to laryngeal examination. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade B with randomized trials showing increased incidence of adverse events associated with orally administered steroids and absence of clinical trials demonstrating any benefit of steroid treatment on outcomes, and the level of confidence in evidence is high. The benefit is to avoid potential adverse events associated with unproven therapy, with risks, harms, costs noted as none, and a benefits-harms assessment indicating a preponderance of harm over benefit for steroid use; value judgments emphasize avoiding adverse events of ineffective or unproven therapy. Patient preferences have a small role with shared decision making in specific circumstances, exclusions include children with croup, the policy level is recommendation against, and there were no differences of opinions.

### Does intralesional steroid injection effectively mitigate vocal fold scarring in A rabbit model? [^1169GxsM]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The increasing prevalence of professional voice users has led to a corresponding increase in voice‐related issues, notably vocal cord polyps. Laryngomicrosurgery (LMS) is a common treatment for these conditions, often employing fiberoptic lasers such as potassium‐titanyl‐phosphate (KTP) and pulse dye laser (PDL) in outpatient departments (OPDs). However, the use of lasers in these procedures can damage the vocal folds leading to scarring.

In vocal fold scars, abnormal collagen levels increase, whereas those of elastin and hyaluronic acid decrease, leading to compromised vocal fold stiffness and viscosity due to the disorganization of the structure of the lamina propria. There are various treatments available for vocal fold scarring, including injections of autologous fat, collagen, or corticosteroids; scar excision; topical mitomycin‐C application; and vascular stripping, but their effectiveness is limited. Therefore, prevention of scarring becomes a crucial focus.

Steroid injections, known for their potent anti‐inflammatory effects, are commonly used after laryngeal surgery but conclusive evidence of their effectiveness in terms of preventing scarring is lacking. Therefore, the primary objective of our study was to determine the effect of steroid injections in preventing vocal fold scarring. The secondary objective was to evaluate the differences in the preventive effects on vocal fold scarring based on the type of steroid used. Accordingly, the independent variables were the presence of steroid injection and the type of steroid injected, whereas the dependent variables were changes in the transcriptional, histological, and functional levels of vocal fold scars in a rabbit model.

### Voice outcomes following a single office-based steroid injection for vocal fold scar [^113hVvHT]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Persistent dysphonia from vocal fold scar remains a clinical challenge, with current therapies providing inconsistent outcomes. We evaluated voice outcomes after a single office-based steroid injection.

Study Design

Case series with chart review.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Subjects and Methods

This study was based on pre- and postoperative analysis of patient-reported, perceptual, acoustic, aerodynamic, and videostroboscopic parameters. The sample comprised 25 patients undergoing office-based dexamethasone injection into the superficial lamina propria for mild/moderate vocal fold scar. Average follow-up was 13.7 ± 4.4 weeks; patients completed 3.5 ± 2.3 sessions of voice therapy between assessments. Complete data sets were not available for each parameter; sample size is noted with results.

Results

Voice handicap index (n = 24; P < .001) and glottal function index (n = 22; P < .001) decreased after injection. Total GRBAS score (grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, strain) decreased (n = 25; P < .001). Fundamental frequency range increased (n = 24; p = 0.024). Phonation threshold pressure decreased (n = 14; p = 0.017). Videostroboscopic parameters of vocal fold edge (P = 0.004), glottic closure (P = 0.003), and right mucosal wave (P = 0.016) improved after injection.

Conclusions

Office-based steroid injection combined with voice therapy for mild/moderate vocal fold scar is associated with improved patient-reported and functional voice measures. These findings provide preliminary support for this approach. Importantly, the procedure is low risk and can be performed in the office, thus offering a simple treatment alternative to patients with a disorder that has traditionally been difficult to manage. Prospective studies evaluating the effects of multiple injections are warranted.

### Mepolizumab improves clinical outcomes in patients with severe asthma and comorbid conditions [^112twByE]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe asthma, thought to affect 5–10% of the asthma population, is characterized by poor symptom control, frequent exacerbations, and airflow limitation, despite the regular use of maintenance therapies including multiple controllers. Patients with severe asthma frequently exhibit comorbid conditions or traits, which add to the burden of respiratory symptoms. These may include primary airway conditions such as allergic rhinitis, which occurs in 55–68% of patients with severe asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyposis, occurring in 45–50% of patients with severe asthma, and vocal cord dysfunction, which affects 19–50% of the severe asthma population. Other comorbid conditions are also common and include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which affects 46–63% of patients with severe asthma, obesity, which occurs in 21–48% of patients with severe asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, seen in up to 88–96% of patients with severe asthma, and anxiety or depression, affecting 81% and 31% of the severe asthma population, respectively.

Comorbidities can complicate the management of severe asthma. Some, such as vocal cord dysfunction, coexist with or mimic asthma, while others, such as upper airway conditions, contribute to poor disease control by aggravating symptoms. As such, the presence of comorbid conditions may lead to under- or overtreatment with anti-asthmatic medications. Additionally, comorbidities could result as adverse effects of asthma treatment, such as iatrogenic comorbidities, including obesity, osteoporosis, depression, and GERD, that are typically related to the use of systemic corticosteroids. Furthermore, the presence of comorbid conditions, whether frequently associated with severe asthma, or simply common with aging, has the potential to alter the response to asthma therapy, either due to a change in asthma phenotype or an increased or less responsive airway inflammation or resultant anatomical changes (e.g. obesity) impacting mechanical functioning of the pleural cavity. As the focus of severe asthma management moves increasingly towards personalized care, the role and importance of comorbid conditions is more often being recognized.

### Oral corticosteroids in vocal fold paralysis after thyroid surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^1167ZgNm]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Importance

There is no consensus in the field for the management of postthyroidectomy unilateral vocal fold paralysis (VFP). In cases where recurrent laryngeal nerve transection is not present, a local inflammatory process is thought to cause VFP. The findings suggest that corticosteroids may have a beneficial effect in managing this phenomenon.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of a 7-day oral corticosteroid treatment on vocal cord remobilization in patients with unilateral VFP after thyroidectomy or parathyroid surgery.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted between September 2018 and May 2023 at a tertiary referral hospital. Patients who underwent partial or total thyroidectomy or parathyroid surgery were included. Exclusion criteria included corticosteroid intolerance, prior cervical surgery or radiotherapy, surgery performed for a malignant tumor and multinodular intrathoracic goiters.

Interventions

At baseline, an inclusion visit assessed vocal cord mobility via nasofibroscopy and voice quality using the GRBAS (grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, strain) scale. Postoperative assessments were performed the day after surgery to identify unilateral VFP. Patients with unilateral VFP were randomized to receive either a 7-day course of oral corticosteroids or a placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

At 7 days, 1 month, and 3 months, nasofibroscopic evaluation and GRBAS scale assessment were performed to monitor vocal fold remobilization and voice quality. All analyses were intention to treat.

Results

Of the 468 patients included, 26 (5.6%) developed unilateral VFP and were randomized (19.2% male; 80.8% female; median age, 68 [IQR, 62.5–73.0] years in corticosteroid group and 59 [IQR, 52.5–73.0] years in placebo group). By day 7, vocal cord remobilization occurred in 42.8% (6 of 14) of the corticosteroid group and 41.6% (5 of 12) of the placebo group (proportion difference, 1.2%; 95% CI -32.8% to 34.4%). GRBAS results showed no meaningful difference in pathological items between groups at any time point.

Conclusion and Relevance

Results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that oral corticosteroids do not enhance vocal cord remobilization or improve voice quality in patients with postoperative unilateral VFP. Speech therapy remains essential in the management of postoperative VFP.

### Office steroid injections of the larynx [^115cTnBs]. The Laryngoscope (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Steroid injection into the larynx has been sporadically reported as helpful in benign lesions of the larynx. Its role in laryngology remains unclear. This study reviews the indications and results of 47 steroid injections in 34 patients in an office setting.

Methods

The authors conducted a retrospective review of 47 injections in 34 patients. Methylprednisolone acetate suspension, USP (40 mg/mL), was injected by indirect laryngoscopy under local anesthesia. Results were evaluated by stroboscopy and by perceptual evaluation of the GRABS scale before and after injection. Pre- versus postinjection ratings were compared by paired t test.

Results

Indications for injection were: 1) postoperative scar with local stiffness (12 patients), 2) vocal nodules and polyp (18 patients), and 3) sarcoidosis/granuloma (4 patients). Steroid injections were done in professional singers instead of repeated oral administration of steroids and/or to avoid surgery in patients with polyps and cysts. Improvement was noted in 28 of 34 (82%). Eleven of the 18 patients with polyps and nodules had significant improvement and avoided surgery. Vocal fold scars improved after injection with an improved voice grade (P < .01), an improved amplitude (P < .05), and improved mucosal wave (P < .05). There were no complications. Only two patients could not tolerate office injection.

Conclusion

Office steroid injections are a valuable adjunct in management of vocal fold scars, polyps, nodules, and granulomas.

### Localized delivery of therapeutics impact laryngeal mechanics, local inflammatory response, and respiratory microbiome following upper airway intubation injury in swine [^1158Fbbt]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The vocal folds are central to generating sound through vibration and airflow modulation. Damage to the mucosal interface or superficial lamina propria under the delicate epithelium significantly impairs vocal fold function and phonation, emphasizing the need to better understand how pathological insults such as traumatic intubation and subsequent therapeutic interventions impact mechanics to optimize treatment approaches. Studies using shear rheometry to evaluate the viscoelastic properties of the vocal fold after injury found that scarred tissue exhibited higher elastic shear modulus and dynamic viscosity compared to non-scarred tissue. Our group has previously investigated localized stiffness of vocal fold tissue after recurrent laryngeal nerve injury utilizing normal indentation and found biomechanical properties to correlate with vocalis muscle atrophy. In this study examining the delivery of roxadustat and valacyclovir in the injured airway, we found local laryngeal tissue stiffness increased as the length of intubation progressed for regular and roxadustat ETTs but remained consistent across all time-points for valacyclovir ETTs. Although valacyclovir is primarily known for its antiviral effects, it produced stiffness outcomes closest to the healthy control at 14 days. Moreover, valacyclovir ETTs demonstrated a reduction in epithelial ulceration and inflammation and a statistically insignificant increase in fibrosis over time on histopathological assessment. Other studies utilizing corticosteroids for the modulation of inflammation in inhalational burn and intubation injury demonstrated similar outcomes indicating valacyclovir may also modulate the immune response.

### The role of oral steroids in the treatment of phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions in women [^116jvSFZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

(1) To determine the short-term effectiveness of oral steroids in women with benign vocal fold lesions and (2) to determine the effectiveness of adjuvant oral steroids in women undergoing voice therapy for benign vocal fold lesions.

Study Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Setting

Tertiary voice care center.

Subjects and Methods

Thirty-six patients undergoing voice therapy for the treatment of phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions randomly received either a 4-day course of oral steroids or a placebo prior to initiating voice therapy. Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10) scores, video and audioperceptual analyses, acoustic and aerodynamic analyses at baseline, and patient perception of improvement after a short course of steroids or a placebo and at the conclusion of voice therapy were collected.

Results

Thirty patients completed the study, of whom 27 (only female) were analyzed. The primary outcome measure, VHI-10, did not improve after the 4-day course of steroids or placebo. Secondary measures similarly showed no improvement with steroids relative to placebo. Voice therapy demonstrated a positive effect on both VHI-10 and patient-perceived improvement of voice in all subjects.

Conclusion

A short course of oral steroids did not benefit women with phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions. In addition, steroids had little beneficial effect when used adjunctively with voice therapy in this patient cohort.

### Ideal particle sizes for inhaled steroids targeting vocal granulomas: preliminary study using computational fluid dynamics [^114Z77VW]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives Vocal fold granulomas are benign lesions of the larynx commonly caused by gastroesophageal reflux, intubation, and phonotrauma. Current medical therapy includes inhaled corticosteroids to target inflammation that leads to granuloma formation. Particle sizes of commonly prescribed inhalers range over 1 to 4 µm. The study objective was to use computational fluid dynamics to investigate deposition patterns over a range of particle sizes of inhaled corticosteroids targeting the larynx and vocal fold granulomas. Study Design Retrospective, case-specific computational study. Setting Tertiary academic center. Subjects/Methods A 3-dimensional anatomically realistic computational model of a normal adult airway from mouth to trachea was constructed from 3 computed tomography scans. Virtual granulomas of varying sizes and positions along the vocal fold were incorporated into the base model. Assuming steady-state, inspiratory, turbulent airflow at 30 L/min, computational fluid dynamics was used to simulate respiratory transport and deposition of inhaled corticosteroid particles ranging over 1 to 20 µm. Results Laryngeal deposition in the base model peaked for particle sizes 8 to 10 µm (2.8%-3.5%). Ideal sizes ranged over 6 to 10, 7 to 13, and 7 to 14 µm for small, medium, and large granuloma sizes, respectively. Glottic deposition was maximal at 10.8% for 9-µm-sized particles for the large posterior granuloma, 3 times the normal model (3.5%). Conclusion As the virtual granuloma size increased and the location became more posterior, glottic deposition and ideal particle size generally increased. This preliminary study suggests that inhalers with larger particle sizes, such as fluticasone propionate dry-powder inhaler, may improve laryngeal drug deposition. Most commercially available inhalers have smaller particles than suggested here.

### Diagnosis of asthma-new theories [^113Zyhey]. The Journal of Asthma (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recent studies have shown a remarkably high frequency of poorly controlled asthma. Several reasons for this treatment failure have been discussed, however, the basic question of whether the diagnosis is always correct has not been considered. Follow-up studies have shown that in many patients asthma cannot be verified despite ongoing symptoms. Mechanisms other than bronchial obstruction may therefore be responsible. The current definition of asthma may also include symptoms that are related to mechanisms other than bronchial obstruction, the clinical hallmark of asthma.

Aim

Based on a review of the four cornerstones of asthma - inflammation, hyperresponsiveness, bronchial obstruction and symptoms - the aim was to present some new aspects and suggestions related to the diagnosis of adult non-allergic asthma.

Conclusion

Recent studies have indicated that "classic" asthma may sometimes be confused with asthma-like disorders such as airway sensory hyperreactivity, small airways disease, dysfunctional breathing, non-obstructive dyspnea, hyperventilation and vocal cord dysfunction. This confusion may be one explanation for the high proportion of misdiagnosis and treatment failure. The current diagnosis, focusing on bronchial obstruction, may be too "narrow". As there may be common mechanisms a broadening to include also non-obstructive disorders, forming an asthma syndrome, is suggested. Such broadening requires additional diagnostic steps, such as qualitative studies with analysis of reported symptoms, non-effort demanding methods for determining lung function, capsaicin test for revealing airway sensory hyperreactivity, careful evaluation of the therapeutic as well as diagnostic effect of corticosteroids and testing of suggested theories.

### Long-term efficacy of percutaneous steroid injection for treating benign vocal fold lesions: a prospective study [^114igGrt]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

This study assessed the long-term efficacy and recurrence rates of percutaneous steroid injections (PSIs) for benign vocal fold lesions.

Study Design

Prospective clinical study.

Methods

A prospective human clinical trial was performed from October 2008 to September 2014 at Soonchunhyang University Hospital, Bucheon, Korea. Percutaneous steroid injection was performed in 84 consecutive patients with small benign vocal fold lesions, such as vocal fold nodules, polyps, and Reinke's edema, who could not be treated with voice therapy or surgery. Patients had acoustic aerodynamic, perceptual, stroboscopic, and voice handicap index evaluations before PSI and also 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after PSI.

Results

Of the 84 patients, 37 (44.0%) showed complete remission; 22 (26.2%) showed partial remission; five (6%) had no response; and 20 (23.8%) developed recurrences after PSI. Most of the objective and subjective parameters that improved statistically (P < 0.05) 3 months after PSI remained stable until 24 months. For the recurrences, the average recurrence time interval after PSI was 8.5 ± 8.2 (range 3–36) months. Recurrence was associated with voice abuse after PSI and professional voice users (P < 0.05). Complications during follow-up included minimal vocal fold hematomas in 2.4% (2 of 84) and mild vocal fold atrophy in 1.2% (1 of 84).

Conclusion

Percutaneous steroid injection is a useful alternative modality for treating benign vocal fold lesions without morbidity. However, recurrence rates were higher with voice abuse after PSI and professional voice users.

### Modulation of inflammatory and profibrotic signaling in a rabbit model of acute phonotrauma using triamcinolone [^1116rqDM]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the hypothesis that prophylactic triamcinolone modulates acute vocal fold inflammatory and profibrotic signaling during acute phonotrauma.

Study Design

In vivo rabbit phonation model.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Subjects and Methods

Forty New Zealand white breeder rabbits were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: control (no intervention), no treatment (30 minutes of raised intensity phonation), sham treatment (bilateral intralaryngeal triamcinolone acetonide injection at 0 µg/25 µL followed by 30 minutes of raised intensity phonation), or steroid treatment (bilateral intralaryngeal triamcinolone acetonide injection at 400 µg/25 µL followed by 30 minutes of raised intensity phonation). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to investigate gene expression levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin (IL)-1β, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1.

Results

Results revealed a significant main effect for COX-2 (P = 0.002). Post hoc testing revealed that rabbits receiving no treatment (15.10) had higher COX-2 gene expression than control (5.90; P < .001). There were no significant differences in COX-2 expression between treatment groups. Results revealed a significant main effect for IL-1β (P < .001). Post hoc testing revealed that rabbits receiving no treatment (14.70) had higher IL-1β gene expression than control (6.30) (P = 0.001). There were no significant differences in IL-1β gene expression between treatment groups. There were no significant differences in TGF-β1 gene expression (P = 0.525) between treatment and control groups.

Conclusion

Given conflicting evidence, further studies are necessary to investigate vocal fold steroid injections prior to and following the induction of phonotrauma. Prophylactic administration of triamcinolone immediately prior to acute phonotrauma resulted in no significant changes in COX-2, IL-1β, and TGF-β1 gene transcript levels.

### Effect of serial intralesional steroid injections on risk of recurrence in idiopathic subglottic stenosis [^1115Enx4]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) is a rare disease of unknown etiology, characterized by severe narrowing of the upper airway. The typical age of onset is around 40–60 years, and it affects nearly exclusively white females. There are various treatment options for iSGS, including endoscopic dilation and cricotracheal resection. Unfortunately, surgical intervention is not curative for iSGS. Despite repeated dilations or complete resection of the stenosis, scarring often recurs, leading to patient anxiety, financial strain from time off work, and the potential for worsening airway scarring or other complications associated with repeated surgical procedures.

Serial intralesional steroid injections (ILSIs) administered in the clinic setting under local anesthesia have been adopted in many laryngology practices as an adjunct treatment for iSGS. Based on evidence that iSGS may be driven by a fibroinflammatory process and that corticosteroid injections have been used to manage other fibrotic diseases, serial ILSIs have been hypothesized to prolong the time to stenosis recurrence. Nevertheless, evidence for the effectiveness of serial ILSIs remains inconclusive. Small retrospective or case series cohorts with fewer than 25 patients, encompassing various forms of subglottic stenosis, have suggested that ILSIs may nearly double the surgery‐free interval compared to the period before ILSI initiation. However, a more recent multicenter prospective study of 290 patients with iSGS found no significant association between serial ILSI use and reduced risk of recurrence.

To evaluate the effectiveness of serial ILSIs, we analyzed prospectively collected longitudinal data from a cohort of patients with iSGS (n = 75), which included both patients who had received ILSIs and those who had not. Using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models for both time‐to‐first event and recurrent event analyses, we assessed the impact of ILSIs on stenosis recurrence risk, adjusting for relevant clinical and demographic covariates. Additionally, we calculated the number needed to treat with ILSIs to prevent one recurrence and summarized the frequency of ILSI administration within our cohort.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^115DQ3zg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroid use in dysphonia — risk profile and limited indications: Steroid adverse effects include dose-related mucosal complications, and hypersensitivity reactions are rare but documented; therefore, steroids should not be used empirically. Rinsing the oral cavity, gargling, drinking water after use, and using the lowest possible inhaled dose is recommended to mitigate side effects. Steroids should also be considered for patients with airway compromise to decrease edema and inflammation, with appropriate evaluation and determination of the cause required prior to starting steroid therapy. Steroid hypersensitivity can be either type 1 (IgE mediated), which can include anaphylaxis (rare, 0.3%-0.5%), or, more commonly, type IV (T cell mediated), usually following topical corticosteroid application.

### Take a deep breath-time to plunge into inducible laryngeal obstruction [^114AmamA]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

Inducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO)/vocal cord dysfunction is frequently encountered in the specialist asthma clinic, where it is often misdiagnosed as asthma or is coexistent with asthma. It causes recurrent distressing episodes of acute dyspnea that can lead to hospital admissions, endotracheal intubation, and fruitless asthma treatment escalation, often including oral glucocorticoids. 1–4 Early diagnosis and treatment of ILO offers the prospect of connecting patients with an effective speech- and language-based intervention earlier and avoiding these unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions.

### The impact of inhaled corticosteroids on lung inflammation and clinical outcomes in children with oropharyngeal dysphagia [^111MwK4j]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) decrease airway inflammation and hospitalization risk in children with laryngeal penetration or aspiration inferior to the vocal cords STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 103 children younger than 24 months who had penetration/aspiration determined by initial videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) between July 2021 and July 2022 and subsequently had a flexible bronchoscopic examination performed at our quaternary care center. Patients were grouped based on exposure to ICS for at least two weeks at the time of bronchoscopy. We compared bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophil percentage, qualitative BAL bacterial cultures, and time to first hospitalization after VFSS between groups, using regression analyses. Cox proportional hazards model was performed for analyses of time to hospitalization.

Results

Patients prescribed ICS were more likely to have elevated BAL neutrophil percentage (33% vs 15%, OR 2.95; 95% CI 1.08–8.35) and positive bacterial cultures (57% vs 30%, OR 3.41; 95% CI 1.30–9.50), after adjusting for comorbidities. After multivariable analyses, treatment with inhaled corticosteroids did not appear to reduce time to hospitalization (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.42–2.67), although the number of hospitalizations in both groups was small.

Conclusions

In this single-center, retrospective study, ICS was associated with elevated percentage of BAL bacterial cultures and neutrophils in children with penetration/aspiration as determined by VFSS. The practice of using of ICS in this population is not supported.

### Corticosteroids for Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial paralysis) [^1171VQCw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Inflammation and oedema of the facial nerve are implicated in causing Bell's palsy. Corticosteroids have a potent anti-inflammatory action that should minimise nerve damage. This is an update of a review first published in 2002 and last updated in 2010.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroid therapy in people with Bell's palsy.

Search Methods

On 4 March 2016, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS. We reviewed the bibliographies of the randomised trials and contacted known experts in the field to identify additional published or unpublished trials. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials and quasi-randomised trials comparing different routes of administration and dosage schemes of corticosteroid or adrenocorticotrophic hormone therapy versus a control group receiving no therapy considered effective for this condition, unless the same therapy was given in a similar way to the experimental group.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology. The main outcome of interest was incomplete recovery of facial motor function (i.e. residual facial weakness). Secondary outcomes were cosmetically disabling persistent sequelae, development of motor synkinesis or autonomic dysfunction (i.e. hemifacial spasm, crocodile tears) and adverse effects of corticosteroid therapy manifested during follow-up.

Main Results

We identified seven trials, with 895 evaluable participants for this review. All provided data suitable for the primary outcome meta-analysis. One of the trials was new since the last version of this Cochrane systematic review. Risk of bias in the older, smaller studies included some unclear- or high-risk assessments, whereas we deemed the larger studies at low risk of bias. Overall, 79/452 (17%) participants allocated to corticosteroids had incomplete recovery of facial motor function six months or more after randomisation; significantly fewer than the 125/447 (28%) in the control group (risk ratio (RR) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.80, seven trials, n = 895). The number of people who need to be treated with corticosteroids to avoid one incomplete recovery was 10 (95% CI 6 to 20). The reduction in the proportion of participants with cosmetically disabling sequelae six months after randomisation was very similar in the corticosteroid and placebo groups (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.29, two trials, n = 75, low-quality evidence). However, there was a significant reduction in motor synkinesis during follow-up in participants receiving corticosteroids (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.91, three trials, n = 485, moderate-quality evidence). Three studies explicitly recorded the absence of adverse effects attributable to corticosteroids. One trial reported that three participants receiving prednisolone had temporary sleep disturbances and two trials gave a detailed account of adverse effects occurring in 93 participants, all non-serious; the combined analysis of data from these three trials found no significant difference in adverse effect rates between people receiving corticosteroids and people receiving placebo (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.51, n = 715).

Authors' Conclusions

The available moderate- to high-quality evidence from randomised controlled trials showed significant benefit from treating Bell's palsy with corticosteroids.

### Atypical mycobacteriosis of the larynx: an unusual clinical presentation secondary to steroids inhalation [^115srRZJ]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Vocal cords stiffness can be associated with a variety of etiologic agents, but it is rarely seen with atypical mycobacteria, for example, Mycobacterium avium complex. We report a case of a 35-year-old white woman who is and was maintained on inhaled steroids. She presented with hoarseness and low-grade fever, but her medical history was otherwise unremarkable. Laryngoscopy revealed bilateral scarring of the vocal cords. Vocal cord biopsies were performed. Histologic examination revealed unremarkable laryngeal mucosa, except for abundant subepithelial non-necrotizing granulomata. The differential diagnosis included sarcoid, Klebsiella scleroma, and tuberculosis. Special stains reviewed abundant acid-fast bacilli, later confirmed by a DNA assay on induced deep sputum, consistent with M avium complex. Subsequently, steroids were withdrawn, and the patient was treated with a multiple-drug antituberculous regimen and had a full recovery. This unusual clinical presentation of the atypical mycobacteriosis may be encountered by otolaryngologists and pathologists, and it is critical to recognize it in patients immunocompromised because of steroids.

### Acute effects of steroids on vocal fold epithelium post-injury in a preclinical model [^116SNoUv]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glucocorticoids (GCs) are commonly prescribed for laryngeal indications due to their potent anti-inflammatory properties. However, GCs effect on vocal fold (VF) epithelial morphology and barrier function following injury is overlooked and may be key to efficacy. In this study, the effects of GCs on epithelial morphology and barrier function were quantified in injured VFs. We seek to increase our understanding of biochemical processes underlying GC mechanisms to refine therapeutic strategies.

Methods

Microflap injury was induced in 65 rabbits. Seven days after injury, animals received bilateral 20μL intracordal injections of saline, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, or triamcinolone (n = 15 per condition). Five rabbits in each condition were euthanized 1, 7, or 60days following treatment. An additional five animals served as non-injured/untreated controls. To quantify transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), 1mm epithelial biopsies were placed in an Ussing chamber. The contralateral VF was processed for transmission electron microscopy and epithelial depth analysis.

Results

At 60days, GC treatment maintained TEER levels similar to non-injured/untreated controls. However, triamcinolone reduced TEER compared with saline-treated conditions. Acutely, epithelial hyperplasia typically persisted in all injured VFs. At 60days, only dexamethasone and triamcinolone increased epithelial depth in injured VFs; all GCs increased epithelial depth compared with non-injured/untreated controls.

Conclusion

Acutely, GCs did not alter TEER. Additionally, GCs did not alter epithelial depth compared with saline treatment, indicating alignment with natural healing responses. At 60days, GCs exhibited varying degrees of TEER restoration and epithelial hyperplasia, possibly due to distinct pharmacodynamic profiles.

### Wheezing and vocal cord dysfunction mimicking asthma [^115godtL]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) is a respiratory disorder characterized by paradoxical closure of the vocal cords during the respiratory cycle leading to obstructive airway symptoms. The presenting symptoms vary from stridor to wheezing. VCD may coexist with asthma or masquerade as asthma. Misdiagnosis of VCD as asthma leads to inappropriate use of systemic steroids with its adverse effects, frequent emergency department visits, hospitalization, and, rarely, intubation and tracheostomy. Attenuation of the inspiratory flow volume loop on spirometry is suggestive of VCD. Laryngoscopic demonstration of the paradoxical vocal cord movements during an acute attack is the gold standard for the diagnosis of VCD. Patient education, speech therapy, and psychologic counseling are the therapeutic tools for treatment.

### Comparing intraoperative and in-office steroid injections for management of subglottic stenosis [^115ExVvh]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Subglottic stenosis (SGS) is a rare and progressive inflammatory process, causing narrowing of the airway immediately below the vocal cords. Known etiologies of this condition include idiopathic (iSGS), autoimmune, iatrogenic, congenital, and traumatic. The management of SGS can be approached using various methods, such as endoscopic and open surgical approaches, with adjunct procedures such as mitomycin C or corticosteroid injections. Based on current management practices, SGS leads to a large surgical burden with most patients requiring repetitive procedures to maintain an adequate airway.

Direct injection of corticosteroids for management of SGS is thought to reduce granulation and stenosis due to their anti‐inflammatory properties. With the advent of distal chip laryngoscopes and side channel procedure endoscopes providing high resolution endoscopy, the capacity to inject the subglottis and trachea has become a routine in‐office procedure using topical rather than general anesthetic in the operating room. Current literature reports improved outcomes of subglottic patency and length of time between surgical interventions in patient populations treated with in‐office serial intralesional steroid injection (SILSI).

The primary objective of this study was to determine the difference in SFI between iSGS patients treated with endoscopic dilation alone, dilation with a single intraoperative intralesional corticosteroid injection, and dilation with intraoperative steroid injection followed by additional SILSI procedures.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) [^1124i8gM]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing hoarseness (dysphonia), defined as a disorder characterized by altered vocal quality, pitch, loudness, or vocal effort that impairs communication or reduces voice-related quality of life (QOL). Hoarseness affects nearly one-third of the population at some point in their lives. This guideline applies to all age groups evaluated in a setting where hoarseness would be identified or managed. It is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with hoarseness.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for hoarseness (dysphonia), reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce inappropriate steroid use, reduce inappropriate use of anti-reflux medications, reduce inappropriate use of radiographic imaging, and promote appropriate use of laryngoscopy, voice therapy, and surgery. In creating this guideline the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of neurology, speech-language pathology, professional voice teaching, family medicine, pulmonology, geriatric medicine, nursing, internal medicine, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, and consumers.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) the clinician should not routinely prescribe antibiotics to treat hoarseness and 2) the clinician should advocate voice therapy for patients diagnosed with hoarseness that reduces voice-related QOL. The panel made recommendations that 1) the clinician should diagnose hoarseness (dysphonia) in a patient with altered voice quality, pitch, loudness, or vocal effort that impairs communication or reduces voice-related QOL; 2) the clinician should assess the patient with hoarseness by history and/or physical examination for factors that modify management, such as one or more of the following: recent surgical procedures involving the neck or affecting the recurrent laryngeal nerve, recent endotracheal intubation, radiation treatment to the neck, a history of tobacco abuse, and occupation as a singer or vocal performer; 3) the clinician should visualize the patient's larynx, or refer the patient to a clinician who can visualize the larynx, when hoarseness fails to resolve by a maximum of three months after onset, or irrespective of duration if a serious underlying cause is suspected; 4) the clinician should not obtain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the patient with a primary complaint of hoarseness prior to visualizing the larynx; 5) the clinician should not prescribe anti-reflux medications for patients with hoarseness without signs or symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease; 6) the clinician should not routinely prescribe oral corticosteroids to treat hoarseness; 7) the clinician should visualize the larynx before prescribing voice therapy and document/communicate the results to the speech-language pathologist; and 8) the clinician should prescribe, or refer the patient to a clinician who can prescribe, botulinum toxin injections for the treatment of hoarseness caused by adductor spasmodic dysphonia. The panel offered as options that 1) the clinician may perform laryngoscopy at any time in a patient with hoarseness, or may refer the patient to a clinician who can visualize the larynx; 2) the clinician may prescribe anti-reflux medication for patients with hoarseness and signs of chronic laryngitis; and 3) the clinician may educate/counsel patients with hoarseness about control/preventive measures.

Disclaimer

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing hoarseness (dysphonia). Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### The effect of a systematic multi-dimensional assessment in severe uncontrolled asthma: a literature review and protocol for an investigator-initiated, open-label, randomized-controlled trial (EXACT @ home study) [^114C79rN]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a common multifactorial disease characterized by chronic inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness to direct or indirect stimuli, resulting in intermittent symptoms like cough, wheezing, shortness of breath and/or chest tightness.

In the Netherlands, more than 500,000 patients have been diagnosed with asthma. Of these patients 17% have difficult-to-treat asthma that is uncontrolled despite optimal use of inhaled medication and/or maintenance therapy with oral corticosteroids (mOCS). This is often due to the presence of treatable traits, which are factors that contribute to the disease severity. Within the field of difficult-to-treat asthma, severe asthma is a distinct subpopulation, affecting 3.6% of the total asthma population. Severe asthma is defined as asthma that remains uncontrolled despite adherence to optimised high-intensity therapy and optimal treatment of treatable traits. Treatable traits can be categorized into pulmonary factors (e.g. eosinophilia, allergies, airway obstruction and infections), non-pulmonary factors such as comorbidities (e.g. obesity, depression, vocal cord dysfunction, rhinosinusitis, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux), behavioral aspects (e.g. adherence, inhaler technique, physical activity, dysfunctional breathing, symptom perception, smoking) and environmental influences (e.g. social network, pollution). Patients with difficult-to-treat asthma have similar clinical presentation, but possess unique compositions of underlying treatable traits.

### Glucocorticoids for croup in children [^1135rg8M]. JAMA Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Clinical Question

For children with croup, do glucocorticoids reduce clinical symptoms, minimize return visits and/or (re)admissions to the hospital, shorten lengths of stay, or reduce the need for additional treatments?

Bottom Line

Glucocorticoids reduce symptoms of croup at 2 hours and for at least 24 hours, reduce return visits to care, and shorten hospital stays by about 15 hours. Serious adverse events are infrequent.

### Laryngoscopic findings and response to gabapentin… [^116Vdf7K]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

The presence of vocal fold motion asymmetry may be considered as a part of a clinical picture consistent with neurogenic cough that responds to gabapentin. Importance Chronic cough is a debilitating, often multifactorial problem. Vagal neuropathy has been proposed as a cause for a fraction of these cases. There are certain features that support the clinical diagnosis of vagal neuropathy. It is hypothesized that patients with neurogenic cough who have vocal fold motion asymmetry on laryngoscopy will be more likely to respond to gabapentin. The maximum daily dose was 1800 mg. Partial or complete response to gabapentin was noted in 16 patients. Vocal fold motion asymmetry was noted in 20 patients. Fifteen of 16 responders had VFMA compared with 5 of 9 nonresponders.

Conclusions and Relevance In patients with chronic cough suspected to be related to vagal neuropathy, the odds of response to gabapentin are higher with the presence of VFMA noted on videostroboscopy. Proponents of this theory describe a lingering cough, globus, vocal fold paresis, and dysphagia that follow an upper respiratory tract infection, which is termed postviral vagal neuropathy. 1, 4, 5 The proposed possible mechanisms of cough reflex potentiation in PVVN include a lowering of. Gabapentin therapy was prescribed based on clinical suspicion for VN, and it was the only medication change made in the patient's treatment during that visit. All patients were given a prescription for an initial gabapentin dose of 100 mg twice daily, and increased weekly by 100 mg, dividing larger doses into administration 3 times daily.

The median difference of the initial visit Voice Handicap Index-10 score between responders and nonresponders was 1 and, for the Reflux Symptom Index score, the median difference was 8. Videostroboscopy was performed in all patients and the medical records procedure reports were reviewed for mention of VFMA. The presence of VFMA on examination was observed in 15 of 16 patients compared with 5 of 9 patients in the nonresponder group. The difference in the frequency of VFMA between responders and nonresponders was 38%.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^117EQMdg]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

We explored and were able to dismiss subgroup effects, with one exception: the reduction in mean time to complete resolution of pain was greater with intramuscular than with oral corticosteroids. The subgroup effect and its direction was specified a priori, the difference between subgroups was relatively large (about 21 hours), and chance seems an unlikely explanation (P < 0.001). Credibility of the effect, however, is underminedas the effect modification is suggested by comparison between rather than within studies, and we found no similar difference in any other outcome. In addition, the only randomised controlled trial that compared oral and intramuscular treatment with dexamethasone reported no significant difference in any outcome.

The few serious adverse effects in the included trials occurred with similar frequency in the intervention and control groups, although some minor adverse effects reported by patients might not always have been noted. Potential adverse effects that appear later are more likely to occur after repeated use or are rare would not have been captured in the trials. Recent observational studies have raised the possibility of extremely rare but serious adverse effects after short courses of corticosteroids. The quality of this evidence is, for several reasons, low with respect to the current question. The studies used observational designs from large databases with suboptimal verification of diagnoses; serious confounding by indication raises the possibility that the association is a result of the underlying disease process (such as acute inflammation or exacerbation) rather than the corticosteroids themselves; and indirectness in that the doses used in the trials were lower and the duration of treatment was considerably shorter than the duration in the observational studies. Among children, a recent overview of reviews looked at evidence from 44 randomised controlled trials on conditions that required a short course of steroids (such as asthma, bronchiolitis, croup, wheeze, and pharyngitis/tonsillitis) and reported no major adverse events.

Methods

Guideline panel and patient involvement

According to the BMJ Rapid Recommendations process, a guideline panel provided critical oversight to the review and identified populations, subgroups, and outcomes of interest. The panel included clinicians, methodologists, and patients with experience of sore throat. Patients received personal training and support to optimise contributions throughout the guideline development process. The patients on the panel led the interpretation of the results based on what they expected the typical patient values and preferences to be, as well as the variation between patients. Five patient representatives were full members of the guideline panel and contributed to the selection and prioritisation of outcomes, values and preferences assessments, and critical feedback to the protocol for the systematic review and the BMJ Rapid Recommendations manuscript.

We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for relevant published randomised controlled trials based on the strategy reported in the most recent Cochrane systematic review, modified under the guidance of a research librarian (appendix 1). We limited the search from 1 January 2010, which included a two month overlap with the previous Cochrane review search, to 1 May 2017. There were no language restrictions. We reviewed reference lists from eligible new trials and related reviews for additional eligible trials and searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing or unpublished trials and for additional data from published trials.

### Effects of steroids on reintubation and post-extubation stridor in adults: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116hsAWS]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

The present meta-analysis documents that steroid administration before a planned extubation decreases the risk of post-extubation stridor and reintubation both in high-risk and unselected patients. The beneficial effect of steroids to prevent post-extubation stridor and reintubation was clear in the subgroup of patients at high-risk for development of post-extubation stridor as identified by a cuff-leak test (a low level of leak less than 110 mL or less than 25%).

The discrepancies observed in studies that evaluated the interest to administer steroids before extubation could be due to several factors including patient inclusion criteria, duration of intubation, dosage, timing of treatment and risk levels of developing stridor. Only the last two criteria (risk levels of developing stridor and timing of administration initiation) could be extensively evaluated in the present meta-analysis, allowing their importance to be reported for the first time. Post-extubation stridor is commonly the result of oedema of the subglottic area or the vocal cords. The difficulty in defining the relationship between laryngo-tracheal injury and post-extubation stridor is that the presence of the endotracheal tube precludes direct visualisation of the upper airway before extubation.

### Ciclesonide (Alvesco) [^11582zce]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

What are the possible side effects of ALVESCO?

ALVESCO may cause serious side effects, including:

Thrush (Candida), a fungal infection of your nose, mouth, or throat. Tell your healthcare provider if you have discomfort or pain in your throat, have hoarseness in your voice or have any redness or white colored patches in your mouth or throat. Rinse your mouth after you use your ALVESCO.
Immune system problems that may increase your risk of infections. You are more likely to get infections if you take medicines that may weaken your body's ability to fight infections. Avoid contact with people who have contagious diseases such as chicken pox or measles while you use ALVESCO. Symptoms of an infection may include:
fever
pain
aches
chills
feeling tired
nausea
vomiting
Adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not make enough steroid hormones. Your healthcare provider will follow you closely if you take steroids by mouth and are having them decreased (tapered) or you are being switched to ALVESCO. People have died while steroids are being decreased and when people have been switched from steroids by mouth to inhaled steroids like ALVESCO. If you are under stress, such as with surgery, after surgery or trauma, you may need steroids by mouth again.

### Prophylactic administration of parenteral steroids for preventing airway complications after extubation in adults: meta-analysis of randomised placebo controlled trials [^114RV3jY]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Single v multiple dose regimens

Our results confirm the benefit of multidose steroids before planned extubation of adults. It is difficult to predict the risk of laryngeal oedema that will require reintubation. Onset of laryngeal oedema usually occurs within eight hours after extubation w1 w2 so administration of steroids immediately after extubation might be too late. Administration of steroids before selected extubation is assumed to protect against or treat mucosal oedema in the glottic region caused by pressure or irritation from the endotracheal tube. Roberts et al compared trials published after 2000 with older studiesand suggested that the lack of clinical benefit observed with earlier studies might have resulted from lower total steroid doses. These authors also pointed out that older studies generally used only a single dose of steroids and suggested that this, compared with the longer duration of treatment in newer studies, might account for the different conclusions. We found possible dose dependent effects in multiple dose regimens but not in single dose regimens. In multiple dose regimens steroids are usually administered at least 12 hours before extubation and repeated almost every plasma half life. This might maintain a high level of anti-inflammatory activity during the period of vulnerability to oedema after extubation.

Hoarseness (dysphonia) management — laryngoscopy timing and corticosteroid use is addressed as follows: Clinicians should not routinely prescribe corticosteroids for patients with dysphonia prior to visualization of the larynx, and the policy level for laryngoscopy at any time was an option whereby clinicians may perform diagnostic laryngoscopy at any time in a patient with dysphonia.

### Laryngotracheal stenosis: mechanistic review [^1125pHxn]. Head & Neck (2022). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
The different types of upper airway stenosis: posterior glottic stenosis, subglottic stenosis, and tracheal stenosis [Color figure can be viewed at]

The purpose of this review article is to summarize the existing literature surrounding wound healing mechanisms in laryngotracheal stenosis from a mechanistic perspective. This will begin with a review of general wound healing pathophysiology, followed by a focused review of iLTS and iSGS as conditions of aberrant wound healing. Current management of laryngotracheal stenosis is primarily surgical, including endoscopic dilation, endoscopic resection, laryngotracheoplasty, and cricotracheal resection. Patients with iLTS have been found to have tracheostomy dependence rates higher than patients with idiopathic or traumatic etiologies by up to 66%. This highlights the poor prognosis associated with iatrogenic LTS and the limitations of current therapies. Whereas patients with iSGS have excellent initial responses to treatment, but suffer from high recurrence rates — more than half of patients with iSGS requiring repeated surgical procedures within 12 months of their initial diagnosis. The variability in treatment outcomes has complicated patient decision‐making as patients try to balance survival, risk of interventions, and quality of life considerations. Medical alternatives or adjuncts to the surgical management of LTS are limited by a lack of mechanistic understanding of the pathogenesis of LTS. Currently utilized adjuncts include systemic or local steroid treatments, mitomycin C injections, antibiotics, and other anti‐inflammatory medications. However, evidence for each of these approaches is inconsistent, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of the wound healing mechanisms involved in this process in order to provide targeted and effective treatment options.

Of note, this paper will not address scarring of the vocal fold and voice disability. For an excellent review of vocal fold wound healing, please reference Branski et al.'s 2006 seminal paper.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving voice outcomes after thyroid surgery [^116yYLWB]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Intraoperative corticosteroids for thyroid surgery — recommendation, evidence profile, and study findings: No recommendation can be made regarding the impact of a single intraoperative dose of intravenous corticosteroid on voice outcomes in patients undergoing thyroid surgery, and policy level is no recommendation. The aggregate evidence quality is Grade D from observational studies with concerns over methodology and clinical importance; benefit is uncertain for short-term voice improvement or shortening the duration of vocal fold paralysis or paresis; and risk includes hyperglycemia, yielding a balance of benefit versus harm. The evidence text notes that the evidence regarding voice outcomes is inconclusive and cannot serve as a primary indication for steroid use. A prospective, case-controlled study of 295 patients compared 143 who received a single dose of hydrocortisone 100 mg with 152 who did not; among those with temporary vocal palsy, recovery time in 41 of 143 steroid-treated patients ranged from 10 to 105 days (mean = 28.6) versus 14 to 61 days (mean = 37.4) in 12 of 152 non-steroid patients, a difference of borderline statistical significance (P = 0.045) and a difference of 8 days of uncertain clinical importance. While the authors stated that no patients reported complications associated with corticosteroid use, no adverse events are reported.

### Corticosteroids for prevention of postextubation laryngeal edema in adults [^113bz23w]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic corticosteroid therapy in preventing postextubation laryngeal edema (PELE) and the need for reintubation in adults.

Data Sources

Literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1966-January 2008) and the Cochrane Library using the terms laryngeal edema, airway obstruction, postextubation stridor, intubation, glucocorticoids, and corticosteroids. Bibliographies of cited references were reviewed and a manual search of abstracts from recent pulmonary and critical care meetings was completed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language, placebo-controlled, randomized studies evaluating the use of prophylactic corticosteroids for the prevention of postextubation laryngeal edema or postextubation stridor (PES) in adults were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Although laryngoscopy is the gold standard method for diagnosing PELE, PES is more commonly used for diagnosis in clinical practice. While 3 older studies failed to demonstrate benefit with the prophylactic administration of corticosteroid therapy in terms of reducing PELE, PES, or the need for reintubation, each of these studies evaluated only a single dose of steroid therapy that was initiated only 30–60 minutes prior to a planned extubation in a population of patients at low-risk for PELE. In comparison, 3 newer studies, each using 4 doses of corticosteroid therapy initiated 12–24 hours prior to a planned extubation in patients deemed to be at high baseline risk for developing PELE, demonstrated a reduction in PELE, PES, and the need for reintubation; no safety concerns were identified. Current evidence therefore suggests that prophylactic intravenous methylprednisolone therapy (20–40 mg every 4–6 h) should be considered 12–24 hours prior to a planned extubation in patients at high-risk for PELE (eg, mechanical ventilation > 6 days).

Conclusions

Data from the most recent well-designed clinical trials suggest that prophylactic corticosteroid therapy can reduce the incidence of PELE and the subsequent need for reintubation in mechanically ventilated patients at high-risk for PELE. Based on this information, clinicians should consider initiating prophylactic corticosteroid therapy in this population. Further studies are needed to establish the optimal dosing regimens as well as the subgroups of patients at high risk for PELE who will derive the greatest benefit from this preventive steroid therapy.

### Hoarseness in asthmatic patients: the side effect of inhaled steroid or not? [^115jP2P2]. The Journal of Asthma (2007). Low credibility.

Hoarseness is one of the possible side effects of inhaled steroid in asthmatic patients as well as a common presenting feature of laryngeal tuberculosis. We report an asthmatic patient on inhaled corticosteroid treatment who presented with a 3-month history of hoarseness. Laryngeal tuberculosis without pulmonary involvement was diagnosed by laryngeal biopsy and microbiologic studies. Laryngeal tuberculosis should be considered in asthmatic patients who present with hoarseness, at least in regions in which tuberculosis is prevalent.

### Dysphonia associated with epidural steroid injection: a case report [^116K9pqG]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

A 46-year-old patient with left-side low back pain developed symptoms of dysphonia and throat irritation 24 hours after receiving a fluoroscopically guided steroid injection into the epidural space. A direct laryngoscopy performed before a second injection detected no abnormalities. When dysphonia reappeared 48 hours after that injection, laryngoscopy revealed edema in the anterior vocal cord with thick surrounding mucous. Full clinical resolution of the dysphonia was apparent by laryngoscopy 15 days after the second injection. The mechanism of dysphonia after epidural steroid injection is unknown, but it may result from a systemic steroid effect.

Introduction: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common rheumatic disease in childhood. It usually presents with peripheral joint involvement but the diagnosis can be challenging due to possible misleading presenting features mimicking infections, malignancies, or other diseases.

Objectives: We describe a child with a very atypical JIA onset involving the laryngeal joints.

Methods: Case reports

Results: A 4-year-old boy presented with a 6-months history of hoarse voice, recurrent barking cough with mild inspiratory stridor. Pediatric pneumologist suggested a course of inhaled and oral corticosteroids with transient improvement but relapse after steroid withdrawal. Lab tests: ESR 56 mm/h, CRP 10 mg/L, negative ANCAs, positive ANA. Neck CT and MRI showed subglottic mucosal thickening with narrowing of the larynx lumen. Laryngotracheobronchoscopy revealed edema of the subglottic region; biopsy showed non specificic subepithelial lymphocytic and granulocytic infiltrate with exclusion of a neoplastic condition. Few days after stopping a short course of corticosteroids, he reported pain and swelling on his right knee. Physical examination showed right knees arthritis and tenosynovitis of the lateral compartment of the left ankle. To further investigated the complex clinical picture, a PET-MRI was performed showing a significant increased uptake of [18F] FDG at the right knee, left ankle and peri-laryngeal region, confirming right knee arthritis, left posterior tibial tenosynovitis and cricoarytenoids inflammation. Based on clinical course, laboratory and imaging results, we ended up to a diagnosis of JIA with involvement of cricoarytenoid joints, knee and ankle. A combined treatment with weekly subcutaneous methotrexate and oral prednisone led to a good control of both articular and respiratory symptoms. Due to corticosteroid dependent course, 6 months later, Adalimumab was started. One month later corticosteroid was stopped and neck-MRI showed a marked reduction of the subglottic thickening.

### Systemic effects and absorption of subepithelial dexamethasone vocal fold injections [^112Fdn1B]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective/Hypothesis

To compare the systemic changes following two office-based procedures-subepithelial vocal fold steroid injections (VFSI) and vocal fold augmentation (VFA), and to characterize the magnitude and chronicity of the effects observed.

Study Design

Prospective, controlled before-after comparative study.

Methods

Patients prospectively underwent VFSI with 0.8–2mg of dexamethasone or VFA. Serum cortisol, white cell count (WCC), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured at day 0 (pre-procedure), 1 and 7. Salivary cortisol was measured at baseline and daily for 7days post-procedure.

Results

Fourteen patients underwent VFSI and 36 VFA. At baseline serum cortisol measured 304.6 ± 116.6nmol/L and fell significantly to 48.1 ± 41.8nmol/L 1day following dexamethasone injection (p = 0.001) and recovered by day 7 to 303.7 ± 78.7nmol/L. Salivary cortisol demonstrated a similar pattern with significant recovery demonstrated by day 3 (p = 0.001). White cell counts were affected by the systemic absorption of exogenous steroid and normalized by day 7. Patients who underwent VFA demonstrated no significant change in their serum or salivary cortisol and no significant change in their WCC. No significant changes in CRP or patient's physiological parameters were observed in either procedure.

Conclusion

Our findings demonstrate systemic absorption of dexamethasone following VFSI, with acute hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression which normalizes day 3 post-procedurally.

### Omalizumab for severe asthma? [^112vRUrG]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2006). Low credibility.

Up to 5% of patients with asthma have severe disease (i.e., around 250,000 people in the U.K.). This means their asthma remains uncontrolled despite optimal treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroid plus additional therapy or a regularoral corticosteroid, and with no otherexplanations such as poor adherenceto therapy and otherdiagnoses such as vocal cord dysfunction. Omalizumab (pronounced oh-ma-liz-oo-mab) (Xolair-Novartis) is a monoclonal antibody to IgE that is available in the U.K. as add-on therapy for people aged 12 years and over with severe persistent asthma that has an important allergic component. What benefits, if any, does omalizumab offer to such patients?

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^116nEJs9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Dysphonia implementation — antireflux medication use and voice therapy education are highlighted. The guideline notes that "there may be a significant role for antireflux therapy to treat laryngeal inflammation", but "empiric use of antireflux medications for dysphonia has minimal support and a growing list of potential risks", and "Avoidance of empiric use of antireflux therapy represents a significant change in practice for some clinicians". "Educational pamphlets describing the risks and benefits of these medications may help facilitate this potential change in practice pattern". Additionally, "Lack of knowledge about voice therapy by practitioners is a likely barrier to advocacy for its use. This barrier can be overcome by educational materials about voice therapy and its indications".

### Concentration effects of methylprednisolone in human vocal fold fibroblast-macrophage Co-culture [^113wgchq]. The Laryngoscope (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The diversity of glucocorticoid (GC) properties may underlie variability of clinical efficacy for vocal fold (VF) disease. Optimized therapeutic approaches must account for tissue complexity as well as interactions between cell types. We previously reported that reduced GC concentrations inhibited inflammation without eliciting fibrosis in mono-cultured VF fibroblasts and macrophages. These data suggested that a refined approach to GC concentration may improve outcomes. In the current study, co-culture of VF fibroblasts and macrophages was employed to investigate the effects of different concentrations of methylprednisolone on fibrotic and inflammatory response genes in VF fibroblasts to optimize management paradigms.

Study Design

In vitro.

Methods

THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophages were stimulated with interferon-γ (IFN-γ), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) to induce inflammatory (M(IFN/LPS)) and fibrotic (M(TGF)) phenotypes. Macrophages were then co-cultured with a human VF fibroblast cell line using a 0.4 μm pore membrane with or without 0.1–3000 nM methylprednisolone. Inflammatory (CXCL10, TNF, and PTGS2) and fibrotic (ACTA2, CCN2, and COL1A1) gene expression was quantified in fibroblasts.

Results

Incubating VF fibroblasts with M(IFN/LPS) macrophages increased expression of TNF and PTGS2, and this effect was inhibited by methylprednisolone. Incubation of VF fibroblasts with M(TGF) macrophages increased expression of ACTA2, CCN2, and COL1A1, and this effect was enhanced by methylprednisolone. The concentration of methylprednisolone required to downregulate inflammatory genes (TNF and PTGS2) was lower than that to upregulate fibrotic genes (ACTA2, CCN2, and COL1A1).

Conclusion

Reduced concentration of methylprednisolone effectively suppressed inflammatory genes without enhancing fibrotic genes, suggesting that a refined approach to GC concentration may improve clinical outcomes.

### Investigation of optimal trafermin dosage and pre-injection factors in vocal fold paralysis [^113aJ2dc]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Optimal trafermin dosages and outcome predictors for treating unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the optimal trafermin dosage and pre-injection factors contributing to voice improvement after intracordal trafermin injection (ITI) for UVFP.

Methods

Medical records of 198 patients diagnosed with UVFP who received ITI at the Tokyo Voice Center between 2012 and 2024 were retrospectively evaluated. To investigate the effect of ITI on voice improvement prior to trafermin injection, we assessed age, sex, causative diseases, and pre- and post-injection maximum phonation time (MPT), pitch range (PR), mean flow rate (MFR), and voice handicap index (VHI). Patients were categorized by dosage: low (< 100μg), normal (100μg), and high (> 100μg). The normal, low, and high groups comprised 152, 12, and 34 cases, respectively.

Results

Following ITI, improvements in the normal, low, and high dosage groups were as follows: MPT (s) (3.03, 3.13, 5.57), PR (ST) (6.82, 4.5, 8.74), MFR (mL/s) (191.28, 121.02, 409.63), and VHI (score) (21.75, 1.83, 33.45) (with data missing for MFR and VHI in eight and three cases, respectively). Analysis of variance revealed significant improvements in MPT, MFR, and VHI among groups. Dunnett's test showed significantly better outcomes in the high-dosage group compared to normal. Covariance analysis identified pre-injection values and comorbidities as significant predictors.

Conclusion

Higher trafermin dosage may provide greater and more sustained voice improvement in patients with UVFP. Identifying optimal candidates based on pre-injection factors can allow for more personalized treatments.

Bell palsy — recommendations for future research: It is unlikely that additional research regarding the efficacy of steroids will change the current estimate of its effect, and large randomized trials comparing outcomes in patients with Bell palsy receiving steroids with or without antivirals would help in determining whether the addition of antivirals to steroid treatment results in a modest benefit. Such trials should be powered to allow pre-specified subgroup analyses, and further research efforts should be directed toward determining the optimal dose and timing of steroids, the effect of other therapeutic modalities, and the identification of the effect of steroids in specific populations, such as in children.

### Severe airway stenosis associated with Crohn's disease: case report [^112eyJbB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Tracheobronchial involvement is rare in CD, but has been reported before. Mucosal inflammation of the trachea and bronchi may be observed, with or without upper airway stenosis, in any age group. Histologically, there may be airway infiltration by inflammatory cells and mucosal ulceration, but non-caseating granulomas are not always present. The diagnosis of CD usually precedes the presentation of pulmonary manifestations, but previously undiagnosed CD presenting with airway manifestations has also been reported. Symptoms of tracheobronchial involvement usually respond well to appropriate doses of inhaled and/or systemic steroids. In the present case, however, although the patient reported improvement with steroid treatment, she still complained of symptoms compromising her quality of life, making a more invasive approach necessary. Bronchoscopic dilatation led to complete remission of her symptoms. Stent placement was not feasible as the lesion was in the glottic and subglottic space involving the vocal cords. The lesions were not approachable surgically as they were multifocal and still revealed chronic inflammation. Surgery could be indicated at a later point when the inflammation has turned into fibrosis. Aggressive treatment with inhaled and oral steroids is still necessary for this patient to avoid relapse, since inflammation is an ongoing process.

In summary, this is a report of a patient with CD who developed severe airway obstruction, despite the fact that gastrointestinal symptoms were well-controlled on conventional CD treatment. Systemic and inhaled steroid treatment led to some improvement, in agreement with previous reports of the effectiveness of steroid administration in similar cases. In this case however, mucosal inflammation and symptoms persisted, making a more invasive approach necessary. Interventional pulmonary medicine has made great progress during recent years, proving to be a valuable tool for respiratory physicians. To our knowledge this is the first report of a patient with tracheal stenosis from CD successfully treated with rigid bronchoscopy and dilatation. Respiratory involvement in CD might be more common than appreciated and the need exists for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of airway complications, which might otherwise prove to be life-threatening.

### Role of steroids in acute phonotrauma: a basic science investigation [^112Yx87h]. The Laryngoscope (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Steroids are used for the treatment of laryngitis in vocal performers and other individuals despite the absence of evidence demonstrating their impact on vocal fold inflammation. Our objective was to examine laryngeal secretion cytokine inflammatory profile changes associated with corticosteroid treatment in a human phonotrauma model.

Study Design

Prospective, individual, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial.

Methods

Participants included 10 healthy females who were randomized to either treatment with oral hydrocortisone or placebo, each given in three doses over 20 hours after the experimental induction of acute phonotrauma. Cytokines associated with inflammation and healing (interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-6, IL-10) were measured in laryngeal secretions before and after vocal loading and at 4 and 20 hours after treatment.

Results

Proinflammatory mediators IL-1β and IL-6 were doubled in the controls versus the steroid treatment group at 21 hours following induction of acute vocal fold inflammation. Anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 showed a 6.3-fold increase in the steroid treatment group versus the controls, indicating anti-inflammatory modulation by steroid treatment.

Conclusions

This study provides biologic evidence supporting the use of steroids for acute vocal fold inflammation associated with phonotrauma.

### The impact of identifying laryngeal obstruction syndromes on reducing treatment of pediatric asthma: a systematic review [^1124VB5t]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Asthma, the most common respiratory chronic disease in childhood, causes considerable morbidity in the pediatric population. Treatment, particularly with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), introduces the risk of side effects including reduced growth velocity and adult height, elevated body mass index, adrenal suppression, dysphonia, thyroarytenoid muscle atrophy, and local Candida infection.,

Asthma can be a misdiagnosis or comorbid condition for inducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO), a laryngeal disorder characterized by inappropriate vocal fold (VF) adduction during the respiratory cycle. Commonly used terms have evolved over time, from vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) and paradoxical VF motion to the physiologic descriptive term ILO. A subset of asthmatic adults have been diagnosed with ILO; the converse is also true and in one study up to 63% of adults with ILO have been diagnosed with asthma. Typical ILO symptoms include stridor, wheeze, and cough. Phenotypically these can occur spontaneously (SILO), be induced by exercise (EILO), or have a mixed presentation. In one study of 99/146 adolescents reporting exercise‐induced dyspnea, 19% had asthma and nearly 6% had EILO, with about 2/3 of the EILO patients showing overlap. Misdiagnosis can be costly. A 2016 U.S. study showed that ILO patients were treated for asthma for an average of 9 years with monthly medication costs of USD $136.40–$256.90 plus $566 in excess emergency visits.

The gold standard for ILO diagnosis is visualizing abnormal VF adduction during laryngoscopy. Paradoxical electrical activity on laryngeal electromyography can detect ILO but is not recommended in children due to the need for anesthesia.

Treatment includes VF abduction exercises, training with a speech‐language pathologist (SLP), or behavioral therapy. Inhaled anticholinergic (ipratropium bromide) is used to treat EILO, based on the premise that vagus nerve stimulation and a dysautonomic response to respiratory irritants may trigger symptoms. Local botulinum toxin injection can lead to improvement in selected adult patients, but has not been demonstrated in children. This systematic review evaluated the scientific evidence on the effects of diagnosing and treating ILO on asthma medication use and respiratory symptoms among pediatric patients.

### Morphological and histological changes of rabbit vocal fold after steroid injection [^111ASj92]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

The purpose of this study was to investigate the morphological and histological change of vocal folds (VFs) after steroid injection in a rabbit model.

Study Design

Prospective animal study.

Setting

Tertiary academic medical center.

Subjects and Methods

Twenty-four New Zealand white rabbits were used in this study. We randomly classified rabbits into the 3 groups and triamcinolone acetonide suspension was injected to the right VF with different concentrations. Left VF was injected with the same volume of phosphate-buffered saline as control. Endoscopic evaluation was performed to measure morphological changes. The larynges were collected for histological analysis, and the VFs were stained with hematoxylin-eosin for assessing inflammatory response, glandular atrophy, and muscular atrophy and with Masson's trichrome for assessing collagen deposition.

Results

In morphological assessment, there were no differences in VF mass reduction, mucosal atrophy, and granulation formation between both VFs. Histological assessments showed no significant difference in inflammatory response, glandular atrophy, and collagen deposition between both VFs. However, there was a difference in muscular atrophy and epithelial layer thinning in steroid injected right VFs. Muscular atrophy had been completely recovered over time, but mild epithelial thinning was continued until 12 weeks. The longer exposure time and larger dose did not increase the intensity of muscular atrophy or epithelial thinning.

Conclusion

We demonstrated that the VF steroid injection resulted in no significant changes in morphology and histology of rabbit VF. However, steroid injection may induce several VF histological changes and these results are needed to be considered when treating humans.

Domain 2: Subglottic stenosis and ear, nose and throat disease recommendations

GPA-related subglottic stenosis diagnostic considerations

10. GPA patients with airway symptoms (exertional dyspnoea, stridor) should be investigated by an Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) and/or Respiratory specialist with expertise in vasculitis and airway stenosis (GRADE 1C, SoA 99%).

Systemic and surgical treatment options in subglottic stenosis

11. Glucocorticoid therapy can help reduce inflammation in GPA-sub-glottic stenosis but is not the preferred option for maintenance therapy. More significant disease requires induction and maintenance therapy following the recommendations for systemic GPA and MPA treatment (GRADE 1C, SoA 98%).

Nomenclature in sino-nasal GPA

12. The term 'limited GPA' may underestimate disease burden; terms such as ENT-localised or sino-nasal GPA are preferred (GRADE 1C, SoA 97%).

Integrated multi-disciplinary assessment in sino-nasal GPA

13. All people living with AAV affecting the sino-nasal tract should be offered multi-disciplinary assessment that includes input from ENT surgeons and physicians experienced in the management of AAV (GRADE 1C, SoA 98%).

Recognition of cocaine-associated vasculitis conditions

14. History of previous and current cocaine use should be assessed (both drug history and toxicology) at baseline in all individuals suspected of having AAV and repeat toxicology screening considered in patients with persistent or refractory sino-nasal disease (GRADE 1B, SoA 99%).

Treatment of sino-nasal disease

15a. Immunosuppression – first line treatment with RTX or cyclophosphamide and GC or avacopan for organ-threatening ENT disease is recommended as this provides early disease control and limits accrual of damage (GRADE 1A, SoA 98%).
15b. Topical and local symptomatic treatments should be offered to people living with sino-nasal disease (GRADE 1B, SoA 99%).
15c. Screening for bacterial carriage and infection, and antimicrobial treatment where indicated, should be offered to people living with sino-nasal disease (GRADE 1C, SoA 98%).

Surgery for sino-nasal disease

16. It is essential that disease is in remission for at least 12 months (and desirable that maintenance prednisolone dose is ≤ 5 mg) at time of reconstructive surgery, otherwise high failure and complication rates are frequently observed (GRADE 1C, SoA 97%).
