## Question

What is the role of imaging studies in diagnosing endometriosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of imaging studies in diagnosing endometriosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical paradigm and whether imaging has supplanted surgery. Then, I should verify the modern, guideline-based diagnostic approach. Next, I will examine first-line versus second-line imaging and their comparative strengths. After that, I need to appraise diagnostic performance by lesion type and acknowledge limitations. Finally, I will integrate imaging into treatment planning, special populations, and a practical algorithm, and close with the bottom-line clinical takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the historical context and the current paradigm shift. Historically, laparoscopy with histology was considered the gold standard, but contemporary guidelines and reviews emphasize a noninvasive, clinical-plus-imaging approach to diagnosis, reserving surgery for treatment rather than diagnosis, which reduces delay and morbidity while maintaining accuracy when imaging is expertly performed [^682efa72] [^a6146c80] [^75e99b53].

> I need to check the modern diagnostic framework. Current high-credibility guidelines recommend integrating clinical history, examination, and imaging rather than relying on surgery for diagnosis. Importantly, a negative imaging study does not exclude endometriosis, particularly superficial peritoneal disease, so imaging complements rather than replaces clinical judgment and, when needed, empiric therapy or surgical exploration [^a6146c80] [^f24fa443] [^14ad53be].

> Next, I should review first-line imaging. Transvaginal ultrasound is the first-line modality because it is accessible, cost-effective, and accurate for ovarian endometriomas and can detect deep infiltrating endometriosis when performed with dedicated protocols. Guidelines from ESHRE, SOGC, and ACR align on TVUS as the initial test, with the caveat that expertise and technique markedly influence performance [^a6146c80] [^880633cb] [^0df4505e] [^ebc47c4c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about replacing TVUS with MRI. I should confirm when MRI is indicated. MRI is the second-line modality for inconclusive ultrasound, suspected deep disease beyond sonographic reach, preoperative mapping, or when TVUS is not feasible. It offers multiplanar soft-tissue contrast and a global pelvic survey, which is valuable for DIE mapping and complex cases, though it is less sensitive for small superficial lesions and is more resource-intensive [^16028a09] [^f70bf25e] [^75e99b53] [^59ebdf36].

> I will now examine diagnostic performance by lesion type, starting with endometriomas. TVUS demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity for endometriomas, approximating 93% and 96% respectively in pooled analyses, and MRI performs similarly, meeting criteria for a replacement test in some studies. This supports using TVUS to confidently diagnose endometriomas and guide management, including surveillance or surgical planning when indicated [^acfc531b] [^e9a1ecc8].

> For deep infiltrating endometriosis, I should double-check the numbers. TVUS shows pooled sensitivity around 79% and specificity around 94%, approaching a SpPin triage test, while MRI shows sensitivity around 94% and specificity around 77%, approaching a replacement or SnNout test. Performance varies by site, with both modalities performing particularly well for rectosigmoid involvement, and advanced sonographic techniques with bowel preparation can further improve detection [^acfc531b] [^a5284180] [^e9a1ecc8].

> But wait, what about superficial peritoneal endometriosis. I need to ensure I state this clearly: neither TVUS nor MRI reliably detects superficial peritoneal disease because lesions are often submillimeter and beyond current spatial resolution, so a negative imaging study cannot exclude early-stage disease. This is a key limitation that reinforces the need to integrate symptoms, response to therapy, and selective surgical evaluation when suspicion remains high [^f24fa443] [^8aeff510] [^99f6ca84].

> Next, I should review how imaging informs treatment planning. Preoperative mapping with TVUS and especially MRI guides surgical approach, predicts complexity, and reduces incomplete excisions. Structured reporting and classifications such as #Enzian improve communication with surgeons and patients, and multidisciplinary conferences enhance accuracy and coordination, which is particularly important for multi-compartment DIE requiring colorectal or urologic involvement [^59ebdf36] [^4b30d32f] [^9aa360f7].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In adolescents, transabdominal or transperineal ultrasound may be substituted when TVUS is not appropriate, and MRI can be used when ultrasound is inconclusive or deep disease is suspected. In postmenopausal patients, imaging helps detect endometriosis and assess malignant transformation risk. For persistent or recurrent symptoms after surgery, contrast-enhanced MRI is recommended to evaluate residual or recurrent disease and complications [^5f5af145] [^72fb4d25] [^b76a7384].

> I should confirm the role of CT and nuclear medicine. CT is not recommended as a primary diagnostic tool for endometriosis due to limited soft-tissue contrast and radiation exposure, though it may be used for acute pain or alternative diagnoses. Molecular imaging with PET tracers like FAPI is investigational and not yet validated for routine clinical use, so it should not change current practice [^7a65a547] [^b4d79c5e] [^a9a91e65].

> Now, I need to ensure the practical algorithm is coherent. Start with clinical suspicion based on symptoms and exam, obtain TVUS as first-line imaging, and if TVUS is negative or nondiagnostic but suspicion remains high, proceed to MRI for mapping and preoperative planning. If both are negative and symptoms persist, consider diagnostic laparoscopy or empiric medical therapy depending on goals and risk, recognizing that a negative imaging workup reduces but does not eliminate the likelihood of endometriosis [^a6146c80] [^16028a09] [^14ad53be].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to avoid overstatement. Imaging has moved from an adjunct to a central pillar in endometriosis diagnosis, enabling earlier, noninvasive recognition of endometriomas and deep disease, while acknowledging that superficial disease remains below the threshold of current imaging. Expertise, standardized protocols, and multidisciplinary integration are essential to realize the full clinical value of TVUS and MRI in reducing diagnostic delay and optimizing outcomes [^682efa72] [^e9a1ecc8] [^59ebdf36].

Imaging is central to modern endometriosis diagnosis, with **transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) as first-line** for detecting ovarian endometriomas and deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) [^880633cb] [^ebc47c4c], and **MRI as second-line** for equivocal TVUS, complex anatomy, or preoperative mapping [^16028a09] [^59ebdf36]. TVUS has high accuracy for endometriomas and moderate sensitivity for DIE, while MRI offers superior soft-tissue contrast and multiplanar views for deep lesions and surgical planning [^acfc531b] [^e9a1ecc8]. Neither modality reliably detects superficial peritoneal disease, so **negative imaging does not exclude endometriosis** [^f24fa443] [^8aeff510]. Imaging reduces diagnostic delay, guides management, and decreases unnecessary surgery, but diagnosis remains clinical plus imaging, with laparoscopy reserved for unresolved cases [^682efa72] [^14ad53be].

## Imaging modalities and their diagnostic accuracy

| **Attribute** | **Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS)** | **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** |
|-|-|-|
| Role | First-line for endometriomas and DIE; high sensitivity/specificity for endometriomas; moderate sensitivity for DIE [^880633cb] [^acfc531b] | Second-line for equivocal TVUS, complex anatomy, or preoperative mapping; high sensitivity/specificity for DIE [^16028a09] [^59ebdf36] |
| Limitations | Operator-dependent; limited for superficial peritoneal disease [^e9a1ecc8] [^f24fa443] | Higher cost, limited availability, longer scan time [^b4d79c5e] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **First-line imaging**: TVUS is recommended as the initial imaging modality for suspected endometriosis [^880633cb] [^6ca80877].
- **Second-line imaging**: MRI is recommended when TVUS is inconclusive or when deep lesions are suspected [^16028a09] [^f70bf25e].
- **Laparoscopy**: Reserved for cases with negative imaging but persistent symptoms or when empirical treatment fails [^14ad53be] [^17f81aa0].

---

## Impact on clinical management

Imaging **reduces diagnostic delay** by enabling earlier, noninvasive diagnosis and guiding timely management [^6f345b33] [^682efa72]. It also supports **surgical planning** by mapping disease extent, identifying involved organs, and facilitating multidisciplinary care [^59ebdf36] [^9aa360f7]. By providing noninvasive diagnosis, imaging reduces unnecessary diagnostic laparoscopies and their risks [^682efa72] [^75e99b53].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Superficial peritoneal disease is often **below imaging resolution**, so negative studies do not exclude endometriosis [^f24fa443] [^99f6ca84]. TVUS performance is operator-dependent, and expertise varies by center [^e9a1ecc8] [^3d2f57f9]. MRI access, cost, and scan time can limit use, especially in resource-limited settings [^b4d79c5e].

---

## Emerging imaging technologies

Artificial intelligence is being explored to **enhance diagnostic accuracy** and reduce operator dependence [^6f345b33] [^b4d79c5e]. Molecular imaging with PET tracers (e.g. FAPI) is under investigation but is not yet clinically validated [^a9a91e65] [^b4d79c5e].

---

Imaging is integral to endometriosis care, with **TVUS first-line and MRI second-line**; together they enable earlier diagnosis, guide therapy, and reduce surgery, though superficial disease remains a challenge and diagnosis still rests on clinical plus imaging assessment [^a6146c80] [^682efa72].

### ACR appropriateness criteria® endometriosis [^87c0f61e]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a common condition impacting individuals assigned female at birth. Though incompletely understood, the disorder is caused by endometrial-like tissue located outside of the endometrial cavity, associated with inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical presentation is variable, ranging from asymptomatic to severe pelvic pain and infertility. Treatment is determined by the patient's individualized goals and can include medical therapies to temporize symptoms or definitive surgical excision. Imaging is used to help diagnose endometriosis and for treatment planning. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Continued improvement to imaging diagnosis and treatment triage of endometriosis: the role of the multi-disciplinary conference [^9aa360f7]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patient-centered endometriosis management tailored to the individual patient's subset of symptoms often requires highly sensitive and specific preoperative imaging. In the setting of a present ongoing learning curve among radiologists who interpret pelvis ultrasounds and MRIs for diagnosis of endometriosis, we have found that routine feedback between minimally invasive gynecology surgeons and radiologists, based on pre-operative imaging and postoperative laparoscopic findings, is essential for the continual improvement of imaging-based staging of endometriosis and empower pre-operative imaging as an important pillar of endometriosis management. We share illustrative patient cases, which, after collaborative discussion during our routine multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary conferences (MDCs) have led to improved patient counseling, better pre-surgical planning, and therefore improved patient satisfaction. Our endometriosis MDCs will continue to improve patient management in the future by providing a forum for trainees in medical, surgical, imaging, and pathology specialties to gain expertise directly from subspecialists, and participate in the care of these patients.

### Imaging modalities for the non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis [^acfc531b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

About 10% of women of reproductive age suffer from endometriosis. Endometriosis is a costly chronic disease that causes pelvic pain and subfertility. Laparoscopy, the gold standard diagnostic test for endometriosis, is expensive and carries surgical risks. Currently, no non-invasive tests that can be used to accurately diagnose endometriosis are available in clinical practice. This is the first review of diagnostic test accuracy of imaging tests for endometriosis that uses Cochrane methods to provide an update on the rapidly expanding literature in this field.

Objectives

- To provide estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis, ovarian endometriosis and deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) versus surgical diagnosis as a reference standard.• To describe performance of imaging tests for mapping of deep endometriotic lesions in the pelvis at specific anatomical sites. Imaging tests were evaluated as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery and as triage tests that would assist decision making regarding diagnostic surgery for endometriosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to 20 April 2015: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, LILACS, OAIster, TRIP, ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDION, DARE, and PubMed. Searches were not restricted to a particular study design or language nor to specific publication dates. The search strategy incorporated words in the title, abstracts, text words across the record and medical subject headings (MeSH).

Selection Criteria

We considered published peer-reviewed cross-sectional studies and randomised controlled trials of any size that included prospectively recruited women of reproductive age suspected of having one or more of the following target conditions: endometrioma, pelvic endometriosis, DIE or endometriotic lesions at specific intrapelvic anatomical locations. We included studies that compared the diagnostic test accuracy of one or more imaging modalities versus findings of surgical visualisation of endometriotic lesions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently collected and performed a quality assessment of data from each study. For each imaging test, data were classified as positive or negative for surgical detection of endometriosis, and sensitivity and specificity estimates were calculated. If two or more tests were evaluated in the same cohort, each was considered as a separate data set. We used the bivariate model to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity when sufficient data sets were available. Predetermined criteria for a clinically useful imaging test to replace diagnostic surgery included sensitivity ≥ 94% and specificity ≥ 79%. Criteria for triage tests were set at sensitivity ≥ 95% and specificity ≥ 50%, ruling out the diagnosis with a negative result (SnNout test - if sensitivity is high, a negative test rules out pathology) or at sensitivity ≥ 50% with specificity ≥ 95%, ruling in the diagnosis with a positive result (SpPin test - if specificity is high, a positive test rules in pathology).

Main Results

We included 49 studies involving 4807 women: 13 studies evaluated pelvic endometriosis, 10 endometriomas and 15 DIE, and 33 studies addressed endometriosis at specific anatomical sites. Most studies were of poor methodological quality. The most studied modalities were transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with outcome measures commonly demonstrating diversity in diagnostic estimates; however, sources of heterogeneity could not be reliably determined. No imaging test met the criteria for a replacement or triage test for detecting pelvic endometriosis, albeit TVUS approached the criteria for a SpPin triage test. For endometrioma, TVUS (eight studies, 765 participants; sensitivity 0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87, 0.99), specificity 0.96 (95% CI 0.92, 0.99)) qualified as a SpPin triage test and approached the criteria for a replacement and SnNout triage test, whereas MRI (three studies, 179 participants; sensitivity 0.95 (95% CI 0.90, 1.00), specificity 0.91 (95% CI 0.86, 0.97)) met the criteria for a replacement and SnNout triage test and approached the criteria for a SpPin test. For DIE, TVUS (nine studies, 12 data sets, 934 participants; sensitivity 0.79 (95% CI 0.69, 0.89) and specificity 0.94 (95% CI 0.88, 1.00)) approached the criteria for a SpPin triage test, and MRI (six studies, seven data sets, 266 participants; sensitivity 0.94 (95% CI 0.90, 0.97), specificity 0.77 (95% CI 0.44, 1.00)) approached the criteria for a replacement and SnNout triage test. Other imaging tests assessed in small individual studies could not be statistically evaluated.TVUS met the criteria for a SpPin triage test in mapping DIE to uterosacral ligaments, rectovaginal septum, vaginal wall, pouch of Douglas (POD) and rectosigmoid. MRI met the criteria for a SpPin triage test for POD and vaginal and rectosigmoid endometriosis. Transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) might qualify as a SpPin triage test for rectosigmoid involvement but could not be adequately assessed for other anatomical sites because heterogeneous data were scant. Multi-detector computerised tomography enema (MDCT-e) displayed the highest diagnostic performance for rectosigmoid and other bowel endometriosis and met the criteria for both SpPin and SnNout triage tests, but studies were too few to provide meaningful results. Diagnostic accuracies were higher for TVUS with bowel preparation (TVUS-BP) and rectal water contrast (RWC-TVS) and for 3.0TMRI than for conventional methods, although the paucity of studies precluded statistical evaluation.

Authors' Conclusions

None of the evaluated imaging modalities were able to detect overall pelvic endometriosis with enough accuracy that they would be suggested to replace surgery. Specifically for endometrioma, TVUS qualified as a SpPin triage test. MRI displayed sufficient accuracy to suggest utility as a replacement test, but the data were too scant to permit meaningful conclusions. TVUS could be used clinically to identify additional anatomical sites of DIE compared with MRI, thus facilitating preoperative planning. Rectosigmoid endometriosis was the only site that could be accurately mapped by using TVUS, TRUS, MRI or MDCT-e. Studies evaluating recent advances in imaging modalities such as TVUS-BP, RWC-TVS, 3.0TMRI and MDCT-e were observed to have high diagnostic accuracies but were too few to allow prudent evaluation of their diagnostic role. In view of the low quality of most of the included studies, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. Future well-designed diagnostic studies undertaken to compare imaging tests for diagnostic test accuracy and costs are recommended.

### Endometriosis: clinical features, MR imaging findings and pathologic correlation [^b629489b]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Endometriosis is a chronic condition affecting women during the reproductive lifespan. Diagnosis of endometriosis must take into account clinical symptoms, physical examination, laboratory tests and different imaging techniques. Since pelvic anatomy is complex and may vary with distortion by invasive endometriosis, the radiologist must be aware of both normal and deranged anatomy.

The ideal purpose of surgery is a therapeutic and effective intervention based on a careful preoperative evaluation. From this point of view, the role of MR imaging to help diagnose and plan surgical strategy is critical in the management of the disease. Preoperative detection of all endometriotic lesions is recommended to choose the surgical approach and to plan a multidisciplinary team work. This multidisciplinary approach including radiologists, gynaecologists, urologists, gastrointestinal surgeons, and (in selected cases) neurosurgeons, is recommended to improve diagnostic imaging accuracy and patients' outcome, and to reduce postoperative complication rates. The recent awareness that endometriosis may be medically treated based on strong clinical suspicion and that laparoscopy should be intended for surgical treatment, not for diagnostic purposes, furtherly enhance the role of non-invasive diagnostic procedures and particularly of MR imaging.

In any case, due to the complexity of the disease, it is appropriate to centralize the overall care of endometriosis patients to reference centres in order to pursue a patient-centred approach tailored to the patient's specific condition and desires.

### Nonsurgical approaches to the diagnosis and evaluation of endometriosis [^8aeff510]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

An inability to make the diagnosis of endometriosis or evaluate lesion response to treatment without surgery is a clear impediment to understanding the disease and to developing new therapies. The need is particularly strong for rASRM Stage 1 or 2 disease, since higher stage (rASRM Stage 3 or 4) endometriosis can often be diagnosed by ultrasound or other imaging techniques. Despite promising findings in association studies, no biomarkers or nonsurgical diagnostic or evaluation methods for Stage 1 or Stage 2 endometriosis has yet been clinically validated. Admittedly, validation is difficult, since surgery is required as a gold standard diagnostic method for comparison. This manuscript is aimed as a succinct review of what is known about nonsurgical approaches to detect and assess endometriosis, with an emphasis on Stage 1 and 2.

### Best practices: ultrasound versus MRI in the assessment of pelvic endometriosis [^e9a1ecc8]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a common yet morbid disease. Imaging plays an important role in diagnosis and treatment planning. Both ultrasound (US) and MRI are used to detect disease. We performed a literature review to assess whether one is superior. A total of 33 studies from the 4482 identified in the initial search were found to assess the efficacy of US and/or MRI in detecting pelvic endometriosis. Most studies were performed at centers with extensive experience with endometriosis, using dedicated US and MRI protocols. A wide range of sensitivities and specificities were reported, but overall weighted means of diagnostic statistics for US and MRI were similar. The choice of dedicated US versus dedicated MRI in the evaluation of endometriosis should therefore be based on the expertise in the region. The data also showed US had better accuracy than MRI for identifying the depth of wall invasion in bowel-wall disease, whereas MRI better depicted pelvic-wall and extraperitoneal disease than US. Routine US and MRI protocols performed worse than dedicated US and MRI protocols, which may account for delays in diagnoses. Clinical and research efforts directed at improving the sensitivity of routine imaging for diagnosing deep endometriosis could improve patient access to appropriate care.

### Postoperative imaging of endometriosis [^0c5ef131]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a highly prevalent disease that affects 10%-15% of women of reproductive age worldwide and is mainly associated with chronic pelvic pain and infertility. With the widespread use of imaging for the diagnosis and monitoring of endometriosis, combined with the ability of surgery to eradicate the disease and address infertility, there has been a significant increase in recent years in imaging examinations for postoperative evaluation of endometriosis. US and MRI are used not only to help diagnose and map endometriosis but also to evaluate refractory symptoms, residual lesions, and complications at posttreatment assessment. Knowledge of surgical techniques and recognition of expected postoperative imaging findings are crucial to differentiate postoperative changes from residual disease and/or recurrence. The authors discuss imaging aspects of postoperative endometriosis, with an emphasis on the imaging approach, comprehension of surgical techniques, recognition of the expected findings, possible complications, and analysis of residual disease or recurrence. © RSNA, 2024 Test Your Knowledge questions for this article are available in the supplemental material.

### Changing the "scope" of diagnosing endometriosis: the new frontier of noninvasive markers [^9b037eed]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis affects 1 in 9 women, and diagnosis is often delayed using conventional laparoscopy. Noninvasive markers of endometriosis have the potential to enable earlier diagnosis, leading to more timely treatment and better surgical planning. This issue's Views and Reviews seek to summarize the current status of noninvasive markers of endometriosis. Experts in reproductive medicine with prior work in this field summarize the key literature on endometrial biomarkers, blood biomarkers, and advanced imaging, including ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. At present, there is no single definitive biomarker that can diagnose endometriosis with high sensitivity and specificity. Advancing endometriosis biomarkers beyond the discovery phase is challenging, and more work is needed. Clinicians who have an improved understanding of noninvasive imaging and biomarkers will be able to identify endometriosis earlier and more easily, allowing for prompt consideration of treatment options. We believe that continued research, innovation, and development will lead to improved diagnostic accuracy and guidance toward the best treatments for endometriosis-related pain and infertility.

### Endometriosis revisited: an imaging review of the usual and unusual manifestations with pathological correlation [^0fb2e784]. Clinical Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The manifestations of endometriosis commonly present a diagnostic challenge to the gynecologist and radiologist. Familiarity with its varied presentations may allow for a more accurate diagnosis. The goal of this review is to the present the imaging spectrum of endometriosis, less common sites of involvement as well as the potential rare complications. Relevant surgical and histopathological correlation is also provided. In addition to clinical evaluation and sonography, MRI is a highly accurate imaging modality in the diagnosis of endometriosis. It possesses a distinctive advantage over other modalities in that it allows a complete survey of the pelvic compartments. The potentially devastating effects of endometriosis include pelvic pain and even infertility. Since standard treatment is surgical, the radiologist needs to be familiar with the various manifestations in order to aid diagnosis for appropriate management.

### Magnetic resonance imaging for deep infiltrating endometriosis: current concepts, imaging technique and key findings [^19bed50a]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Because of its extreme clinical heterogeneity, pelvic endometriosis remains challenging to diagnose. Current evidence demonstrates that the disease should be diagnosed non-invasively by combining the information from patient history, clinical examination, imaging and response to medical treatment. Because the diagnostic accuracy of MRI may differ depending on radiologist experience, this review article aims to help radiologists obtain meaningful images with a tailored MR-acquisition protocol and recognize a wide range of pelvic changes that may result from endometriosis.

However, the literature is somewhat fragmented, and the intersection of these 2 fields has not yet been collectively reviewed. In this installment of the Focus on Molecular Imaging series, we will examine recent advances in the use of PET, SPECT, MRI, and fluorescence imaging for the diagnosis and management of these conditions (Fig. 1). Although both preclinical and clinical results will be covered, particular emphasis will be placed on recent human trials as well as areas of need and opportunities for growth. It is our sincere hope that this work will not only highlight exciting extant results but also inspire new work by bringing attention to the gaps that can be filled by repurposing old tools or developing new ones.

FIGURE 1.
Studies cited for diagnosis and management of conditions.

Before we begin, it is important to recognize that one imaging modality — ultrasonography — has long been commonplace in gynecology. Ultrasonography is easily the most often-used noninvasive diagnostic tool in the field, helping clinicians visualize both normal and aberrant pelvic anatomy. Yet despite its ubiquity, ultrasound is not without problems, as it suffers from suboptimal specificity for some conditions (e.g. endometriosis and adenomyosis) and is susceptible to operator, technique, and interpretation biases. We have chosen not to cover ultrasound imaging in this review, primarily because its outsized presence in the field threatens to swamp our discussion of other emergent modalities but also because, strictly speaking, it is more of an anatomic than molecular imaging methodology. However, excellent reviews on its present and future role in the management of benign gynecological conditions can be found elsewhere.

### A practical guide to the clinical evaluation of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain [^931f1ec5]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis-associated pain (EAP) has a significant impact on the quality of life of those affected and their families. Recognizing that endometriosis is a chronic condition associated with an impairment in function and negative social impact, there is a shift toward reducing diagnostic delays and initiating timely management. This article provides a comprehensive and practical approach to the clinical diagnosis of EAP, which can subsequently facilitate prompt and directed treatment. The key components of the history, physical examination, and high-quality imaging to evaluate suspected EAP and related pain conditions are presented. Currently, biomarkers have limited utility in the diagnosis of endometriosis, but research in this area continues; development of a reliable noninvasive test for endometriosis may further improve early identification of this condition.

### Rethinking mechanisms, diagnosis and management of endometriosis [^682efa72]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, which causes pelvic pain and infertility. This disease should be viewed as a public health problem with a major effect on the quality of life of women as well as being a substantial economic burden. In light of the considerable progress with diagnostic imaging (for example, transvaginal ultrasound and MRI), exploratory laparoscopy should no longer be used to diagnose endometriotic lesions. Instead, diagnosis of endometriosis should be based on a structured process involving the combination of patient interviews, clinical examination and imaging. Notably, a diagnosis of endometriosis often leads to immediate surgery. Therefore, rethinking the diagnosis and management of endometriosis is warranted. Instead of assessing endometriosis on the day of the diagnosis, gynaecologists should consider the patient's 'endometriosis life'. Medical treatment is the first-line therapeutic option for patients with pelvic pain and no desire for immediate pregnancy. In women with infertility, careful consideration should be made regarding whether to provide assisted reproductive technologies prior to performing endometriosis surgery. Modern endometriosis management should be individualized with a patient-centred, multi-modal and interdisciplinary integrated approach.

### ESUR consensus MRI for endometriosis: indications, reporting, and classifications [^59ebdf36]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To propose an update of ESUR endometriosis guidelines to reflect advances in MRI indications, reporting, and classifications.

Methods

The ESUR Research Committee appointed two chairs (I.T.N. L.M.) to supervise the development of the updated guidelines. Following literature research, a survey was delivered to 20 experts in gynecological imaging from 10 countries. Two rounds of surveys were conducted to obtain a consensus according to a Delphi process method. In this article, the results regarding MR indication, the use of standardized reports, and classifications are presented RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended when transvaginal ultrasonography is inconclusive in diagnosing endometriosis or negative, in a symptomatic patient, before surgery or interventional procedure, or after surgical treatment if symptoms persist. ESUR panelists consider the roles of an MR classification: to improve communication between radiologist and surgeon (100%, 20/20) and between the radiologist and the patient (45%, 9/20), to predict operating time if surgery is planned (70%, 14/20), to predict the length of hospital stay after surgery (40%, 8/20), and to predict postoperative complications (70%, 14/20). ESUR panelists strongly agree that using an MR classification is useful (19/20, 95%), especially the radiological score, deep-pelvic endometriosis index (dPEI). Among the ESUR expert group, 9/20 experts (45%) used or agreed to use drawings in their report to improve communication with patients.

Conclusion

Standardized MR reporting is crucial and should include the use of MR classification. Drawings are considered an option, knowing that communication with the patient and surgeon is of paramount importance.

Key Points

Question ESUR's endometriosis guidelines were last published in 2017; an update is provided to reflect advances in MRI indications, reporting, and classifications. Findings MRI is advised for inconclusive/negative transvaginal ultrasound in symptomatic patients, before surgery, or post-treatment if symptoms persist. A structured report enhances communication with surgeons and patients. Clinical relevance A standardized report based on a compartmental analysis of the location of endometriotic nodules, with optional drawings, is essential for comprehensive mapping and optimal communication with both patient and surgeon.

Abstract

Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition of unknown aetiology that primarily affects women of reproductive age. The accepted first-line imaging modality is pelvic ultrasound. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly performed as an additional investigation in complex cases and for surgical planning. There is currently no international consensus regarding patient preparation, MRI protocols or reporting criteria. Our aim was to develop clinical guidelines for MRI evaluation of pelvic endometriosis based on literature evidence and consensus expert opinion. This work was performed by a group of radiologists from the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR), experts in gynaecological imaging and a gynaecologist expert in methodology. The group discussed indications for MRI, technical requirements, patient preparation, MRI protocols and criteria for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis on MRI. The expert panel proposed a final recommendation for each criterion using Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine (OCEBM) 2011 levels of evidence.

Key Points

- This report provides guidelines for MRI in endometriosis.

- Minimal and optimal MRI acquisition protocols are provided.

- Recommendations are proposed for patient preparation, best MRI sequences and reporting criteria.

### Postmenopausal endometriosis: clinical insights and imaging considerations [^72fb4d25]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a chronic systemic condition characterized by the presence of ectopic endometrial-like tissue outside of the uterus. It occurs most often in reproductive-aged patients and less frequently in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal patients, endometriosis is more common in those undergoing hormone replacement therapy or taking tamoxifen. The risk of malignant transformation of endometriosis is higher in this older population, especially in those undergoing estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy. Many theories on the postmenopausal pathogenesis of endometriosis have been proposed, ranging from reactivation of premenopausal disease to de novo manifestation. Compared with premenopausal disease, postmenopausal endometriosis is typically less active and extensive, with fewer hemorrhagic components. Patients may be symptomatic, with chronic pelvic pain, or may receive the diagnosis after imaging performed for other indications such as an incidental ovarian lesion. Treatment is typically surgical resection or estrogen-blocking medications. Although the diagnosis requires pathologic confirmation, radiologists play an important role in diagnosing both benign endometriosis and malignant transformation. Pelvic US following a dedicated protocol is an accessible screening tool, with high sensitivity for diagnosis of bowel-invasive disease. MRI has better anatomic resolution and allows simultaneous characterization of adnexal and extrapelvic lesions, thereby providing excellent assessment for malignant transformation.

### Magnetic resonance imaging for deep infiltrating endometriosis: current concepts, imaging technique and key findings [^d0b144da]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Endometriosis, particularly deep pelvic infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), is a clinical issue affecting premenopausal women who may experience severe pelvic pain and infertility. These symptoms are mainly associated with the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity, with consequent chronic inflammatory reactions and fibromuscular hyperplasia affecting the pelvic peritoneum and the pelvic wall and organs. The disease affects approximately 10% of women of reproductive age and is diagnosed in approximately 20%–50% of infertile women and nearly 90% of infertile women with chronic pelvic pain. Accurate early diagnosis of DIE is crucial to provide women with early tailored treatments and avoid inappropriate surgery. Nevertheless, although many diagnostic techniques have been used, early diagnosis of DIE remains a major challenge.

Laparoscopic exploration is considered the diagnostic golden standard, because it allows for direct visualization of lesions; however, it is not a risk-free surgery and may underestimate retroperitoneal structures, such as nerves and ureters, with possible false negative procedures. Because a poor correlation has been demonstrated between the symptoms and severity of lesions, some authors suggest a paradigmatic shift to a more clinical diagnostic approach based on the combination of symptoms, imaging findings and response to empiric treatment, even before any surgical confirmation. In this scenario, transvaginal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and in some cases computed tomography (CT) play a fundamental role. MRI, the imaging technique with the highest overall accuracy for assessing the extent of DIE, has high specificity for endometriotic foci, owing to its inherent soft-tissue resolution. Nevertheless, to achieve the expected accuracy, the examination itself and the image interpretation should be tailored to each woman's specific issues. This review provides radiologists with information on how to obtain good quality MRI images, interpret and report them correctly.

### Magnetic resonance imaging for deep infiltrating endometriosis: current concepts, imaging technique and key findings [^0f759b5c]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent chronic disease affecting about 10% of reproductive-age women with symptoms like pelvic pain and infertility. Pathologically, it is defined by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity responsible for a chronic inflammatory process. For decades the diagnosis of endometriosis was based on surgical exploration and biopsy of pelvic lesions. However, laparoscopy is not a risk-free procedure with possible false negative diagnosis due to an underestimate of retroperitoneal structures such as ureters and nerves. For these reasons nowadays, the diagnosis of endometriosis is based on a noninvasive approach where clinical history, response to therapy and imaging play a fundamental role. Trans-vaginal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are suitable for recognizing most of endometriotic lesions; nevertheless, their accuracy is strictly determined by operators' experience and imaging technique. This review paper aims to make radiologists aware of the diagnostic possibilities of pelvic MRI and familial with the MR acquisition protocols and image interpretation for women with endometriosis.

### European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) guidelines: MR imaging of pelvic endometriosis [^1ffade82]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition that is defined as functional ectopic endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus. This disease affects women of reproductive age, with a prevalence of approximately 10%. Patients can be asymptomatic or present with chronic pelvic pain and/or infertility. The combination of laparoscopy and histological verification of endometrial glands and/or stroma is considered to be the gold standard for diagnosis of the disease.

Ultrasonography (US) is the first-line imaging modality for the assessment of pelvic endometriosis but has limitations with respect to field-of-view and operator dependence. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually performed as an additional examination in complex cases or prior to surgery and is highly accurate in the evaluation of endometriosis. However, there is no international consensus on patient preparation, best MRI sequences or reporting criteria.

The aim of this work was to develop guidelines for optimal MRI protocols and image interpretation in endometriosis based on a detailed literature review and consensus expert opinion from the Female Pelvic Imaging working group of the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (FPI-ESUR).

### Role of a symptom-based algorithmic approach to chronic pelvic pain [^c6da52d0]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a disorder that has a significant impact on the patient's quality of life. Laparoscopic diagnosis can be disappointing, and recurrence is common after surgical treatment. A symptom-based algorithmic approach to treatment of CPP is presented that is safe and cost-effective.

Methods

This approach is oriented towards making a potential clinical diagnosis of endometriosis. It relies on a structured evaluation of the patient and administration of medical therapy including GnRH agonists to selected patients. Evaluation begins with a history and physical examination; selected cases receive specific therapy. Non-responders undergo appropriate laboratory and imaging studies. If results remain negative, it is possible to make a clinical diagnosis of endometriosis and begin empiric treatment.

Results

Early results strongly indicate that using this approach allowed clinicians to make highly accurate diagnoses (correct in 85–90% of cases).

Conclusion

Use of this approach will minimize the need for surgery.

### DETECT (detecting endometriosis inTEgrins using… [^6438be40]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Endometriosis is a common gynaecological disease affecting 10% of the female population due to the presence of uterus-like tissue outside of the uterus, often in the pelvis. The disease causes severe lower abdominal pain mostly during the monthly period, during or after sexual intercourse, and when emptying the bowel and bladder. Currently, imaging methods such as ultrasound are ineffective at diagnosing the most common type of endometriosis, pelvic endometriosis. Therefore, we are heavily reliant on invasive surgery to make the diagnosis. This study aims to investigate the presence of binding proteins in endometriotic tissue which will expand our understanding of endometriosis and could be used as a target to develop a non-invasive imaging test in the future. Women with symptoms consistent with endometriosis, who are due to undergo surgery to diagnose endometriosis at the EndoCare Unit in Oxford, will be eligible to participate.

To attempt to visualise the integrins, participants will be asked to attend 2–7 days before their surgery to undergo an imaging scan with a molecular marker that has been found to highlight integrins in other conditions. Once a date for the surgery is confirmed they will be booked to have their imaging scan 2–7 days before in the radiology department in Bath or Oxford. On the day of the scan, they will be asked to complete a questionnaire that will provide us with information on their menstrual history, medical history, hormonal influences, and other factors that may influence the results of the scan. They will have IV maraciclatide administered followed by a SPECT-CT scan. For the imaging, participants will be divided into two cohorts. Cohort 1 describes the initial research participants who assist with identifying the optimum imaging time interval following IV 99mTc-maraciclatide.

Participants will undergo 1–6 imaging scans at 30 minutes, 90 minutes, 3–4 hours, 6 hours, or 18–24 hours post-administration. Depending on findings the scanning time will be refined to provide the optimal timing for visualizing lesions expressing αvβ3. The total protocol dose is 14 mSv for Cohort

1. This is equivalent to nearly 6 years of average natural background radiation in the UK. Once 4 participants with surgically confirmed endometriosis have completed each time point, the study will progress to cohort 2 using the optimum scanning.

### Infertility workup: identifying endometriosis [^b1df156c]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis was classically diagnosed during diagnostic laparoscopies, which used to be routinely performed up until a decade ago or so. This practice fitted with the long-held belief that surgery was the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis. Today, the abandon of routine diagnostic laparoscopies-in favor of assisted reproductive technology-first therapeutic approaches-has created a void for diagnosing endometriosis. Modern-day imaging techniques-ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging-when used with a systematic approach have offered a reliable replacement option for diagnosing endometriosis. In infertility, endometriosis should be identified or excluded on the basis of past history or confirmation or exclusion suspicion on the basis of history and/or physical examination.

### Endometriosis: a multimodal imaging review [^358a2403]. European Journal of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized endometrial-like tissue present outside of the uterus, affecting approximately 10% of reproductive age women. It is associated with abdomino-pelvic pain, infertility and other non - gynecologic symptoms, making it a challenging diagnosis. Several guidelines have been developed by different international societies to diagnose and classify endometriosis, yet areas of controversy and uncertainty remains. Transvaginal ultrasound (TV-US) is the first-line imaging modality used to identify endometriosis due to its accessibility and cost-efficacy. Enhanced sonographic techniques are emerging as a dedicated technique to evaluate deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), depending on the expertise of the sonographer as well as the location of the lesions. MRI is an ideal complementary modality to ultrasonography for pre-operative planning as it allows for a larger field-of-view when required and it has high levels of reproducibility and tolerability. Typically, endometriotic lesions appear hypoechoic on ultrasonography. On MRI, classical features include DIE T2 hypointensity, endometrioma T2 hypointensity and T1 hyperintensity, while superficial peritoneal endometriosis (SPE) is described as a small focus of T1 hyperintensity. Imaging has become a critical tool in the diagnosis, surveillance and surgical planning of endometriosis. This literature review is based mostly on studies from the last two decades and aims to provide a detailed overview of the imaging features of endometriosis as well as the advances and usefulness of different imaging modalities for this condition.

### Optimizing endometriosis diagnosis and mapping: the important role of advanced transvaginal ultrasound [^5413b96f]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is estimated to affect 5%-10% of women of reproductive age, making timely diagnosis essential for initiating treatment, alleviating symptoms, and reducing the risk of disease progression. Unfortunately, the diagnostic delay in this disease is estimated to be approximately 10years. The aim of this study is to present a case series of three patients assessed with both imaging modalities for endometriosis diagnosis and mapping, advanced transvaginal ultrasound (ATVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The findings obtained by performing the ATVUS imaging study protocol with different pelvic compartments according to the International Deep Endometriosis Analysis (IDEA) consensus are described and contrasted with those for MRI, along with their correlation to surgical and histological findings. A single gynecologist with specialized training in ATVUS performed a systematic pelvic evaluation in patients with clinical suspicion of endometriosis. The physician performed the anatomo-sonographic assessments described by the IDEA consensus. A retrospective analysis of the three cases was performed comparing both imaging modalities and surgical and histological findings. It was demonstrated in this case series that endometriosis is detectable in distinct pelvic compartments by ATVUS, with results comparable to MRI, while offering the benefits of lower cost and widespread accessibility. In contrast, individuals, insurance companies, and healthcare systems in some countries might be unable or unwilling to cover MRI costs for endometriosis diagnosis or presurgical mapping. In conclusion, given the high prevalence of endometriosis, mastering ATVUS is essential. Future studies should aim to robustly evaluate the role of ATVUS alongside other imaging modalities, including MRI, to maximize diagnostic accuracy.

### Endometriosis: radiologic-pathologic correlation [^a2fec79e]. Radiographics (2001). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is an important gynecologic disorder primarily affecting women during their reproductive years. Pathologically, it is the result of functional endometrium located outside the uterus. It may vary from microscopic endometriotic implants to large cysts (endometriomas). The physical manifestations are protean, with some patients being asymptomatic and others having disabling pelvic pain, infertility, or adnexal masses. Symptoms do not necessarily correlate with the severity of the disease. Ultrasonographic (US) features are variable and can mimic those of other benign and malignant ovarian lesions. Low-level internal echoes and echogenic wall foci are more specific US features for endometriomas. Magnetic resonance imaging improves diagnostic accuracy, with endometriotic cysts typically appearing with high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and demonstrating "shading" on T2-weighted images. The ovaries are the most common sites affected, but endometriosis can also involve the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, chest, and soft tissues. Small implants and adhesions are not well evaluated radiologically; therefore, laparoscopy remains the standard of reference for diagnosis and staging. Both medical and surgical treatment options are available depending on the patient's specific case.

### Association between endometriosis phenotype and preterm birth in France [^9c2e1a30]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Third, imaging diagnoses of endometriosis raise the question of diagnostic confirmation of endometriosis. It is now well documented that specific imaging criteria are sufficiently accurate for a nonsurgical diagnosis of OMA and DE. However, the endometriosis group included women with a diagnosis based on imaging as well as women who were surgically treated for endometriosis. This heterogeneity could be a bias given the presupposed benefit of removing ectopic lesions for a viable intrauterine pregnancy, which is different from an adverse pregnancy outcome. This point does not affect the interpretation of the results of this study because no difference in the rate of preterm birth was observed between the women with a diagnosis based on imaging and those who underwent a complete removal of their lesions. In addition, women with endometriosis more often have a history of gynecological issues (ie, myomectomy and operative hysteroscopy), which is why we included this parameter in the multivariate analysis.

Fourth, we did not provide 3 phenotype groups with isolated lesions (superficial ovarian or deep lesions) because they are often associated. However, endometriosis is a heterogeneous disease, and SUP is frequently associated with OMA or DE and cannot be seen on imaging. In addition, when associated with painful symptoms, OMA is associated with DE. The extent to which SUP plays a role in obstetric outcomes vs OMA or DE remains unknown.

### ESUR consensus MRI for endometriosis: indications, reporting, and classifications [^80bdf22f]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a second-line technique after transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) for exploring patients with a suspicion of endometriosis. The combination of these two imaging modalities and physical examination increases diagnostic accuracy, especially for deep-pelvic endometriosis (DE) locations. Beyond its excellent sensitivity, the main advantage of MR imaging is the possibility of reviewing images by an expert or during a multidisciplinary session before deciding on surgical management.

As endometriosis is a benign disease that may require very complex surgery with potentially long-term impact on the quality of life of the patient, the standardization of MR reporting is critical. Recently, the European Society of Radiology underlined that optimal communication between the imaging team and patients is an essential component of patient-centered and value-based care. This is particularly important in the context of endometriosis management. The imaging report is a crucial tool for communication.

Since the previous consensus, several authors have proposed a consensual lexicon and developed different reporting classifications to improve communication between the radiologist and the patient or the radiologist and the surgeon. This is why it is time to change imaging guidelines in endometriosis.

### ESUR consensus MRI for endometriosis: protocol, lexicon, and compartment-based analysis [^5ee0248f]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Endometriosis, defined by the presence of endometrium-like tissue outside the uterus, affects 2–10% of the female population, representing at least 190 million women worldwide. In addition, endometriosis is reported in 50% of women of reproductive age with chronic pelvic pain and or with a history of infertility, but this includes predominantly superficial endometriosis, which is often overlooked or not seen on imaging. In contrast, adnexal endometriosis and deep pelvic endometriosis (DE) have a more aggressive behavior in some women with endometriosis.

In 2017, the first European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) consensus proposed some recommendations regarding patient preparation and imaging acquisition to start standardizing practice. However, the MRI technique has improved with high-resolution 3D sequences and AI denoising solutions, necessitating a review of protocol guidelines.

Since the previous consensus, several authors have proposed a consensual lexicon and developed different reporting classifications to improve communication between the radiologist and the patient or the radiologist and the surgeon. This is why it is time to change imaging guidelines in endometriosis.

### Endometriosis and infertility: a committee opinion [^d4ada7f7]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis — diagnosis and staging emphasize that laparoscopy is required for a definitive diagnosis and histologic evaluation is warranted when visual inspection is inconclusive; history and physical findings suggestive of endometriosis include cyclic or chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, a fixed retroverted uterus, an adnexal mass, and uterosacral ligament nodularity, thickening, or tenderness; ultrasound can help establish a presumptive diagnosis of an ovarian endometrioma but cannot reliably image peritoneal implants; the therapeutic benefit of laparoscopy to increase fecundity in mild disease is minimal and, accordingly, laparoscopy of asymptomatic women with infertility simply to rule out or confirm disease is unwarranted; disease heterogeneity ranges from a single 1 mm peritoneal implant to ≥ 10 cm endometriomas.

### Reasons why it is time to change imaging guidelines on endometriosis [^8cde4e54]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In light of the rising number of patients referred for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to suspected endometriosis and the high expectations of these patients, there is a need for new imaging guidelines to optimally protocol and indicate MRI and transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) examinations. This is crucial for accurately addressing the inquiries of gynecologists, encompassing complete mapping and preoperative staging, and facilitating effective communication with patients. In this context, the development of a standardized lexicon, as well as dedicated imaging classifications, is recommended to aid in the comprehensive management of patients. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The radiologist should use a standardized lexicon and provide a score along with details about the specific compartments affected by endometriosis disease. This helps in offering clearer guidance to the surgeon. KEY POINTS:
- An optimal staging is based on the combination of clinical examination, transvaginal US, and MRI.
- MRI is able to detect location that is hidden at the beginning of a laparoscopic surgery and thus the need for dedicated MR classifications to correctly stage the disease.
- Deep pelvic endometriosis index (dPEI) classification is externally validated and highly correlated with operating time, hospital stay, and postoperative complications.

### Systematic review on the DNA methylation role in endometriosis: current evidence and perspectives [^c97fac72]. Clinical Epigenetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Meanwhile, the current diagnosis of endometriosis is performed via medical imaging and sometimes histological confirmation but identifying endometriotic lesions is taking a long period of errancy due to a non-specific symptomatology, with a mean diagnostic delay of 7 years in developed countries. This delay is causing unnecessary discomfort for patients seeking appropriate medical care and has deleterious effects on mental wellness, pain, and fertility. As DNA methylation appears to be an integral component of the pathogenesis of endometriosis, the identification of DNA methylation biomarkers would likely help better understand its causes and aggravating factors as well as potentially facilitate its diagnosis and support the development of new therapeutic approaches.

To examine whether DNA methylation is a hallmark of endometriosis, we systematically reviewed the literature regarding DNA methylation in endometriosis. Study selection was performed by two independent reviewers and corroborated by a third virtual reviewer powered by artificial intelligence (AI). We applied rigorous quality evaluation of all studies, and we categorized them according to the tissues compared: healthy endometrium, eutopic (i.e. cells that have a normal location), and ectopic (i.e. cells in an abnormal location) endometrium in endometriotic patient, blood. We summarized the current evidence with reference to targeted gene and epigenome-wide association studies stratified by the level of evidence from high to very low. By applying cross-referencing methods after identifying the precise genomic regions analyzed in each study, we provide a deep investigation of genes and pathways that may be epigenetically regulated in endometriosis. Even if we cannot distinguish whether DNA methylation modifications are a cause or consequence of the disease, evidence suggests a possible epigenetic contribution in endometriosis etiopathology.

### ESUR consensus MRI for endometriosis: indications, reporting, and classifications [^b939bb70]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Usefulness of standardized MR report

There is increasing evidence supporting the use of structured reporting in radiology. It is well-recognized that standardized reporting enhances communication between radiologists, referring physicians, and patients, while also benefiting research efforts. Structured reporting ensures that key features are less likely to be overlooked by radiologists and surgeons, provides greater clarity in findings, aids in patient counseling and management, and facilitates more accurate and appropriate data collection for scientific purposes. Additionally, structured reports improve the complementary practices between radiologists and gynecologic surgeons, with the potential to enhance surgical decision-making compared to routine reviews.

Detecting endometriosis during laparoscopy can be challenging due to the variable appearance of lesions, the presence of subtle retroperitoneal implants, and the inherent complexities of evaluating pelvic anatomy surgically. Surgeries can also be highly complex and carry significant morbidity, often necessitating multidisciplinary teams, including the assistance of colorectal surgeons and/or urologists. Consequently, a compartmentalized review of pelvic anatomy is seen as a key strength in enhancing diagnostic sensitivity. The significance of a comprehensive compartmental review of pelvic structures by radiologists is highlighted by its critical role in surgical planning. The ESUR expert group strongly agreed with using a structured report (17/20, 85%). Only 11/20 (55%) ESUR panelists admitted to using it in daily practice, but 6/20 answered they will in the future (see ESUR standardized report in the supplementary material).

Statement 3: ESUR panelists strongly agreed that a standardized MR report is recommended (Grade B).

### Molecular imaging in gynecology: beyond cancer [^99f6ca84]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The current standard of care for the diagnosis of endometriosis is exploratory laparoscopy. This approach is invasive, painful, expensive, and prone to sampling and operator biases, factors that have combined to create long diagnostic delays for the condition. Anatomic imaging also plays an important role in the care of patients with the condition. Ultrasonography is frequently used as a prediagnostic tool to visualize lesions before surgical diagnosis and resection, but it can exhibit suboptimal sensitivity and accuracy in the context of smaller lesions. MRI has also been used to determine the size, location, and infiltrative stage of large lesions before surgical resection, especially in cases of deep infiltrating endometriosis. Unfortunately, MRI has proven suboptimal for the detection of small superficial lesions (i.e. < 5 mm beneath the surface of the peritoneum).

In light of the clear limitations of extant methods for the detection of endometriosis, researchers have begun to explore the possibility of using nuclear imaging — and PET in particular — for the visualization of endometriosis. Silveira et al. for example, used a rat model of the disease to determine the uptake of [18 F]fluorocholine in superficial lesions. Although the activity concentration of the tracer in implanted endometriosis tissue was found to be 3-fold higher than that in the muscle and peritoneum, the biodistribution data revealed very high uptake in several healthy tissues, most notably (and problematically) the ovaries. More recently, Amartuvshin et al. probed the value of a 64 Cu-labeled variant of the vascular endothelial growth factor–targeting antibody bevacizumab for the delineation of subcutaneous endometriosis lesions. Unfortunately, in vivo experiments revealed low activity concentrations in the target tissue and high levels of uptake in healthy tissues.

### A review of more than 2000 cases of site-specific pelvic endometriosis rates by MRI: a guide to minimizing under / overdiagnosis non-invasively [^f31115c5]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

For a large dataset based on MR imaging, the prevalence of endometrioma and DIE involvement in various pelvic compartments, as well as their statistical correlation, were assessed. Knowing the likelihood of various sections being involved as well as their co-existence is a key step in accurately diagnosing and treating endometriosis. Pretreatment DIE mapping is essential for determining the type of treatment and ensuring thorough removal, especially if a multi-specialty operation is required. Furthermore, it aids in diagnosis and prevents under- or over-diagnosis.

### ESUR consensus MRI for endometriosis: indications, reporting, and classifications [^fa6ecb16]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The experts did not reach an agreement regarding the use of MRI in follow-up to monitor medical treatment response (50%, 10/20), even though this type of indication is becoming more established in clinical practice.

Statement 1: MRI is recommended when TVUS is inconclusive in diagnosing endometriosis or negative, in a symptomatic patient (Grade A, strong agreement), before surgery or interventional procedure, or after surgical treatment if symptoms persist (strong agreement).

When TVUS is not feasible (virgins, adolescents, and patients who are unable to undergo the transvaginal examination due to pain, vaginismus, or claustrophobia), MRI can be indicated as a first-line technique.

Classification and reporting

Usefulness of MR classifications

Disease staging is crucial for both clinical and research activities related to endometriosis. No single staging system is universally competent or applicable to all aspects of endometriosis care, and different approaches should be viewed as complementary. Multiple surgical and radiological classifications exist; however, a broad international consensus has not yet been reached to indicate which of these systems should be recommended for routine use.

Surgical classifications provide a comprehensive staging of DE and evaluate peritoneal, ovarian, and tubal involvement, as well as the presence of adenomyosis. Prominent among these are the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists (AAGL), the revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine (rASRM), and the #Enzian classification. It is essential to recognize the distinction between the surgeon's operative perspective and the radiologist's imaging perspective in evaluating a given patient. The radiologist visualizes the entire pelvis in cross-section, encompassing all organs and anatomical spaces within a single visual field, in fact, in multiple anatomical orthogonal planes, which is the major advantage. In contrast, the surgeon, through laparoscopy, views the peritoneum and the external surface of underlying organs. Laparoscopic surgical classifications do not provide a comprehensive evaluation of pelvic endometriosis. The surgeon cannot initially visualize the internal structures of organs or retroperitoneal spaces, nor can they directly assess the depth of DE within organs or discern the boundaries between organs in cases of obliterated cul-de-sac or the precise location of DE lesions. Radiologists, therefore, must invest time and effort into understanding evolving disease concepts and treatment options and maintain effective communication with referring colleagues to ensure their knowledge remains current across medical fields beyond radiology. By integrating imaging expertise with an understanding of disease management, radiologists contribute significantly to patient care.

### MRI of endometriosis in correlation with the # enzian classification: applicability and structured report [^4b30d32f]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis represents one of the most common causes of life-impacting chronic pelvic pain and female infertility. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an increasing role in the diagnosis and mapping of endometriosis, while diagnostic laparoscopy currently tends to be reserved for the patients with negative imaging results. The #Enzian, published in 2021, proposes a new comprehensive classification system of endometriosis, combining a complete staging of deep infiltrative endometriosis with the evaluation of peritoneal/ovarian/tubal localizations and the presence of adenomyosis. This article addresses in detail the applicability of the #Enzian classification, primarily based on surgical findings, to the MRI evaluation of the endometriosis. Overall, there is a significant matching between MRI features and the #Enzian classification criteria, two different perspectives of endometriosis mapping, with different goals and levels of detail. The main discrepancy lies in the evaluation of tubo-ovarian condition, which is not fully assessable by MRI. Furthermore, as endometriosis is a complex disease, usually multifocal, that can present with a myriad of imaging findings, MRI reporting should be clear and well organized. The authors group, both radiologists and gynecologists, propose a structured MRI report of endometriosis in correlation with the #Enzian classification, merging the detailed anatomical and pre-operative information provided by the MRI with the benefits of a comprehensive classification system of endometriosis in the clinical practice and research field.

Critical relevance statement This article addresses in detail the applicability of the #Enzian classification, primarily based on surgical findings, to the MRI evaluation of the endometriosis and proposes a #Enzian-based structured MRI report.

### Multimodality imaging findings in secondary dysmenorrhea [^c9c19295]. Clinical Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

Dysmenorrhea, characterised by painful menstruation, is a prevalent condition affecting up to 90% of menstruating women, with a significant impact on quality of life and daily functioning. Primary dysmenorrhea occurs without identifiable pelvic pathology as a result of elevated prostaglandins and leukotrienes resulting in uterine contractility and crampy pelvic pain. Secondary dysmenorrhea, on the other hand, arises from identifiable pelvic pathology most commonly endometriosis. Other aetiologies include uterine leiomyomas, adenomyosis, congenital Mullerian duct abnormalities and infection. Accurate diagnosis of pathology in secondary dysmenorrhea is vital for effective management, in order to address patient symptoms and improving outcomes.

Materials and Methods

This paper explores the multimodality imaging features associated with secondary dysmenorrhea, emphasising the importance of accurate diagnosis in guiding effective treatment strategies.

Results

Pelvic ultrasound, transabdominal and transvaginal, is typically the first-line imaging investigation due to its accessibility and effectiveness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers improved soft tissue contrast and assessment of extrauterine anatomy, vital for resolving complex clinical challenges. Computed tomography has a more limited role but is extremely useful in the setting of suspected pelvic inflammatory disease.

Conclusion

We aim to explore the multimodality imaging findings in secondary dysmenorrhea, to aid accurate diagnosis, allowing for timely intervention and improving health outcomes and quality of life for women.

### ESUR consensus MRI for endometriosis: indications, reporting, and classifications [^268bff03]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Usefulness of drawings

Radiology is deeply integrated into the patient care pathway and plays a crucial role in shaping the patient experience. All experts have highlighted the importance and value of clear communication with patients. The traditional models of care, where imaging findings were communicated solely between the radiologist and the referring physician, and management decisions were made without patient input, are no longer viable. The concept of the patient as a passive participant in the decision-making process is increasingly unacceptable. Patient-centered care demands that patients be involved in all major decisions, but this involvement is only meaningful if patients are fully informed about all relevant information, including radiology findings.

"Patient-centered care" is a key dimension of quality care. Patients with confirmed endometriosis often express dissatisfaction with their medical support, and a lack of information is the most significant indicator of dissatisfaction with their overall patient experience. Communication, information, and education have been previously identified as critical areas for improvement in endometriosis clinics, as they are highly valued by patients and are frequently perceived negatively. Beyond procedural accuracy, patients place great importance on receiving information and having clear communication with their radiologist, including explanations of results and personal consultations. However, effective communication with patients can be challenging in busy radiology departments, where the focus is often on efficient and accurate diagnosis. Despite this, optimized communication between patients and radiologists is a vital component of delivering patient-centered and value-based care. Therefore, the availability of the radiologist, as well as the tools they use to explain the diagnosis, is of paramount importance and is integral to the concept of value-based radiology.

Furthermore, studies, such as those by Gutzeit et al, report that the opportunity for patients to discuss MRI findings before leaving the department significantly increases their confidence in the radiology service. Good communication with patients, as well as among the healthcare team, has the potential to improve care coordination, enhance safety and outcomes, increase patient satisfaction, and reduce healthcare costs.

In this setting, the role of drawings to illustrate disease mapping is crucial. These drawings significantly aid clinical counseling and, more importantly, surgical planning. They are invaluable for guiding surgeons during complex procedures, making it essential to highlight their importance. This was the main reason for including diagrams in reports.

Among the ESUR expert group, 9/20 experts (45%) use or agreed to use drawings in their report to improve communication with patients (user = 3/20, not yes but will 6/20) (Fig. 4).

### Noninvasive diagnostic imaging for endometriosis part 1: a systematic review of recent developments in ultrasound, combination imaging, and artificial intelligence [^6f345b33]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis affects 1 in 9 women and those assigned female at birth. However, it takes 6.4 years to diagnose using the conventional standard of laparoscopy. Noninvasive imaging enables a timelier diagnosis, reducing diagnostic delay as well as the risk and expense of surgery. This review updates the exponentially increasing literature exploring the diagnostic value of endometriosis specialist transvaginal ultrasound (eTVUS), combinations of eTVUS and specialist magnetic resonance imaging, and artificial intelligence. Concentrating on literature that emerged after the publication of the IDEA consensus in 2016, we identified 6192 publications and reviewed 49 studies focused on diagnosing endometriosis using emerging imaging techniques. The diagnostic performance of eTVUS continues to improve but there are still limitations. eTVUS reliably detects ovarian endometriomas, shows high specificity for deep endometriosis and should be considered diagnostic. However, a negative scan cannot preclude endometriosis as eTVUS shows moderate sensitivity scores for deep endometriosis, with the sonographic evaluation of superficial endometriosis still in its infancy. The fast-growing area of artificial intelligence in endometriosis detection is still evolving, but shows great promise, particularly in the area of combined multimodal techniques. We finalize our commentary by exploring the implications of practice change for surgeons, sonographers, radiologists, and fertility specialists. Direct benefits for endometriosis patients include reduced diagnostic delay, better access to targeted therapeutics, higher quality operative procedures, and improved fertility treatment plans.

### Non-invasive imaging techniques for diagnosis of pelvic deep endometriosis and endometriosis classification systems: an international consensus statement [^91ac0093]. European Journal of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) and International Deep Endometriosis Analysis (IDEA) group, the European Endometriosis League (EEL), the European Society for Gynaecological Endoscopy (ESGE), the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE), the International Society for Gynecologic Endoscopy (ISGE), the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists (AAGL) and the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) elected an international, multidisciplinary panel of gynecological surgeons, sonographers and radiologists, including a steering committee, which searched the literature for relevant articles in order to review the literature and provide evidence-based and clinically relevant statements on the use of imaging techniques for non-invasive diagnosis and classification of pelvic deep endometriosis. Preliminary statements were drafted based on review of the relevant literature. Following two rounds of revisions and voting orchestrated by chairs of the participating societies, consensus statements were finalized. A final version of the document was then resubmitted to the society chairs for approval. Twenty statements were drafted, of which 14 reached strong and three moderate agreement after the first voting round. The remaining three statements were discussed by all members of the steering committee and society chairs and rephrased, followed by an additional round of voting. At the conclusion of the process, 14 statements had strong and five statements moderate agreement, with one statement left in equipoise. This consensus work aims to guide clinicians involved in treating women with suspected endometriosis during patient assessment, counseling and planning of surgical treatment strategies.

### A clinician's guide to the treatment of endometriosis with elagolix [^147c930b]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Patient Selection

Diagnosis

Historically, a definitive diagnosis of endometriosis required laparoscopic lesion visualization and excision with histologic confirmation of endometrial gland, endometrial stroma, and/or hemosiderin-laden macrophage presence. However, even in the absence of a definitive diagnosis, many professional society treatment recommendations permit the use of empiric therapy when there is a strong suspicion or clinical evidence of endometriosis. For example, guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) give a Level B recommendation to empiric therapy with a 3-month course of a GnRH agonist in women with chronic pelvic pain who have undergone an appropriate pretreatment evaluation and in whom oral contraceptives and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have failed, noting the patient should be informed that treatment response does not confirm an endometriosis diagnosis.

The criteria for suspecting endometriosis differ among guidelines, but generally include the presence of pelvic pain symptoms (progressively worsening dysmenorrhea [particularly when severe and unresponsive to NSAIDs and/or hormonal-based therapies], NMPP, and deep dyspareunia), which may be augmented by physical findings (e.g. pelvic tenderness and nodularity on palpation of the uterosacral ligaments and rectovaginal septum), imaging results, and/or cyclical nongynecologic symptoms (dyschezia, dysuria, hematuria and rectal bleeding, diarrhea/irritable bowel syndrome, and shoulder pain). When symptoms are cyclic in nature and progressive over time, endometriosis is by far the most likely clinical diagnosis.

It is increasingly recognized that identification of endometriosis can be achieved with reasonable certainty using nonsurgical methodologies (i.e. a clinical diagnosis), which include evaluation of pelvic pain symptoms, patient history, physical examination findings, and appropriately performed imaging studies. Although there has yet to be identified a replacement test or tests for diagnostic surgery, clinicians with expertise in endometriosis diagnosis and management have suggested that symptoms, patient history, and clinical assessments taken in totality provide a basis for clinical diagnosis.

The benefits of undertaking a clinical diagnosis approach are that it does not require surgery and the attendant risks thereof, utilizes assessment tools that are readily available to most clinicians, and may reduce the delay frequently observed in endometriosis diagnosis. In clinical practice, presumptive diagnosis of endometriosis is often made without laparoscopy or other surgical procedure, and can facilitate early and effective management of patients' symptoms.

### Diagnosis of deep endometriosis: clinical examination, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and other techniques [^a5284180]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of the present review was to evaluate the contribution of clinical examination and imaging techniques, mainly transvaginal sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose deep infiltrating (DE) locations using prisma statement recommendations. Clinical examination has a relative low sensitivity and specificity to diagnose DE. Independently of DE locations, for all transvaginal sonography techniques a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 94% are observed approaching criteria for a triage test. Whatever the protocol and MRI devices, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for pelvic endometriosis diagnosis were 94% and 77%, respectively. For rectosigmoid endometriosis, pooled sensitivity and specificity of MRI were 92% and 96%, respectively fulfilling criteria of replacement test. In conclusion, advances in imaging techniques offer high sensitivity and specificity to diagnose DE with at least triage value and for rectosigmoid endometriosis replacement value imposing a revision of the concept of laparoscopy as the gold standard.

### Noninvasive diagnostic imaging for endometriosis part 2: a systematic review of recent developments in magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medicine and computed tomography [^b4d79c5e]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis affects 1 in 9 women, taking 6.4 years to diagnose using conventional laparoscopy. Non-invasive imaging enables timelier diagnosis, reducing diagnostic delay, risk and expense of surgery. This review updates literature exploring the diagnostic value of specialist endometriosis magnetic resonance imaging (eMRI), nuclear medicine (NM) and computed tomography (CT). Searching after the 2016 IDEA consensus, 6192 publications were identified, with 27 studies focused on imaging for endometriosis. eMRI was the subject of 14 papers, NM and CT, 11, and artificial intelligence (AI) utilizing eMRI, 2. eMRI papers describe diagnostic accuracy for endometriosis, methodologies, and innovations. Advantages of eMRI include its: ability to diagnose endometriosis in those unable to tolerate transvaginal endometriosis ultrasound (eTVUS); a panoramic pelvic view, easy translation to surgical fields; identification of hyperintense iron in endometriotic lesions; and ability to identify super-pelvic lesions. Sequence standardization means eMRI is less operator-dependent than eTVUS, but higher costs limit its role to a secondary diagnostic modality. eMRI for deep and ovarian endometriosis has sensitivities of 91–93.5% and specificities of 86–87.5% making it reliable for surgical mapping and diagnosis. Superficial lesions too small for detection in larger capture sequences, means a negative eMRI doesn't exclude endometriosis. Combined with thin sequence capture and improved reader expertise, eMRI is poised for rapid adoption into clinical practice. NM labeling is diagnostically limited in absence of suitable unique marker for endometrial-like tissue. CT studies expose the reproductively aged to radiation. AI diagnostic tools, combining independent eMRI and eTVUS endometriosis markers, may result in powerful capability. Broader eMRI use, will optimize standards and protocols. Reporting systems correlating to surgical anatomy will facilitate interdisciplinary preoperative dialogues. eMRI endometriosis diagnosis should reduce repeat surgeries with mental and physical health benefits for patients. There is potential for early eMRI diagnoses to prevent chronic pain syndromes and protect fertility outcomes.

### MRI of endometriosis in correlation with the # enzian classification: applicability and structured report [^5e537c94]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Endometriosis, a gynecological disorder characterized by growth of endometrium-like tissue outside the uterine cavity, affecting around 10% of women of reproductive-age, is one of the most common causes of life-impacting chronic pelvic pain and female infertility. Deep infiltrative endometriosis (DIE) is defined as deeper than 5 mm infiltration of tissue including the uterosacral ligaments, bowel or bladder.

Until recently, laparoscopic identification of endometriotic lesions with histological confirmation was recognized as the diagnostic gold standard, while ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were often used for pre-operative disease staging. Due to availability and advances in the quality of imaging modalities, improved medical options, limited access to highly qualified surgeons as well as financial implications, diagnostic laparoscopy is currently recommended by the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) only in patients with negative imaging results and/or when empirical treatment was inappropriate or unsuccessful.

In advanced centers, the sensitivity and specificity of both US and MRI (engaged by experienced operators) can exceed 80–90% for DIE. Apart from the need to use a standardized imaging technique, we believe that the use of a clinically relevant, systematic and standardized approach for reporting imaging results is beneficial for radiologists, clinicians, researchers and patients. It may facilitate unambiguous communication between healthcare professionals, aid in patient counseling and management, and enable more appropriate and accurate data collection for scientific purposes. The International Deep Endometriosis Analysis (IDEA) group published a consensus opinion in 2016, aiming to standardize the nomenclature and technique of US endometriosis evaluation. In 2017, the European Society for Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) provided guidelines on patient preparation, MRI protocol and reporting criteria for the assessment of pelvic endometriosis.

Over the last five decades, numerous classifications of radiological and laparoscopic findings in women with endometriosis emerged; however, broad international consensus has not yet been reached to indicate which of these systems should be recommended for routine use. The ideal classification system for endometriosis should describe the sites and extent of the disease, be related to surgical complexity and to disease-associated symptoms, including subfertility. Particularly important, it should be possible to use the same classification system both by imaging specialists and by surgeons.

### Endometriosis: clinical features, MR imaging findings and pathologic correlation [^5acd7545]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

We illustrate the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of endometriosis.

Background

Endometriosis is a chronic gynaecological condition affecting women of reproductive age and may cause pelvic pain and infertility. It is characterized by the growth of functional ectopic endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus and includes three different manifestations: ovarian endometriomas, peritoneal implants, deep pelvic endometriosis. The primary locations are in the pelvis; extrapelvic endometriosis may rarely occur. Diagnosis requires a combination of clinical history, invasive and non-invasive techniques. The definitive diagnosis is based on laparoscopy with histological confirmation. Diagnostic imaging is necessary for treatment planning. MRI is as a second-line technique after ultrasound. The MRI appearance of endometriotic lesions is variable and depends on the quantity and age of haemorrhage, the amount of endometrial cells, stroma, smooth muscle proliferation and fibrosis. The purpose of surgery is to achieve complete resection of all endometriotic lesions in the same operation.

Conclusion

Owing to the possibility to perform a complete assessment of all pelvic compartments at one time, MRI represents the best imaging technique for preoperative staging of endometriosis, in order to choose the more appropriate surgical approach and to plan a multidisciplinary team work.

Teaching Points

- Endometriosis includes ovarian endometriomas, peritoneal implants and deep pelvic endometriosis.
- MRI is a second-line imaging technique after US.
- Deep pelvic endometriosis is associated with chronic pelvic pain and infertility.
- Endometriosis is characterized by considerable diagnostic delay.
- MRI is the best imaging technique for preoperative staging of endometriosis.

### A review of more than 2000 cases of site-specific pelvic endometriosis rates by MRI: a guide to minimizing under / overdiagnosis non-invasively [^47333557]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Endometriosis is a condition in which endometrial cells develop outside the uterine cavity, causing pelvic pain. The most common sites of involvement are ovaries, tubes, and pelvic peritoneum. It is mainly a young women's disease (mean age 25–29 years), but it can also be seen in adolescents as well as older women but rarely in the post-menopausal state.

Endometriosis infiltrates the pelvic peritoneum in three ways: superficial or non-invasive (less than 5 mm depth), ovarian or cystic (endometriomas), and deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) which is specified by more than 5 mm of invasion. The invasion can lead to fibrosis, adhesion, and ultimately the obliteration of the relevant anatomic part.

Laparoscopy has long been accepted as the main modality to diagnose endometriosis, although it suffers from associated risks, limitations, and costs. One of the serious drawbacks of laparoscopy is the risk of missing cul-de-sac DIE which is unfortunately among the most prevalent involvement sites. MRI, on the other hand, can quickly diagnose and detect DIE in a variety of locations. Furthermore, normal anatomy which is usually distorted in DIE can be better distinguished due to the multi-planar capability of this modality. MRI is extremely efficient in evaluating ovarian endometrioma and deep infiltrating endometriosis; in contrast, the superficial types and loci which are difficult to be evaluated by MRI are usually non-symptomatic ones.

MRI can be used in diagnosis (presence of disease) and evaluating the extension of disease (normal versus abnormal anatomy) as well as its detailed mapping. Considering its multi-focal capabilities, MRI can simultaneously evaluate different regions of the pelvic cavity for endometriosis, a multi-organ disease. As a result, it may be the ideal imaging modality for determining the operation roadmap, particularly in complicated cases involving many organs and requiring a multi-specialty procedure. In the case of imprecise imaging and mapping, the right treatment and surgery could not be done.

Several research have demonstrated the efficacy of MRI in evaluating patients suspected of endometriosis, although detailed statistics are either absent or the datasets for epidemiological studies are small (less than 400 cases). A collection of several studies has been reviewed in a comprehensive study to evaluate the accuracy of MRI in combined 1819 cases. A statistical survey is especially important to identify rare and isolated regions of involvement that can result in a debilitating unknown source of pain for women which can be under-diagnosed.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^d8585717]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 760 — Initial management of suspected primary dysmenorrhea advises that when the patient's history suggests primary dysmenorrhea, empiric treatment should be initiated, and most adolescents who present with dysmenorrhea have primary dysmenorrhea and will respond well to empiric treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or hormonal suppression, or both. If a patient does not experience clinical improvement for her dysmenorrhea within 3–6 months of therapy initiation, the obstetrician–gynecologist should investigate for possible secondary causes and for treatment adherence, and during evaluation for secondary dysmenorrhea pelvic imaging with ultrasonography, regardless of findings on pelvic examination, also should be considered.

### A new validated screening method for endometriosis diagnosis based on patient questionnaires [^f3c2f0cd]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Endometriosis, defined as the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterine cavity, is responsible for pain and infertility, and it hence has a major impact on quality of life. Endometriosis is a heterogeneous, chronic disease with a systemic impact, with three clinical phenotypes: superficial peritoneal endometriosis (SPE), ovarian endometrioma (OMA), and deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE).

Throughout the world, and irrespective of the health care system, the delay between the onset of symptoms and endometriosis diagnosis is between 6 and 10 years. This delay has major consequences not only for the patient (infertility, decrease of the ovarian reserve, major complications [intestinal occlusion, loss of a kidney, etc.], sexuality, relationship with their partner, fatigue, depression, central sensitization with consequences at the brain and/or peripheral levels, degradation of the patient-practitioner relationship, etc.) but also for society as a whole (loss of work productivity and a substantial economic burden). Initially considered mainly in terms of its impact on the afflicted individuals, endometriosis is increasingly recognized as a major public healthcare and societal problem, with a prevalence of approximately 10% of the female population.

These reasons warrant revisiting endometriosis diagnostic modalities. The "revolution" in the way endometriosis is diagnosed was made possible by the substantial improvements in gynecological imaging in recent years. Indeed, transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used nowadays to diagnose endometriosis, to establish its phenotype (OMA and DIE), to determine the exact localizations of the lesions, as well as to assess the association with adenomyosiswith excellent predictive performance. This is the reason why several gynecological scientific societies are in agreement that patients who are experiencing pain from endometriosis and who do not have an immediate desire for pregnancy can be prescribed hormonal therapy without histological proof of endometriosis.,

However, referring all patients suspected of having endometriosis to specialized radiologists is not feasible. An initial screening to select the patients at higher risk of the disease is needed. A patient questionnaire is the first step in the diagnostic process. When properly conducted, it is sufficient to detect patients at high risk of endometriosis who should be referred to a specialized radiologist who is aware of the specific imaging modalities for the disease.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to devise and validate a score based solely on a patient questionnaire to select a sample of patients with a high prevalence of endometriosis using cut-off points with high specificity and sensitivity.

### Thoracic endometriosis syndrome: CT and MRI features [^a6a1196e]. Clinical Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Thoracic endometriosis is considered to be rare, but is the most frequent form of extra-abdominopelvic endometriosis. Thoracic endometriosis syndrome affects women of reproductive age. Diagnosis is mainly based on clinical findings, which can include catamenial pneumothorax and haemothorax, non-catamenial endometriosis-related pneumothorax, catamenial haemoptysis, lung nodules, and isolated catamenial chest pain. Symptoms are typically cyclical and recurrent, with a right-sided predominance. Computed tomography (CT) is the first-line imaging method, but is poorly specific; therefore, its main role is to rule out other pulmonary diseases. However, in women with a typical clinical history, some key CT findings may help to confirm this often under-diagnosed syndrome. MRI can also assist with the diagnosis, by showing signal changes typical of haemorrhage within diaphragmatic or pleural lesions.

### Pelvic nerve endometriosis: MRI features and key findings for surgical decision [^97f95b0e]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Pelvic nerve involvement in endometriosis is a condition often underestimated by practitioners and underreported by radiologists. Early diagnosis is essential to prevent irreversible nerve damage. MRI is the optimal imaging modality to accurately assess the distribution and the extent of pelvic nerve involvement in endometriosis. Recognizing the key features of MRI is essential for radiologists to provide structured reports to assist in selecting the best therapeutic approach and patient counseling.

### Impact of diagnostic laparoscopy on the management of chronic pelvic pain [^17f81aa0]. Surgical Endoscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnostic laparoscopy is a useful tool, especially when there is no definite anatomical abnormality visible on imaging modalities. We assess the role and clinical impact of diagnostic laparoscopy in the management of women with chronic pelvic pain.

Methods

Clinical data of 3,068 cases of diagnostic laparoscopy performed for chronic pelvic pain from June 1994 to August 2005 were analyzed. We compared the diagnoses after diagnostic laparoscopy and those after pelvic examination and imaging modalities such as ultrasound or computed tomography (CT), and we then checked the final pathologic diagnoses after operation.

Results

Pelvic endometriosis was the most common (60.2%) laparoscopic finding in patients with chronic pelvic pain in this study, followed by normal pelvic findings (21.2%) and pelvic congestion (13.0%). Diagnostic laparoscopy had an influence on correcting previous plans based on imaging modalities in 42.7% of patients such as discarding unnecessary procedures or introducing new diagnostic or therapeutic plans. There were 3 cases of major complications requiring immediate correction.

Conclusions

Diagnostic laparoscopy is a useful diagnostic tool for of women with chronic pelvic pain and can be used as a guideline for individualized treatment.

### Endometriosis: clinical features, MR imaging findings and pathologic correlation [^c917c9a3]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Endometriosis is a chronic multifocal gynecologic disease that affects women of reproductive age and may cause pelvic pain and infertility. The aetiology of endometriosis is unknown; the pathogenesis is complex, multifactorial and still debated. The disease is characterized by the growth of functional ectopic endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus. Its prevalence is of approximately 10% in women of reproductive age, 20–50% in women with infertility and nearly 90% in women with chronic pelvic pain. It is thought that the disease affects about 176 million women of reproductive age worldwide, with a peak of incidence between 24 and 29 years.

The disease includes three different manifestations, namely ovarian endometriomas, superficial peritoneal implants, and deep pelvic endometriosis. The latter is defined as endometriotic lesions penetrating into the retroperitoneal space or the wall of the pelvic organs to a depth of at least 5 mm; it has an estimated prevalence of 1% among women of reproductive age and affects up to 20% of women with endometriosis.

Although the definitive diagnosis is based on laparoscopy or surgery with histological verification of endometrial glands and/or stroma, imaging is necessary for treatment planning.

Among imaging modalities, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often used as a problem-solving additional examination in complex cases and should be considered as a second-line technique after ultrasound (US). Currently, MRI is considered the best imaging technique for mapping endometriosis, since it provides a more reliable map of deep infiltrating endometriosis than physical examination and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS).

In this article we review clinical manifestations and histological features of endometriosis. We describe MR imaging appearances of the different manifestations of pelvic endometriosis and some extrapelvic locations, using examples, many of which pathologically proven, from our institution. Our MR protocol is also included.

### MRI technique for the preoperative evaluation of deep infiltrating endometriosis: current status and protocol recommendation [^0269d302]. Clinical Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a common cause of chronic pelvic pain and infertility. It is defined as the occurrence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity and can manifest as a peritoneal, ovarian or infiltrating form, the latter being referred to as deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). Surgery is essential in the treatment of DIE and depending on the severity of the disease, surgery can be difficult and extensive. Beside clinical examination and ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has proven its value to provide useful information for planning surgery in patients with suspected DIE. To optimise the quality of MRI examinations, radiologists have to be familiar with the capabilities and also the limitations of this technique with respect to the assessment of DIE. MRI yields morphological information by using mainly T1- and T2-weighted sequences, but can also provide functional information by means of intravenous gadolinium, diffusion-weighted imaging or cine-MRI. In this article, these techniques and also adequate measures of patient preparation, which are indispensable for successful MRI imaging for the preoperative evaluation of DIE, are reviewed and a comprehensive protocol recommendation is provided.

### Magnetic resonance imaging for deep infiltrating endometriosis: current concepts, imaging technique and key findings [^62df08b5]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of deep endometriosis: current concepts

Endometriosis is a complex and heterogeneous disease that may manifest with three clinical patterns with increasing severity. Superficial peritoneal lesions are characterized by superficial implants of the pelvic peritoneum; ovarian endometriomas (OMA) are hemorrhagic cysts arising from ectopic endometrial tissue growing within the ovaries and less frequently outside the ovaries; and DIE leads to the most severe clinical pattern and is characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue penetrating deeper than 5 mm under the peritoneal surface, thus leading to local inflammation and consequently to fibrosis and muscular hyperplasia. DIE is usually found as a multifocal disease simultaneously involving multiple pelvic sites such as the Douglas pouch, the utero-sacral ligaments (USL), pelvic nerves, the rectum, the bladder, and the ureters (Table 1). The pathophysiology of such lesions is widely unknown; the type of lesion may vary over the life course, with no evidence supporting an ordered progression of endometriotic lesions. Similarly, the heterogeneity of symptoms is high. Women with endometriosis may experience dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dysuria, constipation, chronic pelvic pain and infertility; however, a clear characterization of the pain types and topologies of implants is lacking. Consequently, some women with minimal disease may report severe pelvic pain and infertility, whereas others with diffuse pelvic lesions can be almost asymptomatic. The heterogeneity of the disease and the uncertainties about its pathogenesis make its diagnosis challenging. For decades, laparoscopic visualization with histologic verification of lesions was considered the golden standard for diagnosis. However, laparoscopy, even if diagnostic, is not a risk-free surgery. Furthermore, deep infiltrating endometriosis may not be clearly seen in some cases during diagnosis laparoscopy. In fact, the diagnosis of adenomyosis and deep endometriosis involving retroperitoneal structures, particularly ureters and nerve roots, is extremely challenging, particularly when performed by non-experienced gynecologists. False negative procedures may result, thus significantly delaying the start of appropriate management and potentially leading to major complications. Symptoms and clinical findings of endometriosis can result in clinical diagnoses that may be strongly supported by imaging techniques even without histological confirmation. Transvaginal ultrasound, because of its non-invasiveness, dynamicity, ease of use, availability, cost-effectiveness and reproducibility, is currently considered by many endometriosis experts as the best first-line method for assessment of DIE. A systematic sonographic approach as defined by International Deep Endometriosis Analysis (IDEA) consensus was shown to improve detection rates of pelvic lesions. MRI is also considered a highly accurate imaging modality in the evaluation of DIE, particularly when involvement of the rectum, ureters and nerve roots is suspected; these areas are highly important for both the patient and the surgeon and may be poorly visualized even with laparoscopy. MRI is also increasingly used to assess the anatomic response to medical or surgical treatment and to differentiate endometriosis from adenomyosis; the latter is a specific and heterogeneous disease contributing, independently of endometriosis to symptoms, defined as the invasion of endometrial tissue into the myometrium occurring in different forms (diffuse, focal, cystic or superficial). Adenomyosis may exist on its own but in about 30% of cases it is associated with DIE. The shift toward clinical and imaging-based diagnosis shortens the time between the first consultation and the final diagnosis, but the use of non-invasive methods requires a rigorous approach to ensure meaningful and consistent results.

IV. Next-generation uterine imaging

Uterine imaging has been employed to allow for noninvasive methods for diagnosing women's health symptoms. Imaging may be used to noninvasively assess conditions of pregnancy and aspects of uterine health and pelvic health, including endometriosis.

The indication for pelvic imaging varies by patient age and clinical presentation. Common indications in premenopausal patients include evaluation for focal endometrial or myometrial lesions (eg, uterine leiomyoma [fibroids]) in patients with symptoms of AUB and pelvic pain. In postmenopausal patients, endometrial imaging is often performed to evaluate the endometrium in patients with postmenopausal bleeding.

Currently, diagnosis relies primarily on anatomic imaging using both ultrasound and MRI that allows for direct visualization of the endometrium, which is complementary to the previously described techniques, similarly noninvasive, but allowing for direct visualization of the endometrium in situ, rather than sloughed endometrial tissue. Ultrasound and MRI may evaluate for the presence of endometrial thickening and the presence of focal endometrial lesions or polyps. In the evaluation of suspected endometriosis, transvaginal ultrasound may be used to assess for deeply infiltrating endometrial implants.MRI is useful to map endometrial implants throughout the pelvis, including extrauterine locations, and confers advantages in terms of the larger field of view, multiplanar capabilities, and excellent contrast resolution. A systematic review and meta-analysis (based on the results of 6 studies) compared the accuracy of transvaginal ultrasound with MRI for diagnosing deep infiltrating endometriosis. The detection of deep infiltrating endometriosis by both MRI and transvaginal ultrasound methods indicated similar sensitivities–between 0.59 and 0.85 depending on the site, with greater sensitivity for detection in the rectosigmoid segment over rectovaginal, uterosacral, and rectovaginal septum locations. The specificities of MRI and transvaginal ultrasound were similar and, similar to sensitivities, showed a wide range depending on the location. It is expected that imaging methods will continue to improve and are likely to be used in the diagnostic workup for women experiencing symptoms of endometriosis.

### Time to move beyond surgical classification systems for endometriosis [^33ee3827]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a common condition associated with chronic pelvic pain and infertility. Its pathogenesis is poorly understood, diagnosis relies on laparoscopy, and staging is based on extent of disease. Unfortunately, the current staging systems do not correlate well with pain severity and impact, nor do they predict prognosis, i.e., treatment success and recurrence of disease. In this article, we discuss the strengths and limitations of current staging systems and propose modifications that will enable better classification systems to be developed in the future.

### Combination of the non-invasive tests for the diagnosis of endometriosis [^31257351]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

About 10% of women of reproductive age suffer from endometriosis, a costly chronic disease causing pelvic pain and subfertility. Laparoscopy is the gold standard diagnostic test for endometriosis, but is expensive and carries surgical risks. Currently, there are no non-invasive tests available in clinical practice to accurately diagnose endometriosis. This review assessed the diagnostic accuracy of combinations of different non-invasive testing modalities for endometriosis and provided a summary of all the reviews in the non-invasive tests for endometriosis series.

Objectives

To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of any combination of non-invasive tests for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis (peritoneal and/or ovarian or deep infiltrating) compared to surgical diagnosis as a reference standard. The combined tests were evaluated as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery and triage tests to assist decision-making to undertake diagnostic surgery for endometriosis.

Search Methods

We did not restrict the searches to particular study designs, language or publication dates. We searched CENTRAL to July 2015, MEDLINE and EMBASE to May 2015, as well as the following databases to April 2015: CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, LILACS, OAIster, TRIP, ClinicalTrials.gov, DARE and PubMed.

Selection Criteria

We considered published, peer-reviewed, randomised controlled or cross-sectional studies of any size, including prospectively collected samples from any population of women of reproductive age suspected of having one or more of the following target conditions: ovarian, peritoneal or deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). We included studies comparing the diagnostic test accuracy of a combination of several testing modalities with the findings of surgical visualisation of endometriotic lesions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently collected and performed a quality assessment of the data from each study by using the QUADAS-2 tool. For each test, the data were classified as positive or negative for the surgical detection of endometriosis and sensitivity and specificity estimates were calculated. The bivariate model was planned to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity whenever sufficient data were available. The predetermined criteria for a clinically useful test to replace diagnostic surgery were a sensitivity of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.79 to detect endometriosis. We set the criteria for triage tests at a sensitivity of 0.95 and above and a specificity of 0.50 and above, which 'rules out' the diagnosis with high accuracy if there is a negative test result (SnOUT test), or a sensitivity of 0.50 and above and a specificity of 0.95 and above, which 'rules in' the diagnosis with high accuracy if there is a positive result (SpIN test).

Main Results

Eleven eligible studies included 1339 participants. All the studies were of poor methodological quality. Seven studies evaluated pelvic endometriosis, one study considered DIE and/or ovarian endometrioma, two studies differentiated endometrioma from other ovarian cysts and one study addressed mapping DIE at specific anatomical sites. Fifteen different diagnostic combinations were assessed, including blood, urinary or endometrial biomarkers, transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and clinical history or examination. We did not pool estimates of sensitivity and specificity, as each study analysed independent combinations of the non-invasive tests. Tests that met the criteria for a replacement test were: a combination of serum IL-6 (cut-off > 15.4 pg/ml) and endometrial PGP 9.5 for pelvic endometriosis (sensitivity 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.00), specificity 0.93 (95% CI, 0.80, 0.98) and the combination of vaginal examination and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) for rectal endometriosis (sensitivity 0.96 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.99), specificity 0.98 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.00)). Tests that met the criteria for SpIN triage tests for pelvic endometriosis were: 1. a multiplication of urine vitamin-D-binding protein (VDBP) and serum CA-125 (cut-off > 2755) (sensitivity 0.74 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.84), specificity 0.97 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.00)) and 2. a combination of history (length of menses), serum CA-125 (cut-off > 35 U/ml) and endometrial leukocytes (sensitivity 0.61 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.69), specificity 0.95 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.98)). For endometrioma, the following combinations qualified as SpIN test: 1. TVUS and either serum CA-125 (cut-off ≥ 25 U/ml) or CA 19.9 (cut-off ≥ 12 U/ml) (sensitivity 0.79 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.91), specificity 0.97 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.00)); 2. TVUS and serum CA 19.9 (cut-off ≥ 12 U/ml) (sensitivity 0.54 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.70), specificity 0.97 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.0)); 3–4. TVUS and serum CA-125 (cut-off ≥ 20 U/ml or cut-off ≥ 25 U/ml) (sensitivity 0.69 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.85), specificity 0.96 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.99)); 5. TVUS and serum CA-125 (cut-off ≥ 35 U/ml) (sensitivity 0.52 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.71), specificity 0.97 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.00)). A combination of vaginal examination and TVUS reached the threshold for a SpIN test for obliterated pouch of Douglas (sensitivity 0.87 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.96), specificity 0.98 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.00)), vaginal wall endometriosis (sensitivity 0.82 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.95), specificity 0.99 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.0)) and rectovaginal septum endometriosis (sensitivity 0.88 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.00), specificity 0.99 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.00)). All the tests were evaluated in individual studies and displayed wide CIs. Due to the heterogeneity and high risk of bias of the included studies, the clinical utility of the studied combination diagnostic tests for endometriosis remains unclear.

Authors' Conclusions

None of the biomarkers evaluated in this review could be evaluated in a meaningful way and there was insufficient or poor-quality evidence. Laparoscopy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis and using any non-invasive tests should only be undertaken in a research setting.

Imaging for endometriosis and müllerian anomalies — subsequent magnetic resonance imaging may be necessary to further delineate müllerian anomalies but "is not cost-effective as an initial screening tool", and although magnetic resonance imaging is likely to be equally as sensitive as ultrasonography for ovarian endometriomas, it "does not appear to be useful for identifying endometriotic peritoneal lesions or determining extent of disease"; moreover, "a normal pelvic ultrasonography or physical examination does not eliminate the possibility of endometriosis".

Evaluation of suspected secondary dysmenorrhea — Most adolescents who present with dysmenorrhea have primary dysmenorrhea and will respond well to empiric treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), hormonal suppression, or both; however, patients who present with symptoms suggesting secondary dysmenorrhea or who fail empiric treatment require further evaluation. Additionally, if a patient has pain for 3–6 months, a more comprehensive evaluation of chronic pelvic pain should be performed with a history and focused physical examination to assess potential gastroenterologic, urologic, musculoskeletal, and psychosocial etiologies of pain. A pelvic examination to evaluate potential etiologies of secondary dysmenorrhea should be considered, and with education and support many adolescents who are not sexually active are able to tolerate a pelvic examination. Pelvic imaging with ultrasonography, regardless of findings on pelvic examination, also should be considered during evaluation for secondary dysmenorrhea, and ultrasonography is the most appropriate initial imaging modality to identify potential etiologies, including obstructive reproductive tract anomalies, uterine myomas, and adnexal masses with endometriomas.

### [Ga] Ga-FAPI-04 PET / CT in a patient with endometriosis: a potential game changer? [^a9a91e65]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis, characterized by the ectopic growth of endometrial-like tissue, is a common gynecological disease affecting approximately 10% of reproductive-age women. It can cause significant symptoms, including dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, infertility, and gastrointestinal disturbances. In addition to its physical effects, endometriosis can also affect mental health. Thus, endometriosis significantly impact the quality of life of patients. Diagnosis is primarily symptom-based, which can be challenging due to their variety and the heterogenic phenotype of endometriosis overlapping with other diseases. A definitive diagnosis is mostly confirmed through diagnostic laparoscopy. While transvaginal ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality, MRI is often used as a second-line tool for assessing disease extent and aiding in surgical planning.

This case highlights the potential role of 68 Ga-FAPI PET/CT in detecting endometriotic lesions. Not only did the scan confirm the known lesion, but also identified additional sites of involvement undetected by MRI. Many studies have demonstrated the biodistribution of the 68 Ga-labeled FAPI tracer, often showing intense uptake in the uterus. There has been a previous case report showing only faint uptake in one endometriotic lesion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first confirmed case of endometriosis demonstrated on 68 Ga-FAPI PET/CT with clear and intensive uptake. Therefore, 68 Ga-FAPI PET/CT could represent a promising diagnostic modality for endometriosis, alongside many malignant diseases in which it has proven effective. Our observation is supported by a recent preclinical study that found FAP expression in the immune microenvironment of endometriosis from various locations.

This case may provide a rationale for future studies systematically analyzing FAP expression in endometriosis across larger patient cohorts, investigating the value of 68 Ga-FAPI PET/CT. A prospective study was recently initiated and is currently underway investigating this issue (NCT06792318).

### Struma ovarii: role of imaging? [^0329cb1c]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Imaging does not allow the differentiation of non-functioning struma ovarii from other cystic masses. When struma ovarii is not associated with hyperthyroidism, the differential diagnosis includes: mature cystic teratoma without fatty tissue, cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma, endometriosis, tubo-ovarian abscess and metastatic tumour, because the images of such lesions may resemble those of struma ovarii.

Mucinous cyst should be considered when the lesion presents with high signal intensity locules on T1-weighted imaging, typical of mucinous content, and associated septations, but such features are also typical of struma. Struma ovarii is generally a much more complex lesion compared with mucinous cystadenoma. In a cystadenoma, lacy pattern contrast enhancement is not present. Both mucinous cystadenoma as well as struma present with locules containing hyperintense content on T1, representing the mucinous material in the first and thyroglobulin in the latter. The very low signal on T1 and T2 of the gelatinous colloid in the struma may be overlapping with features representing focal haemorrhage within a mucinous tumour, but might be more in favour of struma.

Endometriotic cysts present with very low SI on T2-weighted imaging, while the signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging is usually very high. Hence, discrimination from struma ovarii is generally not difficult.

A tubo-ovarian abscess presents with typical clinical signs of pain, fever and hyperleucocystosis, discrepant to the struma's often more insidious presentation.

The most challenging differential diagnosis is with ovarian cancer. Malignant epithelial cysts serous as well as mucinous type can present with very complex features, resembling the architecture of the struma's lacy pattern. Moreover, when haemorrhage is present in ovarian cystadenocarcinoma, this may present with similar features to the colloid in struma. In the absence of omental disease, the differential with malignant epithelial cyst remains challenging.

### ACOG updates guideline on diagnosis and treatment of… [^466882dc]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Definitive diagnosis of endometriosis can be made only by histology of lesions that have been removed surgically. Imaging studies cannot be used to diagnose endometriosis, but they can be useful in patients with pelvic or adnexal masses. Ovarian endometriomas typically appear on ultrasonography as cysts that contain low-level homogeneous internal echoes consistent with old blood. Imaging alone seems to be highly predictive in differentiating ovarian endometriomas from other adnexal masses. Transvaginal ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality to determine the presence of endometriosis and deeply infiltrating endometriosis of the rectum or recto-vaginal septum. Magnetic resonance imaging should be reserved for patients with equivocal ultrasound results and in whom rectovaginal or bladder endometriosis is suspected. If initial therapy is unsuccessful, diagnostic laparoscopy can be offered to confirm the diagnosis.

Alternatively, empiric treatment with another suppressive medication is an option. Empiric therapy with a three-month course of a GnRH agonist is appropriate if initial treatment with oral contraceptives and NSAIDs is unsuccessful. It is important to explain to the patient that response to empiric therapy does not confirm the diagnosis of endometriosis. Endometriomas are thought to result from progression of ovarian lesions that form cysts. These cysts can cause pain and infertility, and are associated with an increased risk of torsion and rupture. However, because they are attached to the ovary and the ovarian cortex where oocytes are embedded, removal of endome-triomas carries a risk that normal tissue will also be removed. There is also concern about the possibility of estrogen-induced malignant transformation in residual endometriosis; this has led some physicians to routinely recommend the addition of a progestin to the estrogen therapy.

However, there is no evidence to support this recommendation. TREATMENT OF INFERTILITY ASSOCIATED WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS Medical suppressive therapy, such as oral contraceptives or GnRH agonists, is ineffective for treatment of infertility associated with endometriosis. Surgery improves pregnancy rates, but the magnitude of improvement is not clear. Excision of deeply infiltrating endometriomas may adversely affect fertility. After initial unsuccessful surgery for infertility associated with endometriosis, in vitro fertilization is preferred over repeat surgery unless pain is still present. Repeat ovarian surgery has a significant negative effect on in vitro fertilization outcomes.

### MRI of endometriosis in correlation with the # enzian classification: applicability and structured report [^b7f6247d]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the last years, several papers highlighted the increasing role of MRI in the diagnosis of endometriosis. MRI shows high accuracy approaching criteria as triage and replacement test versus surgery, particularly for DIE.

The Enzian classification 2011 showed a good correlation between pre-operative MRI features and intraoperative findings in patients with DIE. Recent literature has also evaluated inter-reader agreement with this classification, showing varying results; Thomassin-Naggara et al.'s trial consisted of 150 cases affected by DIE. They found excellent inter-reader agreement for A and C compartments but poor agreement for the B compartment. On the other hand, the trial conducted by Burla et al. which consisted of 21 cases of DIE, showed an overall lower concordance, with a particularly weak inter-reader agreement for compartment C.

The #Enzian proposes a new comprehensive classification system, combining a complete staging of DIE with the evaluation of peritoneal/ovarian/tubal localizations and the presence of adenomyosis. Actually, the applicability of the #Enzian to MRI would benefit from some modifications that would render the classification more suitable for MRI evaluation. The most important limitation is the evaluation of tubo-ovarian condition. As reported in the classification, the subdivision of the adhesions in three different groups on the basis of the sites and of the involved organs remains complex and not reproducible. Additionally, MRI cannot assess the tubo-ovarian mobility and the tubal patency as defined in the classification. According to a recent study of Manganaro et al. including 60 patients, evaluating the applicability and reproducibility of the #Enzian classification to MRI, the concordance between readers (radiologists) regarding tubo-ovarian condition was poor and the worst of all compartments included in the #Enzian classification. Another limitation is the low sensibility of MRI in the diagnosis of peritoneal endometriosis. Regarding reproducibility of the #Enzian classification applied to MRI, excellent inter-reader agreement for peritoneal implants, adnexal lesions and uterine adenomyosis was demonstrated and moderate concordance for DIE, highlighting that the correct assessment of DIE is related to reader's expertise.

### Imaging of urinary bladder and ureteral endometriosis with emphasis on diagnosis and technique [^f22c2fc0]. Academic Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory gynecological condition affecting 10–15% of women in the reproductive age group. The urinary tract is the second most common extragenital organ system affected by endometriosis, and the urinary bladder and ureter are the two most common sites involved. Involvement of the urinary bladder can cause chronic debilitating symptoms, whereas ureteral involvement may lead to asymptomatic loss of renal function. Both conditions are frequently unsuspected, leading to a delay in diagnosis. Therefore, it is important to recognize this entity early, for which knowledge of imaging appearances and techniques is helpful. In this review article, we describe (a) endometriosis background, pathogenesis, definitions and clinical symptoms, (b) imaging appearance, with emphasis on ultrasound and MRI findings of urinary bladder and ureteric endometriosis, (c) ultrasound technique and MRI sequences useful for making the correct diagnosis, (d) overview of the treatment options and key imaging findings that are important to the surgeon for surgical planning, and (e) a structured reporting template useful for multidisciplinary patient management.
