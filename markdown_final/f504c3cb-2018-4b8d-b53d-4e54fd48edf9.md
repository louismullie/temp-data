## Question

Criteria for complicated uti

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the criteria that define a complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) and how to apply them in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical and evolving definitions across societies and guidelines. Then, I should verify the core principle that cUTI is defined by host factors and extent of disease rather than pathogen alone. Next, I will enumerate the major categories that make a UTI "complicated", including structural/functional abnormalities, device-related infections, systemic involvement, and host comorbidities. After that, I should review pediatric-specific considerations and the ongoing controversy about the term itself. Finally, I will translate these criteria into practical clinical implications for diagnosis, empiric therapy, duration, and follow-up, while double-checking areas of uncertainty and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the foundational concept so I don't overgeneralize: cUTI is not a single disease entity but an umbrella term for UTIs occurring in patients with host risk factors or with infection extending beyond the bladder, which increases the risk of treatment failure, complications, and recurrence compared with uncomplicated cystitis in otherwise healthy hosts [^116WuyBb] [^1124T5qR] [^113XstJL].

> I need to check the historical and current definitional frameworks to ensure consistency. Historically, cUTI meant "all UTIs that are not uncomplicated cystitis in a healthy, nonpregnant woman", whereas contemporary IDSA guidance reclassifies cUTI as infection beyond the bladder (pyelonephritis, febrile/bacteremic UTI, catheter-associated UTI) and explicitly excludes bacterial prostatitis from the cUTI scope in these documents, even though prostatitis is often managed as a complicated genitourinary infection in other contexts [^1124T5qR] [^113XstJL]. Hold on, I should verify the nuance here: some IDSA resistance guidance still treats any UTI in an adolescent or adult male as cUTI and manages it akin to pyelonephritis, which reflects a different definitional boundary in that document, so I must flag that discrepancy to avoid confusion [^114JeXVq].

> Next, I will examine structural and functional abnormalities of the urinary tract, because these are classic cUTI drivers. Obstruction (stones, strictures, prostatic hypertrophy), vesicoureteral reflux, neurogenic bladder, congenital anomalies, and urinary retention all impair normal urine flow and host defenses, thereby increasing the risk of persistence, abscess, and sepsis; these are uniformly categorized as cUTI in major guidelines and reviews [^116WuyBb] [^113XstJL] [^111Gwyks].

> I should confirm device-related infections as a distinct cUTI category. Catheter-associated UTI (indwelling urethral, suprapubic, or intermittent catheterization) is explicitly managed as cUTI in EAU guidance, and the pathophysiology and microbiology differ from non-catheterized hosts, often involving biofilm and polymicrobial flora, which explains higher failure rates with standard regimens and the need for device management strategies [^114XQfpU] [^1143DosV] [^115Xk6Uu].

> Let me consider systemic involvement next, because this is where the clinical spectrum shifts. Pyelonephritis, febrile UTI, and urosepsis indicate infection beyond the bladder and are encompassed within cUTI; importantly, the presence of sepsis or septic shock mandates broader empiric coverage and urgent source control when obstruction is suspected, aligning with Sepsis-3 definitions and urosepsis principles [^113XstJL] [^117Vq6gK] [^115H6vcY].

> I will now review host comorbidities that elevate risk and failure probability. Immunocompromise, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, pregnancy, and extremes of age (neonates, elderly) are repeatedly cited as complicating factors; in pediatrics, neonates and infants with febrile UTI are generally managed as cUTI due to immature host defenses and risk of renal scarring, which justifies longer therapy and imaging in selected contexts [^114SY5gu] [^113seaNn] [^112z2pwe].

> But wait, what about recurrent UTIs — do they automatically equal cUTI? I should double-check this. Recurrent UTI alone is not synonymous with cUTI; however, frequent recurrences in the setting of underlying abnormalities or failure of conventional management may be categorized as cUTI in some frameworks, and recurrent infections in men often prompt evaluation for prostatitis or structural disease, which shifts management toward longer courses and source assessment [^11285M1j] [^114JeXVq] [^113seaNn].

> Next, I should review pediatric-specific criteria because adult definitions map imperfectly to children. Pediatric guidelines emphasize subgroups with higher likelihood of failing conventional management: anatomical/functional urologic abnormalities, multiple recurrences, severe clinical presentations (sepsis, extensive parenchymal involvement), nonurologic comorbidities, and neonates; these subgroups guide initial IV therapy, longer durations, imaging, and surgical referral as needed [^113seaNn] [^112z2pwe] [^117TwgWA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the term itself. There is an active debate about whether "cUTI" remains a meaningful clinical category given heterogeneity and poor adherence to FDA guidance in trials; a 2024–2025 Lancet consensus proposes abandoning the term in favor of a reference standard that distinguishes UTI with and without systemic involvement and incorporates quantified pyuria and a lower bacteriuria threshold, while the EAU is proposing a new classification to improve clarity and clinical utility, underscoring the need to document the exact host and disease-extent features rather than rely on a vague label [^113T1p6Z] [^111ndMsp] [^113Ym5hA].

> I need to ensure the practical implications are explicit. Clinically, labeling a UTI as "complicated" should trigger urine culture before antibiotics when feasible, broader empiric therapy tailored to severity and local resistance, attention to source control (especially obstruction or devices), and longer treatment durations than for uncomplicated cystitis, with IDSA suggesting 7 days total for many cUTI syndromes (including pyelonephritis and bacteremia) if improving, and 5–7 days for fluoroquinolones or 7 days for non-fluoroquinolones, recognizing exceptions such as suspected prostatitis where 10–14 days may be preferred despite limited evidence [^1153oX8h] [^117Smpys] [^116fXk2s] [^116wywDX].

> Let me verify the diagnostic thresholds I'm using so I don't propagate outdated cutoffs. The traditional ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL threshold has poor sensitivity in suspected UTI populations; contemporary research and consensus support lowering the significant bacteriuria threshold to 10⁴ CFU/mL in symptomatic patients, and the new reference standard integrates quantified pyuria and clinical symptoms to improve diagnostic validity across settings [^113T1p6Z] [^116cFdsT].

> I should confirm imaging indications because they differ from uncomplicated cystitis. In suspected cUTI, imaging is warranted to evaluate for obstruction, abscess, or other complications: ultrasound can screen for hydronephrosis and guide intervention, while CT is more sensitive for abscess, emphysematous infection, and stone disease; in children, ultrasound is prioritized acutely to detect obstruction or renal lesions, with further imaging guided by clinical course and recurrence [^111Wh21Z] [^111Gwyks] [^116SCarT].

> Finally, I need to ensure antimicrobial stewardship is embedded. Empiric regimens should be narrowed promptly to culture results, and IV-to-oral switch should occur as soon as the patient is clinically improving, hemodynamically stable, and an effective oral option is available; avoid unnecessary fluoroquinolones in patients with recent class exposure and tailor choices to prior resistance patterns and local antibiograms to mitigate resistance and adverse effects [^112bPvv4] [^112BXcnZ] [^111s2fcA] [^116v63pm].

A complicated UTI is defined by **structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities** [^114JeXVq] or **significant host comorbidities** that increase the risk of treatment failure, recurrence, or severe outcomes [^113ivLkw] [^116WuyBb]. Key criteria include **indwelling catheters**, **urinary obstruction**, **vesicoureteral reflux**, **neurogenic bladder**, **diabetes**, **immunosuppression**, **pregnancy**, **recent urologic surgery**, or **multidrug-resistant pathogens** [^113XstJL] [^117CE24G]. These factors necessitate longer antibiotic courses, imaging, and closer follow-up than uncomplicated UTIs [^113ivLkw] [^116buK5r].

---

## Structural and functional abnormalities of the urinary tract

Structural or functional abnormalities are a hallmark of complicated UTIs, as they impair normal urine flow and host defenses, increasing the risk of persistent infection and complications [^114JeXVq]. The following abnormalities are commonly associated with complicated UTIs:

- **Indwelling urinary catheters**: Catheter-associated UTIs (CAUTIs) are a major subset of complicated UTIs, characterized by biofilm formation and increased resistance to antibiotics [^1143DosV].

- **Urinary obstruction**: Obstruction due to stones, strictures, tumors, or prostatic hypertrophy predisposes to infection and requires intervention to relieve the obstruction [^116SCarT].

- **Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)**: VUR, especially grades III-V, significantly increases the risk of recurrent infections and renal scarring, particularly in children [^notfound].

- **Neurogenic bladder**: Conditions such as spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis impair bladder emptying, leading to chronic infections and complications [^113XstJL].

- **Congenital anomalies**: Anatomical abnormalities present from birth, such as ureteral strictures or posterior urethral valves, predispose to recurrent infections and renal damage [^notfound].

---

## Host-related factors and comorbidities

Certain patient characteristics and comorbidities significantly increase the complexity and severity of UTIs:

- **Immunosuppression**: Patients with HIV/AIDS, transplant recipients, or those on immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk of severe infections and complications [^1157GpzH].

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Diabetes impairs host immune responses and increases the risk of severe infections, including emphysematous pyelonephritis [^notfound].

- **Pregnancy**: UTIs during pregnancy are considered complicated due to the risk of maternal and fetal complications, including pyelonephritis and preterm labor [^notfound].

- **Elderly patients**: Older adults often have comorbidities, impaired bladder function, and atypical presentations, increasing the risk of complications [^1174T2WE].

- **Recent urologic surgery**: Recent instrumentation or surgery increases the risk of infection and complications [^114VaKCN].

---

## Clinical presentation and severity

Complicated UTIs often present with more severe clinical features than uncomplicated UTIs, including:

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, chills, rigors, and hemodynamic instability indicate systemic involvement and a more severe infection [^113XstJL].

- **Flank pain or costovertebral angle tenderness**: Suggestive of upper urinary tract involvement, such as pyelonephritis [^115nETUE].

- **Bacteremia**: Presence of bacteria in the bloodstream, indicating a severe infection with potential for sepsis [^114VaKCN].

- **Multidrug-resistant organisms**: Infections caused by resistant pathogens, such as ESBL-producing Enterobacterales or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, complicate treatment and increase the risk of treatment failure [^116WuyBb].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and laboratory findings

Diagnosis of complicated UTIs relies on clinical assessment supported by laboratory and imaging studies:

- **Urine culture**: Positive urine culture with significant bacteriuria (typically ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL), often with multidrug-resistant organisms [^115saG8A].

- **Blood culture**: Positive blood cultures indicate bacteremia and systemic infection [^notfound].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI may reveal structural abnormalities, obstruction, abscesses, or other complications requiring intervention [^111Wh21Z].

- **Laboratory tests**: Elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, procalcitonin) and renal function tests may indicate severe infection and renal involvement [^116oRwnF].

---

## Management implications

Complicated UTIs require **more aggressive and prolonged antibiotic therapy** than uncomplicated UTIs, typically 7–14 days, with longer courses for severe infections or persistent complicating factors [^112nVoR8]. Imaging studies are often necessary to identify and address underlying structural abnormalities or complications [^111Wh21Z]. Close follow-up is essential to monitor for recurrence, persistent infection, or development of complications such as renal scarring or chronic kidney disease [^116buK5r].

---

A complicated UTI is defined by structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities, significant host comorbidities, or severe clinical presentations that increase the risk of treatment failure, recurrence, or severe outcomes. Accurate identification and management of these factors are essential to prevent complications and ensure optimal patient outcomes [^111Gwyks].

A complicated urinary tract infection is that which occurs in a patient with an anatomically abnormal urinary tract or significant medical or surgical comorbidities. Whereas this definition may not cover each and every situation, it does serve to encompass the great majority of these patients and guide their care. The definition is necessarily broad, to assure that these potentially complex patients are appropriately managed. Thus, complicated urinary tract infection describes a group of patients that usually need a prolonged course of antimicrobial therapy, with all its attendant morbidities, costs, and outcome differences.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® recurrent lower urinary tract infections in females [^111Gwyks]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women are common, with an overall lifetime risk over > 50%. UTIs are considered recurrent when they follow complete clinical resolution of a previous UTI and are usually defined as at least three episodes of infection within the preceding 12 months. An uncomplicated UTI is classified as a UTI without structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract and without relevant comorbidities. Complicated UTIs are those occurring in patients with underlying structural or medical problems. In women with recurrent uncomplicated UTIs, cystoscopy and imaging are not routinely used. In women suspected of having a recurrent complicated UTI, cystoscopy and imaging should be considered. CT urography or MR urography are usually appropriate for the evaluation of recurrent complicated lower urinary tract infections or for women who are nonresponders to conventional therapy, develop frequent reinfections or relapses, or have known underlying risk factors. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Epidemiology, definition and treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^116WuyBb]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2020). High credibility.

UTIs are amongst the most frequent bacterial infections. However, the clinical phenotypes of UTI are heterogeneous and range from rather benign, uncomplicated infections to complicated UTIs (cUTIs), pyelonephritis and severe urosepsis. Stratification of patients with UTIs is, therefore, important. Several classification systems exist for the description and classification of UTIs, with the common rationale that cUTIs have a higher risk of recurrence or chronification, progression or severe outcome than uncomplicated UTIs. The pathophysiology and treatment of cUTIs and pyelonephritis are driven more by host factors than by pathogen attributes. cUTIs and pyelonephritis are associated with high antimicrobial resistance rates among causative pathogens. However, antimicrobial resistance rates can differ substantially, depending on the population being studied and whether the data being analysed are from surveillance studies, registry data or interventional studies, in which specific inclusion and exclusion criteria are used for patient selection. For example, antibiotic resistance rates are higher in patients with urosepsis than in those with less severe infections. Thus, treatment outcomes differ substantially among studies, ranging from 50% to almost 100% clearance of infection, depending on the patient population analysed, the UTI entities included and the primary outcome of the study. Pyelonephritis and cUTIs have emerged as infection models for the study of novel antibiotics, including extensive investigation of novel substances active against Gram-negative bacteria.

INTRODUCTION

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) present a challenge to the clinician because of the variety of clinical syndromes included and consequent difficulties in synthesizing evidence for practical guidance. The cumulative incidence of all childhood UTI by the age of 7 years is 1%–2% in boys and 7% in girls. Of those presenting to emergency, 5%–24% are deemed cUTI, so it is a common childhood infection. However, defining what makes a UTI complicated is difficult because it has been characterized by a variety of UTI syndromes, which include hosts with abnormal urology or other underlying conditions, severe clinical presentations with or without extensive tissue involvement, and unusual pathogens. For this review and guideline, cUTIs are those that require other management considerations than straightforward lower or upper tract UTIs for which evidence and guidelines exist. Accurate diagnosis and management of cUTI limit morbidity and mortality from sepsis and long-term renal damage. However, most trials of UTI in children have excluded those with cUTI, and consequently, many guidelines also exclude them. The absence of a standardized definition for cUTI has resulted in inconsistencies in treatment approaches, which may lead to increased morbidity among affected children. Existing major UTI guidelines for children either do not address complicated UTIs at all or are limited to only some complications or some age groups. –

This review aims to address the four most important controversies when managing children with cUTI and provide recommendations for definition, investigations, treatment and follow-up. The resulting guidelines offer evidence-graded recommendations specifically for the management of pediatric cUTI, addressing gaps that exist in current guidelines.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^113seaNn]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) present a challenge to the clinician because of the variety in clinical syndromes included and consequent difficulties in synthesizing evidence. A harmonized definition of cUTI does not exist. In national guidelines, management recommendations for cUTI are often neglected. We aimed to define the four most important controversies and formulate management recommendations for cUTI in children and adolescents.

Methods

The European Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Guideline Committee convened a working group of experts from microbiology, pediatric nephrology and infectious diseases with expertise in managing children with UTI. A comprehensive literature review was done using PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library to find studies in children under 18 years published until December 2024. Four controversies were defined from experience and available evidence. Children with cUTI were categorized into 5 subgroups: anatomical/functional urological abnormalities, multiple UTI recurrences, severe clinical presentation, nonurological underlying conditions and neonates. Respective management guidelines were formulated through the evidence and by consensus of working group members. Recommendations were made using GRADE criteria.

Results

The term cUTI is generally used to define children with UTI with an increased likelihood of failing conventional management. The included 5 subgroups are the most likely to need additional investigations at diagnosis and during the course of infection, initial intravenous antibiotics, longer treatment duration, antibiotic prophylaxis, follow-up imaging and surgical referral. These are detailed for each subgroup.

Conclusions

These comprehensive guidelines offer evidence-graded recommendations specifically for pediatric cUTI, addressing gaps that exist in current guidelines.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^117Smpys]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

RESULTS

What Is the Definition of cUTI?

cUTI is most usefully defined as children with UTI with an increased likelihood of failing conventional management (GRADE D).
Children with cUTI have one or more of: localized risk: significant anatomical or functional urological abnormality, multiple recurrent UTI, generalized risk: neonates, nonurological underlying condition (renal and nonrenal) and severe clinical presentations: sepsis, severe renal parenchymal disease.
We have used "complicated" to define subgroups at presentation and consequent management recommendations and "atypical" to refer to unexpected clinical progress (GRADE D).

The term "complicated UTI" has been used to describe multiple different UTI syndromes, with additional characteristics that might complicate the usual UTI course, variably including severe clinical presentations with or without extensive tissue involvement, hosts with abnormal urology or other underlying conditions and unusual pathogen properties. This variety makes it difficult to compare studies and provide consistent evidence in guidelines for the management of cUTI. UTI has traditionally been categorized as uncomplicated (uUTI) and complicated (cUTI) to standardize trial participants, but due to the lack of specific and clearly defined criteria at the outset, the definition has become increasingly broad and ambiguous. In a recent systematic review in adults, cUTI was variably defined by host factors and systemic involvement, a combination of both or neither. In children, early attempts to define cUTI variably included all neonates, most children with pyelonephritis, children with known anatomical or functional abnormalities, extensive parenchymal involvement, septicemia, nosocomial acquisition, renal impairment and recent antibiotics. The limited number of pediatric studies addressing cUTI (Table S1, Supplemental Digital Content 1a, and 1b,), have used various definitions, from comprehensive to brief to single complication.– Regarding the cUTI definition in existing guidelines for childhood UTI management, the updated National Institute for Clinical Excellence guideline for childhood UTIand recent Canadianand Swissguidelines used varying combinations of severe presentation, renal issues and failure to improve in their definitions, while the Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrologyuses severe presentation as the only criterion.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116wywDX]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) management — men with febrile, bacteremic urinary tract infection in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement. This recommendation places a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations as well as reducing the burden of antimicrobial administration from a healthcare perspective and reducing the burden of taking antibiotics from a patient perspective. Refer to Figure 1.3 for a stepwise assessment of the intravenous to oral switch and the duration of antibiotic therapy.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Over the last 5 years, new and updated pediatric UTI guidelines from around the world have become increasingly consistent for uncomplicated UTI, but either do not address or differ in definition and recommendations for complicated UTI. This is the first comprehensive guideline focused exclusively on cUTI in children that addresses its diagnosis and management according to the features making it complicated: young age, disease severity/extent and comorbidities. This guideline is comprehensive in addressing gaps in existing guidelines by first highlighting that cUTI is not a uniform entity but rather constitutes a wide range of disease processes. The guideline presents the evidence for diagnosing and managing the subgroups presenting with each of these processes to ensure more individualized patient management. It also reviews emerging evidence for conceptualizing cUTI as an amalgamation of patients' individual features and attainment of a threshold for more intense management. Regardless of the subgroup, accurate diagnosis is the critical first step in managing children with cUTI for which additional investigations, such as blood culture, serum biochemistry and USS, might be required. While several subgroups benefit from initial IV (sepsis, VUR 3–5, neonates) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (sepsis, high risk of resistance from recurrent UTI and immunocompromise), oral narrow-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for most children with cUTI who are not severely unwell. Prophylaxis is not needed universally in cUTI, and its relatively small benefits in specific subgroups need to be weighed against the risk of resistance, with at least 6-monthly reevaluation for its requirement. Longer-term follow-up should aim to assess the need for surgical intervention to reduce the risk of renal damage.

Despite cUTI being common in children, differences in definition and focus on uncomplicated infection have led to scarce high-grade evidence for management, that is also difficult to synthesize. Apart from RCT-based recommendations for CAP in children with urological abnormality, these guidelines are largely based on retrospective studies and expert consensus in areas where high-quality evidence is currently lacking. In addition, available evidence mostly comes from resource-rich settings, and in resource-limited settings there may be some barriers to accessing some investigations and treatments, for example, nuclear medicine imaging and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, most first-line investigations in the guideline are broadly available and most antibiotic recommendations are from the World Health Organization Access list which should be available in most countries. Therefore, these guidelines can be effectively implemented in most healthcare settings, even in resource-limited environments.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^113YNbiD]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The European Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Guidelines Committee convened a working group of experts from microbiology, pediatric nephrology and infectious diseases. The working group conducted a comprehensive literature review using PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library of studies published until December 2024. Search terms included: urinary tract infection/UTI, complicated, complex, atypical, urinary tract abnormality/anomaly, recurrent/recurrence, chronic renal/kidney disease/failure, immunosuppression, adolescent, child, pediatric, infant, neonate/neonatal, definition, investigations, diagnosis, treatment, management, antibiotics, prophylaxis and imaging. Studies were included for review if they involved children under 18 years with any definition of cUTI and excluded if they focused solely on uncomplicated UTI (uUTI) or adults. Types of included studies were reviews, trials, comparative and cohort studies and existing guidelines were also reviewed for references. Four key controversies were identified from experience and available literature: definition of cUTI, investigations, treatment and follow-up. Evaluation of evidence quality and formulation of recommendations used GRADE methodology. After assessment of the literature on definition, cUTIs were categorized into 5 main subgroups, and respective management guidelines were formulated from the graded evidence by working group consensus.

### An update on classification and management of urosepsis [^115H6vcY]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The urinary tract is the infection site in severe sepsis/septic shock in 10–30%.

Recent Findings

There is a new Sepsis definition focusing on severe sepsis. Urosepsis is mainly due to obstructed uropathy of the upper urinary tract. The pathogenesis of sepsis is complex and is driven by the innate immune system. In the further course immunosuppression is developing. Management of urosepsis includes early diagnosis, early initiation of treatment such as identification and control of the complicating factor in the urinary tract and the specific sepsis therapy. As part of early diagnosis the value of the new defining criteria is still to be known. The management bundles are regularly updated according to the surviving sepsis campaign guidelines.

Summary

Sepsis has still a high morbidity and mortality rate. Although definition and diagnosis of sepsis has been recently updated, its translation into urosepsis management requires validation.

Selection of definitive antibiotic therapy for complicated UTI — In patients with confirmed complicated UTI, we suggest selecting a definitive effective antibiotic with a targeted spectrum based on the results of urine culture (identification and susceptibility) as soon as these are available, rather than continuing empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for the complete duration of treatment (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The comment states that this recommendation places a high value on de-escalating antibiotic therapy based on culture results and notes that de-escalation may be less practical in cases of cUTI managed in the outpatient setting.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute cystitis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, EAU 2025 guidelines recommend to diagnose cystitis in females with no other risk factors for complicated UTIs based on a focused history of LUTS (dysuria, frequency, and urgency) and the absence of vaginal discharge.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^113XstJL]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) classifications — intended to guide treatment not diagnosis — are defined by clinical presentation suggesting infection extending beyond the bladder with fever, other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills, rigors, or hemodynamic instability), flank pain, or costovertebral angle tenderness. Pyelonephritis is encompassed in complicated UTI. UTI with systemic symptoms associated with transurethral, suprapubic, or intermittent catheterization is encompassed in complicated UTI. Patients with complicated UTIs may have an indwelling urinary catheter, neurogenic bladder, urinary obstruction, or urinary retention as an underlying condition, and these guidelines are not intended to apply to bacterial prostatitis, epididymitis, or orchitis.

### Managing complicated urinary tract infections: the urologic view [^116buK5r]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with complicated UTIs are a diverse group. These patients have upper UTIs and structural or functional abnormalities that reduce the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy. They are at increased risk for morbidity such as bacteremia and sepsis, perinephric abscess, renal deterioration, and emphysematous pyelonephritis. Appropriate urinary tract imaging, antimicrobials, medical and surgical therapies, and follow-up are required to avoid potentially devastating outcomes.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^112xqzWq]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

The most systematic effort to categorize the diversity of UTI syndromes and provide a basis for the definition of cUTI has been by the European Association of Urology (EAU), through a four-component classification system that identifies children likely to fail conventional UTI management. This incorporates clinical presentation, severity of tissue involvement, host risk factors (ORENUC acronym, O: no risk factors, R: recurrences, E: extra-urological risk factors, N: nephropathic diseases, U: urological risk factors, C: catheter) and pathogen susceptibility. Most of the broadly recognized subgroups of cUTI include components of the EAU system and are incorporated into the 2015 EAU/ESPU Guideline, although the 2021 revision does not include neonates. Uncomplicated pyelonephritis is no longer considered cUTI. Part of the problem with clearly defining cUTI is that the spectrum of disease is wide, with multiple mild to severe complicating factors. It has been found that if more complicating features exist, clinicians are more likely to manage these differently from uUTI, that is, use intravenous (IV) antibiotics. It may be that rather than categorizing UTI as either uncomplicated or complicated, the concept of less complicated or more complicated is useful, with an increasing number of abnormal features guiding more aggressive management. This requires further study.

Despite the broadness and inconsistencies in the term cUTI, it is preserved in the present guideline, where we use "complicated" to refer to components at presentation that impact immediate management and "atypical" to refer to progress that does not follow the expected trajectory. We define several subgroups of children with UTI that are deemed complicated at presentation to differentiate them from children with uUTI and to consider their diagnosis and management separately, rather than addressing them as a heterogeneous whole. This has been done considering published literature, other UTI guidelines and the EAU classification system. All subgroups identified in this guideline have at least 2 components from the EAU classification system(Table 1).

### A reference standard for urinary tract infection research: a multidisciplinary Delphi consensus study [^113T1p6Z]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The absence of a consensus-based reference standard for urinary tract infection (UTI) research adversely affects the internal and external validity of diagnostic and therapeutic studies. This omission hinders the accumulation of evidence for a disease that imposes a substantial burden on patients and society, particularly in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance. We did a three-round Delphi study involving an international, multidisciplinary panel of UTI experts (n = 46) and achieved a high degree of consensus (94%) on the final reference standard. New-onset dysuria, urinary frequency, and urinary urgency were considered major symptoms, and non-specific symptoms in older patients were not deemed indicative of UTI. The reference standard distinguishes between UTI with and without systemic involvement, abandoning the term complicated UTI. Moreover, different levels of pyuria were incorporated in the reference standard, encouraging quantification of pyuria in studies done in all health-care settings. The traditional bacteriuria threshold (10⁵ colony-forming units per mL) was lowered to 10⁴ colony-forming units per mL. This new reference standard can be used for UTI research across many patient populations and has the potential to increase homogeneity between studies.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^11285M1j]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) classifications — intended to guide treatment, not diagnosis — describe a clinical syndrome characterized by local bladder signs and symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain, and are defined by absence of findings suggesting infection beyond the bladder: no fever unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills, rigors, or unstable vital signs) unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no flank pain, and no costovertebral angle tenderness. Uncomplicated UTI can occur in females or males, patients with underlying urologic abnormalities, patients with immunocompromise, and persons with diabetes; recurrent UTI can be uncomplicated. Patients with urinary catheters (including transurethral, suprapubic, and intermittent catheterization), stents, and percutaneous nephrostomy tubes generally do not have uncomplicated UTI, and these guidelines are not intended to apply to bacterial prostatitis, epididymitis, or orchitis.

UTIs are common, potentially severe infections that the emergency physician must manage efficiently and effectively. In most cases, this entity is well recognized, and the clinician will be confident of the correct course. However, in certain populations, complications are common, and the best therapy has yet to be proven. Tailoring the evaluation and treatment to the risk of complications is imperative. With careful evaluation, individualized therapy and close follow-up, the majority of patients can be expected to do well.

Severity of illness — initial prioritization of empiric antibiotic therapy states: For patients with suspected complicated UTI (including pyelonephritis), we suggest that the selection of empiric antibiotic therapy be initially guided by the severity of illness, specifically by whether the patient is in sepsis or not (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Sepsis is defined per the Sepsis-3 Task Force as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection; patients can be identified by SOFA score increase of 2 points or more, reflecting an in-hospital mortality greater than 10%, or presumptively identified with screening tools such as qSOFA or SIRS.

An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI — In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, sepsis or septic shock, immunocompromised states, severe renal insufficiency, and functional or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and some patients in these subpopulations may need an individualized plan of therapy. An effective antimicrobial agent means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

Agents with broader spectrum of activity against organisms other than Enterobacterales (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) may be considered for patients with sepsis in whom the diagnosis of cUTI is not clear or who are suspected to have cUTI due to these pathogens.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^114VaKCN]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

UTIs are characterized according to several schema and terminologies, which are relevant to their diagnostic work-up. Anatomically, lower UTIs are confined to the bladder (cystitis) and/or urethra, while upper UTIs involve ascension to the kidneys (pyelonephritis). The latter are more commonly associated with both bacteremia (a condition defined microbiologically) and urosepsis (defined clinicopathologically), although they may occur with cystitis alone. UTIs may be further defined according to patient risk factors. Uncomplicated UTI (uUTI) affects non-pregnant, immunocompetent females without structural/functional urinary tract abnormalities or other predisposing conditions. Notably, an explicit microbiologic diagnosis (i.e. urine culture) is not necessarily indicated for routine cases of uncomplicated cystitis, as empiric antimicrobial therapy is often appropriate. Complicated UTI (cUTI) is an umbrella term for infections arising in the context of risk factor(s) listed above for uUTI. Traditionally, a UTI in a male is inherently considered complicated (although this is controversial). Complicated infections secondary to catheterization are termed catheter associated UTIs. In terms of temporal dynamics, multiple episodes of symptomatic infection (two within 6 months or three within 1 year) with intervening periods of clinical resolution are recurrent UTIs. These may represent persistent infections by the same offending organism or reinfection by a different species/strain. Likewise, the term chronic UTI is applied loosely to either recurrent or unresolving infections. Finally, the concept of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) refers to recovery of a potential uropathogen at high burden (typically > 10⁵ CFU/mL) in the absence of symptomatology. Antimicrobial therapy is typically not indicated for ASB, except in certain populations at high risk for adverse outcomes (e.g. renal transplant recipients and pregnant women, especially those undergoing invasive urologic procedures).

Additional blood tests, and imaging can be useful depending on the subgroup of cUTI, both for initial diagnosis and subsequently (Table 2), with the rationale for their use often different at different stages in the infection. For example, USS of the kidneys and urinary tract during the acute phase can neither rule in nor rule out an upper UTI (pyelonephritis) or vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Therefore, the role of acute USS in children with urosepsis, septic shock, poor urine flow, abdominal or bladder mass and increased creatinine is to determine whether there is acute obstruction that needs urgent surgical intervention.USS may be performed for different reasons, including failure to respond with suitable antibiotics within 48 hours to investigate for renal abscess, or for recurrent UTI to assess for other urological abnormalities needing intervention.

All children should be reassessed 48 hours after diagnosis for (1) clinical response to treatment, (2) confirmation of the diagnosis and (3) potential targeting of antibiotics according to susceptibility (aim to the narrow antimicrobial spectrum).

Treatment should be stopped if the UTI diagnosis is not confirmed, that is, most cases with a negative urine culture with no prior antibiotics to explain this. If the response to treatment is atypical and does not follow the expected trajectory after 48 hours, reassessment for the cause is imperative, rather than simply switching to IV or broader-spectrum antibiotics (although either of these could be needed). Depending on the clinical situation, repeat urine culture, inflammatory markers, serum creatinine and renal USS may be needed to confirm the UTI diagnosis and assess for complications. Other investigations may be needed to seek an alternate/additional diagnosis.

How Should Children With cUTI be Treated?

Treatment of cUTI involves consideration of antibiotic route, choice and duration and supportive management. The majority of RCTs and meta-analyses of childhood UTIs exclude those with cUTIs, so recommendations largely rely on a synthesis of retrospective studies (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2,) and expert opinion to provide a practical empirical guideline to initiate treatment (Table 3). Due to the variability of complicating features even within subgroups, a further individualized approach is often needed, considering local antibiograms, past urine cultures, antibiotic exposure, hospital admissions, urine catheterization and other host factors, including allergies.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common infection seen in the emergency department. The spectrum of UTI includes simple versus complicated infection and lower versus upper UTI. No one history or examination finding is definitive for diagnosis. Testing often includes urinalysis and/or urine dipstick, and several pitfalls may occur in interpretation. Urine cultures should be obtained in complicated or upper UTIs but not simple and lower tract UTIs, unless a patient is pregnant. Imaging often is not required. Most patients with simple cystitis and pyelonephritis are treated as outpatients. A variety of potentially dangerous conditions may mimic UTI and pyelonephritis.

### CAUTIon-not all UTIs are the same [^1143DosV]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common infections, accounting for ~400 million diagnoses per year worldwide. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs) occur in healthy individuals with no structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary system and primarily affect women. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are a type of complicated UTI affecting patients who have a urinary catheter in place, often hospitalized patients or patients with conditions that prevent them from urinating naturally. Both infections share common symptoms, diagnostics and treatment options but also differ greatly in pathophysiology, aetiology, risk factors and comorbidities. These differences could explain why antibiotic treatments - which generally lead to positive outcomes in patients with uUTIs - often fail in patients with CAUTIs. Understanding these differences could guide evidence-based insights into why treatments for CAUTIs should be different from those for uUTIs, specifically, by modifying catheters, which initiate the damage-induced segue for UTIs.

### Urine trouble: should we think differently about UTI? [^115iUiqd]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is clinically important, given that it is one of the most common bacterial infections in adult women. However, the current understanding of UTI remains based on a now disproven concept that the urinary bladder is sterile. Thus, current standards for UTI diagnosis have significant limitations that may reduce the opportunity to improve patient care. Using data from our work and numerous other peer-reviewed studies, we identified four major limitations to the contemporary UTI description: the language of UTI, UTI diagnostic testing, the Escherichia coli-centric view of UTI, and the colony-forming units (CFU) threshold-based diagnosis. Contemporary methods and technology, combined with continued rigorous clinical research can be used to correct these limitations.

THE CLINICAL LANDSCAPE OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS

An estimated 400 million urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur each year globally, with over 200,000 associated deaths, making UTIs one of the most common bacterial diseases and drivers of antimicrobial usage. UTIs disproportionately affect women, up to 60% of whom experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. This association is generally attributed to anatomy, although hormonal factors also play an increasingly recognized role, including in relation to the vaginal microbiome. Traditionally, a UTI is defined by clinical signs and symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, pelvic or lower abdominal pain, pyuria, or urinary incontinence — often in combination with identification of an offending pathogen via urine culture. This symptom-based approach to UTIs can lack sensitivity or specificity in certain populations, including the very young and elderly, or individuals who are chronically catheterized, with urologic or neurologic abnormalities. For these patients, signs and symptoms can be ambiguous.

### Ceftazidime-avibactam versus doripenem for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, including acute pyelonephritis: RECAPTURE, a phase 3 randomized trial program [^115nETUE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

METHODS

Study Design and Participants

RECAPTURE 1 and 2 comprised 2 identical phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trials designed incorporating FDA and EMA guidance. All patients (or their legal representatives) provided written informed consent. The studies were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Protocols (available at:) were approved by study sites' independent ethics committees and/or institutional review boards.

Thelists full inclusion/exclusion criteria. In brief, eligible patients were aged 18–90 years, and had cUTI or acute pyelonephritis considered by the investigator to be serious and requiring hospitalization for intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy. Diagnosis was based on positive urine cultures obtained within 48 hours of enrollment showing 1–2 gram-negative uropathogens at ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, and pyuria. Complicated UTI without pyelonephritis was defined as presence of ≥ 2 symptoms, including ≥ 1 UTI-specific symptom (dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain with onset/worsening within the previous 7 days) as well as ≥ 1 complicating factor. Acute pyelonephritis was indicated by flank pain with onset/worsening within the previous 7 days, and/or costovertebral angle tenderness, with fever and/or nausea/vomiting. Patients could be enrolled before cultures were available, providing that positive results were expected, the study drugs were considered appropriate empiric therapy, and a urine Gram stain showed gram-negative bacilli and no gram-positive bacteria. Indwelling bladder catheters in place for > 24 hours had to be removed or replaced (unless considered unsafe or contraindicated) before the baseline urine collection. Standardized catheter management guidelines were followed.

Key exclusion criteria included complete obstruction of any portion of the urinary tract, perinephric or intrarenal abscess, or prostatitis; UTI symptoms potentially attributable to another process; urinary diversion or vesicoureteral reflux; creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≤ 30 mL/minute (including patients on dialysis).

### Urine flow cytometry in older adults urinary tract infection diagnosis: is it time to reevaluate thresholds for men and women? [^112E5WTn]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic of UTI

The diagnosis of UTI in the older patients is complicated by the frequent absence of specific clinical signs in these patients. There is currently no gold standard for diagnosis in this age group. We based the diagnosis of UTI on the clinician's assessment during the patient's admission, coupled with strict criteria. Patients were considered eligible for the UTI group if they were treated for UTI during their hospital stay based on their initial urine culture results. To confirm the diagnosis of UTI, patients had to have: a positive urine culture (as defined above) associated with a bloodstream infection with the same bacteria, or at least one major symptom of UTI (dysuria, pollakiuria), or imaging compatible with UTI, or at least two minor symptoms among: fever or chills, hypotension, confusion, urological obstruction, or flank pain without another diagnosis to explain these symptoms. Additionally, we collected other symptoms, such as onset of incontinence, acute urinary retention, or acute renal insufficiency. However, these symptoms were not included in our criteria, as they are not usually considered in the diagnosis of UTI. U-WBC, as a diagnostic criterion, was excluded to avoid biasing the leukocyte threshold selection. For patients with discordant classification between the patient's hospital admission report and our definition, patient's charts were reviewed by a geriatrician and an infectious disease physician independently (M.G. and K.B.). In the case of a discordant classification between the two investigators or a lack of data to exclude or confirm urinary tract infection, the patient was excluded.

### The adherence of GPs to guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of lower urinary tract infections in women is poor [^111zzxXJ]. Family Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the adherence of GPs to evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of lower urinary tract infection (UTI) in women.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was performed from March to July 2009 in primary care offices. Physicians consecutively registered the first six UTI attended during an 8-week period. Age, days with symptoms, episode of infection, associated morbidity, signs and symptoms, diagnostic procedures performed, antibiotic prescription, allergies and referral or not were registered. The type of antibiotic course (short or long) and first-choice treatments were also taken into account.

Results

Of 176 physicians invited to participate, 110 (62.5%) included 658 women with lower UTI. Urine dipstick was performed in 550 cases (83.6%) and urine culture was requested in 235 women (35.7%), with criteria for culture in 49.6% and without criteria in 32.8%. Antibiotic treatment was administered in 634 cases (96.4%). Short courses were given to 385 women (60.7%) and 75 of those with complicated UTI were treated with long courses (66.4%). First-choice antibiotics were administered as empiric treatment in only 92 women with uncomplicated UTI (17.7%).

Conclusions

These results highlight the poor adherence of GPs to the current recommendations of clinical practice guidelines with a high number of inappropriate urine cultures requested and a low utilization of first-choice antibiotics.

### Management of kidney transplant recipients for primary care practitioners [^112WMXRF]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common complication among kidney transplant recipients, often leading to serious consequences. UTIs have been linked to bacteremia, acute T cell-mediated rejection, impaired graft function, allograft loss, hospitalization, or mortality, particularly when recurrent or severe sepsis occurs. While UTIs can manifest at any post-transplant stage, they are most common within the first year. Female recipients, older age, history of UTIs pre-transplant, vesicoureteral reflux, catheterization, stent placement, deceased-donor transplants, and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are established risk factors. Diagnosis involves urine dipstick, microscopy, and culture, with additional blood cultures for suspected complicated cases. Criteria include evidence of inflammation, pyuria, and a bacterial count exceeding 10³ colony-forming units per milliliter for acute simple cystitis, albeit these criteria are not absolute. Imaging, including ultrasound and CT scans, is crucial for assessing structural abnormalities, especially in recurrent cases and patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Distinguishing simple versus complex UTIs is essential (Table 4).

Table 4
Distinguishing simple vs. complicated UTI in kidney transplant recipients

Treatment is primarily tailored to available sensitivities on urine culture, while empiric therapy for simple cystitis in outpatient settings includes an oral fluoroquinolone, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or an oral third-generation cephalosporin for a treatment duration of 7–10 days, with subsequent tailoring of antibiotics guided by speciation and sensitivities. In cases of pyelonephritis or complex or complicated UTI, can often require inpatient admission for intravenous antibiotics with a course spanning 14–21 days guided by susceptibility data. Duration of therapy is usually longer in comparison to similar infections in the general population. Treatment extension may be necessary until sufficient drainage of any abscesses, if present, has been achieved. Recurrent UTIs (two or more episodes of UTI in six months, or three or more episodes of UTI in one year) may necessitate a referral to a transplant infection disease specialist for consideration of prophylactic/suppression therapy.

### Cross-sectional imaging of complicated urinary infections affecting the lower tract and male genital organs [^1157GpzH]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical overview of urinary tract infections

The commonest conditions predisposing patients to either acquiring infection or experiencing a more severe outcome are listed in Table 1, categorised with the mnemonic RENUC.

Table 1
Risk factors for acquiring urinary tract infection, developing complications, and/or failing treatment (mnemonic RENUC) [Adapted from Ref.]

C-UTIs may or may not cause symptoms. Manifestations of active infection often overlap with pre-existing chronic complaints secondary to the underlying lower urinary tract dysfunction. The severity of UTI is graded clinically as follows: a) asymptomatic; b) causing local symptoms such as dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency, supra- or retropubic pain or bladder tenderness; c) causing general symptoms including fever, flank pain, nausea and vomiting; d) systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS); and e) circulatory and organ failure. The SIRS includes fever or hypothermia, leukocytosis or leukopenia, tachycardia and tachypnoea, and represents the first step to multi-organ failure. Urosepsis is defined by the presence of UTI plus SIRS, and warrants immediate bacteriological and imaging investigation to allow for timely treatment. Although associated with a better prognosis than other forms of sepsis, urosepsis remains a critical situation, with a 20–40% fatality rate, particularly in the elderly and immunocompromised. Mortality is considerably increased in severe sepsis (with symptoms of organ dysfunction) and septic shock (with persistent hypotension).

### Urologic imaging: infections and inflammation [^111Wh21Z]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Urinary infections are common. Typically, infections of the upper and lower urinary tract do not require imaging. However, in the presence of confirmed or suspected complicated urinary tract infections, imaging to assess for underlying causes and complications is required. Computed tomography imaging is useful in identifying predisposing structural abnormalities of the urinary tracts and complications of urologic infection. Ultrasonography can be used to identify hydronephrosis and may be used to guide percutaneous intervention. Recurrent chronic infections can lead to end organ damage or chronic granulomatous processes. Rarely, systemic inflammatory disorders can involve the upper and lower urinary tracts.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline strength of evidence framework states that the AUA employs a three-tiered strength of evidence system and categorizes body of evidence strength as Grade A, Grade B, or Grade C. High certainty by GRADE translates to AUA A-category strength of evidence, moderate to B, and both low and very low to C. By definition, Grade A evidence is evidence about which the Panel has a high level of certainty, Grade B evidence is evidence about which the Panel has a moderate level of certainty, and Grade C evidence is evidence about which the Panel has a low level of certainty. Table definitions specify for high certainty that one is very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect; for moderate certainty that one is moderately confident in the effect estimate and that the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different; for low certainty that confidence in the effect estimate is limited and that the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect; and for very low certainty that there is very little confidence in the effect estimate and that the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

### Uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1142cqa9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) present a significant problem for women and a challenge for the doctors who care for them. The diagnosis of uncomplicated UTI, which usually is not challenging, can be achieved best by a thorough assessment of patient symptoms with or without the addition of a urine dipstick test. Treatment should be based on the most recent Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines, taking into account resistance patterns in the local community. The patient who suffers from recurrent UTIs can be treated safely and effectively with continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, postcoital therapy, or self-initiated treatment.

We question the reliability of the vague symptoms that most commonly define catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) and encourage further examination of whether the current CAUTI definition reflects a true infection. While diagnosing CAUTI using the current surveillance definition, physicians may be missing a number of nonurinary etiologies for fever, prematurely diagnosing urinary tract infection, and prescribing unnecessary antibiotics. We believe it is time to reconsider the quality metric of CAUTI. By doing so, we can improve antibiotic use and quality of patient care.

A Panel of International Experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) to update the 1999 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection Guidelines by the IDSA. Co-sponsoring organizations include the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Urological Association, Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases-Canada, and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine. The focus of this work is treatment of women with acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis, diagnoses limited in these guidelines to premenopausal, non-pregnant women with no known urological abnormalities or co-morbidities. The issues of in vitro resistance prevalence and the ecological adverse effects of antimicrobial therapy (collateral damage) were considered as important factors in making optimal treatment choices and thus are reflected in the rankings of recommendations.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113C4q31]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — definition and diagnostic criteria emphasize that this Guideline supports the most commonly used definition of two episodes of acute bacterial cystitis within a six-month period sometime within the preceding year, and any patient experiencing episodes of symptomatic acute cystitis after previous resolution of similar symptoms meets the criteria for rUTI. Strong evidence suggests that the diagnosis of acute bacterial cystitis should include the combination of acute-onset symptoms referable to the urinary tract, urinary inflammation on microscopic urinalysis (pyuria), and laboratory confirmation of significant bacteriuria, with Table 1 detailing components such as acute-onset symptoms including dysuria with increased urgency and frequency, hematuria, and new or worsening incontinence; urinary tract inflammation defined as pyuria ≥ 5 WBC/high power field (hpf) on microscopic urinalysis; and detection of a bacterial uropathogen. Without symptoms, bacteriuria of any magnitude is considered asymptomatic bacteriuria, and patients who recur rapidly within two weeks of initial treatment or who display bacterial persistence without symptom resolution may require imaging, cystoscopy, or other further investigation for bacterial reservoirs.

Although CAUTI rates decreased after the definition was changed, rates of related measures remained relatively stagnant, which indicates that longitudinal measurements of CAUTI may be misleading and that the change in definition did not itself impact care.

### Defining urinary tract infection in the critically ill child [^112VmRPn]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To define urinary tract infections in critically ill children in the intensive care unit setting for the purpose of surveillance of infection, enrollment of children in sepsis trials, and for trials of therapy and prevention.

Design

Summary of the literature with review and consensus by experts in the field.

Results

A variety of definitions, only some of which have been validated for use in children, were identified. The Centers for Disease Control criteria for the definition of nosocomial infection have been used to establish surveillance data for inter-institutional comparison. Validated definitions for the febrile child were identified. Using the known characteristics of symptoms, signs, and laboratory criteria for urinary tract infections, definitions for definite, possible, and probable urinary tract infection were derived.

Conclusions

Definitions for definite, probable, and possible urinary tract infection were achieved by consensus that can be used for surveillance and enrolment in sepsis trials. Future research should determine the utility of these definitions in the critically ill child and adapt them accordingly.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections in pediatrics and adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^1122dnZP]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches.

Findings

A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

### The clinical and imaging presentation of acute "non complicated" pyelonephritis: a new profile for an ancient disease [^116cDn65]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

The second definition is clinical only. Under the pressure of cost constraints, most Authors in the last decade have preferred (at least in adults) a clinical definition based on a classic tetrad of high fever, costovertebral angle tenderness, signs or symptoms of lower urinary tract infection and positive urinary cultures. This approach has the advantage of simplicity and lower costs but is unable to discriminate between the different forms of upper urinary tract infections (upper UTI).

The therapy of upper urinary tract infections is likewise controversial, possibly because of the different prevalence of severe parenchymal lesions in the different series. General agreement is reached only on the potential danger of kidney abscesses, requiring hospitalization and long-term antibiotic treatment.

In this context, there are at least two good reasons to reconsider acute pyelonephritis one century after the pivotal description by Tiemlich and a decade after the K-DOQI re-definition of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The first is the re-definition by the K-DOQI guidelines of CKD as any persistent alteration of the morphology of the kidneys or of kidney function. Thus kidney scars define the presence of CKD, suggesting that the therapeutic goals should include their avoidance, along with the prevention of sepsis and renal abscesses.

The second reason regards the impressive improvements of imaging in kidney infections, allowing the identification of small lesions and the distinction between healing, fibrotic and edematous (presumably active) infectious foci. However, despite the improvement in diagnostic tools, very few recent studies have investigated the relationship between clinical and imaging presentation in adults. Our previous studies suggested a relationship between the presence of renal abscesses at diagnosis and the development of kidney scars. They also indicated, in a cohort of cases referred to the Emergency Room, that only imaging data could distinguish between upper urinary tract infections with and without parenchymal involvement.

The aim of the present prospective study (June 2005-December 2009) was to analyze the clinical and imaging presentation of all patients hospitalized in our setting, in which diagnosis of APN was made according to imaging criteria.

Our goal was to test the relationship between the clinical-laboratory data at presentation and the imaging data. We reasoned that a strong correlation would allow a simpler, more rapid identification of the cases with the severest kidney involvement (abscessed and/or multiple lesions), requiring hospitalization and long-term therapy, while the lack of correlation would support the wide use of imaging techniques.

### Urinary tract infections: core curriculum 2024 [^1137rWfo]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are some of the most commonly encountered infections in clinical practice. Accurate diagnosis and evidence-based treatment of UTIs will lead to better clinical care for many patients and limit unnecessary antibiotic use. Urinalysis and urine cultures are helpful tools in the diagnosis of UTIs; however, it is important to recognize their limitations. Differentiating between asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and true UTI is important because antibiotics are unnecessary in most nonpregnant patients with ASB and can even potentially cause harm if prescribed. Choice and duration of antibiotics varies across the spectrum of UTI syndromes such as acute uncomplicated cystitis, pyelonephritis, prostatitis, and catheter-associated UTIs. The treatment approach also depends on patients' degree of immunosuppression and their genitourinary anatomy. Therefore, patients with urological obstruction or kidney transplants may require a specialized and multidisciplinary management approach. For individuals prone to frequent UTIs, some preventative measures can be utilized, yet there is often not a "one size fits all" approach.

### The scientific evidence for a potential link between confusion and urinary tract infection in the elderly is still confusing-a systematic literature review [^114Erpxa]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

It is well documented that lower urinary tract infection (UTI) should only be diagnosed when there are new onset localising genitourinary signs and symptoms and a positive urine culture result. However, despite new onset or worsening of confusion being a non-specific symptom, it continues to be the most common reason for suspecting a lower UTI in elderly patients, often leading to antibiotic treatment. The diagnosis of UTI is further complicated by the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, particularly in nursing home residents, varying between 25 and 50% for women and 15–40% for men, without an indwelling urinary catheter. While urine cultures can guide the choice of antibiotic, their poor positive predictive value means a positive culture alone should not warrant initiation of antibiotics. Additionally, evidence suggests patients with confusion and dementia are more likely to be continuously bacteriuric. Due to all of these confounding factors, new onset or worsening of non-specific symptoms in residents is one of the major diagnostic challenges in caring for the elderly.

Subsequently, many different consensus based criteria to enable appropriate diagnosis of UTI have been devised, most notably the revised Mcgeer and updated Loeb criteria. Despite the difficulty of diagnosing UTI, there is sound evidence that elderly residents with symptomatic lower UTI should receive antibiotic treatment and elderly residents with asymptomatic bacteriuria should not. Although inappropriate antibiotic use results in those few residents suffering from a lower UTI to be treated promptly, it leads to significant overdiagnosis of UTI and potentially harmful outcomes through misdiagnosis. With many residents receiving unnecessary antibiotics with possible adverse reactions, and the ever-increasing rates of antibiotic resistance, it is evident that inappropriate antibiotic use in this population must be reduced.

A previous literature review conducted by Balogun et al. exclusively reviewed the association between symptomatic UTI and delirium in the elderly in five publications. It concluded that there may be an association between symptomatic UTI and delirium; however, some methodological flaws may have led to biased results. It was limited by only using the term delirium and excluding terms like confusion, resulting in many publications potentially being excluded. In addition, Balogun et al. only searched the Medline database potentially missing important publications.

UTI is a broad diagnosis encompassing infections arising from all levels of the urinary tract, ranging in severity from acute cystitis to acute pyelonephritis. This systematic review aims to review the evidence for the association between acute cystitis or bacteriuria and confusion in the elderly in all care settings.

### Febrile urinary tract infection in the emergency room [^116oRwnF]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the recent advances in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to adults presenting with febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in the emergency department (ED).

Recent Findings

Recent research suggests overdiagnosis and therefore overtreatment of UTI in the ED, especially in the elderly. Antimicrobial pretreatment, an indwelling catheter, and malignancy are independent risk factors for bacteremia with uropathogens that cannot be cultured from urine. A simple clinical prediction rule can predict clinically relevant radiologic findings in patients with invasive UTI. Procalcitonin is a marker for bacteremia; pro-adrenomedullin predicts a complicated course and 30-day mortality in complicated UTI. Several reports have identified the risk factors for resistant uropathogens in community-acquired febrile UTI. Adherence to the guidelines and early culture-guided intravenous-to-oral switch reduces the length of hospitalization.

Summary

An effective strategy is needed to improve the diagnosis of UTIs in acute care. Further research regarding biomarker-guided triage might improve the management of patients with febrile UTI. Future efforts should be directed toward the improvement of adherence to UTI treatment guidelines.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection in hospitalized older people [^1131y89g]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection (UTI) in hospitalized older people with clinical criteria and therapeutic guidelines.

Design

A retrospective case series of emergency hospital admissions collected over an 18-month period.

Setting

An acute general hospital in northwest England.

Participants

Two hundred sixty-five patients aged 75 and older with a diagnosis of UTI at hospital discharge.

Measurements

Data relating to age, sex, presenting complaint, admission and discharge destinations, background comorbidities and medications, investigations performed, treatment given, length of stay, and complications were obtained using chart review.

Results

Of the 265 patients (mean age 85.4) the overdiagnosis of UTI was common, with 43.4% of patients not meeting criteria. Only 32.1% of patients overall had any urinary tract symptoms (48.7% in the UTI group). Of the non-UTI group, 12 (10.4%) had urinary tract symptoms with a negative urine culture, 43 (37.4%) had asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), and 60 (52.2%) had neither urinary tract symptoms nor bacteriuria. Treatment given varied greatly. The mortality rate was 6.0%, and the average length of stay was 29.9 days (median 17.0, range 1–192). Complications were frequent, including Clostridium difficile diarrhea (8%), falls (4%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection (3%), and fracture (2%).

Conclusion

More-reliable criteria are needed to aid the diagnosis of UTI in hospitalized older people. Better adherence to clinical management guidelines may improve outcomes.

### Efficacy and safety of individualised versus standard 10-day antibiotic treatment in children with febrile urinary tract infection (INDI-UTI): a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial in Denmark [^112amWAz]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

The optimal antibiotic duration for febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in children remains uncertain. We aimed to assess whether individualised treatment was non-inferior to standard 10-day treatment in terms of recurrent UTI and superior in reducing overall antibiotic exposure.

Methods

INDI-UTI was a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial conducted at eight Danish hospitals. Children aged 3 months to 12 years who were febrile (≥ 38°C), within 24 h of treatment start, and with significant growth of uropathogenic bacteria were randomly assigned (1:1) using a web-based module with randomly permuted blocks to individualised or standard 10-day treatment. Main exclusion criteria included known urinary tract abnormalities, complicated medical history, bacteraemia, and elevated serum creatinine. The individualised group stopped treatment 3 days after adequate clinical improvement (ie, absence of fever, flank pain, and dysuria), with a minimum treatment duration of 4 days. The primary outcomes were recurrent UTI within 28 days after treatment cessation (non-inferiority margin 7.5 percentage points) and total antibiotic days within 28 days of treatment initiation (superiority assessment). No sample size calculation was performed for the assessment of total antibiotic days. Safety was assessed in all included patients. Main analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05301023.

Findings

Between March 28, 2022, and March 3, 2024, 694 patients were assessed for eligibility and 408 patients were randomly assigned to individualised (n = 205; median antibiotic duration 5.3 days [IQR 4.8 to 6.5]) or standard 10-day treatment (n = 203; 10.0 days [10.0 to 10.0]). Median age was 1.5 years (IQR 0.7 to 5.4), and there were 326 (80%) female and 82 (20%) male participants. Recurrent UTI within 28 days occurred in 23 (11%) of 205 patients in the individualised group and 12 (6%) of 203 patients in the standard 10-day group (difference 5.3 percentage points, one-sided 97.5% CI -∞ to 11.1, p non_inferiority = 0.24). Total antibiotic days within 28 days were 6.0 (IQR 5.3 to 7.5) in the individualised group and 10.0 (10.0 to 10.0) in the standard 10-day group (median difference -4.0 days [97.5% CI -4.5 to -3.7], p < 0.0001). The incidence rate of antibiotic-related adverse events within 28 days was 6.8 per 100 patient-days in the individualised group and 11.1 per 100 patient-days in the standard 10-day group (rate ratio 0.61 [95% CI 0.47 to 0.80], p = 0.0003). Serious adverse events occurred in 17 (8%) of 205 patients in the individualised group and 15 (7%) of 203 patients in the standard 10-day group (difference 0.9 percentage points [95% CI -4.6 to 6.5], p = 0.79).

Interpretation

Children with febrile UTI assigned to individualised treatment duration had an increased risk of recurrent UTI (by 5.3 percentage points) but reduced antibiotic use and fewer adverse event days within 28 days compared with those assigned to standard 10-day treatment. These findings highlight the potential of individualised treatment strategies to reduce antibiotic exposure and associated harms in most children with febrile UTI, supporting antimicrobial stewardship goals. Further research is needed to identify those requiring 10-day treatment to avoid compromising care for most children with febrile UTI who respond well to shorter durations.

Recommendation strength and interpretation using GRADE — All recommendations follow GRADE and are either strong or weak. Recommendations are strong when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences for a course of action, and they may also be strong when there is high-quality evidence of harm and benefits are uncertain (ie, low or very low quality). Table 2 provides the suggested interpretation of strong and weak recommendations for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policy makers: for strong recommendations, all or almost all individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, all or almost all individuals should receive the intervention, and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations with adherence usable as a quality criterion or performance indicator; for weak (conditional) recommendations, most individuals would probably want the suggested course of action but many would not, clinicians should recognize that fully informed individuals might reasonably choose different courses of action and a shared decision-making process is typically useful to align with values and preferences, and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

Section 2: Background on definitions of CAUTI

The clinical diagnosis of CAUTI is often a diagnosis of exclusion, making it difficult to have a standardized definition. At present, all of the available definitions have substantial limitations. We discuss the criteria, advantages, and limitations of different definitions used for CAUTI in Table 4.

The optimal definition for CAUTI used for surveillance and quality improvement is one that only captures true instances of symptomatic infection that would benefit from antimicrobial treatment. The NHSN CAUTI definition has been adopted nationally, but other definitions are also used for clinical care and administrative purposes. The NHSN CAUTI definition has been updated in 2015 with exclusion of yeast as a pathogen and increase in the urine-culture bacterial threshold to ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) to align with a clinical definition for symptomatic CAUTI.

Complicated Urinary Tract Infection and Pyelonephritis – Efficacy in Pediatric Patients

NOTE: Although effective in clinical trials, ciprofloxacin is not a drug of first choice in the pediatric population due to an increased incidence of adverse events compared to controls, including events related to joints and/or surrounding tissues.

Ciprofloxacin, administered I.V. and/or orally, was compared to a cephalosporin for treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and pyelonephritis in pediatric patients 1 to 17 years of age (mean age of 6 ± 4 years). The trial was conducted in the US, Canada, Argentina, Peru, Costa Rica, Mexico, South Africa, and Germany. The duration of therapy was 10 to 21 days (mean duration of treatment was 11 days with a range of 1 to 88 days). The primary objective of the study was to assess musculoskeletal and neurological safety.

Patients were evaluated for clinical success and bacteriological eradication of the baseline organism(s) with no new infection or superinfection at 5 to 9 days post-therapy (Test of Cure or TOC). The Per Protocol population had a causative organism(s) with protocol specified colony count(s) at baseline, no protocol violation, and no premature discontinuation or loss to follow-up (among other criteria).

The clinical success and bacteriologic eradication rates in the Per Protocol population were similar between ciprofloxacin and the comparator group as shown below.

* Patients with baseline pathogen(s) eradicated and no new infections or superinfections/total number of patients. There were 5.5% (6/211) ciprofloxacin and 9.5% (22/231) comparator patients with superinfections or new infections.

### Impact of urinary catheter on resistance patterns and clinical outcomes on complicated urinary tract infection [^117CE24G]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) corresponds to a heterogeneous entity characterized by urinary tract infection (UTI) manifestations and risk factors associated with urinary tract structural anomalies, presence of a catheter or devices in the urinary tract, and comorbidities such as diabetes, neoplasms, immune disorders or isolation of multiresistant germs. The UTI represents 1.8% of US hospitalizations with costs per hospitalization near to 10,000 dollars. Additionally, cUTI is associated with a high rate of therapeutic failure (26.6%) 4, hospital readmission around 9% 2 and 30-day mortality of 8.7%. cUTI is associated with elevated costs and high health services requirement; therefore, cUTI is a relevant entity for health systems.

In Colombia, there are descriptions of microbiologic isolations in community-acquired UTI and UTI associated with health care in users of vesical catheter. However, in both Colombia and Latin America, there is a lack of information on the clinical manifestations, complications and resistance patterns in patients with catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI) and its differences with non-catheter-associated cUTI (NC-cUTI).

The aim of this study is to describe the clinical and microbiologic characteristics, treatments and outcomes in patients with cUTI and to compare CAUTI vs NC-cUTI, in a reference university hospital in Colombia.

### Urinary tract infections in adults… [^1143JJsA]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Recurrent Cystitis in Young Women Up to 20 percent of young women with acute cystitis develop recurrent UTIs. During these recurrent episodes, the causative organism should be identified by urine culture and then documented to help differentiate between relapse and recurrence. Multiple infections caused by the same organism are, by definition, complicated UTIs and require longer courses of antibiotics and possibly further diagnostic tests. Complicated UTI A complicated UTI is one that occurs because of anatomic, functional or pharmacologic factors that predispose the patient to persistent infection, recurrent infection or treatment failure.

These factors include conditions often encountered in elderly men, such as enlargement of the prostate gland, blockages and other problems necessitating the placement of indwelling urinary devices, and the presence of bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics. Although antibiotic-susceptible. E. coli is responsible for more than 80 percent of uncomplicated UTIs, it accounts for fewer than one third of complicated cases. 1, 3 Clinically, the spectrum of complicated UTIs may range from cystitis to urosepsis with septic shock. Accurate urine culture and susceptibility information are necessary to best target and eradicate the pathogens in complicated UTIs. These infections are usually associated with high-count bacteriuria. Occasionally, lower quantitative counts may be encountered in patients who are undergoing diuresis or who are in renal failure. Patients with complicated UTIs require at least a 10- to 14-day course of therapy.

Follow-up urine cultures should be performed within 10 to 14 days after treatment to ensure that the uropathogen has been eradicated. Recent studies have shown that patients initially placed on parenteral therapy can be switched to oral therapy within 72 hours as long as they are clinically improving and able to tolerate the oral agent, and a regimen is available that covers the identified pathogen. 26 The diagnosis of catheter-associated urinary tract infection can be made when the urine culture shows 100 or more CFU per mL of urine from a catheterized patient. The microbiology of catheter-associated urinary tract infections includes. Symptomatic urinary tract infections complicate 1 to 2 percent of pregnancies, usually in women with persistent bacteriuria.

If the laboratory cannot clarify the culture count and cannot say for certain that a culture has at least 100, 000 CFU/ml, do not use that culture for NHSN UTI surveillance. Mixed flora No, this urine culture is not eligible for use in an NHSN UTI determination. The medical definition of flora is a group of organisms. Any type of mixed flora makes a positive urine culture ineligible for use to meet NHSN UTI criteria, because "mixed flora" implies that at least 2 organisms are present in addition to the identified organism. The urine culture does not meet the criteria for a positive urine culture with 2 organisms or less and cannot be used to meet the NHSN UTI criteria. Number of organisms in cultures Do not add multiple cultures together. More than 2 organisms in a single urine culture suggests the possibility of contamination of the specimen. The same is not true for separate urine cultures with less than 3 organisms in each.

In this example the first culture would be eligible for a UTI. If no UTI was associated with that urine culture, then the second urine culture could be considered for a UTI, since no previous UTI RIT was set and there were not more than 2 organisms in that urine culture. 40, 000–50, 000 CFU/ml Klebsiella oxytoca > 100, 000 CFU/ml Pseudomonas aeruginosa < 10, 000 CFU/ml Candida, not albicans No, the urine culture would be ineligible for use to meet NHSN UTI criteria, because there would be a total of three organisms present, including the candida. An excluded organism, such as candida, can be in a positive urine culture, however, there can only be one other organism present that has. The purpose of submitting a urine specimen for culture is to determine infection. The NHSN definitions currently account for contamination of urine specimens.

NSHN excludes specimens with culture results of more than two organisms for use in meeting UTI definitions. Neobladders and CAUTIs Yes. Patients who have neobladders are not excluded from CAUTI surveillance. NHSN surveillance definitions account for contamination. Urine cultures that result with > 2 eligible organisms, are not eligible for use to meet NHSN UTI criteria.
