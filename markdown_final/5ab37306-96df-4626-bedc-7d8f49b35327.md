## Question

how to screen for leukemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to screen for leukemia and what the correct approach should be, distinguishing true population screening from diagnostic workups and symptom-triggered evaluations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition of screening and whether any authoritative guidelines endorse it. Then, I should verify which populations warrant surveillance or early evaluation, including those with symptoms, high-risk features, or predisposition syndromes. Next, I will examine which initial tests are appropriate in each scenario, including CBC with differential and smear, and when to escalate to flow cytometry, molecular testing, and imaging. Finally, I should consider the limitations and harms of incidental detection and outline practical, guideline-based recommendations for primary care and specialty referral, while keeping in mind geographic and resource constraints.

> Let me first confirm the core definitions, because precision matters here. Screening, in population terms, means testing asymptomatic individuals to detect disease earlier, whereas diagnosis involves evaluating symptomatic patients or those with abnormal findings, and surveillance refers to scheduled monitoring in high-risk groups; none of the major guidelines endorse universal screening for leukemia, so I need to be careful not to overgeneralize routine CBCs as "screening" in healthy people [^115U9ZgD].

> Wait, let me verify the concept of "unintentional detection" with CBC. A CBC can reveal cytopenias, leukocytosis, blasts, or dysplasia that lead to leukemia diagnosis, but this is not a formal screening program; rather, it is opportunistic detection during care for other reasons, with both potential benefits and harms such as false positives, anxiety, and overtreatment, so I should frame it that way rather than as endorsed screening [^115U9ZgD].

> I need to check who actually warrants earlier evaluation or surveillance. Individuals with hereditary predisposition syndromes or pathogenic germline variants in genes like RUNX1, GATA2, FANCA, or TP53 should have periodic surveillance with CBC, bone marrow evaluation, and molecular testing rather than universal screening; children with hypodiploid ALL or other predisposition features may need intensive surveillance programs, and this is a different, risk-adapted pathway rather than population screening [^111UU2fe] [^1119QAVQ] [^111Myek8].

> Next, I should review when to suspect leukemia clinically and order a CBC with differential and smear. Red flags include unexplained cytopenias, leukocytosis, constitutional symptoms, organomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or laboratory features such as anemia and thrombocytopenia; primary care guidance supports obtaining a peripheral smear when WBC is markedly elevated, particularly with cytopenias or systemic signs, to look for blasts or dysplasia and guide hematology referral [^1113Q9nd] [^115FEDF8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. A CBC abnormality is not diagnostic by itself. If blasts are present, counts are abnormal, or smear is suspicious, I should confirm the next steps per hematology guidelines: comprehensive flow cytometric immunophenotyping to distinguish AML, ALL, and mixed-lineage disease, and bone marrow aspirate/biopsy with cytogenetics and molecular testing to establish diagnosis and risk. In ALL, diagnosis requires at least 20% marrow lymphoblasts, and in select cases with high circulating blasts, peripheral blood may substitute for marrow for initial molecular workup [^113tAegz] [^114EEmAQ] [^112kjH7N].

> I will now examine the molecular and cytogenetic testing that should accompany the initial workup, because treatment often hinges on it. For AML, I should ensure testing for ELN 2022 risk-defining mutations and structural variants, including FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, and core-binding factor abnormalities, using FISH, RT-PCR, and/or NGS panels. For ALL, I should test for BCR::ABL1 and other sentinel fusions, and for CML, I must detect BCR::ABL1 with methods that capture typical and atypical transcripts to avoid missed diagnoses. These tests should be prioritized and, when possible, expedited to inform initial therapy decisions [^116k74KE] [^113f6j8t] [^112y1XNm].

> But wait, what if the presentation suggests CML rather than acute leukemia. I should double-check that CML is often recognizable by a characteristic leukocytosis with left shift on CBC and differential, yet definitive diagnosis still requires demonstration of BCR::ABL1 by RT-PCR or FISH. Importantly, I need to ensure the assay detects atypical transcripts to avoid false negatives, and if cytogenetics/FISH are used first, I should still determine the transcript type before therapy to enable accurate MRD monitoring [^116tCU6H] [^112y1XNm].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In children and adolescents, pediatric-specific AML and ALL guidelines emphasize timely, comprehensive molecular and immunophenotypic diagnostics and attention to predisposition syndromes. In resource-limited settings, delays in diagnosis and limited access to advanced testing contribute to worse outcomes, so early recognition with basic labs and expedited referral become even more critical. And in patients with suspected APL, I should screen urgently for coagulopathy and avoid invasive procedures until corrected to mitigate bleeding risk [^111Kp7Dt] [^112SYLoG] [^112bRL3R].

> I should confirm the role of imaging and other supportive tests. Imaging is not for routine screening but is used selectively for staging or symptom-driven evaluation; for example, CT or PET/CT may be indicated when extramedullary disease is suspected, and head imaging or lumbar puncture is guided by neurologic symptoms or baseline CNS prophylaxis protocols in ALL; likewise, tumor lysis labs and infectious disease screening are part of initial workup rather than screening tools [^111sxydZ] [^115yAxUv].

> Hold on, I should verify the downstream use of MRD assessments, because they are often conflated with screening. MRD testing is for treatment response monitoring and risk adaptation after diagnosis, not for population screening; high-sensitivity flow cytometry, PCR, or NGS-based methods are recommended at defined timepoints in ALL and increasingly used in AML to refine prognosis and guide therapy, but they require baseline clone characterization and should be interpreted in specialized centers [^1149FwgM] [^115ddHLT] [^112mW3KG] [^113SXdwv] [^114EEmAQ] [^117RdR52].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and ensure my recommendations align with guidelines. There is no endorsed population screening for leukemia; instead, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in symptomatic patients or those with abnormal CBCs, pursue a prompt, guideline-concordant diagnostic workup with CBC/differential/smear, flow cytometry, marrow evaluation, cytogenetics, and molecular testing, and implement surveillance only for defined high-risk predisposition syndromes; this approach balances early detection benefits against the harms of overdiagnosis and ensures timely, accurate classification and therapy [^113tAegz] [^111UU2fe].

There is **no routine screening** for leukemia in asymptomatic people [^notfound]. Screening is only considered for high-risk groups with genetic predisposition syndromes (e.g. Fanconi anemia, Li-Fraumeni, RUNX1, GATA2) [^111UU2fe] using periodic CBCs and bone marrow exams [^111UU2fe]. For everyone else, diagnosis relies on **symptom-triggered testing** — CBC with differential, peripheral smear, and bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular testing [^113tAegz] [^116k74KE]. Early detection improves outcomes, but **population screening is not recommended** due to low prevalence and potential harms [^notfound].

---

## Current screening recommendations

- **General population**: No routine screening is recommended for leukemia in asymptomatic individuals [^notfound].

- **High-risk populations**: Screening is considered for individuals with known genetic predisposition syndromes, such as Fanconi anemia, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, RUNX1, GATA2 mutations, and others [^111UU2fe]. Annual surveillance with complete blood count (CBC), differential, and bone marrow aspirate/biopsy with cytogenetics is recommended for these high-risk individuals [^111UU2fe].

- **Pediatric populations**: Routine screening is not recommended for asymptomatic children. However, children with genetic predisposition syndromes or family history of leukemia may undergo periodic surveillance [^111UU2fe].

## Diagnostic methods for leukemia

When leukemia is suspected based on clinical presentation or laboratory abnormalities, **the following diagnostic methods are employed**:

| **Diagnostic method** | **Description** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| Complete blood count (CBC) with differential | Measures levels of white blood cells, red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets | Initial test to detect abnormal blood cell counts |
| Peripheral blood smear | Microscopic examination of blood cells | Identifies abnormal cell morphology, blasts, and dysplasia |
| Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy | Collection and examination of bone marrow samples | Definitive diagnosis, classification, and staging |
| Flow cytometry | Immunophenotyping of blood or bone marrow cells | Identifies cell surface markers to classify leukemia subtype |
| Cytogenetic analysis (karyotyping) | Chromosomal analysis of leukemic cells | Detects chromosomal abnormalities for prognosis and treatment planning |
| Molecular genetic testing (PCR, FISH, NGS) | Detection of specific genetic mutations and fusion genes | Guides targeted therapy and risk stratification |

---

## Clinical presentation prompting diagnostic evaluation

Leukemia often presents with **nonspecific symptoms**, including:

- Fatigue and weakness
- Frequent infections
- Easy bruising or bleeding
- Pale skin
- Unexplained weight loss
- Bone or joint pain
- Enlarged lymph nodes, liver, or spleen

These symptoms warrant **further evaluation** with laboratory tests and hematology referral [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and challenges of screening

- **Low prevalence**: Leukemia is relatively rare, making population screening inefficient and potentially harmful due to false positives [^notfound].

- **Potential harms**: Screening asymptomatic individuals may lead to unnecessary anxiety, invasive procedures, and overtreatment.

- **Resource limitations**: Screening programs require significant resources, infrastructure, and trained personnel, which may not be feasible in many settings [^112SYLoG].

---

## Impact of early detection on treatment outcomes

Early detection of leukemia **significantly improves treatment outcomes**, including higher remission rates, improved survival, and reduced treatment-related complications. However, given the lack of evidence supporting population screening, early detection primarily relies on clinical awareness and prompt diagnostic evaluation of symptomatic individuals [^116CWQdd].

---

## Ongoing research and emerging technologies

Research is ongoing to identify **novel biomarkers and genetic signatures** that could enable earlier detection of leukemia. Advances in genomic sequencing, liquid biopsy, and artificial intelligence may improve diagnostic accuracy and enable personalized treatment strategies. However, these technologies are not yet validated for routine screening.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no routine screening** for leukemia in asymptomatic individuals [^notfound]. Screening is reserved for high-risk populations with genetic predisposition syndromes. For the general population, early detection relies on clinical awareness, prompt evaluation of symptoms, and appropriate diagnostic testing. Continued research and advances in diagnostic technologies may improve early detection and treatment outcomes in the future.

It is also possible to screen for Ph-like ALL by searching directly for specific translocations and mutations. In a study conducted by the research group from the Munich Leukemia Laboratory in Germanyscreening by multiple FISH probes and targeted PCR (ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, PDGFRB along with quantitative PCR for CRLF2) successfully identified all patients who had a Ph-like gene expression profile according to the aforementioned 257-gene set. Another advantage of this method is the option of using quantitative PCR of the found driver mutation for MRD detection, although the negative predictive value of each aberration should be evaluated separately. Cooperative groups and leading centers around the world use different methods for the identification of Ph-like ALL. In Europe, some groups employ multiplex PCR or commercially available targeted RNA sequencing kits, while others use a FISH panel for primary screening. In the USA, the Children's Oncology Group (COG) uses LDA as the screening approach. Comprehensive RNA sequencing is conducted only in specific centers such as the St. Jude Medical Center.

The variability of the methods available makes the diagnosis of a Ph-like expression signature in a patient with no defined genetic alteration a challenge. Figure 1 presents a suggested clinical screening algorithm for Ph-like ALL to be applied outside of clinical trials.

Introduction

Myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias encompass many clinically independent entities, some with unique genetic features and optimized treatment approaches. The accurate assignment of patients to stratified risk groups can be a difficult, expensive and slow process, requiring intensive laboratory studies including morphology, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping, cytogenetics and molecular diagnostics. One of the most important laboratory features used to categorize leukemia cases according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2008 classification is the presence of specific balanced chromosomal translocations that in many cases determine therapy. For example, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with t(1;19) responds poorly to conventional antimetabolite-based treatment but has cure rates approaching 80% when treated with more intensive therapies. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the genetic alterations inv(16) and t(8;21) are associated with a favorable prognosis, good response to chemotherapy and relatively long complete remission. In some cases, the presence of a single alteration dictates the use of a specific drug such as all-trans-retinoic acid for t(15;17) positive acute promyelocytic leukemia or an ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor for t(9;22) positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).

The advent of targeted therapy underscores the need for rapid and accurate genetic diagnostic methods. Major disease-defining, diagnosis-relevant and therapy-determining data may be provided by molecular methods. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is widely used clinically for detecting chromosome translocations at the DNA level. However, it can be labor-intensive, is not amenable to multiplexing and can lack sufficient resolution to detect or differentiate certain genetic alterations. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) has been shown to be a sensitive tool for the detection of chimeric transcripts resulting from recurrent chromosome translocations. RT-PCR analysis has numerous advantages over conventional cytogenetics, including shorter turn-around time, no requirement for dividing cells, detection of translocations that may be missed by conventional cytogenetics (cryptic translocations) and identification of specific markers for subsequent monitoring of minimal residual disease with sensitive molecular methods. As there are many distinct genetic alterations characteristic of various leukemia subtypes, it is difficult or impractical to carry out a series of single RT-PCR detection assays, especially when the total amount of RNA is limiting.

### Acute myeloid leukemia, version 3.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116k74KE]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Acute myeloid leukemia — molecular risk stratification and testing logistics emphasize that several gene mutations have prognostic and therapeutic implications, and comprehensive testing is recommended and should be operationalized promptly. In addition, several gene mutations are associated with specific prognoses in a subset of patients (category 2A) and may guide treatment decisions (category 2B). Molecular analyses for lesions that allow risk stratification per ELN 2022 are recommended for all patients at diagnosis. All patients should be tested for mutations, and multiplex gene panels and targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis are recommended for the ongoing management of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in various phases of treatment. Additional molecular and genetic testing for heritable hematologic malignancy predisposition may be considered in a subset of patients. To appropriately stratify therapy options, test results of molecular and cytogenetic analyses of immediately actionable genes or chromosomal abnormalities should be expedited. Adequate marrow should be available at the time of diagnosis or relapse for molecular studies as per the institutional practice, and local pathologists should be consulted to optimize collection and preservation. If molecular testing is not available at the patient's treatment center, evaluation at an outside reference laboratory or transfer to another institution is recommended prior to performing the bone marrow (BM) evaluation; circulating leukemic blasts from peripheral blood may alternatively be used to detect molecular abnormalities.

### Global, regional, and national burden of childhood leukemia from 1990 to 2021 [^112SYLoG]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

LMICs bear the highest leukemia burden. In 2021, these countries reported the highest number of childhood leukemia cases, with low SDI regions showing an upward trend. This is closely tied to the lack of comprehensive healthcare systems, limited diagnostic capabilities, and insufficient treatment options. Strengthening healthcare infrastructure in LMICs, investing in medical equipment, training healthcare professionals, and enhancing diagnostic and treatment capacities are urgently needed. The shortage of skilled healthcare workers, advanced medical equipment, and resources in low-income regions often leads to delayed diagnoses, missed treatment opportunities, and high mortality rates, resulting in low survival rates for leukemia patients. Promoting early screening, preventive measures, and healthy lifestyles, as well as focusing on high-risk populations for early detection, are essential to reduce leukemia incidence. In contrast, high-income countries (high SDI) have demonstrated clear advantages in leukemia prevention and control, with decreasing mortality rates maintained at lower levels. In economically developed regions, advanced medical technologies and abundant resources ensure early and accurate disease detection and diagnosis. By contrast, sustaining treatment regimens in underprivileged areas proves particularly challenging, resulting in inadequate monitoring of therapeutic outcomes and toxicities, thereby elevating patient mortality risks.

### Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia [^113t9hiX]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a haematological malignancy characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of immature lymphoid cells. Over past decades, significant progress has been made in understanding the biology of ALL, resulting in remarkable improvements in its diagnosis, treatment and monitoring. Since the advent of chemotherapy, ALL has been the platform to test for innovative approaches applicable to cancer in general. For example, the advent of omics medicine has led to a deeper understanding of the molecular and genetic features that underpin ALL. Innovations in genomic profiling techniques have identified specific genetic alterations and mutations that drive ALL, inspiring new therapies. Targeted agents, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapies, have shown promising results in subgroups of patients while minimizing adverse effects. Furthermore, the development of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy represents a breakthrough in ALL treatment, resulting in remarkable responses and potential long-term remissions. Advances are not limited to treatment modalities alone. Measurable residual disease monitoring and ex vivo drug response profiling screening have provided earlier detection of disease relapse and identification of exceptional responders, enabling clinicians to adjust treatment strategies for individual patients. Decades of supportive and prophylactic care have improved the management of treatment-related complications, enhancing the quality of life for patients with ALL.

Abridged materials and methods

Cell culture and patient samples

All leukemia cell lines (Nomo-1, THP-1, MonoMac-1, Molm13, SHI1, ML2, and KG-1a) were grown in recommended media with 10% FBS at 37 o C in 5% CO 2 and 90% humidity. Patient leukemia samples were grown in serum-free media with growth factors and SR1/UM171 to block differentiation as previously described. Human model leukemias were generated as previously described. For this, summarizing the full details in supplemental methods, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells were enriched from pooled CB samples using EasySep human CD34 + positive selection kits (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC). Following lenti/retroviral transduction to introduce human oncogenic gene fusions (e.g. KMT2A::MLLT3/4, NUP98::KDM5A, CBFA2T3::GLIS2) cells injected into immune-compromised mice (NSG/NSG-SGM3) and human leukemia cells were harvested when mice became ill.

Ethics approval and consent to participate

All pediatric and adult AML patient samples and additional clinical information used in this study were collected by the Banque de cellules leucémiques du Québec (BCLQ) with informed consent for all patients and project approval from the Research Ethics Boards of CHU Ste-Justine, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Université de Montréal, the LTBSR of the OSUCCC, and from the Children's Oncology Group (COG) in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

High throughput screening and RNA-seq

Leukemia and normal cells (400–5000 cells/well depending on growth rate) were screened for viability using CellTiter-Glo (Promega) 5 days after being treated using a single dose (1–2uM depending on compound source) of each of the 11,142 compounds used. Data for each sample were normalized using cells with only DMSO added present on each plate and DMSO-only averages were also used for quality control to remove samples with high variation. Just prior to screening, cells were collected from each samples and used for RNA-seq. Samples were sequenced on a NextSeq500 high-output flow cell and the resulting data was filtered for quality and mapped to the human genome (GRCh38) as previously described.

### Initial diagnostic workup of acute leukemia: guideline from the college of American pathologists and the American Society of Hematology [^116xaQyf]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

CAP/ASH initial diagnostic workup of acute leukemia — key questions and evidence review: The expert panel met 23 times through teleconference webinars from June 8, 2011 through August 16, 2016, conducted additional work via electronic mail, and met in person July 19, 2013 and again September 15, 2015. Prior to the first in-person meeting, key questions guiding the literature search addressed what clinical and laboratory information should be available during the initial diagnostic evaluation, what specimens and sample types should be evaluated, at diagnosis what tests are required for all patients, which tests should be performed only on a subset of patients including in response to results of initial tests and morphology, where laboratory testing should be performed, and how test results and the diagnosis should be correlated and reported. All expert panelists participated in the systematic evidence review (SER) including title-abstract screening, full-text review, and data extraction of high-level studies (i.e., randomized control trials, systematic reviews, and clinical practice guidelines), with a dual review for each study and phase and co-chair adjudication of all conflicts. Because the high-level studies alone and initial extraction points were not sufficient to draft guideline statements, the panel developed additional extraction points, included lower-level study designs, and CAP staff and two contracted methodologists performed a second round of data extraction for the high-level studies and 150 cohort studies; the expert panel co-chairs audited for accuracy and completeness, and a total of 119 studies comprised the final body of studies included in the SER.

### Initial diagnostic workup of acute leukemia: guideline from the college of American pathologists and the American Society of Hematology [^111aumHz]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, more specifically with respect to biopsy and histopathology, ASH/CAP 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain sufficient samples and obtain conventional cytogenetic analysis (karyotype), appropriate molecular genetic and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization testing, and flow cytometric immunophenotyping in addition to morphologic assessment (blood and bone marrow). Ensure that the flow cytometry panel is sufficient to distinguish acute myeloid leukemia (including acute promyelocytic leukemia), T-cell ALL (including early T-cell precursor leukemias), B-cell precursor ALL, and acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage in all patients diagnosed with acute leukemia, and to allow subsequent detection of minimal residual disease. Recognize that molecular genetic and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization testing does not replace conventional cytogenetic analysis.

### A novel approach for the identification of efficient combination therapies in primary human acute myeloid leukemia specimens [^111Q5Yhv]. Blood Cancer Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Appropriate culture methods for the interrogation of primary leukemic samples were hitherto lacking and current assays for compound screening are not adapted for large-scale investigation of synergistic combinations. In this study, we report a novel approach that efficiently distills synthetic lethal interactions between small molecules active on primary human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) specimens. In single-dose experiments and under culture conditions preserving leukemia stem cell activity, our strategy considerably reduces the number of tests needed for the identification of promising compound combinations. Initially conducted with a selected library of 5000 small molecules and 20 primary AML specimens, it reveals 5 broad classes of sensitized therapeutic target pathways along with their synergistic patient-specific fingerprints. This novel method opens new avenues for the development of AML personalized therapeutics and may be generalized to other tumor types, for which in vitro cancer stem cell cultures have been developed.

### Proposal for the clinical detection and management of patients and their family members with familial myelodysplastic syndrome / acute leukemia predisposition syndromes [^114XESnK]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2013). Low credibility.

As with most genetic cancer predisposition syndromes, inherited susceptibility to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute leukemia (AL) is likely to be more common than previously appreciated. As next-generation sequencing technologies become integrated into clinical practice, we anticipate that the number of cases of familial MDS/AL identified will increase. Although the existence of syndromes predisposing to MDS/AL has been known for some time, clinical guidelines for the screening and management of suspected or confirmed cases do not exist. Based on our collective experience caring for families with these syndromes, we propose recommendations for genetic counseling, testing, and clinical management. We welcome discussion about these proposals and hope that they will catalyze an ongoing dialog leading to optimal medical and psychosocial care for these patients.

### Genomic profiling for clinical decision making in myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia [^113muCGG]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias derive from the clonal expansion of hematopoietic cells driven by somatic gene mutations. Although assessment of morphology plays a crucial role in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with these malignancies, genomic characterization has become increasingly important for accurate diagnosis, risk assessment, and therapeutic decision making. Conventional cytogenetics, a comprehensive and unbiased method for assessing chromosomal abnormalities, has been the mainstay of genomic testing over the past several decades and remains relevant today. However, more recent advances in sequencing technology have increased our ability to detect somatic mutations through the use of targeted gene panels, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, and whole-transcriptome sequencing or RNA sequencing. In patients with myeloid neoplasms, whole-genome sequencing represents a potential replacement for both conventional cytogenetic and sequencing approaches, providing rapid and accurate comprehensive genomic profiling. DNA sequencing methods are used not only for detecting somatically acquired gene mutations but also for identifying germline gene mutations associated with inherited predisposition to hematologic neoplasms. The 2022 International Consensus Classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias makes extensive use of genomic data. The aim of this report is to help physicians and laboratorians implement genomic testing for diagnosis, risk stratification, and clinical decision making and illustrates the potential of genomic profiling for enabling personalized medicine in patients with hematologic neoplasms.

### Initial diagnostic workup of acute leukemia: guideline from the college of American pathologists and the American Society of Hematology [^1156NHts]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Context

- A complete diagnosis of acute leukemia requires knowledge of clinical information combined with morphologic evaluation, immunophenotyping and karyotype analysis, and often, molecular genetic testing. Although many aspects of the workup for acute leukemia are well accepted, few guidelines have addressed the different aspects of the diagnostic evaluation of samples from patients suspected to have acute leukemia.

Objective

- To develop a guideline for treating physicians and pathologists involved in the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of new acute leukemia samples, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage.

Design

- The College of American Pathologists and the American Society of Hematology convened a panel of experts in hematology and hematopathology to develop recommendations. A systematic evidence review was conducted to address 6 key questions. Recommendations were derived from strength of evidence, feedback received during the public comment period, and expert panel consensus.

Results

- Twenty-seven guideline statements were established, which ranged from recommendations on what clinical and laboratory information should be available as part of the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of acute leukemia samples to what types of testing should be performed routinely, with recommendations on where such testing should be performed and how the results should be reported.

Conclusions

- The guideline provides a framework for the multiple steps, including laboratory testing, in the evaluation of acute leukemia samples. Some aspects of the guideline, especially molecular genetic testing in acute leukemia, are rapidly changing with new supportive literature, which will require on-going updates for the guideline to remain relevant.

### EuroFlow: resetting leukemia and lymphoma immunophenotyping. basis for companion diagnostics and personalized medicine [^112SmTNG]. Leukemia (2012). Low credibility.

What are the current achievements of the EuroFlow Consortium?

After a period of 5 years, the EuroFlow Consortium has reached most of its initial goals, a large part of the results obtained being presented in this issue of the Leukemia journal. In this period, 8-color antibody protocols for the diagnosis and classification of hematological malignancies have been developed. Such protocols consist of a sequential combination of (i) screening tubes adapted to address distinct clinical questions and specific medical indications of immunophenotyping and (ii) multi-tube panels for the diagnosis and classification per disease category. The development of the new 8-color protocols was paralleled by a set of standard operating procedures (SOP)to assure full technical standardization of multicolor flow cytometry based on 3-laser flow cytometry instruments, selection of appropriate fluorochromes, standardization of instrument settings and laboratory protocols, and detailed testing and comparison of antibody clones and fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies from multiple companies. For this purpose, development and implementation of new software tools for fast and easy handling of large data files, combining multiple tubes and mapping of leukemia samples against templates of normal and pathological reference samples for fast multidimensional pattern recognition, appeared to be crucial. Finally, new antibody clones were developed against carefully selected epitopes of proteins involved in chromosomal translocations, to be used in immunobead assays for detection of the most frequent fusion proteins in acute leukemias and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).

### Discovery of putative tumor suppressors from CRISPR screens reveals rewired lipid metabolism in acute myeloid leukemia cells [^11483XNb]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

CRISPR perturbations in human cells can result in loss-of-function alleles that increase as well as a decrease in vitro proliferation rates; faster proliferation is an extreme rarity in yeast knockouts. These fast-growers can complicate predictions of genetic interactionand confound pooled chemoresistance screens. However, there is no broadly accepted method of identifying these genes from CRISPR screens.

In this work, we describe the development of a method to systematically classify genes whose knockout provides a proliferation advantage in vitro. We observe that genes that confer proliferation advantage are typically tumor suppressor genes and that they show the same modularity and functional coherence as context-dependent essential genes. Moreover, we discover a module that includes several components of the glycerolipid biosynthesis pathway that slows cell proliferation in a subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. We show a rewired genetic interaction network using enCas12a multiplex screening, and find strong genetic interactions corroborated by clinical survival data. A putative tumor-suppressive role for glycerolipid biosynthesis is noteworthy considering this process is thought to be required to generate biomass for tumor cell growth, and inhibitors targeting this pathway are currently in clinical trials.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute lymphoblastic leukemia - NCCN, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, NCCN 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma subtypes include T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, not otherwise specified, cortical type, mature type, and early T-cell precursor lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Note that early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia typically lacks expression of CD5, CD8, and CD1a and expresses one or more myeloid/stem cell markers. The mature subtype often also lacks expression of CD1a and frequently is accompanied by T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 11 or T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 12 rearrangement.

### The unintentional detection of leukemias with complete blood count [^115U9ZgD]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The complete blood count (CBC) is the most requested medical test in the world and it is used for various clinical purposes. Due to its characteristic of quantifying red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, it assesses bone marrow function, where most leukemias originate. Therefore, the test has the potential to unintentionally detect different types of leukemia. Screening refers to the application of a diagnostic test to a population without signs or symptoms of the disease. Although the request of a CBC in clinical practice does not necessarily constitute screening, the premise that early detection allows more effective treatment, preventing deaths and allowing patients to live longer, may also apply to leukemias. In this article, leukemias and the CBC are used as a didactic platform to explain some aspects regarding potential benefits, harms, and limitations of incidental detection of diseases in asymptomatic individuals and its implications for the primary care clinician.

Ensure that the flow cytometry panel is sufficient to distinguish AML (including APL), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (including early T-cell precursor leukemias), B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage in all patients diagnosed with acute leukemia, and to allow subsequent detection of minimal residual disease. Recognize that molecular genetic and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization testing does not replace conventional cytogenetic analysis.

### Comparative small molecule screening of primary human acute leukemias, engineered human leukemia and leukemia cell lines [^117CCec8]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Despite significant efforts to address the unmet medical need, the identification of novel targeted anti-leukemic therapeutic strategies remains extremely challenging. In parallel to efforts to carefully dissect the leukemia subtype-specific genetic dependencies, high-throughput screening offers the possibility of uncovering novel vulnerabilities. However, the impact of using leukemia cells from different sources for drug screening has not been carefully examined. In this study, we address this question using a standardized high-throughput drug screen to identify novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in various AML cell sources. These include established AML cell lines that are typically genetically unstable and exhibit divergent growth behaviours, primary leukemia patient samples, and genetically reproducible human de novo-generated models of pediatric leukemias. Importantly, these models enabled a comparison with analogous and rare AML patient samples which are often limited in cell numbers available and challenging to grow in vitro. The results of our screen and dose-response analysis identified a large number of compounds with anti-leukemic activity, that are active on leukemic stem cell phenotypes (Supplementary Fig. 14), but have limited activity against normal HSPCs. A small number (10–12) of novel and highly active hits are being investigated for further development, however, a detailed analysis of each of these molecules with respect to their individual targets and in vivo activity is beyond the scope of this manuscript.

### -double-mutated acute myeloid leukemia displays a unique phenotypic profile: a reliable screening method and insight into biological features [^114YaPWT]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Mutations in CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (CEBPA) occur in 5–10% of cases of acute myeloid leukemia. CEBPA -double-mutated cases usually bear biallelic N- and C-terminal mutations and are associated with a favorable clinical outcome. Identification of CEBPA mutants is challenging because of the variety of mutations, intrinsic characteristics of the gene and technical issues. Several screening methods (fragment-length analysis, gene expression array) have been proposed especially for large-scale clinical use; although efficient, they are limited by specific concerns. We investigated the phenotypic profile of blast and maturing bone marrow cell compartments at diagnosis in 251 cases of acute myeloid leukemia. In this cohort, 16 (6.4%) patients had two CEBPA mutations, whereas ten (4.0%) had a single mutation. First, we highlighted that the CEBPA -double-mutated subset displays recurrent phenotypic abnormalities in all cell compartments. By mutational analysis after cell sorting, we demonstrated that this common phenotypic signature depends on CEBPA -double-mutated multi-lineage involvement. From a multidimensional study of phenotypic data, we developed a classifier including ten core and widely available parameters. The selected markers on blasts (CD34, CD117, CD7, CD15, CD65), neutrophil (SSC, CD64), monocytic (CD14, CD64) and erythroid (CD117) compartments were able to cluster CEBPA -double-mutated cases. In a validation set of 259 AML cases from three independent centers, our classifier showed excellent performance with 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity. We have, therefore, established a reliable screening method, based upon multidimensional analysis of widely available phenotypic parameters. This method provides early results and is suitable for large-scale detection of CEBPA -double-mutated status, allowing gene sequencing to be focused in selected cases.

How Do We Diagnose AML?

AML must be distinguished from other hematologic malignancies, nutritional deficiencies, infections, medication effects, and other differential diagnoses. Diagnostic testing includes complete blood count with peripheral smear to evaluate for leukemic myeloblasts, electrolytes to screen for tumor lysis syndrome, lactate dehydrogenase, and coagulation profile to evaluate for disseminated intravascular coagulation. Diagnosis is made upon bone marrow biopsy with histochemical staining for cytology, flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular studies. Cytogenetic abnormalities inform prognosis, and separate AML into categories as favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable.

The diagnosis and follow-up process of adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is challenging to clinicians and laboratory staff alike. While several sets of recommendations have been published over the years, the development of high throughput screening and characterization for both genetic and epigenetic events have evolved with astonishing speed. Here we attempt to provide a practical guide to diagnose and follow adult AML patients with a focus on how to balance the wealth of information on the one hand, with the restriction put on these processes in terms of time, feasibility and economy when caring for these patients, on the other.

### Detection of minimal residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia [^1125Y8xt]. Current Oncology Reports (2002). Low credibility.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a curable malignancy, but its cure rate remains disappointingly low. Accurate quantitation of residual AML cells would allow individualization of therapy and thereby increase the likelihood of cure for each patient. Techniques that are being studied for residual disease detection include molecular assays for abnormalities that are present in subsets of AML patients, and multiparameter flow cytometry, which has broader applicability. Although significant advances have been made in the development of assays for monitoring residual disease, and particularly in techniques for molecular quantitation, additional refinement and validation are needed before these assays can be applied routinely in clinical management.

Recommendations for screening of patients with genetic predisposition for hematologic malignancies

The screening program is recommended only for patients with (likely) pathogenic variants, but not for variants of unknown significance and should also be offered to family members at risk.

According to the recent recommendations of the AACR, there is no benefit of screening in rapidly evolving leukemia such as AML or ALL. However, screening may be helpful for timing of allo-stem cell transplantation in some bone marrow failure syndromes predisposing for AML or MDS.

AACR recommends an annual surveillance testing with complete blood count (CBC) and bone marrow (BM) aspirate/biopsies with cytogenetics. At baseline CBC with differential, BM aspirate/biopsy with cytogenetics and a myeloid panel is recommended to investigate somatic variants. A CBC as a follow-up should be performed every six months for patients and family members at risk that carry RUNX1, GATA2 or Fanconi anemia pathogenic variants. Only in case of worsening CBC, BM aspirate/biopsy with cytogenetics and a myeloid genetic panel should be performed. An innovative recommendation is to do an annual blood testing for somatic pathogenic variants to follow clonal evolution. Clonal hematopoiesis may be used to determine the time point for early intervention. These data should be evaluated in the context of the type and number of variants, the gene involved, the variant allele frequency (VAF), and also the dynamics over time.

It is also important to consider other organ manifestations such as the high risk for early breast cancer in females with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Thus, children with hypodiploid ALL carrying pathogenic variants of TP53, should be included in intensive screening programs that have demonstrated improved outcome. Whenever possible, avoiding exogenic noxes such as repeated radiography and radiotherapy may help to decrease the risk of secondary cancer in Li-Fraumeni syndrome and other DNA repair deficiency syndromes.

### Comparative small molecule screening of primary human acute leukemias, engineered human leukemia and leukemia cell lines [^1126qRBL]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Although standard chemotherapeutic regimens can be effective in some patients, these non-targeted treatments also result in significant and life-long side effects. This limitation has motivated efforts to identify alternative approaches for specifically eradicating leukemia cells. While detailed genetic and biochemical studies can be undertaken to identify leukemia-specific differences, such efforts are time-consuming and may not reveal a practical therapeutic target. The alternative approach of high-throughput screening offers the advantage of being unbiased with respect to existing biological knowledge and also inherently incorporates the genetic heterogeneity present in leukemia samples. At the same time, the question of which source of cells are the most appropriate to use for this approach remains unclear. Primary AML patient samples could be considered the ideal source of cells for screening, however the growth and survival mechanisms that sustain the malignant population in vitro are poorly understood and for pediatric patients, obtaining the quantities of cells required for screening is difficult. Indeed, several screens have recently been reported for primary AML samples, but these have typically been restricted to either a small number of samples or a small number of compounds. Leukemic cell lines have also been used for screening which avoids some of the limitations associated with the use of primary cells because they are inexpensive and grow well in vitro, however, these lines often have highly abnormal and/or unstable karyotypes and, having been selected to grow in vitro without growth factors, they lack many of the growth characteristics of primary cells.

Recently, new methods of genetic engineering have been applied to generate human models of cancer through the introduction of specific oncogenic changes into freshly isolated normal human cells. As these cells can be produced in large numbers with specific oncogenic drivers, they present an attractive potential alternative for large-scale drug screens. Importantly, our prior extensive characterization of the de novo models of pediatric leukemias, using cells either from individual donors (facilitating the tracking of somatic mutations), or using cells pooled from multiple normal donors (to focus on common perturbations), have consistently recapitulated the features of primary AML populations carrying the same genetic alterations. Moreover, unlike most leukemia cell lines, their growth in vitro is growth factor (GF)-dependent. This suggests that their molecular circuitry may provide a more relevant system for drug screening and complement findings based on access to more limited primary cells.

### Comparative small molecule screening of primary human acute leukemias, engineered human leukemia and leukemia cell lines [^117ELPfP]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

To test this prediction, and directly compare three different sources of AML cells in a standardized setting, we performed a high-throughput small molecule screen using 11,142 compounds. These compounds were tested at a single dose against 34 AML/AMKL samples and three cord blood (CB) CD34 + hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) control samples. Our primary screening results, validated by subsequent dose-response assays, identified dozens of molecules that significantly impaired the growth of leukemic cells while having a limited impact on normal CB HSPCs. Analysis of these data highlighted a greater similarity in drug response between human model leukemias and primary patient samples compared to leukemia cell lines and provides strong evidence for biases in the vulnerabilities in essential signalling pathways between sample classes. Our functional studies also highlight the high cell- and genotype-specific activity of pro-apoptotic compounds, demonstrating the critical importance of subtype-specific studies for therapeutics. Together, these results provide empirical evidence for biases in drug discovery that reflect the test system used while underlining the challenges of developing targeted therapies with clearly defined mechanisms of actions.

### Diagnosis and management of acute myeloid leukemia in adults: recommendations from an international expert panel, on behalf of the European LeukemiaNet [^1116wCmB]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

In 2003, an international working group last reported on recommendations for diagnosis, response assessment, and treatment outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Since that time, considerable progress has been made in elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of the disease that has resulted in the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic markers. Furthermore, therapies are now being developed that target disease-associated molecular defects. Recent developments prompted an international expert panel to provide updated evidence- and expert opinion-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of AML, that contain both minimal requirements for general practice as well as standards for clinical trials. A new standardized reporting system for correlation of cytogenetic and molecular genetic data with clinical data is proposed.

What were the initial aims of the EuroFlow project?

The general aims of the EuroFlow project were the development and standardization of fast, accurate and highly sensitive flow cytometry approaches for diagnosis and (sub)classification of hematological malignancies, as well as for the evaluation of treatment effectiveness during follow-up. In the first 4 years (2006–2010) activities were exclusively focused on the diagnosis and (sub)classification of hematological malignancies. Five specific aims were addressed in this period: (1) to evaluate the utility of new antibodies developed either by the EuroFlow members or other institutions and companies, (2) to introduce novel flow cytometry immunobead assays for the detection of fusion proteins to be used for characterization of acute leukemias, (3) to define multicolor flow cytometry protocols and comprehensive antibody panels for the diagnosis and classification of hematological malignancies, (4) to create novel software tools for recognition of complex immunophenotypic patterns and multivariate analysis of flow cytometric data and (5) to promote standardization of flow cytometric immunophenotyping.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia — coagulopathy screening and transfusion targets — Because coagulopathy is common in patients with APL, it is important to screen with evaluation of PT, PTT, and fibrinogen during the initial workup and before any invasive procedure. Clinical coagulopathy is managed by aggressive transfusion support to maintain platelet counts of ≥ 50 x 10^9/L, by fibrinogen replacement with cryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma to maintain a level > 150 mg/dL, and by maintenance of PT and PTT close to normal values, with daily monitoring until resolution. Given the risks at diagnosis, invasive procedures including leukapheresis and/or central line placement should be avoided, and, if possible, diagnosis may be made using peripheral blood samples to minimize bleeding complications until coagulopathy is adequately controlled.

Here we report the results of a large-scale screen of over 11,000 molecules for their ability to inhibit the survival and growth in vitro of human leukemic cells from multiple sources including patient samples, de novo generated human leukemia models, and established human leukemic cell lines. The responses of cells from de novo models were most similar to those of patient samples, both of which showed striking differences from the cell-line responses. Analysis of differences in subtype-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities made possible by the scale of this screen enabled the identification of new specific modulators of apoptosis, while also highlighting the complex polypharmacology of anti-leukemic small molecules such as shikonin. These findings introduce a new platform for uncovering new therapeutic options for high-risk human leukemia, in addition to reinforcing the importance of the test sample choice for effective drug discovery.

### Diagnosis and management of AML in pediatric patients: consensus recommendations from an international expert panel [^111Kp7Dt]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

The European LeukemiaNet has periodically issued guidelines for the diagnosis and management of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults. These consensus recommendations, most recently updated in 2022, incorporate recent advances in genomic testing, disease detection methods, target identification, and response assessment. Whilst similarities exist between AML in children and adults, pediatric AML is frequently characterized by unique cytogenetic and molecular features, which require distinct genetic and immunophenotypic diagnostics, therapeutic approaches, response assessment criteria, and supportive care strategies. To address these specific needs, an international panel of pediatric hematologist-oncologists, biologists, geneticists, and laboratory medicine scientists convened to develop recommendations for the diagnosis and management of AML in children, adolescents, and young adults (hereafter termed pediatric AML) that are discussed in this special report.

### AnCRISPR screening platform for prioritizing therapeutic targets in AML [^111xyF3B]. Cancer Discovery (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Large-scale genome-wide CRISPR screening has provided numerous candidate AML targets, yet uncertainty remains about their physiologic relevance and translational potential. In vivo CRISPR screens offer a strategy for identifying leukemia dependencies within the context of the physiologic microenvironment. Our study thus aimed to refine the candidate list by providing in vivo functional references to better inform future studies. We have developed an in vivo CRISPR screening pipeline in orthotopic xenograft models of human AML and defined experimental conditions necessary for an optimal in vivo screen. One major consideration is the requirement for sufficient in vivo library representation to avoid false-positive hits. Because AML is established by leukemia-initiating cells, only a subset of the AML cell population retains this leukemia-initiating activity in mouse recipients. As evidenced by our barcoding experiments, random sets of barcodes prevailed in different individual recipients, reflecting the selective leukemia-initiating activity and clonal expansion. Therefore, it is critical to use irradiation to maximize the engraftment capacity of AML cells and include multiple mice to achieve complete in vivo library representation. The number of mouse recipients must be adjusted according to the library size and the leukemia-initiating capacity of the model.

### The present and future of measurable residual disease testing in acute myeloid leukemia [^112mW3KG]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Considerable progress has been made in the past several years in the scientific understanding of, and available treatments for, acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Achievement of a conventional remission, evaluated cytomorphologically via small bone marrow samples, is a necessary but not sufficient step toward cure. It is increasingly appreciated that molecular or immunophenotypic methods to identify and quantify measurable residual disease (MRD) – populations of leukemia cells below the cytomorphological detection limit – provide refined information on the quality of response to treatment and prediction of the risk of AML recurrence and leukemia-related deaths. The principles and practices surrounding MRD remain incompletely determined however and the genetic and immunophenotypic heterogeneity of AML may prevent a one-size-fits-all approach. Here, we review the current approaches to MRD testing in AML, discuss strengths and limitations, highlight recent technological advances that may improve such testing, and summarize ongoing initiatives to generate the clinical evidence needed to advance the use of MRD testing in patients with AML.

Acute myeloid leukemia — coagulopathy screening and cardiac evaluation indicate that screening for coagulopathy is standard by evaluating prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and fibrinogen activity as part of the initial evaluation and before any invasive procedure. The need for a cardiac evaluation (echocardiogram or multigated acquisition [MUGA] scan) should be determined based on individual risk factors; patients with a history or symptoms of cardiac disease, prior exposure to cardiotoxic drugs or thoracic RT, or those of an older age, should have an echocardiogram, whereas in younger asymptomatic patients with no history of cardiac disease an echocardiogram can be considered, and in acutely ill patients treatment should not be delayed for an echocardiogram. A small study of 76 patients with cancer who were screened for cardiac disease identified only 4 patients with cardiac abnormalities, and of these 4 patients the presence of cardiac disease did not change the course of treatment.

### -double-mutated acute myeloid leukemia displays a unique phenotypic profile: a reliable screening method and insight into biological features [^1175urpn]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Mutations in the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (CEBPA) are found in approximately 10% of cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). – Most CEBPA -mutant AML exhibit two mutations, which frequently involve a combination of an N-terminal and a C-terminal gene mutation, typically on different alleles. Recent comprehensive data have shown that CEBPA -double-mutated (CEBPA -dm) cases, rather than single mutants, are associated with a common gene expression signatureand a relatively favorable outcome. – Based on these features, CEBPA -dm AML has been recognized as a separate entity in the revised World Health Organization classification. The identification of a CEBPA -dm genotype provides crucial prognostic information, since these patients often lack other main predictors of relapse risk. However, there are several technical issues with CEBPA mutational analysis. First, CEBPA sequencing is known to be difficult because of the high GC content of the gene, which frequently correlates with failure of the polymerase chain reaction, and the presence of background or sequencing artifacts. Sequencing the entire gene enables detection of all mutations but is labor-intensive, especially in a routine context, and requires expertise with unusual variants. Several screening methods have, therefore, been developed. Although efficient and sensitive, polymerase chain reaction-based fragment-length analyses can only detect mutations resulting in a net insertion or deletion and not substitution mutations. Furthermore, they cannot distinguish a common 6-bp duplication polymorphism from an actual insertion or duplication. Next-generation sequencing-based CEBPA studies are able to overcome these difficulties but are not widely available yet. Some reports have proposed gene expression arrays as a screening method for CEBPA -dm status, given the unique profile of these malignancies.– Although these methods have excellent performance, they require further technology and relative expertise for specific application in this context.

### How I diagnose and manage Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^1112tPUJ]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation and diagnostic approaches to Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia

The prevalence of Ph-like ALL in cohorts of newly diagnosed pediatric patients is about 10–20%, and rises to 20–30% in adults. Ph-like cases are by definition BCR/ABL -negative, and are also always MLL-ETV/RUNX1 -and TCF3/PBX1 -negative. Thus, they constitute a subgroup within the B cell other ALL. It has been previously reported that some patients may present with an overlapping group of hyperploid cytogenetics and Ph-like ALL. A recent comprehensive and integrative genomic classification of B-ALL categorized 23 leukemia subclasses, clearly defined by a specific genetic aberration, thus minimizing overlaps with the Ph-like phenotype.

There is no consensus approach to the diagnosis of patients who express a Ph-like gene signature. These patients usually present with a higher white blood cell count, and are likely to remain MRD-positive following standard induction regimens. Selecting an optimal screening method and defining the patient population to be screened are still moving targets.

When first recognized, Ph-like ALL were retrospectively identified based upon gene expression profiling of a very wide array of genes. Notably, two large gene arrays, using a 257-gene probe set and a 110-gene setshared only a minimal number of genes. Application of both arrays to each of two different cohorts of patients resulted in low concordance. Remarkably, kinase fusion cases in the two cohorts were identified by both methods in complete concordance, while there were many cases of high expression of CRLF2 and JAK/STAT mutations that were recognized with the 257-gene probe set and not with the 110-gene set. Thus, while the evaluation of newly diagnosed "B-cell other" ALL patients should include an attempt to identify the Ph-like phenotype, a definitive diagnosis should not rely on the gene expression phenotype but rather on the identification of a genetic aberration in the cell signaling related gene. RNA sequencing enables both identification of a Ph-like phenotype and comprehensive analysis of aberrant translocations. As this method is technically complicated and unavailable in most centers, a routine diagnosis of Ph-like ALL requires a combination of a simple screening test and an ultimate method to identify the culprit leukemia driver in each patient.

### -double-mutated acute myeloid leukemia displays a unique phenotypic profile: a reliable screening method and insight into biological features [^114Ynfsk]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

As a screening method for genetic abnormalities, the immunophenotype of AML blasts is often able to predict the main underlying genotypes. Generally, the association with phenotype is strong when a few, relevant genetic events are responsible for leukemogenesis [e.g. CBF-related translocations or t(15;17)], whereas it is weaker when genetic heterogeneity is greater (e.g. normal karyotype with several gene mutations). Furthermore, the strength of the correlation with a certain genotype depends on phenotypic aberrations being rare in AML not characterized by that genotype [e.g. cross-lineage CD19 and t(8;21)]. In fact, CEBPA -mutated AML has not been associated with a specific immunophenotype. Rather, it has been described as showing positivity for commonly expressed antigens, such as CD15, CD7, CD34 and HLA-DR on blasts. Although associated with a mutant status, this phenotypic profile was not able to screen effectively for CEBPA -mutated cases, since about 25% of them were missed. Furthermore, it was based on the strict application of the European Group for Immunological Characterization of Leukemia (EGIL) threshold for positivity (i.e. more than 20% of cells), which is probably inadequate for dissecting a shared phenotypic signature, especially for frequently expressed antigens.

In this study, we extensively investigated the immunophenotype of CEBPA -mutated AML by analyzing all bone marrow cell compartments at diagnosis and by comparing each compartment with its corresponding normal counterpart in order to highlight aberrations. Our aim was to develop a screening method for CEBPA -mutated AML based on the phenotypic profile, which would be straightforward, widely available and fast, in order to focus molecular techniques on a narrow subset of AML patients.

Consideration for leukemia predisposition syndromes — given the risk of increased treatment-related toxicity, increased risk of secondary malignancy, and need for surveillance beyond what is typical for patients with a history of leukemia, it is important that a clinician perform a thorough physical exam to look for features of an underlying genetic syndrome (eg, cafe au lait macules), and additionally a thorough family history should be taken to assess for others with hematologic or other malignancies, with or without antecedent cytopenias, in order to screen for patients who may have a leukemia predisposition syndrome. Additional considerations include low hypodiploidy, which could indicate the presence of a germline TP53 mutation, and for individuals that undergo genomic testing, the presence of tumor variants of potential germline relevance.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® staging and follow-up of leukemia [^111sxydZ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Imaging associated with staging and follow-up of leukemia can play an important role in accurately assessing disease; however, the type of imaging and usefulness varies significantly by the subtype of leukemia. This document reviews the current literature regarding the impact of imaging for both staging and surveillance of several of the most common leukemic variants. These include acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Richter transformation, and chronic myeloid leukemia. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### -double-mutated acute myeloid leukemia displays a unique phenotypic profile: a reliable screening method and insight into biological features [^114A9DWT]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Being based on phenotypic data, our approach provides very early results and this goes beyond the mere speeding up of a focused molecular study. Although it is well-recognized that main genetic prognostic factors drive only the post-complete remission phase, knowledge about them since the outset is often meaningful for the clinical management of patients with AML.

In conclusion, we established a reliable and straightforward screening method, based simply on the multidimensional analysis of widely available phenotypic parameters, suitable for large-scale detection of CEBPA -dm status and potentially able to overcome technical issues related to molecular methods. Our approach provides very early results, allowing entire CEBPA sequencing to be performed in only selected cases. The method has high specificity and sensitivity, as demonstrated in an independent AML cohort. This is of major clinical significance, since CEBPA -dm patients show a favorable prognosis, and knowledge about the CEBPA genotype status permits the use of proportional treatment modalities.

Results

Pairwise combinatorial chromatin regulator screening

We selected 268 chromatin regulators that contain one or more of 50 protein family (Pfam) domains with the rationale that the domains could ultimately enable target prosecution (Supplementary Data 1 and 2, Supplementary Fig. 1a). We initially produced a pilot library targeting 98 chromatin regulator genes and screen pairwise combinations all-by-all in THP-1, a mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-AF9 rearranged monocytic leukemia, and Reh, a TEL-AML1 carrying lymphocytic leukemia (Supplementary Fig. 2a-c). We leveraged our CRISPR system that achieves pairwise gene inactivation by delivering two guide RNAs (sgRNAs), one of which directs S. pyogenes Cas9 and a second that directs S. aureus Cas9. We identified several gene pairs that were significantly depleted relative to either gene alone in both lines, including HDAC1; HDAC2 and BRD2; BRD3 (Supplementary Fig. 3a–d). Prior work has shown HDAC1; HDAC2 as a synergistic pair in many tissues. The pilot screen confirmed our ability to screen and identify significant chromatin regulator pairs.

### Risk-based classification of leukemia by cytogenetic and multiplex molecular methods: results from a multicenter validation study [^112rQqPk]. Blood Cancer Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Modern management of leukemia and selection of optimal treatment approaches entails the analysis of multiple recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities with independent diagnostic or prognostic value. We report the first multicenter validation of a multiplex molecular assay for 12 relevant fusion transcripts relative to cytogenetic methods. Performance was evaluated using a set of 280 adult and pediatric acute or chronic leukemias representative of the variety of presentations and pre-analytical parameters encountered in the clinical setting. The positive, negative and overall agreements were > 98.5% with high concordance at each of the four sites. Positive detection of cases with low blast count or at relapse was consistent with a method sensitivity of 1%. There was 98.7% qualitative agreement with independent reference molecular tests. Apparent false negatives corresponded to rare alternative splicing isoforms not included in the panel. We further demonstrate that clinical sensitivity can be increased by adding those rare variants and other relevant transcripts or submicroscopic abnormalities. We conclude that multiplex RT-PCR followed by liquid bead array detection is a rapid and flexible method attuned to the clinical laboratory workflow, complementing standard cytogenetic methods and generating additional information valuable for the accurate diagnosis, prognosis and subsequent molecular monitoring of leukemia.

### Acute myeloid leukemia: 2023 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^115yUwpf]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Disease Overview

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a frequently fatal bone marrow stem cell cancer characterized by unbridled proliferation of malignant marrow stem cells with associated infection, anemia, and bleeding. An improved understanding of pathophysiology, improvements in measurement technology and at least 10 recently approved therapies have led to revamping the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic landscape of AML.

Diagnosis

One updated and one new classification system were published in 2022, both emphasizing the integration of molecular analysis into daily practice. Differences between the International Consensus Classification and major revisions from the previous 2016 WHO system provide both challenges and opportunities for care and clinical research.

Risk Assessment and Monitoring

The European Leukemia Net 2022 risk classification integrates knowledge from novel molecular findings and recent trial results, as well as emphasizing dynamic risk based on serial measurable residual disease assessment. However, how to leverage our burgeoning ability to measure a small number of potentially malignant myeloid cells into therapeutic decision making is controversial.

Risk Adapted Therapy

The diagnostic and therapeutic complexity plus the availability of newly approved agents requires a nuanced therapeutic algorithm which should integrate patient goals of care, comorbidities, and disease characteristics including the specific mutational profile of the patient's AML. The framework we suggest only represents the beginning of the discussion.

a FISH and qualitative RT-PCR may be considered as alternative approaches for initial screening, i.e. initial identification of CML patients.

b RNAseq may be a better alternative to qualitative RT-PCR but is not widely available.

c Depending on trial design and objectives.

Overall, variants in cancer-associated genes (not including BCR::ABL1 TKD mutations) have been described in 20–30% of CML patients in CP, but it is important to note that most published studies are retrospective and focused on patients who subsequently relapsed or progressed to BP. Prospective studies are needed to determine the true frequency of genetic variants in CP, and their clinical significance. Nevertheless, ASXL1 has emerged as the most common somatically-mutated gene in CP, with abnormalities seen in about 10% of adult CML patients, although the prevalence in children and young adults appears to be significantly higher. Other recurrent abnormalities in CP include mutations in RUNX1 (2%), TET2 (2%), and DNMT3A (2%), and mutations or deletions of IKZF1 (4%). Of note, DNMT3A, TET2 and ASXL1 mutations are commonly associated with CH and in some cases may precede the acquisition of BCR::ABL1. In these patients, the mutations typically persist despite effective suppression of the CML clone by TKI therapy (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, some studies have found that ASXL1 mutations or overall somatic mutation burden prior to treatment are associated with poor outcomes.

Systematic literature review

Evidence base

We systematically reviewed published studies according to a prespecified protocol, using a process compliant with the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed and Embase databases were searched (Online Supplementary Table S1) for studies in humans published in English between 1 January, 1995 and 1 March, 2016. Additional searches were conducted for congress proceedings [American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), American Society of Hematology (ASH), European Hematology Association (EHA), and ESMO] published between 2012 and 2016.

Screening and data extraction

Titles or abstracts identified from the initial searches were evaluated against the prespecified inclusion criteria (Online Supplementary Methods). The full texts were obtained for all studies deemed eligible, and for studies whose eligibility was unclear during the title/abstract screening. The full texts were independently screened by two reviewers to confirm which studies should be included. Any discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer. Data extraction is described in the Online Supplementary Methods.

Here we analyzed the presence of ERG del by SNP array, genomic PCR followed by Sanger sequencing, and by a newly-designed deep amplicon sequencing procedure (AmpliSeq). We aimed to determine to what extent the different sensitivity of methods impacts ERG del detection and classification into IKZF1 plus category. Next, we wanted to assess whether ERG del can be detected in a significantly higher proportion of DUX4 r-positive patients using a potentially more sensitive method and to what extent positivity could serve as a surrogate marker for the DUX4 r-ALL classification. Moreover, we wanted to elucidate whether ERG del-positive DUX4 r-ALL differs from ERG del-negative DUX4 r-ALL, and whether the possible differences depend on the method used to detect ERG del. Finally, use of AmpliSeq enabled us to study in detail also the repertoire and clonality of ERG del in order to better understand its origin during leukemia clone evolution.

Imaging-based compound screen in leukemia-stroma coculture

We established a microscopy-based platform (Figure 1) for compound screening in primary blood cancer cells cocultured with the HS-5 bone marrow stromal cell line, which has been demonstrated to reproduce most features of bone marrow–derived stromal cells. Using this platform, we screened 50 compounds at 3 concentrations (supplemental Table 1) in 108 leukemia and lymphoma samples (supplemental Tables 2 and 3) in monoculture and coculture (Figure 1), including CLL (n = 81), AML (n = 17), T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (n = 4), mantle cell lymphoma (n = 4), and hairy cell leukemia (n = 2). An exposure time of 72 hours and drug concentrations aiming for high, medium, or low toxicity were selected based on a previous internal high-throughput compound screen. After 72 hours, we used Hoechst to stain nuclei in all samples and used confocal microscopy to read out viability and morphological changes in leukemia and lymphoma cells. As previously described, viable CLL cells were identified based on the Hoechst-stained nucleus area(supplemental Figure 1 A), whereas in non-CLL entities, an additional staining of the cytoplasm using Calcein was required to distinguish viable and dead cells (supplemental Figure 1 B, refer to "Methods" for details). Our primary readout was viability, defined as the viable fraction of leukemia cells. A total of 14 out of 150 drug conditions (50 drugs times 3 concentrations) were identified to be toxic to stromal cells and were thus excluded from further analysis. To adjust for spontaneous apoptosis, viabilities in drug-treated wells were normalized to viabilities in untreated wells. The viability readout of our platform was highly reproducible between replicates with correlations of R = 0.88 in coculture and R = 0.92 in monoculture (supplemental Figure 1 C), and between Hoechst- and Calcein-based readout in CLL samples with correlations of R = 0.92 (supplemental Figure 1 D).

### Revised recommendations of the international working group for diagnosis, standardization of response criteria, treatment outcomes, and reporting standards for therapeutic trials in acute myeloid leukemia [^114DtaeY]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

An International Working Group met to revise the diagnostic and response criteria for acute myelogenous leukemia originally published in 1990, as well as to provide definitions of outcomes and reporting standards to improve interpretability of data and comparisons among trials. Since the original publication, there have been major advances in our understanding of the biology and molecular genetics of acute leukemia that are clinically relevant and warrant incorporation into response definitions. Differences from the 1990 recommendations included a category of leukemia-free state, new criteria for complete remission, including cytogenetic and molecular remissions and remission duration. Storage of viable blasts for correlative studies is important for future progress in the therapy of these disorders.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia: ESMO clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^116TSXJf]. Annals of Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, more specifically with respect to cytogenetic analysis, ESMO 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain FISH for the detection of chromosome 17 deletion affecting the tumor protein p53 expression, and obtain TP53 sequencing, at least exons 4–10, exons 2–11, for the detection of TP53 gene mutation in the absence of chromosome 17 deletion before initiating treatment in patients with advanced or symptomatic stage disease.
Obtain analysis as close as possible, such as < 6 months, to initiation of therapy because genetic lesions may evolve throughout the disease.

Initial identification of CML patients

For centres that use reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based methods as the primary or sole means to screen for BCR::ABL1 in cases with suspected CML, it is essential that the methodology detects both typical and atypical BCR::ABL1 variants. Screening only for transcripts that encode p210 or p210 plus p190 BCR::ABL1 is poor practice and may result in up to 2% of bone fide CML cases being misdiagnosed as another disorder. If a limited transcript screen is performed it is essential that the clinical report clearly states that atypical BCR::ABL1 fusions would not have been detected, and that a diagnosis of CML is not excluded with certainty.

For centres that use cytogenetics and/or FISH as the primary screen, the BCR::ABL1 transcript type in positive cases should be determined prior to starting treatment to facilitate accurate assessment of measurable residual disease (MRD) on therapy. Although the exact transcript type should ideally be identified for all patients, many groups use reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to assess levels of e13a2 and/or e14a2 mRNA in cases prior to treatment and only search for atypical fusions in the small minority of CML cases for whom BCR::ABL1 mRNA is not detected, or found at unexpectedly low levels (e.g. < 1% on the International Scale). Low levels of BCR::ABL1 mRNA at diagnosis may also signal the presence of a co-existing BCR::ABL1 -negative hematological neoplasm. Quantitative assessment of BCR::ABL1 mRNA prior to treatment may also be useful to help interpret initial MRD results, e.g. after 3 months on therapy, as discussed below.

Identification of atypical BCR::ABL1 variants may be challenging, and there are no CE-marked or Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved kits or systems that can detect most rare isoforms. Laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) have been described that use multiplex RT-PCR followed, where appropriate, by sequence analysis. Two step, nested RT-PCR should generally not be used in patients with a high burden of disease due to the potential for artefacts or amplification of very low level, clinically insignificant splice variants. Looking forward, it is likely that genomic approaches such as whole transcriptome sequencing will be used increasingly on a routine basis to identify BCR::ABL1 isoforms as well as other fusion genes.

Flow cytometry is the primary tool for phenotyping leukemias and related conditions. With the ever increasing numbers of antibodies commercially available, the ability to study and understand leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes, and the myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases is improving. Although the data generated by flow cytometry are not comprehensive enough to completely subtype leukemias or myelodysplastic syndromes into their myriad divisions, this wealth of information does provide phenotype, reproducible enumeration of blasts, certain prognostic information, and it can reveal the presence of cell populations with aberrant antigen profiles. An important drawback to flow cytometry as it is performed today is the inability to look at the cells that mark with the antibody panels used. As classifications of leukemia and related conditions evolve, flow cytometry continues to answer many of the questions asked and to provide critical information reliably and quickly.
