## Question

A 32-year-old woman with a history of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) underwent elective splenectomy six weeks ago after failing medical therapy. She presents to your clinic for a routine follow-up. She is otherwise well and has no current complaints. Her platelet count has normalized. She asks if there are any special precautions she should take now that her spleen has been removed.

What specific counseling should you provide to this patient regarding infection prevention following splenectomy, according to current guideline recommendations?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what specific counseling should be provided to a 32-year-old woman who underwent splenectomy for ITP six weeks ago, focusing on infection prevention and current guideline recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's baseline risk profile and why asplenia matters. Then, I should verify the three core pillars of prevention: vaccination, antibiotic prophylaxis, and fever management. Next, I will check the exact vaccine schedule and timing, including boosters. After that, I need to review antibiotic prophylaxis duration and whether it should be lifelong. Then, I will confirm the fever action plan and standby antibiotics. Finally, I should consider special situations like travel, dental care, and documentation, and close with a concise, prioritized plan with clear timelines and rationale.

> Let me first confirm the risk profile and why counseling is critical. Asplenia confers a lifelong increased risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI) due to impaired clearance of encapsulated bacteria, with the highest risk in the first 1–2 years and in children, though risk persists for decades; mortality from OPSI remains high if unrecognized or untreated, underscoring the need for structured prevention and education [^9ee7fb7b] [^74891104] [^3c8cdadf].

> I will now examine the three core pillars of prevention. Vaccination, antibiotic prophylaxis, and patient education with a fever action plan are the mainstays; I should confirm that each element is addressed explicitly and that the patient understands that vaccines reduce but do not eliminate risk, so antibiotics and urgent care remain essential [^9ee7fb7b] [^a5e6f3f1].

> Next, I should review the vaccination schedule and timing. Wait, let me verify the sequence: pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13 or PCV15) should precede pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23), with an interval of about 8 weeks between them; meningococcal ACWY and meningococcal B vaccines are both indicated; Hib is indicated if not previously immunized; and annual influenza vaccination is recommended to reduce secondary bacterial infections. If vaccines were not given preoperatively, they should be administered now, ideally at least 2 weeks after surgery to optimize immunogenicity, and boosters for pneumococcus and meningococcus are needed at defined intervals to maintain protection [^fcf22757] [^3ef2ae7e] [^524d0b90] [^996e0bef] [^9ee7fb7b].

> Hold on, I should verify the exact pneumococcal booster cadence. For adults aged 19–64, after the initial PCV dose, a single PPSV23 dose is given 8 weeks later; a second PPSV23 dose is recommended 5 years after the first, and then PCV or PPSV23 boosters are considered every 5 years thereafter in high-risk groups, though I need to align this with current ACIP updates and local policy; I initially thought a second PPSV23 was only for those 65 and older, but wait, that is not correct for asplenia, where a second dose in 5 years is advised in adults under 65 as well, so I should correct that and document the schedule clearly [^fcf22757] [^9ee7fb7b].

> Now, antibiotic prophylaxis. I should confirm duration and agent. Many guidelines recommend penicillin V 500 mg orally twice daily for at least 2 years after splenectomy, and some experts extend prophylaxis lifelong, particularly in high-risk groups or those with additional immunocompromise; given this patient is an adult with ITP and no other immunocompromise, a reasonable approach is to continue prophylaxis for at least 2 years and then reassess, while ensuring she has standby antibiotics for fever if medical access is delayed [^9ee7fb7b] [^c0d03f29] [^a5e6f3f1].

> Let me think about the fever action plan, because this is where delays can be fatal. I should confirm that she has a supply of standby antibiotics (commonly amoxicillin-clavulanate or levofloxacin if penicillin-allergic) and explicit instructions to take them immediately if fever is 38.3°C (101°F) or higher and she cannot reach medical care within 2 hours; concurrently, she should seek urgent medical evaluation, obtain blood cultures when feasible, and receive parenteral ceftriaxone in clinic or emergency settings, with escalation to vancomycin if severe or toxic; she should carry a medical alert card or bracelet stating "asplenia" to expedite care [^a5e6f3f1] [^1a0f72bb] [^4b3dc0ab].

> But wait, what if she plans to travel or has animal exposures. I need to ensure travel counseling includes malaria prophylaxis for endemic destinations and tick-bite precautions given risks of Babesia; I should also remind her that animal bites, especially dogs, can transmit Capnocytophaga and warrant prompt antibiotics even for minor wounds; these risks are lifelong and should be reinforced periodically [^9ee7fb7b] [^2faba59b].

> I should double-check dental and procedural considerations. While routine dental prophylaxis is not universally required for asplenia, some guidelines advise discussing with dental providers and considering prophylaxis for high-risk procedures; I should individualize this based on local practice and patient risk, and ensure her dental team knows she is asplenic [^1a0f72bb].

> Next, I should review documentation and communication. She needs a medical alert card or bracelet stating "asplenia", an up-to-date vaccination record, and written emergency instructions; I should also send a letter to her primary care provider and keep her in a registry or structured follow-up program to track boosters and reinforce education, as adherence wanes without systematic reminders [^a5e6f3f1] [^1642ba78].

> Let me synthesize a practical, prioritized plan. Immediately, ensure vaccinations are up to date per the schedule above if not already completed; provide a 30-day supply of standby antibiotics with clear fever instructions; arrange a 2-week follow-up to confirm adherence and answer questions. Short term, continue antibiotic prophylaxis for at least 2 years with periodic reassessment; schedule pneumococcal and meningococcal boosters at 5-year intervals; reinforce annual influenza vaccination. Long term, maintain lifelong vigilance for fever, travel risks, and documentation; consider indefinite antibiotic prophylaxis if additional risk factors emerge or if the patient prefers after shared decision-making [^9ee7fb7b] [^304f19d6] [^3ef2ae7e].

> Finally, I should confirm that the patient understands the key messages. I will explain that her infection risk is lifelong, highest in the first 2 years, and that vaccines reduce but do not eliminate risk; that any fever of 38.3°C or higher is an emergency requiring immediate antibiotics and urgent care; and that carrying an alert card and keeping vaccinations current are essential. I will also address any misconceptions, such as the idea that splenectomy "cures" ITP and therefore ends all precautions, which is incorrect for infection risk [^9ee7fb7b] [^74891104] [^a5e6f3f1].

---

After splenectomy for ITP, patients have a **lifelong risk of overwhelming infection** from encapsulated bacteria (pneumococcus, meningococcus, Hib) and other pathogens [^9ee7fb7b]. Provide **vaccination against pneumococcus, meningococcus, Hib, and annual influenza** [^996e0bef] [^3ef2ae7e] [^b40cf823], and give **daily penicillin prophylaxis for at least 2 years** (often lifelong) [^9ee7fb7b] [^c0d03f29]. Educate the patient to seek immediate care for any fever ≥ 38.3°C (101°F) and to carry a medical alert card/bracelet [^a5e6f3f1] [^1642ba78]. These measures reduce but do not eliminate OPSI risk, so ongoing vigilance is essential [^cd0996ce].

---

## Vaccinations

Vaccination is the cornerstone of infection prevention in asplenic patients [^9ee7fb7b]. The following vaccines are **recommended**:

| **Vaccine** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13 followed by PPSV23) | - Administer PCV13 first, followed by PPSV23 after ≥ 8 weeks <br/> - Repeat PPSV23 every 5 years [^304f19d6] [^9ee7fb7b] |
| Meningococcal vaccine (MenACWY and MenB) | - Administer MenACWY and MenB vaccines <br/> - Repeat MenACWY every 5 years if risk remains [^3ef2ae7e] [^ae2b03e4] |
| Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine | - Administer one dose if not previously vaccinated [^b40cf823] [^ae2b03e4] |
| Annual influenza vaccine | - Administer annually [^996e0bef] [^7a08926a] |

---

Vaccinations should ideally be administered **at least 2 weeks before splenectomy**; if not, give them as soon as possible postoperatively [^3ef2ae7e] [^7193b867].

---

## Antibiotic prophylaxis

Daily antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended to prevent overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI) [^9ee7fb7b]. Penicillin V 500 mg orally twice daily is first-line; amoxicillin or macrolides are alternatives if penicillin allergy or intolerance occurs. Continue prophylaxis for **at least 2 years post-splenectomy**; many experts recommend lifelong prophylaxis, especially in adults [^9ee7fb7b] [^c0d03f29].

---

## Patient education and emergency preparedness

Patient education is critical for early recognition and management of infections. Provide **clear instructions** to seek immediate medical attention for any fever ≥ 38.3°C (101°F) or signs of infection (chills, rigors, malaise) [^a5e6f3f1]. Supply standby antibiotics (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate or levofloxacin) for use if medical care is not accessible within 2 hours [^a5e6f3f1]. Ensure the patient carries a medical alert card or wears a bracelet indicating asplenia to expedite care in emergencies [^1642ba78].

---

## Additional precautions

- **Travel precautions**: Avoid travel to malaria-endemic areas; if unavoidable, use prophylaxis and strict mosquito precautions [^9ee7fb7b].
- **Animal bites**: Seek prompt medical care for animal bites due to risk of Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection [^2faba59b].
- **Regular follow-up**: Maintain ongoing follow-up to monitor vaccination status, adherence, and infection risk [^9ee7fb7b].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Vaccinations**: Pneumococcal, meningococcal, Hib, and annual influenza vaccines [^996e0bef].
- **Antibiotic prophylaxis**: Penicillin V 500 mg twice daily for at least 2 years, often lifelong [^9ee7fb7b].
- **Patient education**: Immediate care for fever ≥ 38.3°C (101°F) and standby antibiotics [^a5e6f3f1].
- **Medical alert**: Carry asplenia identification [^1642ba78].
- **Travel and animal precautions**: Malaria prophylaxis and prompt care for animal bites [^9ee7fb7b] [^2faba59b].

---

These measures significantly reduce but do not eliminate infection risk; **lifelong vigilance and adherence are essential** [^cd0996ce].

Persons at Increased Risk for Meningococcal Disease

Persons at increased risk for meningococcal disease are recommended to receive routine meningococcal vaccination. Vaccine product, number of doses, and booster dose recommendations are based on age and risk factors (Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10). Although evidence suggests that vaccination might not adequately prevent meningococcal infections among persons with certain complement deficiencies or those using a complement inhibitor, these persons should continue to be vaccinated according to recommendations because of a possible benefit among persons at high risk for infection (Table 4). Persons using complement inhibitor should be vaccinated at least 2 weeks before complement inhibitor initiation unless the risks for delaying treatment outweigh the risks for developing meningococcal disease. Among unvaccinated patients for whom complement inhibitor therapy cannot be delayed, antimicrobial prophylaxis (e.g. penicillin) should be administered alongside meningococcal vaccination and continued for 2 weeks after vaccine administration. In addition, providers might consider antimicrobial prophylaxis for the duration of complement inhibitor therapy. Among persons undergoing elective splenectomy, meningococcal vaccines should be administered at least 2 weeks before surgery, if possible; otherwise, they should be administered after the procedure as soon as the patient's condition is stable.

Background

The terms asplenia and hyposplenia refer to absent or diminished splenic function, respectively. Functional a/hyposplenia can be caused by hepatic, gastrointestinal, autoimmune, neoplastic and haematological disorders. Atraumatic indications for splenectomy include malignancy and haematological autoimmune disorders, such as ITP, and other haematological conditions such as inherited RBC disorders (eg, sickle cell anaemia) and TTP. Therefore, it is common for haematologists to manage PWA/H.

The spleen plays an important role in immune regulation and defence. Thus, individuals with a/hyposplenia are at risk of certain infections, including encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae type b. As a result, a/hyposplenia are both associated with increased morbidity and mortality from complications of infection.

Strategies to prevent and reduce the risks of infection in people with a/hyposplenia include vaccination, rapid access to antibiotics and education. Since fever is often the initial manifestation of infection, PWA/H should be counselled to seek urgent medical care at fever onset. Adult PWA/H should have access to preprescribed antibiotics which should be taken at fever onset if unable to seek medical attention within 2 hours. Ideally, PWA/H should carry an alert card or bracelet and an up-to-date vaccination record.

Poor communication and education regarding infection risk and preventative measures by healthcare providers for people with asplenia has been described. The main barrier to appropriate care is lack of provider recognition of the infection correlative mortality risk associated with a/hyposplenia. There is evidence to support the utility of an alert card and education programme that addresses this infection risk in this patient population. The risk of infection can be significantly reduced by using systematic, long-term approaches to care of PWA/H.

### The variable manifestations of disease in pyruvate kinase deficiency and their management [^c0d03f29]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

The decision to proceed with splenectomy is more common in US centers, whereas in European centers, more patients with PKD remain on transfusions and iron chelation with intact spleens. This practice variation likely reflects provider and patient preferences and values assigned to the potential risks and benefits of splenectomy. International expert guidelines recommend splenectomy in patients with PKD who receive regular transfusions or do not tolerate their anemia. Cholecystectomy may be recommended at the time of splenectomy given the persistent risk of bilirubin gallstones, but patients should be counseled about the risk of intrahepatic cholestasis and other complications. Full splenectomy is recommended given the reported poor hemoglobin response to partial splenectomy. Pre- and post-splenectomy vaccinations are critical for preventing sepsis, and antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered according to country-specific guidelines but is often considered lifelong. Post-splenectomy thromboprophylaxis can be considered in the immediate postoperative period in patients with additional thrombotic risk factors. If thromboprophylaxis is given, low-dose aspirin can be considered in adults with additional risk factors (including advanced age, a history of thrombosis, or cigarette smoking) until the platelet count is < 500×10⁹/L and in children until the platelet count is < 1,000×10⁹/L.

Patients with a mildly low hemoglobin without symptoms of anemia, even with concurrent infections, can clearly avoid splenectomy. However, the management of many patients, like the one in this case, is not straightforward. He has received a considerable number of transfusions, possibly each time he has had a viral infection, and he likely has a high hemolytic rate and low hemoglobin at baseline. He would benefit from a post-splenectomy rise in hemoglobin, which could help him to avoid transfusions with illnesses going forward. Inquiring about agespecific signs and symptoms of fatigue will help to determine whether a chronically low hemoglobin is associated with daily symptoms, an additional reason to support moving forward with full splenectomy and cholecystectomy in this patient. Further complicating this discussion is the potential for future targeted treatments for PKD, including mitapivat (AG-348), an oral small molecule allosteric activator of PK currently in phase III clinical trials in adults. If the patient has at least one missense PKLR mutation, consideration could be given to delaying splenectomy while awaiting potential regulatory approval of this treatment. Off-target mild aromatase inhibition may, however, delay the future availability of this treatment until adulthood.

A good practice statement adds that the treating physician should ensure appropriate immunizations prior to splenectomy, provide counseling regarding antibiotic prophylaxis following splenectomy, and educate the patient on prompt recognition and management of fever and refer to current recommendations on pre- and postsplenectomy care.

### Infectious complications in asplenic hosts [^6525f86f]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Hyposplenism, secondary to splenectomy or disease state, predisposes the host to overwhelming infection with certain bacteria, such as S. pneumoniae. Recognition of the hyposplenic state and preventive measures, including patient education and vaccination, appear to reduce the rate of this highly fatal infection. In addition to considering chemoprophylaxis, a clinician should promptly evaluate or empirically treat all febrile episodes in hyposplenic patients.

### Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency: 2015 status report [^95ab8b3a]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Before splenectomy, all PKD patients should receive immunizations according to the Center for Disease Control guidelines for patients with asplenia, including the pneumococcal, meningococcal, and Haemophilus influenza vaccines. Post‐splenectomy, these vaccines should be boosted at regular intervals according to the same guidelines and any newly recommended vaccines should be administered in children and adults. Providers must be aware that these guidelines vary from time to time. Splenectomized patients should seek urgent medical care for all fevers ≥ 101.5 F due to the risk of sepsis with encapsulated organisms. These febrile, splenectomized individuals should have a blood culture drawn and then broad spectrum parenteral antibiotics should be administered. Penicillin prophylaxis generally is recommended for 1–2 years post‐splenectomy. Continued penicillin prophylaxis beyond this time period is more controversial. Some clinicians consider a lifetime course of prophylaxis, particularly for those patients who live a long distance from a medical center.

As in other congenital hemolytic anemias, gallstones occur at an earlier age than in the healthy population. Pancreatitis can occur as an acute complication of biliary tract disease. In contrast to hereditary spherocytosis, gallstones are also common in splenectomized PKD patients. Thus, the risk continues for gallstones to develop regardless of splenectomy status 21. For this reason, in order to avoid a second surgery and future complications, some advocate for a cholecystectomy at the time of splenectomy, even in the absence of gallstones. Concomitant Gilbert Syndrome should be suspected in patients with higher than expected indirect bilirubin measurements, which may predispose to a higher rate of gallstones. Genetic testing for the UGT1A1 promoter polymorphism of Gilbert syndrome may be indicated in such patients.

Successful pregnancies and deliveries have been reported in women with PKD 41, 42, 43, 44. Pregnancy is associated with increased hemolysis in some individuals; thus, regular transfusions may be necessary even in women who were transfusion‐independent before pregnancy. No guidelines exist regarding indications for blood transfusion during pregnancy, and it is not clear whether splenectomy status or other factors affect the degree of hemolysis in pregnancy. The increased hemolysis observed during pregnancy abates soon after delivery 43. Women should be counseled regarding the potential for increased hemolysis during pregnancy, and the requirement for close follow up with both an obstetrician and hematologist 41.

### Preventing infections in children and adults with asplenia [^9ee7fb7b]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

An estimated 1 million people in the United States have functional or anatomic asplenia or hyposplenia. Infectious complications due to encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae can lead to fulminant sepsis and death, particularly in young children, in the period shortly after splenectomy, and in immunocompromised patients. Patients with asplenia are also at risk for less common infections due to Capnocytophaga, Babesia, and malaria. Antibiotic prophylaxis, vaccines, and patient and family education are the mainstays of prevention in these at-risk patients. Recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis typically target high-risk periods, such as 1 to 3 years after splenectomy, children ≤ 5 years of age, or patients with concomitant immunocompromise. However, the risk for sepsis is lifelong, with infections occurring as late as 40 years after splenectomy. Currently available vaccines recommended for patients with asplenia include pneumococcal vaccines (13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine followed by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine), meningococcal vaccines (meningococcal conjugate vaccines for serogroups A, C, Y and W-135 and serogroup B meningococcal vaccines), H. influenzae type b vaccines, and inactivated influenza vaccines. Ongoing booster doses are also recommended for pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines to maintain protection. Despite the availability of prevention tools, adherence is often a challenge. Dedicated teams or clinics focused on patient education and monitoring have demonstrated substantial improvements in vaccine coverage rates for individuals with asplenia and reduced risk of infection. Future efforts to monitor the quality of care in patients with asplenia may be important to bridge the know-do gap in this high-risk population.

### Asplenia and hyposplenism: an underrecognized immune deficiency [^af4409cf]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

The number of disorders associated with congenital or acquired asplenia and functional hyposplenism has increased substantially over the past couple decades. Previously, screening for asplenia and hyposplenism was a barrier to identifying patients at risk. Recent methods for measuring splenic function have emerged as accurate and reliable. Identifying patients prevents overwhelming postsplenectomy infection or invasive pneumococcal disease. Approaches to protect patients with asplenia or hyposplenism include patient education of risks and signs/symptoms of infection, vaccination, and antibiotic prophylaxis. Physicians have evaluated methods of preserving splenic function after trauma and sought alternative treatments of refractory cytopenias treated with splenectomy in the past.

### Perioperative immunization for splenectomy and the surgeon's responsibility: a review [^5c546de1]. JAMA Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Patients who have had splenectomy have a lifelong risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI), a condition associated with high mortality rates. Surgeons must be aware of the rationale of vaccination in the case of splenectomy, to provide appropriate immunization in the perioperative time.

Observations

English-language articles published from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 2019, were retrieved from MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. Randomized clinical trials as well as systematic reviews and observational studies were considered. Asplenia yields an impairment of both innate and adaptive immunity, thus increasing the risk of severe encapsulated bacterial infections. Current epidemiology of OPSI ranges from 0.1% to 8.5% but is hard to ascertain because of ongoing shifts in patients' baseline conditions and vaccine penetration. Despite the lack of randomized clinical trials, immunization appears to be effective in reducing OPSI incidence. Unfortunately, vaccination coverage is still suboptimal, with a great variability in vaccination rates being reported across institutions and time frames. Notably, current guidelines do not advocate any particular health care qualification responsible for vaccine prescription or administration. Given the dearth of high-level basic science or clinical evidence, the optimal vaccination timing and the need for booster doses are not yet well established. Although almost all guidelines indicate to not administer vaccines within 14 days before and after surgery, most data suggest that immunization might be effective even in the immediate perioperative time, thus placing the surgeon in a primary position for vaccine delivery. Furthermore, revaccination schedules are the target of ongoing debates, since a vaccine-driven hyporesponsiveness has been postulated.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients who have undergone splenectomy, OPSI might be effectively prevented by proper immunization. Surgeons have the primary responsibility for achieving adequate, initial immunization in the setting of both planned and urgent splenectomy.

### The development of a quality improvement project to improve infection prevention and management in patients with asplenia or hyposplenia [^60c2f012]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Lessons and limitations

We successfully increased vaccination rates and awareness of proper fever management. The incorporation of feedback from key stakeholders critically improved the toolkit and will facilitate extension of the study to other sites.

A limitation of this project was that it relied on self-reported vaccination status if there was insufficient clinical documentation of a participant's vaccination status. Unless the patient had received the vaccine at the pilot site (eg, perioperatively for splenectomy performed at the pilot site), the patient's vaccination status could not be obtained by their haematologist through their hospital electronic medical record. Although a limitation, the poor documentation of vaccination status further highlighted the need for a readily available medical alert card that accurately describes patient vaccination status. The haematology clinics at the pilot site were not regularly equipped to provide vaccinations. Therefore the patient faced a barrier of receiving timely vaccinations. This emphasised the benefit of equipping the haematology clinics to provide vaccinations to PWA/H. We do not expect these to be limitations in the extension study since the haematology team provides vaccinations routinely to their patient population.

Another limitation of this project was that the postintervention questionnaire was not distributed at a consistent interval after receiving the toolkit. This is due to the different follow-up requirements of each individual patient. Unfortunately, up-to-date vaccination records were not always available at the time the postintervention questionnaire was administered, especially in patients who were followed frequently by their haematologist. The incomplete availability of vaccination records likely attenuated the effect of our intervention. Also, the postintervention outcomes were measured at only one time point, usually within 4 months of receiving the toolkit. Long-term sustainability of the awareness and understanding of the implications of a/hyposplenia could therefore not be measured.

We learnt to establish a clear duration required between the completion of the preintervention and postintervention questionnaires and to extend the study duration to allow for sustainability to be measured. At the extension-study site, the postintervention questionnaire will be administered to participants at a clinic visit 3–9 months and 12–24 months from baseline which is in line with their routinely booked clinic visits which appear to be more standardised for clinical reasons than at the pilot site.

Another limitation is the potential lack of generalisability. The intervention was implemented mainly to an ITP and TTP adult patient population. In order to evaluate the generalisability of the intervention we will extend the intervention to additional (eg, sickle cell disease population) and larger patient populations at the extension-study site.

### Recommendations regarding splenectomy in hereditary hemolytic anemias [^2faba59b]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Splenectomy complications

Post-splenectomy infections

Given the role of the spleen in immune competence and blood filtration, there is a risk of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI), which is highest with encapsulated micro-organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenza. Asplenia is also an important risk factor for serious infections with Plasmodium, Capnocytophaga canimorsus and C. cynodegmi (after an animal bite), Babesia spp. (after a tick bite), and Bordetella holmesii. – The risk of post-splenectomy sepsis may vary according to the indication for splenectomy (intermediate risk in spherocytosis and higher in other inherited anemias), patient's age at the time of surgery (highest before the age of 5 years), and time since the splenectomy was performed (risk highest during the first year after the intervention). However, the risk probably remains elevated for life. Given the high risk of OPSI at a young age, splenectomy should not normally be performed before 5 years of age.

It is difficult to estimate the current risk of OPSI in subjects aged > 5 years as most studies are retrospective and include patients with heterogeneous diseases who were not fully immunized. It is possible that the widespread use of conjugated vaccines will significantly reduce the risk of OPSI. In fact, a recent retrospective study in which 141 consecutive children undergoing splenectomy during 1991–2010 were analyzed indicated that ten of the 11 patients who developed post-splenectomy sepsis had an additional underlying immune deficiency. However, in a recent prospective, multicenter cohort study of German patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, S. pneumoniae sepsis was more frequent among splenectomized patients than among those with a normal functional spleen (42% versus 12%, respectively; P < 0.001). It is of note that less than half of the OPSI patients in this study had received pneumococcal vaccination before splenectomy, despite national and international guidelines.

Strategies to reduce the development of OPSI include: (i) patient's education, including advice to take urgent action in response to febrile episodes; (ii) vaccination and (iii) prophylactic anti-microbial therapy. Detailed guidelines regarding the prevention and treatment of infections in splenectomized or asplenic patients are available through the British Committee for Standards in Haematologyand American Academy of Pediatrics (Red Book 30 th edition, 2015), to which the reader is referred.

### Post-splenectomy antibiotic prophylaxis – unfinished story: to treat or not to treat? [^64c5ed80]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Overwhelming infection in asplenic patients is a well documented occurrence in the literature. The introduction of immunization with polyvalent pneumococcal, Hemophilus Influenza and meningococcal vaccines significantly cut down the incidence of post-splenectomy sepsis and mortality. However, the issue of prophylactic antibiotic therapy in these patients remains inconclusive. There are contradictory reports bouncing between life-long treatment to no treatment. There are also more flexible approaches emerging from patient difficulties complying with a prolonged therapy. This debate calls for developing a better predictive approach based on genetic profiling of patients with different susceptibility to infectious pathogens, host-pathogens interactions as well as to identify the impact of factors such as age, on immunological competence.

### Prevention and treatment of infection in patients with an absent or hypofunctional spleen: a British Society for Haematology guideline [^c9784d89]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of infection in patients with an absent or dysfunctional spleen were published by the British Committee for Standards in Haematology in 1996 and updated in 2002 and 2011. With advances in vaccinations and changes in patterns of infection, the guidelines required updating. Key aspects included in this guideline are the identification of patients at risk of infection, patient education and information and immunisation schedules. This guideline does not address the non-infective complications of splenectomy or functional hyposplenism (FH). This replaces previous guidelines and significantly revises the recommendations related to immunisation. Patients at risk include those who have undergone surgical removal of the spleen, including partial splenectomy and splenic embolisation, and those with medical conditions that predispose to FH. Immunisations should include those against Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) and influenza. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is part of the infant immunisation schedule and is no longer required for older hyposplenic patients. Treatment of suspected or proven infections should be based on local protocols and consider relevant anti-microbial resistance patterns. The education of patients and their medical practitioners is essential, particularly in relation to the risk of serious infection and its prevention. Further research is required to establish the effectiveness of vaccinations in hyposplenic patients; infective episodes should be regularly audited. There is no single group ideally placed to conduct audits into complications arising from hyposplenism, highlighting a need for a national registry, as has proved very successful in Australia or alternatively, the establishment of appropriate multidisciplinary networks.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: challenges and best practices [^49b964d5]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

2.1 Splenectomy

Conventionally, splenectomy has been the principal option for long‐term management of ITP because of its potential to induce long‐term remission. Splenectomy provides a high initial response rate (85%); however, up to 30% of responders will relapse during the 10 years following an initial response (typically, within 2 years after splenectomy), and there is no widely available and reliable means of predicting whether an individual patient will respond. 10 In addition, splenectomy is associated with serious short‐ and long‐term risks. Surgical complications were reported in 10% of patients in the 30‐day period following splenectomy, even when less‐invasive laparoscopic methods were used. 10 Furthermore, lack of splenic function may result in infections, thromboembolism, and possibly an increased incidence of malignancy, which result in an increased risk of death that persists for > 10 years after surgery. 11 Based on a study of 8149 US veterans who had splenectomy for any indication, the risk of death due to certain events was 3‐ to 4‐fold higher in patients who had undergone splenectomy versus those with intact spleens (the risks of septicemia, pulmonary embolism, and non‐Hodgkin lymphoma were 3.02‐, 4.53‐, and 4.69‐fold higher, respectively). 11 In addition, another study in 9976 patients with ITP revealed a 2.7‐fold increased risk of venous thromboembolism and a 1.6‐ to 3.1‐fold increased risk of sepsis (depending on timing and comorbidities) ≥ 90 days after splenectomy (median follow‐up of 120 months), but an increase in the risk of malignancy was not reported. 12 Thus, splenectomized patients need lifelong management to prevent sepsis, such as vaccinations and prophylactic antibiotics, as well as surveillance for relapse. The advent of pharmaceutical second‐line treatment options has significantly decreased the use of splenectomy in ITP. 13, 14 However, splenectomy may still be preferred by some patients who desire independence from medications. 15

### Splenectomy: still a life-saving treatment in immune thrombocytopenia [^0a5da3b0]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Notwithstanding some naïve interpretations, we should pay tribute to Kaznelson's hazardous courage that made splenectomy a life-saving treatment for several thousands of patients. Indeed, splenectomy was the only effective treatment for severe ITP up to the introduction of corticosteroids in the early 1950s, after Kaznelson's death. Today, with the availability of many effective treatments and innovative drugs under investigation, splenectomy is generally offered as a last chance for refractory patients, and less than 5% of patients accept this option. However, it is confirmed to have the highest potential for an entire life free of or with a much more tolerable thrombocytopenia in over 70% of patients, thus avoiding prolonged or life-long medicalization. This is even more true now given appropriate patient selection, prevention of thrombosis and infections and the availability of simple non-invasive surgery. Indeed, 2019 guidelines for ITP were unable to determine which approach among rituximab, thrombopoietin receptor agonists and splenectomy was superior, leaving the choice to patients' preferences. Let's hope that medical treatments able to definitely cure this disease will be found in the near future.

### Underlying disease is the main risk factor in post-splenectomy complication risk: data from a national database [^1c27faef]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition, the first 2 years following splenectomy have been reported to have the highest risk of complications; therefore, prophylaxis schemes and clinical or laboratory follow‐ups are generally limited to the first few years following splenectomy. However, these recommendations are derived from historical observational studies preceding the most recent prophylactic guidelines, are limited to specific disease groups, consider heterogeneous end‐points and, therefore, may be obsolete and impractical.

Thus, the specific long‐term risk of post‐splenectomy complications in different diseases and at different ages has not been defined yet, as studies published so far are either limited to the observation of small groups of patients or come from the analysis of hospital discharge registries lacking detailed medical information or have a short follow‐up time. Therefore, the specific post‐splenectomy risk for individual diseases and the long‐term effects of splenectomy versus other therapies (e.g. drug therapies) are still unclear. Thus, at the present time, the decision to perform splenectomy in different haematological disorders is based on generic and anecdotal data on the risk of post‐splenectomy complications.

For all these reasons, the need for national registries of patients undergoing splenectomy that collect detailed and high‐quality clinical data has recently been emphasized, in order to provide solid indications on post‐splenectomy infectious and vascular risk and thus to guide clinical decision‐making.

In this long‐term follow‐up study of splenectomised haematological patients from a national database, we aimed to assess the risk of infectious and vascular complications after splenectomy as a function of the underlying disease and of the patient's age at the time of splenectomy, in order to provide reference data on post‐splenectomy risk in major haematological diseases.

ACIP — Administration of PPSV23 after PCV7 or PCV13 among children aged 2–18 years at increased risk: Children aged ≥ 2 years with underlying medical conditions should receive PPSV23 after completing all recommended doses of PCV13, with 1 dose of PPSV23 at age ≥ 2 years and at least 8 weeks after the most recent PCV13 dose. Children who have received PPSV23 previously also should receive recommended PCV13 doses. For children aged 24–71 months with underlying medical conditions who received < 3 doses of PCV7 before age 24 months, give a series of 2 doses of PCV13 followed by 1 dose of PPSV23 administered ≥ 8 weeks later; if they received any incomplete schedule of 3 doses of PCV7 before age 24 months, give 1 dose of PCV13 followed by 1 dose of PPSV23 administered ≥ 8 weeks later. When elective splenectomy, immunocompromising therapy, or cochlear implant placement is being planned, PCV13 and/or PPSV23 vaccination should be completed at least 2 weeks before surgery or initiation of therapy.

### Vaccination of asplenic or hyposplenic adults [^fde40bfa]. The British Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a feared complication in patients with an absent or dysfunctioning spleen.

Methods

A literature search was undertaken to identify recommendations for vaccination in asplenic or hyposplenic adults, and published data regarding the effectiveness of the vaccines in reducing the incidence of infections, and vaccine failures.

Results

Various committees and organizations recommend that the pneumococcal, meningococcal and Haemophilus influenza vaccine, plus booster doses, should be administered to patients with an absent or dysfunctional spleen. However, adherence to such recommendations varies. Furthermore, vaccine failures still occur in a subset of properly immunized individuals. Immunocompromised individuals, in particular, have a greater risk of inadequate antibody response.

Conclusion

Immunization is partially responsible for the observed reduction in sepsis after splenectomy.

### Underlying disease is the main risk factor in post-splenectomy complication risk: data from a national database [^3f106f76]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

In subjects with CHA, SCA and trauma, even with very different rates of infection, the lowest in CHA and the highest in SCA, no deaths from infection were reported, according to data published in Italian splenectomized patients with SCA. These elements must be taken into account in the decision‐making process as splenectomy in these patient groups is often necessary to treat severe complications of the underlying disease.

It should be noted the limited number of patients splenectomised for trauma regularly followed up in specialized centres (51 out 1348 splenectomised subjects). This suggests that patients splenectomised for trauma may not receive updated information on post‐splenectomy risks and may not implement all the preventive measures expected for asplenic patients. To address this critical issue revealed by our data, the collaboration between specialized centres and surgeons or general practitioners is essential to ensure correct management of post‐splenectomy risk in subjects splenectomised for trauma.

The identification of a specific period of increased risk of serious infection after splenectomy is key for clinical practice to appropriately intensify surveillance and prevention. According to our data, in all diseases, the risk of developing an infectious or vascular complication is persistent throughout the observation period and is not limited to the first 2–3 years after splenectomy, as reported in some studies. Probably, the different methods of recording infectious events in the different studies (analysis of hospital discharge diagnosis versus direct recording of infectious events by the attending physician of the splenectomized patient) explain these differences in the results.

Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) with currently active chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) involves functional asplenia with risk for life-threatening infection from encapsulated organisms and specifies evaluation, counseling, and interventions. Functional asplenia is noted as at risk for life-threatening infection with encapsulated organisms. Physical exam at time of febrile illness to evaluate degree of illness and potential source of infection is advised, and Blood culture when febrile T ≥ 101°F (38.3°C) as indicated for patients with active cGVHD. Potential considerations include Antibiotic prophylaxis for encapsulated organisms and bacteremia/endocarditis prophylaxis for duration of immunosuppressive therapy for cGVHD. For acute management, Administer a long-acting, broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotic (e.g., ceftriaxone) in patients with T ≥ 101°F (38.3°C) or other signs of serious illness and continue close medical monitoring while awaiting blood culture results. Hospitalize and broaden antimicrobial coverage (e.g., addition of vancomycin) under certain circumstances, such as the presence of marked leukocytosis, neutropenia, or significant change from baseline CBC, toxic clinical appearance, fever ≥ 104°F (40°C), meningitis, pneumonia, or other serious focus of infection, signs of septic shock, or previous history of serious infection. Counseling includes Discuss importance of immunization with Pneumococcal, Meningococcal (including serotype B), Influenza and HIB vaccines according to current ACIP recommendations and Obtain medical alert bracelet/card noting functional asplenia. Additional Information advises to consider risk modifiers including Splenic radiation, ongoing immunosuppression and Hypogammaglobulinemia. SYSTEM = Immune SCORE = 1.

### Splenic trauma: WSES classification and guidelines for adult and pediatric patients [^74891104]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

OPSI are defined as fulminant sepsis, meningitis, or pneumonia triggered mainly by Streptococcus pneumoniae (50% of cases) followed by H. influenzae type B and N. meningitidis. OPSI is a medical emergency. The risks of OPSI and associated death are highest in the first year after splenectomy, at least among young children, but remain elevated for more than 10 years and probably for life. The incidence of OPSI is 0.5–2%; the mortality rate is from 30 to 70%, and most death occurs within the first 24 h. Only prompt diagnosis and immediate treatment can reduce mortality. Asplenic/hyposplenic children younger than 5 years old have a greater overall risk of OPSI with an increased death compared with adults. The risk is more than 30% in neonates. Evidence exist regarding the possible maintaining of the function by the embolized spleen (hyposplenic patients) however is reasonable to consider it as less effective and proceed with vaccination as well.

Vaccination against flu is recommended annually for asplenic/hyposplenic patients over 6 months of age. Prevention of influenza may decrease the risk of secondary bacterial infection, including pneumococcal infection.

Ideally, the vaccinations against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae type B, and N. meningitidis should be given at least 2 weeks before splenectomy. Patients should be informed that immunization can only reduce the incidence of OPSI (vaccines so far available do not allow an exhaustive coverage neither for S. pneumoniae — 23 of 90 serotypes are included — nor for N. meningitidis — 5 of 6 serotypes) (Table 5).

Table 5
Vaccinations and antibiotic prophylaxis after splenectomy or hyposplenic status

In traumatic patients, the correct time for vaccination should be not less than 14 days after splenectomy; in fact, before 14 days, the antibody response is supposed to be suboptimal; after that interval, the earlier the better. In asplenic/hyposplenic patients discharged before 15 days, where the risk to miss the vaccination is deemed high, the first vaccines should be given before discharge. The Centre for Disease Control in 2016 proposed the last updated recommendations. Most episodes of severe infections occur within the first 2 years after splenectomy, and for this reason, some authors recommend at least 2 years of prophylactic antibiotics after splenectomy. However, the duration of antibiotic prophylaxis is controversial.

### Prevention and management of infections in patients without a spleen [^3c8cdadf]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

Patients who lack a functioning spleen become vulnerable to sepsis caused by bacteria and, occasionally, protozoa. The risk is higher in children and in those who have had immunosuppressive treatment, and the risk remains lifelong. Overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI) occurs at an estimated incidence of 0.23–0.42% per year, with a lifetime risk of 5%. Episodes of OPSI are emergencies, requiring immediate parental antibiotics and intensive care; intravenous immunoglobulins may be useful. OPSI carries a mortality of 38–69%. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the commonest infecting organism, accounting for 50–90% of isolates from blood cultures in reported series; it is particularly common in children with sickle cell disease. Less commonly, the infecting organisms are other bacteria, Babesia or Ehrlichia. OPSI may be, to some extent, preventable by several interventions. These are surgical conservation of the spleen; immunization against S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Neisseria meningitidis; prophylactic antibiotics; stand-by antibiotics; patient information sheets; and a medical alert bracelet. Asplenic patients living in malaria-endemic areas require optimal prophylaxis. The initial step in prevention of OPSI is the creation of an asplenia register, as many patients are not covered by these simple measures.

### Short-and long-term risks of splenectomy for benign haematological disorders: should we revisit the indications? [^eaa2955b]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Splenectomy has represented a key treatment option in the treatment of many benign haematological diseases, including immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and disorders associated with ongoing haemolysis (thalassaemia major and intermedia, sickle cell disease, and hereditary or acquired haemolytic anaemias). Improvements in surgical techniques have reduced perioperative complications and mortality. Preventive measures (new protein conjugate vaccines, antibiotic prophylaxis, and increased vigilance) are thought to greatly reduce the risk of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI), although their implementation is inconsistent. Nevertheless, there is increasing documentation of the short- and long-term risks of splenectomy, which vary according to the underlying indication. Splenectomized patients are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism, particularly within the splenoportal system. The long-term thromboembolic risk is higher in haematological disorders associated with ongoing haemolysis, particularly in thalassaemia intermedia, which has led to a more conservative approach. In comparison, patients with ITP appear to be at lower risk of adverse effects of splenectomy, which maintains its place as the potentially most curative and safe second-line treatment. However, a splenectomy-sparing approach is also emerging for ITP, and recent guidelines recommend that this procedure is deferred until ≥ 12 months from ITP diagnosis, to allow sufficient time for possible remission.

### Splenic trauma: WSES classification and guidelines for adult and pediatric patients [^4c65fef8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

US or CEUS or DUS follow-up seems reasonable to minimize the risk of life-threatening hemorrhage and its associated complications. General surgeons tend to perform routinely imaging follow-up for children differently from pediatric surgeons that only in 5% of cases suggest imaging follow-up.

The APSA guidelines recommended 2–5 months of "light" activity before restart with normal activities and recommended 3 week–3 months of limited activity at home. Some authors suggested the reprise of normal activity even after 4 weeks after III–IV grade injuries. In fact, the risks of delayed splenic rupture and post-traumatic pseudocysts seem to be increase within the first 3 weeks (incidence 0.2 and 0.3%, respectively). Canadian guidelines suggested a discharge at home after reprise and good toleration of oral intake, able mobilization, and analgesia with oral medications without images before discharge. They reported a 32% of children that did not have any images follow-up without any complications and a restriction of activity no more than 6–8 weeks with a length of activity restriction modulated on the grade of injury. The use of CEUS can improve the diagnosis of PSA that can be found in all grades of injury.

Patients and parents psychological involvement after trauma can be related with abdominal pain; for this reason, family and patient education post-discharge should be considered to reduce readmission rate.

Infection prophylaxis in asplenic and hyposplenic adult and pediatric patients:
Patients should receive immunization against the encapsulated bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis) (GoR 1A).
Vaccination programs should be started no sooner than 14 days after splenectomy or spleen total vascular exclusion (GoR 2C).
In patients discharged before 15 days after splenectomy or angioembolization, where the risk to miss vaccination is deemed high, the best choice is to vaccinate before discharge (GoR 1B).
Annual immunization against seasonal flu is recommended for all patients over 6 months of age (GoR 1C).
Malaria prophylaxis is strongly recommended for travelers (GoR 2C).
Antibiotic therapy should be strongly considered in the event of any sudden onset of unexplained fever, malaise, chills, or other constitutional symptoms, especially when medical review is not readily accessible (GoR 2A).
Primary care providers should be aware of the splenectomy/angioembolization (GoR 2C).

### Performance of Dutch hospitals in the management of splenectomized patients [^7bf989b2]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

After splenectomy, patients are at increased risk of sepsis with considerable mortality. This risk can be reduced by taking preventive measures, such as prescribing immunizations and antibiotic prophylaxis. Studies from various countries show that a substantial percentage of patients are not managed adequately. The aim of the present study was to investigate the quality of care in the prevention of infections after splenectomy in Dutch hospitals. The research questions were two-fold: (1) Is there an association between hospital teaching status and guideline adherent preventive measures? (2) Which factors contribute to hospital performance?

Methods

A total of 28 Dutch hospitals (30%) participated in the study. A retrospective review of medical records of 536 splenectomy patients was performed. Adherence to prevention guidelines was assessed for all patients, and analyzed according to teaching status and the presence or absence of a post-splenectomy protocol.

Results

(1) University hospitals in the Netherlands offered higher quality of care than other teaching and nonteaching hospitals. There were only small differences between nonuniversity teaching and nonteaching hospitals. (2) The presence of a hospital post-splenectomy protocol did not improve vaccination rates. Other aspects of practice organization, such as surgical staff size and keeping a complication registry were only weakly related to performance.

Conclusions

In the Netherlands, university hospitals deliver state-of-the-art care in the prevention of infections in asplenic patients more often than nonuniversity teaching and nonteaching hospitals. The availability of a hospital protocol does not seem to contribute to guideline adherence.

### Primary care of the blunt splenic injured adult [^76b9c868]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The spleen is the most commonly injured abdominal organ in blunt trauma. Immediate treatment is aimed at assessing for bleeding and abating it when it is severe. Methods for the management of blunt splenic injury-associated bleeding include observation, splenectomy, and splenic salvage procedures through splenorrhaphy or embolization. After blunt splenic injury, complications commonly occur, including bleeding, infection, thrombosis, and pneumonia. If a patient undergoes splenectomy, infections can be severe. To mitigate infectious complications after splenectomy, vaccination against common pathogens remains paramount. Patients may often present to their primary care provider with complaints related to splenic injury or long-term care of their immunocompromised state. Knowledge of the spleen's function, as well as common complications and risks, is important to physicians caring for splenic injury patients.

### A review of guidance on immunization in persons with defective or deficient splenic function [^55c1dbec]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

The spleen acts as a blood filter and lymphopoietic organ. Asplenic and hyposplenic individuals are more susceptible to serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria but they can be protected by antibiotic prophylaxis and immunizations. Recent progress in vaccinology means prophylaxis is now successful in the vast majority of serious infections with pneumococci, meningococci and Haemophilus influenzae type b responsible for the majority of cases of overwhelming sepsis in asplenic patients. Current guidelines are coherent. Physicians treating patients with conditions associated with hyposplenism are ethically obliged to immunize their patients using the vaccines currently available to protect them from largely preventable, life-threatening infections.

### Splenectomy for immune thrombocytopenia: down but not out [^a6625c72]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Splenectomy is an effective therapy for steroid-refractory or dependent immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). With the advent of medical alternatives such as rituximab and thrombopoietin receptor antagonists, the use of splenectomy has declined and is generally reserved for patients that fail multiple medical therapies. Splenectomy removes the primary site of platelet clearance and autoantibody production and offers the highest rate of durable response (50% to 70%) compared with other ITP therapies. However, there are no reliable predictors of splenectomy response, and long-term risks of infection and cardiovascular complications must be considered. Because the long-term efficacy of different second-line medical therapies for ITP have not been directly compared, treatment decisions must be made without supportive evidence. Splenectomy continues to be a reasonable treatment option for many patients, including those with an active lifestyle who desire freedom from medication and monitoring, and patients with fulminant ITP that does not respond well to medical therapy. We try to avoid splenectomy within the first 12 months after ITP diagnosis for most patients to allow for spontaneous or therapy-induced remissions, particularly in older patients who have increased surgical morbidity and lower rates of response, and in young children. Treatment decisions must be individualized based on patients' comorbidities, lifestyles, and preferences. Future research should focus on comparing long-term outcomes of patients treated with different second-line therapies and on developing personalized medicine approaches to identify subsets of patients most likely to respond to splenectomy or other therapeutic approaches.

Splenectomy

The American Society of Hematology guidelines and international consensus report recommend that splenectomy be delayed to at least 1 year after the diagnosis of ITP, since the rate of resolution of ITP within the first 1–3 years of disease appears substantial even in adults. Laparoscopic splenectomy is infrequently complicated by perioperative problems; response rates are initially 80% which relapse reduces to 60%. Late relapse beyond 2 years after splenectomy is very uncommon. Whether delaying splenectomy reduces its efficacy is a concern; a recent study from Francesuggests that efficacy is maintained, and some patients responded better to TPO-RA after splenectomy.

There are long-term risks of adverse effects of splenectomy which are clinically significant, including not only overwhelming sepsis but also thrombosis, especially stroke. The risk of sepsis is based on less efficient blood stream phagocytosis and is exacerbated by low antibacterial antibody levels. Pneumococci are a more frequent cause of post-splenectomy sepsis than all other infections combined. Following splenectomy, individuals also have an elevated risk of infections by encapsulated Gramnegative pathogens, e.g. Capnocytophaga canimorsus and Bordetella holmesii, as well as intraerythrocytic parasites, such as malaria and Babesia, as noted in a recent review of post-splenectomy infections.

Providing patients appropriate and timely immunization for pneumococci, Hemophilus influenzae B, and meningococcus, antibiotic prophylaxis, education, and prompt treatment of infection mitigates this risk; when to repeat pneumococcal and other vaccinations remains unclear. While vaccination appears more effective if given at least 2 weeks prior to splenectomy, vaccination can be administered after splenectomy if there is not time before the splenectomy or if vaccination would likely be ineffective because the patient is receiving high-dose immunosuppression or has recently received rituximab.

The risk of post-splenectomy thrombosis was not initially appreciated. Population studies using a Danish registry identified this risk, particularly with regard to stroke, with confirmation in other populations, e.g. the Nurses' Health Study. Splenectomy for hemolytic anemias has been complicated by pulmonary hypertension, with mitigation by partial splenectomy and reduction in the use of splenectomy. Partial splenectomy may "hit the sweet spot" by reducing red blood cell phagocytosis but maintaining enough phagocytosis to prevent pulmonary hypertension and sepsis. The apparent absence of pulmonary hypertension after splenectomy for ITP suggests that partial splenectomy, like splenic embolization and radiation, is very rarely if ever used.

Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of infection in patients with an absent or dysfunctional spleen were first published by the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) in 1996 and formally reviewed in 2002. Although the guidelines originated from discussion within the BCSH, the intended readership is wide given the multidisciplinary nature of the management of hyposplenism.

### Vascular complications after splenectomy for hematologic disorders [^ae0f99df]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

The most widely recognized long-term risk of splenectomy is overwhelming bacterial infection. More recently, thrombosis has become appreciated as another potential complication of the procedure. Because of these long-term risks, the indications for and timing of splenectomy are debated in the medical community. Accordingly, the adverse effects and benefits of splenectomy for hematologic disorders and other conditions demand further study. This comprehensive review summarizes the existing literature pertaining to vascular complications after splenectomy for hematologic conditions and attempts to define the potential pathophysiologic mechanisms involved. This complex topic encompasses diverse underlying conditions for which splenectomy is performed, diverse thrombotic complications, and multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms.

### Splenectomy as a destination: improving quality of care among asplenic veterans through a travel clinic [^819ccc05]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Asplenic patients are at risk for severe infections, but adherence to recommended preventive education and vaccination is poor. The goal of this study was to demonstrate that a targeted intervention can improve vaccination rates in a population of asplenic veterans.

Methods

Surgically asplenic patients actively receiving care in our health care system were identified via a database search. Patients were contacted via mailed letters and encouraged to attend an existing travel clinic with a new process designed for asplenic patients. In the clinic, patients were educated on the risks of asplenia and proper preventive precautions, a vaccination history was taken, and patients were administered any additional indicated vaccines.

Results

The database search yielded 113 patients; an additional 14 asplenic patients were identified and referred to the clinic by providers, and 2 were referred prior to planned splenectomy. Among all asplenic patients, the first-year referral rate to clinic was 38/129 (29%). During the first year of the intervention, there were increases in the rates of 3 of 4 recommended vaccinations: pneumococcal conjugate, 19% to 55% (P < .001); Haemophilus influenzae type B, 19% to 35% (P = 0.007); and meningococcal vaccine, 24% to 43% (P = 0.002). The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination rate increased from 91% to 93% (P = 0.62).

Conclusions

Targeted interventions can improve guideline-based care for asplenic patients. The creation of a clinic designed for asplenic patients led to increases in 3 of 4 recommended vaccinations. This strategy may be applicable to other health care systems with similar numbers of asplenic patients.

### Splenic injury from blunt trauma [^49203a9a]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Who needs vaccination?

Postsplenectomy vaccination against encapsulated bacteria and seasonal flu (risk of secondary bacterial infection) is recommended. People without splenic function (asplenic or postsplenectomy state) have a greater than 50 times higher risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy infections, which may have a fatal course. However, the routine use of lifelong prophylactic antibiotics, practised in some countries for the prevention of overwhelming postsplenectomy infections, is not evidence-basedand should not be recommended.

Recent practice management guidelinesdo not recommend routine vaccination after angioembolization. In this setting, retained splenic immune function has been demonstrated, with no data to suggest an increased level of infectious complications.

### Underlying disease is the main risk factor in post-splenectomy complication risk: data from a national database [^33ff7476]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Splenectomy can be an urgent life‐saving procedure in certain haematological conditions and in trauma, or it can be a planned operation to alleviate the symptoms of an underlying disease.

The relationship between underlying disease, age at splenectomy, elapsed time since splenectomy and the risk of asplenia‐related complications has always been a point of great interest for researchers and clinicians, as it greatly influences the decision‐making process.

In our study, we investigated all infectious events that required hospitalization, reporting as a final diagnosis meningitis in only 1% of cases, sepsis in 15%, while pneumonia was involved in 42% of cases and other febrile events in 42% of cases. While an admission for infection affected about one in six splenectomy patients in our cohort of splenectomized patients, the low number of meningitis and sepsis compared to total admissions for infections suggests that preventative protocols are effective in curbing the most invasive bacteria.

Our analysis indicated that delaying splenectomy does not reduce the risk of infectious complications in all diseases considered, and the key message is that it is no longer reasonable to postpone splenectomy when clinically indicated. This finding was even more evident in subjects with TDT and partly in NTDT, in which the risk of infectious and vascular complications increased with increasing age at splenectomy, contrary to what is generally and traditionally believed. The immunological impairment and cardiovascular risk increased by long‐term iron overload complications, prolonged oxidative stress and early immune senescence may explain the increasing risk of post‐splenectomy complications in older splenectomised TDT and NTDT patients. However, in all disorders assessed in this study, the decision to perform splenectomy must depend on the clinical indication and therapeutic goal in the individual disease, regardless of the patient's age. To date, similar results were reported only for sickle cell patientsand for infectious complications.

### Guidelines for the performance of minimally invasive splenectomy [^3a59d32d]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). High credibility.

Minimally invasive splenectomy — The panel suggests that drains not be used routinely during elective, MIS (conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence). Evidence came from a single, small, observational study of low quality and 54 participants, in which routine drain placement was favored over no drain placement regarding operative time (MD -41.75 minutes (95% CI, -72.77 to -10.73). For routine placement of drains, the effect was deemed trivial. Routine drain placement was possibly associated with small harm regarding SSI (OR 2.97 [95% CI, 0.14 to 61.05], absolute difference is 1.2% more (0.6 fewer to 33.5 more) and length of stay (MD 1.46 [-0.32 to 3.24]). The expert panel felt there could be an increased risk of SSI with routine drain placement based on duration of drainage and stated there may also be increased costs to patients for increased length of stay. All evidence for each outcome was very low certainty.

### Overwhelming infection in asplenic patients: current best practice preventive measures are not being followed [^ec4398fc]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

Aims

Patients without spleens are at increased risk of overwhelming infection. Recently, greater efforts, including the publication of national guidelines, have been made to improve the management of asplenic individuals. In theory, risks of serious sepsis can be reduced by good advice, immunisation, and antibiotic prophylaxis. In practice, such preventive measures might not be followed or may fail. A study of recent cases of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI) was undertaken to examine specific associated factors and to determine whether currently recommended preventive measures are being followed.

Methods

Cases of OPSI were identified and reported mainly by microbiologists across the country using a specifically designed proforma. Data including the nature of the infection and vaccination/ antibiotic prophylaxis history since splenectomy were obtained.

Results

Seventy seven cases were reported. The age range varied from 3 months (congenital asplenia) to 87 years. In those who had undergone surgical splenectomy, the time interval between surgery and OPSI varied from 24 days to 65 years. Overall mortality reached 50%, with underlying haematological malignancy associated with the highest death rate. Streptococcus pneumoniae caused approximately 90% episodes. Only 31% individuals had received pneumococcal vaccination before OPSI. Seven of 17 pneumococcal infections in immunised cases could be considered vaccine failures. Few patients had been adequately advised on antibiotic prophylaxis or other measures.

Conclusions

Currently accepted best practice for managing asplenic patients is not being followed. Some OPSI cases may still be preventable but many asplenic individuals remain unrecognised. The compilation of asplenic patient registers might help to implement agreed policies with audit necessary to evaluate compliance. More is needed to ensure optimal management for this cohort of the population.

### Splenectomy for thrombocytopenia in chronic liver disease… [^f51a257c]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — Immune thrombocytopenia is not an indication for splenectomy. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura may be an indication for splenectomy, 1 but a platelet count below 150 000/mm3 is not. In immune thrombocytopenia, the patients usually do not have purpura unless the platelet count is below 20 000/mm3. In the six patients reported by Skootsky et al, 2 no platelet count was that low, the word purpura is not used in their descriptions, and there is no mention of unusual bleeding or need for platelet transfusion during splenectomy.

Annual fasting glucose levels may also be monitored. An annual influenza vaccination and other vaccines as clinically indicated are recommended for all patients, and patients treated with splenic RT or splenectomy should receive pneumococcal, meningococcal, and H-flu type b revaccination after 5 to 7 years.

### Detection, education and management of the asplenic or hyposplenic patient [^0c17422f]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Fulminant, potentially life-threatening infection is a major long-term risk after splenectomy or in persons who are functionally hyposplenic as a result of various systemic conditions. Most of these infections are caused by encapsulated organisms such as pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae and meningococci. A splenectomized patient is also more susceptible to infections with intraerythrocytic organisms such as Babesia microti and those that seldom affect healthy people, such as Capnocytophaga canimorsus. Most patients who have lost their spleens because of trauma are aware of their asplenic condition, but some older patients do not know that they are asplenic. Other patients may have functional hyposplenism secondary to a variety of systemic diseases ranging from celiac disease to hemoglobinopathies. The identification of Howell-Jolly bodies on peripheral blood film is an important clue to the diagnosis of asplenia or hyposplenia. Management of patients with these conditions includes a combination of immunization, antibiotic prophylaxis and patient education. With the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pneumococci, appropriate use of the pneumococcal vaccine has become especially important.

### Splenectomy for HIV-related immune thrombocytopenia… [^96b796c4]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

All patients with HIV-related thrombocytopenia had a complete early platelet response to splenectomy, with an elevation of the platelet count to greater than 100×10⁹/L. After a median follow-up of 26. 5 months, all but 1 patient had a sustained complete remission with no need for medical therapy for thrombocytopenia. A rise in the platelet count after administration of corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin is usually observed in both conditions, although this rise is often not sustained after withdrawal of the drugs. Splenectomy is effective long-term therapy for patients with classic chronic ITP, 8, 9 and despite concerns that splenectomy in HIV-infected patients might increase the risk of developing AIDS10 or overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis, splenectomy has been successfully used for the treatment of HIV-related thrombocytopenia. 2, 11–17.

Follow-up information was obtained from the medical records, by postal and telephone inquiry with the patients' local physicians or their hematologists, and with the patients. Follow-up information was available for all patients. Patients were included in the non-HIV ITP group if they had been diagnosed as having ITP and had isolated thrombocytopenia with no clinically apparent associated conditions or other causes of thrombocytopenia.
9. The lowest platelet count before splenectomy, the platelet count 1 week after splenectomy, and any other available platelet counts, were also recorded. End points for recording of postoperative platelet counts were either the last available count or the last count before institution of medical therapy for thrombocytopenia for patients who relapsed or remained severely thrombocytopenic after splenectomy.

Symptoms and signs of thrombocytopenia were recorded for the HIV-related thrombocytopenia group, as were the details of medical treatment for thrombocytopenia. Only medications given for thrombocytopenia more than 3 months after splenectomy were recorded, to avoid recording the use of drugs that were being gradually weaned after operation. Also noted were the results of histopathological examination of the spleen, and whether vaccines for encapsulated organisms were given. Follow-up information recorded included whether there had been progression of HIV disease, and whether any severe or overwhelming infections had occurred. There was no operative mortality. Postoperative complications were recorded for 6 patients, consisting of pulmonary atelectasis in 5 patients, wound infection in 2 patients, and urinary retention in 1 patient.

Median postoperative stay was 8 days, with a range of 6 to 23 days. All patients with HIV-related thrombocytopenia had an initial complete response to splenectomy, 15 and the sustained complete remission rate was 93% over a median follow-up of 26. 5 months. Only 1 patient, a 57-year-old man with transfusion-acquired HIV infection and a CD4 count at splenectomy of 0.129×10⁹/L, needed to recommence medical therapy for recurrent symptomatic thrombocytopenia. The early response to splenectomy was better in the HIV-related thrombocytopenia group, with a significantly higher median platelet count in that group at 7 days and 30 days after operation.

### Splenectomy for immune thrombocytopenia: the evolution and preservation of treatment [^18d426b7]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

These findings provide robust data in a large cohort of children who have undergone splenectomy for ITP, in particular with regard to the reported findings of an over 90% CR/R rate, with minimal adverse effects in the perioperative period. Age in terms of a predictor for responsiveness is also a novel finding for children. As suggested by the authors, this is perhaps related to the pathophysiology of the disease in teenagers being similar to young adults, who also have improved responsiveness to splenectomy. Although the evidence provided in this study represent novel data in support of consideration of splenectomy as opposed to other forms of second-line therapy, a number of questions remain unanswered. The reason behind the selection of splenectomy and clinical decision-making was not collected, in particular regarding the indication of treatment, e.g. treatment due to bleeding symptoms, disease chronicity, or other HRQoL metrics. Splenectomy also remains the treatment of choice for emergent management of life-threatening bleeding which may be represented by a handful of cases who underwent splenectomy early in the course of their ITP in this cohort. Furthermore, the availability of alternative treatments was variable over the course of cohort enrollment (1997–2017), which possibly influenced selection of splenectomy as treatment. The disease phase was also not defined in relation to outcomes. Additional limitations include potential selection bias related to the affiliation with the registry. In addition, the follow-up of the patients was limited to 25 months due to patient retention. It would be important to understand more longterm outcomes (i.e. decades) regarding relapse of disease in adulthood, as well as infectious risk. It may never be possible to conduct randomized trials; however, longitudinal tracking of patients requiring second-line therapy provides the opportunity for indirect comparison. Application of patient-related outcomes in prospective trials may also help to capture factors that matter to patients besides platelet count and help in decision-making.

Despite the unanswered questions and known limitations associated with a registry, the work by Avila et al. provides insight into the long-term outcomes associated with splenectomy in children with ITP. The authors are to be commended for the long-term follow-up and collection of data on a rare group of patients. These data give rise to an important consideration of the safe use of splenectomy to achieve remission in the majority of patients who have undergone this procedure, in spite of the decreasing numbers of patients over time in favor of therapies with presumably fewer life-long side-effects.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia [^6f28b5cd]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Rituximab versus splenectomy in children with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — in children unresponsive to first-line treatment, there were no RCTs that directly compared rituximab and splenectomy, and thus the arms represent different populations; reported remission rates favored splenectomy (68.5%) compared with rituximab (20%), durable remission was 76.7% compared with 47.0%, and major bleeding was similar (6.7% with rituximab and 6.3% with splenectomy); overall infection rates were lower for rituximab than splenectomy (1.4% vs 3.8%) and additional operative complications with splenectomy were identified in 5.9% of children; the guideline panel determined that there is low-certainty evidence for treatment with rituximab rather than splenectomy, and based on the available body of evidence, the risks associated with rituximab were thought to be less than with splenectomy, but not negligible; the high 1-time cost for surgery is greater than the direct drug costs associated with a course of rituximab, and if a patient places high value on a chance for long-term remission, splenectomy may be preferable, with the panel placing high value on avoiding splenectomy in the pediatric population given that many children are likely to undergo spontaneous remission.

Minimally invasive splenectomy — drain placement: Based on very low certainty evidence, the panel judged there is trivial benefit to routine drain placement with potential small detriment, noting that undesirable effects of increased surgical site infection (SSI) and possible increased length of stay outweigh any small benefit in operative time, and a small proportion felt no recommendation should be made. The panel suggests that drain placement not be used routinely during MIS and states that selective drain placement should be used instead of routine placement based on individual patient factors or operative considerations, such as infected fields or obvious or suspected pancreatic injury; in these situations, benefits such as control of a pancreatic leak or source control for an infection may outweigh the undesirable effects. The panel also notes that the value of decreased operative time may vary and expressed some distrust in conclusions about operative time due to poor-quality, limited data.

### Pneumococcal purpura fulminans in asplenic or hyposplenic patients: a French multicenter exposed-unexposed retrospective cohort study [^fcf22757]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

Asplenic or hyposplenic patients admitted to the ICU for a purpura fulminans seem to have a high risk of pneumococcal purpura fulminans. In patients surviving pneumococcal purpura fulminans, unknown congenital asplenia should be searched with abdominal CT-scan. Detecting Howell-Jolly bodies in peripheral blood smear and counting pitted erythrocytes by phase-interference microscopy may also help diagnosing hyposplenia. In such patients, pneumococcal vaccination seems welcomed in order to avoid recurrences of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection. As recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019 guidelines, patients with asplenia or hyposplenia should receive one dose of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine together with one (for persons aged ≥ 64 years) or two doses (for persons aged 19–64 years) of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Furthermore, continuing education is required to advise patients with a risk of severe infection inherent to asplenia and the need for immediate antibiotic therapy in case of fever, especially since it has been reported that 40 to 84% of splenectomized individuals were not aware of the infectious risks associated with their condition. In adult asplenic/hyposplenic patients, long-term antibiotic prophylaxis is still debated, except in those who survived overwhelming post-splenectomy infection, a targeted subgroup of patients in whom such a strategy seems appropriate, although supported by a low evidence.

These vaccinations should be administered at least 14 days before elective splenectomy, if possible, and if not administered before surgery, they should be administered after the procedure as soon as the patient's condition is stable.

### Underlying disease is the main risk factor in post-splenectomy complication risk: data from a national database [^4dc1e4fa]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our data suggest revising age as a criterion for indication to splenectomy and highlight the importance of weighing the pros and cons of splenectomy in individual diseases, considering the burden and side effects of alternative therapies to splenectomy and the risks associated with spleen‐related complications.

For instance, some forms of congenital haemolytic anaemia, such as severe or moderate hereditary spherocytosis, are maintained on a regular transfusion regimen for several years before splenectomy. However, in this group of patients, our data showed a high safety profile of splenectomy, a curative procedure that almost completely frees patients from the risk of severe acute anaemia and the need for transfusions.

Treatment protocols for some AHDs, such as immune thrombocytopenia or immune haemolytic anaemia, involve the use of potent immunosuppressive agents for years before splenectomy, administered to delay or avoid the surgical procedure as much as possible. The reported infectious risk in patients splenectomised for autoimmune diseases was intermediate, but all reported deaths were associated with infections, with the highest mortality for infections among all disease groups. So, the indication for splenectomy in subjects with AHDs requires particular caution, and in light of these data, the follow‐up and management of infectious events must be particularly aggressive in this group of patients.

In NTDT, the risk of post‐splenectomy complications clearly exceeds the benefit of the increase in the haemoglobin value (generally 1–2 g/dL) obtained by splenectomy, at any age. Chronic anaemia in NTDT patients should be managed with a regular transfusion regimen or new drugs, where available and effective. However, in some NTDT patients, splenectomy is inevitable when severe hypersplenism and/or symptomatic splenomegaly occur, or anaemia cannot be managed by regular transfusions due to immunization or limited resources, as in low‐income countries, with restricted availability of new expensive drugs, as well. Therefore, patients with NTDT will continue to require splenectomy worldwide. Even in our national database, despite a clear reduction in the number of NTDT patients registered with splenectomy performed from 2010 onwards, compared to previous decades, spleen removal in NTDT continues to be performed even in very recent years. So, it is crucial to consider the specific risk of post‐splenectomy complications in individual diseases in order to implement adequate monitoring and preventive measures.

Children born without a spleen or who have impaired splenic function, due to disease or splenectomy, are at significantly increased risk of life-threatening bacterial sepsis. The mainstays of prevention are education, immunization, and prophylactic antibiotics. The availability of conjugate 7-valent pneumococcal vaccines for use in children to age 9 years at least, as well as conjugate meningococcal C vaccine in some countries, for use beginning in infancy, appear to represent beneficial additions, but not substitutions, to previous recommendations for the use of polysaccharide 23-valent pneumococcal and quadrivalent A, C, Y, W-135 vaccines. Routine immunization against H. influenzae type b should continue with non-immunized children older than age 5 years receiving two doses 2 months apart, similar to children who have not previously received conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in infancy. Annual influenza immunization, which reduces the risk of secondary bacterial infection, is also recommended for asplenic children and their household contacts. Many experts continue prophylaxis indefinitely although prophylaxis of the penicillin allergic child remains suboptimal.

### Early splenectomy in a large cohort of children with sickle cell anemia: risks and consequences [^21307ede]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

One important finding of this study is the absence of an increased infectious risk when splenectomy is performed before 3 years of age, with a comparable very low incidence of invasive infections in those splenectomized before or after 3 years of age. However, a large majority of children were splenectomized between 2 and 3 years of age in the younger group, with only 3 children splenectomized under the age of 2. The absence of an increased infectious risk in these younger children may be associated to the early loss of spleen function, with a subsequent risk related to surgical splenectomy that is not modified by the procedure. It has, indeed, been demonstrated that ASS negatively impacts splenic function. Accordingly, the majority of children who were under 3 years old at splenectomy had experienced ASS, with a median number of 3 episodes. Whatever the explanation, this finding seems to suggest that it is better to proceed to splenectomy without delay in children aged between 2 and 3 years old who have an indication of splenectomy for ASS, although such a management strategy is not currently widely accepted. In many centers, prophylactic chronic transfusion therapy is usually initiated in order to decrease the risk of severe acute anemia in case of recurrence of ASS, and this is prolonged until splenectomy can be "safely" performed, generally around 4 or 5 years of age. However, chronic transfusion does not prevent the recurrence of ASS, while it may cause serious complications, including iron overload, as illustrated by an elevated mean ferritin level (395 ng/mL [range 159–783 ng/mL]) at a median age of 4.1 years in our cohort. Not only can a strategy based on early splenectomy avoid transfusion therapy, iron overload and alloimmunization, but also, in low-income countries, blood-transmitted viral infections. Nevertheless, early splenectomy is only to be considered if appropriate pneumococcal prophylaxis is both prescribed and available, and when parents have been educated about the risk of infection.

Minimally invasive splenectomy — preoperative imaging and monitoring in ITP are guided by expert opinion: Given that there is no available evidence informing the effectiveness of preoperative imaging compared to no imaging in this context, the panel provided their expert opinion, and the panel suggests that preoperative imaging may be beneficial for patients with ITP undergoing MIS. In pediatric populations, the concerns for additional radiation exposure are greater and modern imaging techniques may mitigate these negative effects and should be discussed with the patient and/or their parent/guardian(s). Regardless of intervention or comparison, patients with ITP should be monitored for recurrence of disease suggesting missed accessory spleen.

INTRODUCTION

Surgical removal of the spleen improves or eliminates the symptoms of the underlying condition for many haematological diseases. However, the resulting asplenia is associated with an increased risk of infectious and vascular complications in the long term.

Splenectomy is indicated in different clinical settings to manage acute or chronic complications of specific haematological diseases, such as hypersplenism and the increased need for blood transfusions in several congenital anaemias. Failure of pharmacological first‐line therapies in haematological autoimmune disorders may also require splenectomy. Splenectomy is urgently required to prevent acute, serious and potentially fatal spleen‐related complications such as acute splenic sequestration in sickle cell anaemia (SCA), and intractable haemorrhage in autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Subjects with no underlying haematological disorders may require splenectomy for abdominal trauma or for abnormalities of the spleen.

With regard to the complications of asplenia, fulminant and unresponsive‐to‐treatment infections (mainly caused by encapsulated bacteria) facilitated by immune impairment are a widely recognized life‐threatening risk. Historical studies have reported rates of severe post‐splenectomy infections ranging from 1% to 5% of cases, with infection‐related mortality varying between 1.4% and 70% of patients.

It is expected that the availability of more effective vaccinesand the implementation of infection management recommendations will progressively reduce the risk of infections and infection‐related mortality, but the impact of these factors is still unknown, due to the lack of contemporary data on clinical outcome rates in splenectomised patients that can guide the clinical decision‐making process.

The risk of post‐splenectomy vascular complications is much less characterized. Arterial thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, acute portal vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and subsequent pulmonary hypertension are more frequent in splenectomised patients. Variable risk in different haematological diseases is due to the persistence of intravascular haemolysis, hypercoagulability and vascular remodelling, which have greater or lesser impact depending on the underlying disease.

The age at which patients undergo splenectomy may influence their risk of infectious and thrombotic complications, but this is still a matter of debate. It has been reported that the lower the age at splenectomy, the greater the risk of infectious complications. In clinical practice, it is generally recommended to postpone splenectomy at least after the age of 6 to reduce the infectious risk. Recently, no increased risk of infection has been found in children with SCA splenectomised before the age of 3, but no similar data are available in other haematological diseases undergoing splenectomy.

### Preventive counseling, screening, and therapy for the patient with newly diagnosed HIV infection [^425a5099]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

The epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues, and the infection is converting into a treatable chronic disease; therefore, it is increasingly important for family physicians to be current with and comfortable in providing basic care to patients infected with HIV. Important aspects of counseling and patient education include stabilization of psychosocial issues and prevention of HIV transmission through behavior change counseling. Reporting HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is mandatory in most states, whereas partner notification laws vary from state to state. Baseline evaluation includes screening for comorbid conditions such as viral hepatitis, syphilis, and tuberculosis, as well as common HIV-related manifestations such as recurrent candidal infections and thrombocytopenia. Baseline testing includes CD4+ T-lymphocyte cell counts and HIV viral RNA levels to assess HIV disease stage, and numerous studies to screen for opportunistic infections. Initial preventive interventions include patient education to reduce exposure to infections, treatment of comorbid conditions such as human papillomavirus-related dysplasia, and vaccinations such as for pneumococcus and hepatitis B. Prophylaxis against opportunistic pathogens is recommended when CD4+ cell counts fall below 200 cells per mm3. Lastly, the indications for antiretroviral therapy include symptomatic patients or those with AIDS, and pre-AIDS patients with CD4+ cell counts of 200 to 350 cells per mm3 or HIV RNA above 55,000 to 100,000 copies per mL.

### Pneumococcal purpura fulminans in asplenic or hyposplenic patients: a French multicenter exposed-unexposed retrospective cohort study [^cd0996ce]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

In the present study, only 35% of the patients with asplenia or hyposplenia had received a pneumococcal vaccination despite current recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, it is worth noticing that 2/34 (6%) patients were not aware of their asplenic status since asplenia was diagnosed in the ICU and revealed by the pneumococcal purpura fulminans episode. Moreover, given the wide study period (17 years), recommendations about pneumococcal vaccination may have varied over time. The vaccination rate observed in our cohort is consistent with the 31% rate reported by Waghorn et al. in a series of 77 patients with overwhelming post-splenectomy infection. In a recent multicenter German cohort study including 52 patients with overwhelming post-splenectomy infection, only 11 (21%) had received a pneumococcal vaccination within the past 5 years. In the global population of splenectomized patients without infection, the coverage of pneumococcal vaccination rates is as high as 80%. Our finding of one third of the asplenic/hyposplenic patients with pneumococcal purpura fulminans having received a pneumococcal vaccination emphasizes that pneumococcal vaccination may reduce but does not abolish the risk of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection in splenectomized patients.

Our study showed similar severity levels and outcomes between patients with and without asplenia/hyposplenia. This observation is in line with a prospective multicenter German cohort study reporting a similar ICU, 7-day or 28-day mortality between patients with overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (from every cause and pathogen) and matched patients without asplenia or hyposplenia. Similarly, a large prospective Canadian cohort study including 2435 patients with invasive pneumococcal disease over a 15-year period reported on similar in-hospital mortality rates between asplenic/hyposplenic and eusplenic non-ICU patients. This observation underlines the fact that asplenia is a risk factor for severe pneumococcal sepsis but seems not to worsen the course of a declared sepsis, pointing out that our efforts must focus on preventing the disease. In this regard, a retrospective Australian before-after study recently showed that including patients in a registry of asplenic patients (with educational kit containing information sheet, alert cards regarding the history of splenectomy, educational DVD, personalized vaccine report, information regarding antibiotic prophylaxis, emergency plan in case of fever, newsletter to their general practitioners with updates regarding recommended vaccinations and booster doses) was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of infections caused by encapsulated bacteria after splenectomy.

### The bleeding risk and natural history of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in patients with persistent low platelet counts… [^e4ee8c1a]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Otherwise, the patient will remain in the ITP state for the next cycle. A 30-year-old woman remaining thrombocytopenic due to ITP was predicted to lose 20. 4 years of her potential life expectancy. At age 70, predicted loss was 9. 4 years. Conclusions. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura with persistent low platelet counts carries a grave prognosis. Therefore, an active therapeutic approach in the clinical management of affected patients should be considered. In view of the significant potential implications of the model results, we call for initiating a well-designed prospective inception cohort study of patients with ITP. Such dilemmas arise in patients refractory to first-line therapy or those at high risk for adverse effects.

Hence, the consequences of withholding treatment must be weighed against immediate and long-term risks associated with this treatment.
3. Knowledge of the natural history of ITP in terms of bleeding risk and decline in life expectancy and quality of life could greatly contribute to the decision process. In this article, we attempt to estimate the prognosis of patients with ITP involving persistent low platelet counts by performing quantitative assessment of bleeding risk in ITP based on pooled data obtained from the literature and determining the effect of this bleeding risk and remission rate on LE and quality-adjusted LE. We considered patients with ITP to be at risk for major hemorrhage when their platelet counts fell below 30×10⁹/L.

1–3 The analysis referred to 4 bleeding categories: fatal bleeding events; hemorrhagic strokes with residual disability; major "transient" bleeding events requiring hospitalization, but without long-term sequelae; and minor oozing and bruising. We assumed no difference in bleeding rates between the sexes. absence of such fatalities within the study period was clearly reported; the study period had been sufficiently characterized; and the number of patients at risk for thrombopenic hemorrhage during the study follow-up period was reported.

Patient time at risk for major bleeding events included the period prior to response to therapy in all patients and the follow-up period among refractory patients or patients who had experienced relapse. Time until response was estimated according to the treatment modality used: 2, 3, and 4 weeks for splenectomy, corticosteroid treatment, and cytotoxic therapy, respectively. Estimation of the follow-up period for patients who did not respond to therapy or those who experienced a relapse was either the exact period of follow-up, when reported, or when the exact period was not stated, we estimated a plausible range between a high boundary maximum follow-up period in the study and a low boundary. We selected this low boundary based on the assumption that patients who remained thrombopenic tended to continue with medical attention for longer rather than shorter periods.

### Splenectomy and the risk of sepsis: a population-based cohort study [^8fb54a81]. Annals of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to estimate the long-term risk of sepsis in patients who underwent splenectomy before, during, and after implementation of vaccination.

Background

Because patients who have undergone splenectomy are considered at increased risk of bacterial sepsis, they typically receive vaccination, education, and occasionally antibiotic prophylaxis. However, the extent to which these interventions have actually reduced the risk of sepsis remains unclear.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study encompassing all patients in the Swedish national inpatient register, who underwent splenectomy in 1970–2009. Patients were followed for hospitalization for or death from sepsis, as identified using national inpatient and cause of death registers. Relative risks, comparing patients to the background population were expressed as standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs).

Results

Altogether, 20,132 splenectomized patients were included. The overall SIR for hospitalization for sepsis was 5.7 [95% confidence interval (CI), 5.6–6.0]. However, risks depended on the indication for splenectomy, with SIRs varying from 3.4 (95% CI, 3.0–3.8) for trauma patients to 18 (95% CI, 16–19) for patients with hematologic malignancies. SMRs ranged from 3.1 (95% CI, 2.1–4.3) for trauma to 8.7 (95% CI, 6.8–11) for hematologic disease. In regression analyses adjusting for age at splenectomy, follow-up time, sex, and calendar year of splenectomy, there were no significant risk decreases after implementation of routine vaccination, except for in patients with malignant and non-malignant hematologic disease.

Conclusions

The risk of hospitalization or death from sepsis is high in patients who previously underwent splenectomy and depends on the indication for splenectomy. The effectiveness of current vaccination practices warrants further evaluation.
