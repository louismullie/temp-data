## Question

Can elevated CK cause muscle weakness

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether elevated creatine kinase (CK) can cause muscle weakness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what CK actually represents and whether it is a cause or a marker of muscle injury. Then, I should verify the clinical contexts where CK and weakness co-occur, such as rhabdomyolysis, statin-associated myopathy, and inflammatory myopathies. Next, I will examine the direction of causality: does CK elevation lead to weakness, or does muscle damage cause both weakness and CK release. After that, I need to check for exceptions where CK is high without weakness and vice versa. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and outline practical clinical implications for evaluation and management.

> Let me first confirm the biology. CK is an intracellular enzyme abundant in skeletal muscle that leaks into the bloodstream when muscle fibers are damaged. It is a biomarker of muscle injury rather than a mediator of weakness itself, so CK does not directly cause weakness, it signals that muscle damage has occurred [^116m285X] [^111dhbCP].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical syndromes where CK and weakness travel together. In rhabdomyolysis, patients often have myalgia, weakness, and marked CK elevations, sometimes exceeding 50,000 IU/L, reflecting extensive muscle breakdown; weakness here is due to muscle fiber necrosis and loss of contractile function, not the CK molecule itself [^111Xh7su] [^1123GacT]. Similarly, statin-associated myopathy spans myalgia, weakness, and CK elevations, with severe cases meeting myopathy criteria (symptoms plus CK > 10× ULN); again, the weakness is from the underlying myotoxic process, not CK itself [^1157vY8W] [^117UHuFY]. Inflammatory myopathies such as dermatomyositis and immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy present with proximal weakness and elevated CK, where immune-mediated fiber injury drives both symptoms and enzyme release [^114dg47i] [^1175Lsnq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. I should confirm the direction of the relationship: muscle fiber injury causes both weakness (impaired force generation) and CK release (enzyme leak), so CK and weakness are correlated but CK is not the causal agent; this is why guidelines and reviews consistently treat CK as a marker to be interpreted in clinical context rather than a pathogenic driver of weakness [^116m285X].

> But wait, what if CK is high and there is no weakness? I need to check for exceptions. Asymptomatic hyperCKemia is well described and can persist without weakness, including in neuromuscular carriers and some medication-associated states; conversely, weakness can occur with normal CK in certain myopathies, such as some congenital myopathies, metabolic myopathies, and even statin-associated myopathy with normal CK on occasion, underscoring that CK is an imperfect correlate of symptom severity [^116V6LpS] [^116PvCis] [^116WijLD] [^114K77JT].

> Let me consider exertional settings to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. After unaccustomed strenuous exercise, CK commonly rises and may reach levels that would otherwise sound alarming, yet many individuals have minimal or no weakness. This supports the concept that CK reflects muscle fiber stress or microtrauma rather than a direct cause of weakness, and that clinical correlation is essential before labeling rhabdomyolysis [^115TCakZ] [^112WZ4M1].

> I should double-check the clinical implications so the answer is actionable. When weakness and CK elevation coexist, evaluate for causes of muscle injury such as statins or other myotoxins, inflammatory myopathies, metabolic or endocrine disorders (for example, hypothyroidism), infections like COVID-19, and genetic muscle diseases; management targets the underlying process, not the CK value itself, and CK is used to gauge severity and monitor recovery rather than as a treatment target [^115tgyVz] [^1111rCYZ] [^1163SH7q] [^111HHQQU].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise: elevated CK does not cause muscle weakness. Rather, CK elevation is a marker that accompanies weakness when muscle fibers are damaged by various pathologic processes, so the correct clinical inference is that concurrent CK elevation and weakness indicate underlying muscle injury that warrants targeted evaluation and treatment of the cause [^116m285X] [^111dhbCP].

---

Elevated CK does not directly cause muscle weakness; it is a **marker of muscle injury** [^116m285X] from conditions such as rhabdomyolysis [^111dhbCP], statin myopathy [^1157vY8W], or inflammatory myopathies [^114K77JT]. Weakness results from the underlying muscle damage, not CK itself [^116m285X]. CK elevation alone is insufficient to explain weakness; **evaluate for the cause** and manage accordingly [^115tgyVz].

---

## Pathophysiological relationship between elevated CK and muscle weakness

CK is an enzyme released from damaged muscle cells; elevated levels reflect **muscle injury**, not a direct cause of weakness [^116m285X]. Weakness arises from the underlying muscle damage — such as rhabdomyolysis [^111dhbCP], statin-associated myopathy [^1157vY8W], or inflammatory myopathies [^1157cM6m] — rather than from CK itself [^116V6LpS].

---

## Clinical conditions associated with elevated CK and muscle weakness

Several conditions present with both elevated CK and muscle weakness, including:

| **Clinical condition** | **Description** | **Relationship to ck and weakness** |
|-|-|-|
| Rhabdomyolysis | Rapid muscle breakdown releasing CK and myoglobin [^111dhbCP] | CK elevation indicates muscle damage; weakness results from muscle necrosis [^1123GacT] |
| Statin-associated myopathy | Muscle injury from statins, ranging from mild myalgia to severe myopathy [^1157vY8W] | CK elevation reflects muscle injury; weakness results from muscle damage [^117UHuFY] |
| Inflammatory myopathies (e.g. polymyositis, dermatomyositis) | Autoimmune muscle inflammation and necrosis [^114K77JT] | CK elevation indicates muscle damage; weakness results from inflammation and necrosis [^114K77JT] |
| Metabolic myopathies (e.g. McArdle disease) | Genetic defects in muscle energy metabolism [^112jYcsh] | CK elevation reflects muscle damage during exertion; weakness results from energy deficiency [^112jYcsh] |

---

## Mechanisms of muscle weakness in conditions with elevated CK

Muscle weakness in these conditions results from:

- **Muscle fiber necrosis**: Direct damage causing loss of contractile function [^1157DtUA].
- **Inflammation**: Autoimmune or drug-induced inflammation impairs function [^1155CUD6].
- **Metabolic impairment**: Energy deficits cause fatigue and weakness [^115bngEc].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia or hyperkalemia from muscle breakdown can cause weakness [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the association

Clinical studies and guidelines support the link between elevated CK and weakness:

- **Rhabdomyolysis**: CK > 5× ULN with weakness and myoglobinuria defines rhabdomyolysis [^1123GacT] [^116mXx2Z].
- **Statin-associated myopathy**: CK elevation with weakness is a recognized adverse effect [^1157vY8W] [^117UHuFY].
- **Inflammatory myopathies**: CK elevation with weakness is a hallmark of polymyositis and dermatomyositis [^114K77JT].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

CK elevation alone does not explain weakness; **additional factors** include:

- **Severity of muscle damage**: Higher CK generally reflects more extensive injury and weakness [^116KXUVA].
- **Individual variability**: Baseline CK and genetic factors influence symptom severity [^notfound].
- **Concurrent conditions**: Electrolyte disturbances, medications, and comorbidities can modulate symptoms [^116mXx2Z].

---

## Clinical implications and management

When CK is elevated with weakness, clinicians should:

- **Identify the underlying cause**: History, exam, labs, and imaging to distinguish rhabdomyolysis, statin myopathy, or inflammatory myopathy [^111wBuXL].
- **Monitor CK and renal function**: Track CK trends and watch for renal injury, especially in rhabdomyolysis [^115FofgK].
- **Treat the underlying condition**: Stop offending drugs, provide immunotherapy for inflammatory myopathies, and support recovery [^1175Lsnq].
- **Educate patients**: Explain that CK is a marker, not the cause, and emphasize adherence and follow-up [^116m285X].

---

Elevated CK is a **marker of muscle injury** and does not directly cause weakness; weakness results from the underlying muscle damage. Accurate diagnosis and targeted management of the cause are essential to restore strength [^115tgyVz].

## References

### Evaluation of the patient with muscle weakness [^111wBuXL]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Muscle weakness is a common complaint among patients presenting to family physicians. Diagnosis begins with a patient history distinguishing weakness from fatigue or asthenia, separate conditions with different etiologies that can coexist with, or be confused for, weakness. The pattern and severity of weakness, associated symptoms, medication use, and family history help the physician determine whether the cause of a patient's weakness is infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced. In the physical examination, the physician should objectively document the patient's loss of strength, conduct a neurologic survey, and search for patterns of weakness and extramuscular involvement. If a specific cause of weakness is suspected, the appropriate laboratory or radiologic studies should be performed. Otherwise, electromyography is indicated to confirm the presence of a myopathy or to evaluate for a neuropathy or a disease of the neuromuscular junction. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the examiner should pursue a tiered progression of laboratory studies. Physicians should begin with blood chemistries and a thyroid-stimulating hormone assay to evaluate for electrolyte and endocrine causes, then progress to creatine kinase level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and antinuclear antibody assays to evaluate for rheumatologic, inflammatory, genetic, and metabolic causes. Finally, many myopathies require a biopsy for diagnosis. Pathologic evaluation of the muscle tissue specimen focuses on histologic, histochemical, electron microscopic, biochemical, and genetic analyses; advances in technique have made a definitive diagnosis possible for many myopathies.

5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

LESCOL XL may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statins, including LESCOL XL.

Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in CK, values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) was < 0.1% in fluvastatin clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Avoid concomitant use of LESCOL XL with gemfibrozil, cyclosporin, and fluconazole. When used concomitantly with LESCOL XL, lipid modifying doses (≥ 1 g/day) of niacin, fibrates, and colchicine may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Discontinue LESCOL XL if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK increases may resolve if LESCOL XL is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue LESCOL XL in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, e.g., sepsis, shock, severe hypovolemia, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders, or uncontrolled epilepsy.

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting LESCOL XL. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy

There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum CK, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody, muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy, and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue LESCOL XL if IMNM is suspected.

### Pitavastatin calcium [^1178X11A]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Pitavastatin may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statins, including pitavastatin.

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher pitavastatin dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Drug Interactions (7), and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)]. Dosages of pitavastatin greater than 4 mg once daily were associated with an increased risk for severe myopathy in premarketing clinical studies. The maximum recommended dose of pitavastatin is 4 mg once daily.

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Pitavastatin is contraindicated in patients taking cyclosporine and not recommended in patients taking gemfibrozil [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. There are pitavastatin dosage restrictions for patients taking erythromycin or rifampin [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The following drugs when used concomitantly with pitavastatin may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis: lipid-modifying dosages of niacin (> 1grams/day), fibrates, and colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Discontinue pitavastatin if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if pitavastatin is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue pitavastatin in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy).

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the pitavastatin dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^113FSL2h]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Statin therapy is the cornerstone for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and is generally safe and well tolerated. In randomized, controlled trials (RCTs), adverse event rates (including complaints of muscle pain) are similar in statin and placebo groups, – and compare favourably with event rates for other agents commonly used in CVD prevention, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitorsand beta-blockers. However, statins do cause a rare side-effect known as myositis, defined as muscle symptoms in association with a substantially elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) concentration. Creatine kinase is the enzyme released from damaged muscle cells, and CK elevations > 10× the upper limit of normal (ULN) occur in 1 per 1000 to 1 per 10 000 people per year, depending on the statin, its dose, and the presence of other risk factors. Over the last decade, a series of observational studies have attributed a number of other adverse effects to statins, including musculoskeletal complaints, gastro-intestinal discomfort, fatigue, liver enzyme elevation, peripheral neuropathy, insomnia, and neurocognitive symptoms. In addition, randomized trials have shown a small increase in the risk of incident diabetes. – Muscle symptoms, the most prevalent of these effects, are the focus of this review.

In contrast to RCTs, patient registries, together with clinical experience, indicate that 7–29% of patients complain of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). – These are usually associated with normal or slightly elevated CK concentrations. Statin-associated muscle symptoms likely contribute significantly to the very high discontinuation rates of statin therapy (up to 75%) within 2 years of initiation. Indeed, in 65% of former statin users, the main reason for statin non-adherence or discontinuation was the onset of side effects, predominantly muscle-related effects. Such non-adherence/discontinuation from treatment may have a marked impact on CVD benefit, as suggested by the higher mortality in elderly secondary prevention patients with low vs. high adherence to statin therapy (24% vs. 16%, respectively; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.25; P = 0.001). Similarly, a meta-analysis showed a 15% lower CVD risk in patients who were adherent to statins compared with those with low adherence.

### Disease spectrum of myopathies with elevated aldolase and normal creatine kinase [^114K77JT]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Creatine kinase (CK) is a muscle enzyme involved in the phosphocreatine circuit for energy supply of muscles, whilst aldolase is a glycolytic enzyme abundantly expressed in not only muscles but also liver, brain and red blood cells. Elevation of serum CK (hyperCKemia) and aldolase level is considered a biomarker of muscle damage secondary to a leakage of these cytosolic enzymes into the bloodstream. HyperCKemia is often accompanied by high aldolase level. The magnitude of CK elevation generally directly correlates with the number of necrotic fibers. CK level can be normal in myopathies without prominent necrotizing pathology, for example congenital myopathies or metabolic myopathies. Immune‐mediated myopathies generally feature a significant degree of necrotic fibers and CK elevation; however, a proportion of patients with dermatomyositis, inflammatory myopathy or polymyositis, inflammatory myopathy with perimysial pathology, scleroderma myopathy and eosinophilic fasciitis can have normal serum CK levels with elevated aldolase levels. In skeletal muscle, aldolase is abundantly expressed in myoblasts in the early stage of differentiation and in regenerating fibers, whilst CK expression in these cells is minimal to none. It is hypothesized that immune‐mediated destruction of these regenerating myofibers may underlie the discrepancy of aldolase elevation and normal CK level. In some patients in whom myodegeneration is not a prominent histopathological feature (e.g. eosinophilic fasciitis), aldolase may be derived from cells other than myofibers. Herein, the aim was to investigate the disease spectrum of myopathies with elevated aldolase and normal CK level.

### What are the normal serum creatine kinase values for skeletal muscle? A worldwide systematic review [^1158bzqN]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Creatine kinase (CK) has been recognized as an essential marker for muscle disease since 1959. It is universally utilized in the diagnostic evaluation of neuromuscular disorders; however, high CK levels often appear in oligo‐symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals. Oligosymptomatic individuals may experience nonspecific muscle symptoms, including myalgia, stiffness, fatigue, or muscle cramps. Such symptoms were common in individuals with either normal CK or hyperCKemia in the Tromsø study, the largest epidemiologic study of hyperCKemia in the general population. The prevalence of hyperCKemia in the Tromsø study, which included 12,828 individuals, was 1.3%. Although CK is a marker of primary muscle disease, various non‐myopathic causes can result in oligo/asymptomatic hyperCKemia. These include strenuous exercise, certain medications (especially statins), as well as cardiac, endocrine, and metabolic conditions, trauma, intramuscular injections, and alcohol, among others. Similarly, normal values are influenced by gender, race, and age. Therefore, establishing an appropriate normal range for CK is crucial before deciding to investigate a patient further, especially if they are oligo/asymptomatic. This decision is especially relevant today, as next‐generation sequencing can offer a prompt and precise diagnosis. The accepted approach to managing muscle disease that presents with oligo/asymptomatic hyperCKemia is to diagnose and treat it early and, when appropriate, provide genetic counseling for the family. The significance of establishing normal CK levels was emphasized by the EFNS Guideline group task force, which discussed the diagnostic approach to oligo/asymptomatic hyperCKemia. We conducted a systematic review to better estimate the normal values of total CK in different racial groups. In the study, the total CK is referred to as CK.

### Lovastatin [^1163YsDK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis

Lovastatin, like other inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, occasionally causes myopathy manifested as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Myopathy sometimes takes the form of rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, and rare fatalities have occurred. The risk of myopathy is increased by high levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma.

The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is dose related. In a clinical study (EXCEL) in which patients were carefully monitored and some interacting drugs were excluded, there was one case of myopathy among 4933 patients randomized to lovastatin 20 to 40 mg daily for 48 weeks, and 4 among 1649 patients randomized to 80 mg daily.

All patients starting therapy with lovastatin, or whose dose of lovastatin is being increased, should be advised of the risk of myopathy and told to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing Lovastatin. Lovastatin therapy should be discontinued immediately if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued. Periodic CK determinations may be considered in patients starting therapy with lovastatin or whose dose is being increased, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent myopathy.

Many of the patients who have developed rhabdomyolysis on therapy with lovastatin have had complicated medical histories, including renal insufficiency usually as a consequence of long-standing diabetes mellitus. Such patients merit closer monitoring. Lovastatin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Lovatsatin therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient experiencing an acute or serious condition predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, e.g., sepsis; hypotension; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy.

The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant use of lovastatin with the following:

Heterozygous 46, XX individuals — Neuromuscular manifestations can occur and sometimes progress over time, commonly including muscle weakness (which may be asymmetric), myalgias, cramping, calf hypertrophy, and fatigue; a study using isokinetic dynamometry found weakness greater than 1 SD below age norms in 40% of heterozygous XX individuals, with a higher proportion meeting myopathy criteria by serum CK levels; CK levels may be elevated, tend to normalize with age, and symptomatic XX individuals generally have higher CK levels.

### Muscle biopsy in the evaluation of patients with modestly elevated creatine kinase levels [^113joitC]. Muscle & Nerve (2003). Low credibility.

The utility of muscle biopsy in patients with modest elevations of serum creatine kinase (CK) level but normal neurological examinations and nondiagnostic electrodiagnostic studies is uncertain. We performed systematic, extensive studies on muscle biopsies of 20 such patients. A definitive diagnosis was arrived at in only 1 by histochemical studies, although 4 others demonstrated minor myopathic changes. Biochemical evaluation led to a diagnosis in an additional 5. Muscle biopsy is useful for evaluating such patients, but extensive studies of the muscle are necessary.

### Hypothyroid myopathy with a strikingly elevated serum creatine kinase level [^116BjiRP]. Muscle & Nerve (2002). Low credibility.

Although serum creatine kinase (CK) levels are frequently modestly elevated in patients with hypothyroid myopathy, elevations in serum CK to the levels usually seen in inflammatory myopathies or dystrophies are rare. We report a patient with progressive proximal weakness and a serum CK level of over 29,000 IU/L, in whom subsequent laboratory evaluation identified profound hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy resulted in resolution of clinical symptoms and a marked reduction in the serum CK level. Such a high serum CK level in a patient with hypothyroidism underscores the importance of assessing thyroid function in patients with weakness, regardless of serum CK levels, even when systemic symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism are minimal or absent.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Monitoring for statin-associated side effects — CK and liver enzymes: "it is recommended that CK be measured in the case of severe SAMS and in the presence of objective muscle weakness", and "the FDA recommends measuring transaminases… if there are signs or symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity". An "asymptomatic increase in transaminases (> 3 times upper limit of normal) is an infrequent statin-associated side effect" that often resolves with dose adjustment, while "Severe statin-associated hepatotoxicity is rare, and the incidence is not impacted by routine monitoring of transaminases", and evaluation for nonstatin causes "is warranted" if elevations persist. "Statins are not contraindicated in patients with increased ASCVD risk with chronic, stable liver disease", and, overall, "CK and transaminase levels should not be routinely measured".

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^114yd8g7]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is the combination of symptoms (myalgia, weakness and muscle swelling) and a substantial rise in serum creatine kinase (CK) > 50000 IU/L; there are many causes, but here we specifically address exertional rhabdomyolysis. The consequences of this condition can be severe, including acute kidney injury and requirement for higher level care with organ support. Most patients have 'physiological' exertional rhabdomyolysis with no underlying disease; they do not need investigation and should be advised to return to normal activities in a graded fashion. Rarely, exertional rhabdomyolysis may be the initial presentation of underlying muscle disease, and we review how to identify this much smaller group of patients, who do require investigation.

### Genetic counseling for the dystrophinopathies-practice resource of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^111Hvba3]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). High credibility.

Dystrophinopathies — initial laboratory testing and creatine kinase (CK) interpretation notes that a serum CK level is typically the first test and is a simple, inexpensive test; hemizygous XY individuals with DMD/BMD will have serum CK levels of > 2000 IU/L, whereas elevated CK within 500–1200 IU/L may indicate other neuromuscular or non-neuromuscular conditions; an elevated CK usually prompts referral to neurology and/or genetics.

### MLIP causes recessive myopathy with rhabdomyolysis, myalgia and baseline elevated serum creatine kinase [^112W4Dbc]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

Striated muscle needs to maintain cellular homeostasis in adaptation to increases in physiological and metabolic demands. Failure to do so can result in rhabdomyolysis. The identification of novel genetic conditions associated with rhabdomyolysis helps to shed light on hitherto unrecognized homeostatic mechanisms. Here we report seven individuals in six families from different ethnic backgrounds with biallelic variants in MLIP, which encodes the muscular lamin A/C-interacting protein, MLIP. Patients presented with a consistent phenotype characterized by mild muscle weakness, exercise-induced muscle pain, variable susceptibility to episodes of rhabdomyolysis, and persistent basal elevated serum creatine kinase levels. The biallelic truncating variants were predicted to result in disruption of the nuclear localizing signal of MLIP. Additionally, reduced overall RNA expression levels of the predominant MLIP isoform were observed in patients' skeletal muscle. Collectively, our data increase the understanding of the genetic landscape of rhabdomyolysis to now include MLIP as a novel disease gene in humans and solidifies MLIP's role in normal and diseased skeletal muscle homeostasis.

### Pitavastatin magnesium (Zypitamag) [^116NhEHo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

ZYPITAMAG may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statins, including pitavastatin.

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher ZYPITAMAG dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Drug Interactions (7), and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)].

Dosages of pitavastatin greater than 4 mg once daily were associated with an increased risk for severe myopathy in premarketing clinical studies. The maximum recommended dose of ZYPITAMAG is 4 mg once daily.

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

ZYPITAMAG is contraindicated in patients taking cyclosporine and not recommended in patients taking gemfibrozil [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. There are pitavastatin dosage restrictions for patients taking erythromycin or rifampin [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The following drugs when used concomitantly with ZYPITAMAG may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis: lipid-modifying dosages of niacin (> 1 grams/day), fibrates, and colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Discontinue ZYPITAMAG if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if ZYPITAMAG is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue ZYPITAMAG in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy).

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the ZYPITAMAG dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

### Statin-associated myopathy with normal creatine kinase levels [^116WijLD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Muscle symptoms in patients who are treated with statins and have normal creatine kinase levels are not well understood.

Objective

To report biopsy-confirmed myopathy and normal creatine kinase levels associated with statin use.

Design

Case reports from preliminary analysis of an ongoing clinical trial.

Setting

Clinical research center in a community hospital.

Patients

Four patients with muscle symptoms that developed during statin therapy and reversed during placebo use.

Measurements

1) Patients' ability to identify blinded statin therapy and 2) standard measures of functional capacity and muscle strength.

Results

All four patients repeatedly distinguished blinded statin therapy from placebo. Strength testing confirmed weakness during statin therapy that reversed during placebo use. Muscle biopsies showed evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction, including abnormally increased lipid stores, fibers that did not stain for cytochrome oxidase activity, and ragged red fibers. These findings reversed in the three patients who had repeated biopsy when they were not receiving statins. Creatine kinase levels were normal in all four patients despite the presence of significant myopathy.

Conclusion

Some patients who develop muscle symptoms while receiving statin therapy have demonstrable weakness and histopathologic findings of myopathy despite normal serum creatine kinase levels.

### Pregabalin (pregabalin extended release) [^114oAo7m]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.11 Creatine Kinase Elevations

LYRICA treatment was associated with creatine kinase elevations. Mean changes in creatine kinase from baseline to the maximum value were 60 U/L for LYRICA-treated patients and 28 U/L for the placebo patients. In all controlled trials across multiple patient populations, 1.5% of patients on LYRICA and 0.7% of placebo patients had a value of creatine kinase at least 3 times the upper limit of normal. Three LYRICA-treated subjects had events reported as rhabdomyolysis in premarketing clinical trials. The relationship between these myopathy events and LYRICA is not completely understood because the cases had documented factors that may have caused or contributed to these events. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if these muscle symptoms are accompanied by malaise or fever. Discontinue treatment with pregabalin extended-release tablets if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected or if markedly elevated creatine kinase levels occur.

5.12 Decreased Platelet Count

Both pregabalin extended-release tablets and LYRICA treatment were associated with a decrease in platelet count. In the double-blind phase of controlled studies for pain indication, pregabalin extended-release tablets-treated patients experienced a median change from baseline in platelet count of 11 × 103/mm3(for the PHN population) and 14 × 103/mm3(for the FM population) as compared to 1 × 103/mm3in placebo-treated patients (for both populations). LYRICA-treated patients experienced a mean maximal decrease in platelet count of 20 × 103/mcL, compared to 11 × 103/mcL in placebo patients. In the overall database of controlled trials, 2% of placebo patients and 3% of LYRICA patients experienced a potentially clinically significant decrease in platelets, defined as 20% below baseline value and less than 150 × 103/mcL. A single LYRICA-treated subject developed severe thrombocytopenia with a platelet count less than 20 × 103/mcL. In randomized controlled trials, LYRICA or pregabalin extended-release tablets were not associated with an increase in bleeding-related adverse reactions.

### Identifying inherited metabolic disorders in children: the role of elevated creatine kinase [^112jYcsh]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Creatine kinase (CK) is an essential enzyme predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain tissue, where it facilitates energy homeostasis by catalyzing the conversion of creatine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). CK elevation is a key biochemical marker for muscle integrity and is widely used in diagnosing neuromuscular disorders, particularly in pediatric patients. However, the underlying causes of CK elevation vary, encompassing both inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs) and primary myopathies. The differential diagnosis of these conditions requires a systematic approach integrating clinical, biochemical, and genetic assessments.

Among IMDs, disorders such as glycogen storage diseases (GSDs), fatty acid oxidation defects (FAODs), and mitochondrial disorders frequently present with CK elevation, often accompanied by additional biochemical abnormalities such as elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In addition, neuromuscular diseases, including muscular dystrophies and inflammatory myopathies, also manifest with increased CK levels, necessitating careful differentiation. Moreover, non-metabolic factors such as trauma, viral myositis, exercise-induced muscle damage, and drug-induced myopathies (e.g. statins, corticosteroids) further complicate the diagnostic process.

Despite the widespread use of CK as a screening tool, there is no universal consensus on CK cut-off values that reliably distinguish metabolic from neuromuscular conditions. CK thresholds used in clinical practice may differ based on laboratory-specific reference values, and there is variability in reference ranges across different populations and age groups. In our institution, a CK level exceeding 171 U/L is considered elevated based on laboratory-defined upper limits. Previous studies, such as Schumann and Klauke, have also defined the upper normal CK limit as 171 U/L based on the 97.5th percentile of reference samples, which aligns with our institutional threshold. While some sources suggest that CK levels exceeding 1000 U/L warrant investigation for muscle disorders, there is still a lack of standardized reference values specific to pediatric metabolic diseases, underscoring the need for further research in this area.

### Effect of newly proposed CK reference limits on neuromuscular diagnosis [^113Vufxw]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

The objective was to determine the effect of a proposed increase in the upper reference limits of serum creatine kinase (CK) on neuromuscular disease diagnosis. This was a retrospective study of 94 Caucasian subjects (49 women and 45 men) in whom a neuromuscular physician ordered a CK as part of their evaluation. The patients were divided into two groups: those with diagnoses that either should or could elevate serum CK, and those with diagnoses that should not elevate serum CK. Sensitivities and specificities of the manufacturer's and the newly proposed upper reference limits were determined. For women, raising the upper reference limit of CK from 140 IU/L to 201 IU/L reduced the sensitivity of the test from 50% to 29%, while increasing the specificity from 67% to 80%. For men, raising the upper reference limit of CK from 174 IU/L to 322 IU/L reduced the sensitivity from 80% to 60%, while increasing the specificity from 63% to 80%. The newly proposed upper reference limits resulted in a false-negative CK of clinical significance in 7 of 94 subjects. Increasing the upper reference limit for CK reduced the sensitivity and increased the specificity of serum CK for neuromuscular disease diagnosis. Such a change will reduce unnecessary referrals and invasive diagnostic testing in patients with asymptomatic CK elevations. The clinical impact of the loss in sensitivity is small. If these new upper reference limits are adopted, neuromuscular physicians should be aware that a normal CK level does not exclude a diagnosis of myopathy.

### Muscle weakness with a hidden cause [^114dg47i]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Laboratory testing revealed elevated creatine kinase (CK 10 226 U/L; upper limit of normal (ULN) 170 U/L), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH 766 U/L; ULN 240 U/L), and transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 433 U/L; ULN 50 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 158 U/L; ULN 45 U/L). CRP (11 mg/L; ULN 5 mg/L) and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR 30 mm/h; ULN 8 mm/h) were slightly elevated, while leucocyte counts were normal. A mildly elevated high-sensitivity (hs) troponin T level (80 ng/L; ULN 14 ng/L) did not increase in a 1-hour and 3-hour follow-up. Echocardiography and ECG were unremarkable, and the patient had no signs of acute coronary syndrome. We therefore did not suspect heart disease, especially since active muscle diseases can be associated with elevated hs troponin T levels. Nevertheless, we chose to closely monitor his troponin T levels but did not detect further elevations in the subsequent follow-up period.

Based on these clinical and laboratory findings, a diagnosis of DM was suspected.

A subsequent screen for myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSA) was positive for anti-NXP-2 antibodies. Furthermore, an MRI of the right shoulder and plexus was remarkable for ubiquitous subcutaneous and muscle oedema. An MRI-correlated biopsy of the right deltoid muscle revealed T-lymphocytic myositis with accompanying fasciitis and perifasciitis. The cellular infiltrate particularly consisted of CD3-positive lymphocytes and CD68-positive macrophages, compatible with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate in DM (figure 2). Initial serological results (ANA titres, ANCA) remained negative.

### Pitavastatin (Nikita) [^116xEFsm]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

NIKITA may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) above ten times the upper limit of normal) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statins, including NIKITA.

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher NIKITA dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Drug Interactions (7), and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)]. Dosages of pitavastatin greater than 4 mg once daily were associated with an increased risk for severe myopathy in premarketing clinical studies. The maximum recommended dose of NIKITA is 4 mg once daily.

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

NIKITA is contraindicated in patients taking cyclosporine and not recommended in patients taking gemfibrozil [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. There are NIKITA dosage restrictions for patients taking erythromycin or rifampin [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The following drugs when used concomitantly with NIKITA may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis: lipid-modifying dosages of niacin (> 1grams/day), fibrates, and colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Discontinue NIKITA if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if NIKITA is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue NIKITA in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy).

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the NIKITA dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^115FofgK]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with muscle symptoms and elevated serum creatine kinase levels (> 4× upper limit of normal)

For patients at low CVD risk who have symptoms with CK > 4× ULN, the statin should be stopped and the need for statin reassessed. If considered important, a lower dose of an alternative statin should be tried and CK monitored. For patients at high CVD risk with muscle symptoms and a CK of > 4× ULN (but < 10× ULN), statin therapy can be continued with concomitant monitoring of CK, but stopped (at least temporarily) if the levels exceed 10× ULN. In this case, that particular statin regimen should not be restarted. If CK levels decrease after stopping the statin, restarting at a lower statin dose with CK monitoring should be tried. If, however, CK elevation persists, there may be an underlying myopathy (e.g. hypothyroidism or a metabolic muscle disorder), and referral to a neuromuscular specialist should be considered.

In patients with a CK > 10× ULN for which no secondary cause (e.g. exercise) can be found, statin therapy should be stopped because of the potential risk of rhabdomyolysis. If the CK level subsequently returns to normal, re-challenge with a lower dose of an alternative statin and careful monitoring of symptoms and CK may be considered. If rhabdomyolysis is suspected, statin should not be reintroduced. Rhabdomyolysis should be considered if there is severe muscular pain, general weakness and signs of myoglobinaemia or myoglobinuria. These patients, and those with very high CK levels (e.g. > 40× ULN), should be referred for evaluation of renal damage (urinalysis, serum creatinine levels). Intravenous hydration and urine alkalinisation are recommended for the treatment of rhabdomyolyis depending on severity and the presence of kidney injury. If indicated, non-statin LDL-C lowering agents should be used (see below).

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Statin safety — laboratory monitoring and supplements: In patients treated with statins, it is recommended to measure creatine kinase levels in those with severe statin-associated muscle symptoms or objective muscle weakness and to measure liver transaminases, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase if symptoms suggest hepatotoxicity. Coenzyme Q10 is not recommended for routine use in patients treated with statins or for the treatment of SAMS, and routine measurements of creatine kinase and transaminase levels are not useful in statin-treated patients.

### Pompe disease, the must-not-miss diagnosis: a report of 3 patients [^116eSdou]. Muscle & Nerve (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pompe disease is a progressive and debilitating neuromuscular disorder that presents with a heterogeneous array of signs and symptoms including proximal muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency, and/or elevated creatine kinase levels. It mimics other neuromuscular disorders, making its diagnosis challenging and often significantly delayed, thereby increasing morbidity and early mortality of the disease.

Methods

Three Pompe disease patients are discussed to highlight the challenging path to diagnosis and the common cluster of symptoms that could lead to timely and accurate diagnosis.

Results

After significant delays in diagnosis, Pompe disease was diagnosed on the basis of the pattern of proximal weakness.

Conclusions

Suspicion and recognition of the characteristic symptoms of Pompe disease may improve both the timing and accuracy of the diagnosis, which will improve clinical outcomes and minimize disease progression.

### Serum creatine kinase: requesting and interpreting results [^116m285X]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Creatine kinase is an intracellular enzyme found abundantly in skeletal muscle, myocardium and brain. It is well known as a biomarker that increases following skeletal muscle damage and doctors instinctively associate it with myopathies. Serum creatine kinase is undoubtedly often raised in many myopathies and the extent of increase may provide a clue to the myopathic culprit. However, in other myopathies, it may be normal or only marginally raised, and rarely it is normal when the underlying pathology suggests that it should be very raised. Creatine kinase can also be raised in neurogenic disorders, and it can help in the investigation of some neurological disorders that are unrelated to neuromuscular disease. Finally, it may be discovered to be mysteriously elevated without a clear clinical correlate. Here, we examine each of these conundrums, beginning with the clinical problem at hand.

### Independent risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy and relevance to different types of muscle symptom [^114g4cT3]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

A better understanding of factors affecting the risk of myopathy due to statin therapy could help guide safer prescribing in people at higher risk of it (e.g. use of lower doses of more potent statins, perhaps in combination with other LDL-lowering agents) and support more regular monitoring strategies for those in higher-risk groups. When patients do report muscle-related symptoms, measurement of CK levels (particularly during the first year of therapy or after an increase in dose or the addition of interacting medications) is warranted not only to detect the rare cases of myopathy but also to identify individuals with moderately elevated levels who may be more likely to develop myopathy. In addition, the much larger number of patients who do not have elevated CK levels can be reassured that their symptoms are not likely to be a pharmacologic consequence of their statin treatment; therefore, they should not stop their statin therapy and put themselves at increased risk of a heart attack or a stroke.

### Causes of hyperCKemia in children: a retrospective cohort study [^1127d3ts]. Journal of Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives: Creatine kinase (CK) is a commonly used screening test for neuromuscular disorders (NMDs). However, hyperCKemia can result from several pathologic and physiologic causes. We analyzed neuromuscular disorders in noninfant children with hyperCKemia including those with no weakness and mild CK elevations (< 5 times the upper limit of normal). We hypothesized that children with mild CK elevation and no weakness would be unlikely to have neuromuscular disorders and require additional evaluation. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated patients between 1 and 18 years of age seen at a single children's hospital over a 3-calendar-year period with initial total CK values greater than the upper limit of normal with at least 2 years of follow-up data. Final diagnoses were analyzed and associations with possible risk factors assessed. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated to assess altering CK cutoff values. Results: Of 260 subjects with hyperCKemia, 18 had a neuromuscular disorder (6.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.2%-10.9%). Of 166 subjects with CK < 5 times the upper limit of normal and no weakness, 8 had a neuromuscular disorder (4.8%, 95% CI 2.3%-9.6%). Weakness (odds ratio [OR] 32.5, 95% CI 4–385, P = 0.0002), and family history of neuromuscular disorders (OR not calculable, P = 0.0003) were associated with neuromuscular disorders. An optimal CK threshold of 777 was identified on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 64%). The most commonly identified neuromuscular disorders were muscular dystrophies, inflammatory myopathies, and metabolic myopathies. Conclusion: Most children with hyperCKemia will not be diagnosed with a neuromuscular disorder, but a significant minority even with mild hyperCKemia and without weakness may warrant additional evaluation.

Statin safety monitoring — targeted testing versus routine labs: In patients treated with statins, it is recommended to measure creatine kinase levels in individuals with severe statin-associated muscle symptoms, objective muscle weakness, and to measure liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase) as well as total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (hepatic panel) if there are symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity. In patients treated with statins, routine measurements of creatine kinase and transaminase levels are not useful.

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^112WZ4M1]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis

Exertional rhabdomyolysis is the combination of muscle symptoms (myalgia, weakness and swelling) and a substantial rise in serum CK (> 50 000 IU/L) in the setting of exercise. Serum CK rises after exercise are common and are asymptomatic in up to half of cases. Mean serum CK values 24 hours after marathons are 3322 IU/L for men (22× baseline) and 946 IU/L for women (9× baseline). The clinical significance of the serum CK concentration is unclear: 6000 IU/L has been cited as the minimum necessary for renal failurebut case reports indicate acute kidney injury may occur with a serum CK of 5000 IU/Land other studies suggest no safe serum concentration of CK. Pragmatically, a rise in CK to > 5000 U/L and/or evidence of end-organ damage (eg, myoglobinuria or decline in renal/liver function) is sufficient for a diagnosis of exertional rhabdomyolysis. Patients with exertional rhabdomyolysis may also experience fever, nausea and decreased/absent urine production. Supportive biochemical findings include hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia, hyperphosphataemia, hypercalcaemia or hypocalcaemia and metabolic acidosis.

Most cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis are caused by heat-related injuries, specifically heat stroke and heat injury. The WHO's International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision includes four overlapping categories relating to exertional heat conditions (table 1). These symptoms are worth enquiring about since rhabdomyolysis in the context of a clear-cut heat-related condition usually does not require further investigation.

### A critical appraisal of lipid management in the post-statin era: comparison on guidelines, therapeutic targets, and screening in a case-based framework of lipid management [^117XaPPe]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Key considerations

- Assessment of SAMS: The first step in managing suspected SAMS is assessing the likelihood of true statin intolerance using a validated tool, such as the National Lipid Association Statin Myalgia Clinic Index. Secondary causes of muscle symptoms should also be evaluated, including,: 1) Drug interactions: Medications that interfere with statin metabolism can increase the risk of SAMS. 2) Hypothyroidism: Although hypothyroidism can contribute to myalgias, thyroid function should be normal before assuming SAMS is the cause. 3) Vitamin D deficiency: Low vitamin D levels can cause muscle pain, but supplementation has not been definitively shown to affect SAMS. 4) Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation: While anecdotal evidence suggests CoQ10 may improve SAMS, data are discordant, and current guidelines do not recommend its routine use. However, patients may choose to try CoQ10 if they wish to continue statin therapy.
- Management of statin intolerance,: 1) Mild symptoms: If the patient's muscle symptoms are mild and do not impair function or quality of life, the statin can be continued, with supportive measures such as stretching, hydration, and sleep hygiene. If symptoms persist, de-escalation of the statin dose or temporary discontinuation with a rechallenge is a reasonable approach. 2) Severe symptoms: If symptoms significantly impact the patient's quality of life, discontinuation of the statin is appropriate. Rechallenge with a lower dose of the same or an alternative statin can be attempted after a 2- to 4-week washout period. Statins like pravastatin or fluvastatin may be better tolerated as they are less likely to cause muscle symptoms.
- **CK testing**: Routine CK testing is not indicated for mild SAMS, as most patients do not have elevated CK levels. However, CK testing is warranted if the patient experiences severe pain, objective muscle weakness, or if CK elevation is suspected. If CK levels exceed 3 × the upper limit of normal, the statin should be discontinued. CK elevations > 5–10× upper limit of normal require urgent evaluation for rhabdomyolysis.
- Pharmacologic alternatives to statins: If statin intolerance is confirmed, alternative LLTs should be considered. The 2022 ACC/AHA ECDP for nonstatin therapies outlines several options: 1) Ezetimibe: As a first-line nonstatin agent, ezetimibe reduces LDL-C by inhibiting cholesterol absorption in the intestine. It is well-tolerated and can be used alone or in combination with the lowest tolerable dose of a statin. 2) Bempedoic acid: The CLEAR Outcomes trial demonstrated that bempedoic acid is an effective option for statin-intolerant patients. Bempedoic acid, in combination with ezetimibe, has LDL-C-lowering efficacy comparable to moderate-intensity statins. This therapy is particularly useful for high-risk primary prevention patients, such as those with diabetes or elevated CAC scores. 3) Bile acid sequestrants: Although second-line agents, bile acid sequestrants can be considered if the patient is unable to tolerate both statins and ezetimibe. However, they may cause gastrointestinal side effects and have limited tolerability. 4) PCSK9 inhibitors: While PCSK9 inhibitors (eg, evolocumab, alirocumab) are not recommended for most primary prevention patients, they can be considered in very-high-risk individuals (eg, those with a CAC score > 1,000 AU or severe dyslipidemia). These agents are more frequently used in secondary prevention or patients with LDL-C > 190 mg/dL. 5) Inclisiran: Although inclisiran (a siRNA-based PCSK9 inhibitor) may offer long-term LDL-C reduction with less-frequent dosing, it lacks cardiovascular outcomes data in statin-intolerant patients and should be used cautiously.
- **Secondary prevention considerations**: If this patient were being treated for secondary prevention (ie, if he had known ASCVD or severe hyperlipidemia with LDL-C > 190 mg/dL), the need for LDL-C lowering would be more urgent. In such cases, more aggressive therapy with statins (if tolerable) or nonstatin agents like PCSK9 inhibitors would be warranted. The goal in secondary prevention is to achieve an LDL-C of < 70 mg/dL or a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline.

### Rosuvastatin (Crestor) [^114t7Ym2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

CRESTOR may cause myopathy [muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK)] and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statins, including CRESTOR.

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher CRESTOR dosage. Asian patients on CRESTOR may be at higher risk for myopathy [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.8)]. The myopathy risk is greater in patients taking CRESTOR 40 mg daily compared with lower CRESTOR dosages.

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

The concomitant use of CRESTOR with cyclosporine or gemfibrozil is not recommended. CRESTOR dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking certain antiviral medications, darolutamide, and regorafenib [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Niacin, fibrates, and colchicine may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Discontinue CRESTOR if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if CRESTOR is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue CRESTOR in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy).

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the CRESTOR dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy

There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue CRESTOR if IMNM is suspected.

### What are the normal serum creatine kinase values for skeletal muscle? A worldwide systematic review [^113u56KG]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The statistical methods described focus solely on estimating medians and have not been developed to assess the pooled lower and upper boundaries of reference values across population groups. As a result, the lower and upper boundaries of the median confidence intervals did not align with the true reference values reported in the individual studies. Although methods for estimating reference ranges are available, these require studies to report their mean values or individual participant data, which did not apply to our studies. Given that reference values are crucial for clinical practice, we presented them descriptively, summarizing the ranges reported in the studies.

Finally, alongside the descriptive table, we illustrated our results graphically with forest plots whenever a meta‐analysis was feasible and pertinent (based on the heterogeneity analysis).

### Muscle biopsy: what and why and when? [^1151Uog5]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Skeletal muscle biopsy remains an important investigative tool in the diagnosis of a variety of muscle disorders. Traditionally, someone with a limb-girdle muscle weakness, myopathic changes on electrophysiology and raised serum creatine kinase (CK) would have a muscle biopsy. However, we are living through a genetics revolution, and so do all such patients still need a biopsy? When should we undertake a muscle biopsy in patients with a distal, scapuloperoneal or other patterns of muscle weakness? When should patients with myositis, rhabdomyolysis, myalgia, hyperCKaemia or a drug-related myopathy have a muscle biopsy? What does normal muscle histology look like and what changes occur in neurogenic and myopathic disorders? As with Kipling's six honest serving men, we hope that by addressing these issues we can all become more confident about when to request a muscle biopsy and develop clearer insights into muscle pathology.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^115bngEc]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) are one of the principal reasons for statin non-adherence and/or discontinuation, contributing to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) Consensus Panel overviews current understanding of the pathophysiology of statin-associated myopathy, and provides guidance for diagnosis and management of SAMS. Statin-associated myopathy, with significant elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK), is a rare but serious side effect of statins, affecting 1 per 1000 to 1 per 10 000 people on standard statin doses. Statin-associated muscle symptoms cover a broader range of clinical presentations, usually with normal or minimally elevated CK levels, with a prevalence of 7–29% in registries and observational studies. Preclinical studies show that statins decrease mitochondrial function, attenuate energy production, and alter muscle protein degradation, thereby providing a potential link between statins and muscle symptoms; controlled mechanistic and genetic studies in humans are necessary to further understanding. The Panel proposes to identify SAMS by symptoms typical of statin myalgia (i.e. muscle pain or aching) and their temporal association with discontinuation and response to repetitive statin re-challenge. In people with SAMS, the Panel recommends the use of a maximally tolerated statin dose combined with non-statin lipid-lowering therapies to attain recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets. The Panel recommends a structured work-up to identify individuals with clinically relevant SAMS generally to at least three different statins, so that they can be offered therapeutic regimens to satisfactorily address their cardiovascular risk. Further research into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms may offer future therapeutic potential.

5.1	Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

LIVALO may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statins, including LIVALO.

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher LIVALO dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Drug Interactions (7), and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)]. Dosages of LIVALO greater than 4 mg once daily were associated with an increased risk for severe myopathy in premarketing clinical studies. The maximum recommended dose of LIVALO is 4 mg once daily.

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

LIVALO is contraindicated in patients taking cyclosporine and not recommended in patients taking gemfibrozil [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. There are LIVALO dosage restrictions for patients taking erythromycin or rifampin [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The following drugs when used concomitantly with LIVALO may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis: lipid-modifying dosages of niacin (> 1grams/day), fibrates, and colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Discontinue LIVALO if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if LIVALO is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue LIVALO in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy).

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the LIVALO dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis: physiological response or manifestation of an underlying myopathy? [^115TCakZ]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Physiological exertional CK elevation

Several studies have investigated the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis among healthy individuals exposed to unaccustomed physical exertion, such as military recruits during basic military training and athletes. Kenney et al studied a cohort of 499 healthy individuals who participated in a 2-week basic military training, including eccentric strength training. The cohort included individuals of various ethnicities. The term 'clinically symptomatic ERM' was defined more stringently than the above: elevated serum CK, muscle weakness and myoglobinaemia and/or myoglobinuria. Hence, patients with myalgia in the absence of weakness were not included. Based on this definition, no cases of ERM were encountered. The mean and median CK values were within normal limits (for sex and race) at baseline, peaked with maximal elevation at day 7 and returned to normal at day 14. Serum CK levels were nearly universally elevated during training, but they were also increased in nearly one-fourth of the participants at baseline. At day 7, 27% of participants had CK levels > 5 times the ULN, and 11% had levels > 10 times the ULN, with values ranging from 56 to 35 056 IU/L on day 7. There was no correlation whatsoever between CK levels and the amount of exertion, environmental conditions, or myalgia, or weakness. In fact, quite surprisingly, and contrary to received opinion, CK elevations were less pronounced during the hot, humid months. One possible explanation was the less rigorous training during the hot months. Hence, the authors proposed that patients with serum CK levels < 50 times the ULN, no definite muscle swelling or weakness, no myoglobinuria, and without laboratory evidence of ARF or electrolyte imbalance have most likely expressed a physiological response to exercise and should not be classified as having 'clinically significant ERM'. Furthermore, the authors suggested that CK is only one of the factors predicting morbidity and mortality in ERM, which is in line with a recent risk stratification model.

### Evidence-based guideline summary: evaluation, diagnosis, and management of congenital muscular dystrophy: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the practice issues review panel of the American association of neuromuscular&electrodiagnostic medicine [^111D9SFM]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Suspected congenital muscular dystrophy — geographic/ethnic background and clinical features can inform subtype prediction: Founder mutations led to clusters of certain mutations in the Japanese (Fukuyama CMD), Korean (Fukuyama CMD), Ashkenazi Jewish (Walker–Warburg syndrome), and Turkish (A200P haplotype in the POMT1 gene) populations, and thus the geographic and ethnic background may help predict the specific subtype. Proximal skeletal muscle weakness and hypotonia are the cardinal clinical manifestations, and serum creatine kinase (CK) levels are typically but not invariably elevated. Distal joint hyperlaxity, congenital hypotonia, and joint contractures are characteristic clinical features associated with collagenopathy, and L‑CMD (LMNA‑associated CMD) is strongly associated with neck extensor weakness. Overall, in children with suspected CMD, clinical features may predict subtype‑specific diagnosis and in many cases predict the causative genes.

### The incidence of anti-HMGCR immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy: an Australian and UK retrospective multi-site cohort study [^111rTUWP]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Anti-HMGCR IMNM typically causes severe proximal muscle weakness and marked elevations in creatine kinase (CK). However, there is growing recognition of rare phenotypic subgroups within anti-HMGCR IMNM. Some patients with anti-HMGCR have a chronic limb-girdle muscular dystrophy-like phenotype. Statin-naïve anti-HMGCR IMNM can occur and seems to be more frequent than statin-exposed anti-HMGCR IMNM in Asian cohorts. In paediatric patients (universally statin-naïve), anti-HMGCR IMNM is infrequent but presents with severe, refractory myopathy. Finally, there are rare cases where anti-HMGCR IMNM is self-limiting.

There remain many unanswered questions about anti-HMGCR IMNM, from risk factors to pathogenesis, clinical presentations and treatment strategies. Research into anti-HMGCR IMNM is limited by the rarity of the disease but also by awareness of anti-HMGCR and access to laboratory testing for this autoantibody.

We aimed to assemble the first international, multi-site cohort of patients with anti-HMGCR IMNM, using detailed clinical data to calculate disease incidence and associations.

2.1. Myotoxicity

Myotoxicity includes various forms of myopathy, myalgia, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis. Myopathy is defined as muscle symptoms and creatine kinase levels greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal. Rhabdomyolysis is defined as creatine kinase levels above 10,000 IU/L or above 10‐fold upper limit of normal with an elevation in serum creatinine or requirement for hydration therapy. Myalgias is defined as muscle ache or weakness without creatine kinase elevation. Myositis is defined as muscle symptoms with creatine kinase elevation.

3.1 Literature Search and Assessment for Eligibility

The literature search results are summarized in a PRISMA flowchart in Figure 1. After removing duplicates, we screened for eligibility, which included 1996 titles and abstracts and 76 full texts. The main reasons for exclusion were as follows: only abstracts were available (primarily conference abstracts), differing aims, including laboratory manuals or statistical methods for measuring CK, opinion papers, or insufficient information on the population studied or measurements inconsistent with our scope (children only, non‐healthy participants, assessment of CK after exercise). Ultimately, 20 papers were considered eligible for inclusion in our review. No additional studies were identified from the references of the included documents or the updated search conducted after finalizing the manuscript.

### Signs and symptoms of rhabdomyolysis… [^114ij2Pr]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- The main rhabdomyolysis symptoms are muscle pain, dark urine, and feeling weak or tired.
- Seek medical attention immediately if you experience any symptoms.
- Rhabdo symptoms can mimic other conditions like heat cramps and dehydration.
- A healthcare provider can perform a specific blood test to determine if you have rhabdo. Signs and symptoms It's important to learn the signs and symptoms of rhabdo that may be present. Learning the symptoms can help you figure out if you or someone else needs to seek medical attention. If you develop rhabdo, you might have one or more of these symptoms: Muscle cramps, aches, or painsthat are more severe than expected Dark urine Feeling weak or tired, unable to complete tasks or finish a workout you were able to do previously. When will symptoms appear. Symptoms of rhabdo may not begin until hours or days after the initial muscle injury.

For some people, symptoms might not start to appear until several days after the initial injury. Seek medical care immediately If you have any of these symptoms at any time, do not ignore them. Seek medical treatment right away. Earlier diagnosis means an earlier start to treatment and a greater chance of recovery without permanent health effects. Blood tests for rhabdo Repeated blood tests for the muscle protein creatine kinase are the only accurate test for rhabdo. If you suspect that you may have rhabdo, ask a healthcare provider to check your CK levels with a blood test.
- CK enters the bloodstream when muscle tissue is damaged.
- When rhabdo is present, CK levels will rise. You will need repeat blood tests to determine if CK levels are going up or down:

- Like symptoms, the rise in CK may not appear right away.
- Test CK levels until 2 consecutive tests show levels lowering.

Urine tests are not accurate Urine dipstick tests are not a good way to diagnose rhabdo.
- These tests check for myoglobin indirectly.
- Myoglobin quickly clears from the body so it may not show up in urine.
- High CK levels in the blood may persist for days.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^113UzvxY]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Assessment and diagnosis of statin-associated muscle symptoms

While consensus groups including the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiologyand the National Lipid Associationhave presented definitions of SAMS based on symptoms and the magnitude of CK elevation, less attention has been paid to clinical diagnostic criteria. Indeed, a definitive diagnosis of SAMS is difficult because symptoms are subjective and there is no 'gold standard' diagnostic test. Importantly, there is also no validated muscle symptom questionnaire, although the National Lipid Association has proposed a symptom scoring system based on the STOMP trial and the PRIMO survey (see). Consequently, we suggest that assessment of the probability of SAMS being due to a statin take account of the nature of the muscle symptoms, the elevation in CK levels and their temporal association with statin initiation, discontinuation, and re-challenge. Note that this is a clinical definition, which may not be appropriate for regulatory purposes.

In the absence of a standardized classification of SAMS, we propose to integrate all muscle-related complaints (e.g. pain, weakness, or cramps) as 'muscle symptoms', subdivided by the presence or absence of CK elevation (Table 1). Pain and weakness in typical SAMS are usually symmetrical and proximal, and generally affect large muscle groups including the thighs, buttocks, calves, and back muscles. Discomfort and weakness typically occur early (within 4–6 weeks after starting statin therapy), but may still occur after many years of treatment. Onset of new symptoms may occur with an increase in statin dose or initiation of an interacting drug. The symptoms appear to be more frequent in physically active individuals. Statin-associated muscle symptoms often appear more promptly when patients are re-exposed to the same statin.

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: an individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^111X4z8C]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

The main strength of our analyses is that they provide the first reliable estimates of the causal contribution of statins to muscle symptoms reported by a wide range of patients. The data are derived from large-scale, double-blind, randomised trials, which guarantees the avoidance of both moderate random errors and moderate biases. By contrast, non-randomised observational studies, in which outcomes are compared between individuals who received the treatment of interest and those who did not are (irrespective of their size) prone to moderate biases (especially where participants are aware of which drugs they are taking), which cannot be guaranteed to be removed through statistical adjustment (eg, propensity score matching).

However, there are some potential limitations to our analyses. Firstly, there was considerable heterogeneity in the methods used for the ascertainment of muscle symptoms, and definitions varied from trial to trial. Nonetheless, as noted above, the relative excesses appeared to be broadly consistent among the different trials and clinical circumstances. Secondly, although we sought adverse event data from all randomised, double-blind trials included in the CTT, some data were not available. However, the missing data represented less than 1% of all adverse events,(mainly because of data privacy concerns). Furthermore, data were not consistently available on whether muscle events led to the discontinuation of allocated treatment (and thus planned on-treatment analyses for rare events were not possible), and there was no reliable information on some relevant comorbid conditions (such as hypothyroidism) or concomitant medications that might affect the risk of having symptoms. Thirdly, most reports of muscle pain or weakness were not accompanied by a measurement of creatine kinase value, so we were unable to assess whether some symptoms were associated with large increases in creatine kinase concentrations. However, among the cases for which there were data available on creatine kinase concentrations, more than 96% were less than 3 times the ULN, and there was no evidence that (after removing myopathy cases) extreme creatine kinase values were more common among participants allocated to the statin groups. Finally, although all trials excluded anyone known to have had a previous serious adverse reaction to statin therapy, and many took steps to exclude those with a previous statin sensitivity or hypersensitivity, most of them did not seek to identify or exclude participants who might now be categorised as statin intolerant (most of the trials had completed enrolment before statins were in common use and well before they were available generically).

### Asymptomatic / pauci-symptomatic creatine kinase elevations (hyperckemia) [^116V6LpS]. Muscle & Nerve (2013). Low credibility.

Neuromuscular clinicians are frequently asked to evaluate patients referred for asymptomatic elevations in creatine kinase (CK), a catalytic enzyme that combines creatine and ATP to form phosphocreatine and ADP. This reaction is crucial for cellular energy generation and metabolism. This laboratory finding, often referred to in simplified lexicon as asymptomatic hyperCKemia, continues to generate controversy at several levels, including definition, the extent of evaluation, and the yield of diagnostic testing. In this review, we summarize the literature based on series of patients with asymptomatic hyperCKemia and provide a rational clinical approach to reveal identifiable underlying causes.

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^111Xh7su]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is the combination of symptoms (myalgia, weakness and muscle swelling) and a substantial rise in serum creatine kinase (CK) > 50 000 IU/L; there are many causes, but here we specifically address exertional rhabdomyolysis. The consequences of this condition can be severe, including acute kidney injury and requirement for higher level care with organ support. Most patients have 'physiological' exertional rhabdomyolysis with no underlying disease; they do not need investigation and should be advised to return to normal activities in a graded fashion. Rarely, exertional rhabdomyolysis may be the initial presentation of underlying muscle disease, and we review how to identify this much smaller group of patients, who do require investigation.

### Bench-to-bedside review: rhabdomyolysis – an overview for clinicians [^111dhbCP]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis ranges from an asymptomatic illness with elevation in the creatine kinase level to a life-threatening condition associated with extreme elevations in creatine kinase, electrolyte imbalances, acute renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Muscular trauma is the most common cause of rhabdomyolysis. Less common causes include muscle enzyme deficiencies, electrolyte abnormalities, infectious causes, drugs, toxins and endocrinopathies. Weakness, myalgia and tea-colored urine are the main clinical manifestations. The most sensitive laboratory finding of muscle injury is an elevated plasma creatine kinase level. The management of patients with rhabdomyolysis includes early vigorous hydration.

### Managing statin myopathy [^1124PhEZ]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Approximately 10% of patients treated with statins experience some form of muscle-related side effects in clinical practice. These can range from asymptomatic creatine kinase (CK) elevation, to muscle pain, weakness, and its most severe form, rhabdomyolysis. Higher risk patients for statin myopathy are those older than 80, with a small body frame, on higher statin doses, on other medications, or with other systemic diseases including hepatic or renal diseases, diabetes mellitus, or hypothyroidism. The cause of statin myopathy is presumed to be the same for its variable presentation but has not been defined. In patients with myopathic symptoms, their symptoms and CK levels determine whether statin therapy can be continued or must be stopped.

### European Federation of Neurological Societies cutoff values significantly reduce creatine kinase sensitivity for diagnosing neuromuscular disorders [^113ZbKdf]. Muscle & Nerve (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Elevated creatine kinase (CK) level was redefined by the European Federation of Neurological Societies)EFNS(as 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. In the current study we sought to determine the sensitivity and specificity of CK testing for the diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders.

Methods

Demographics and CK levels were retrospectively extracted from an electronic database for 234 patients with neuromuscular disorders. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios and the area under curve were determined for each diagnosis and different cutoff CK values.

Results

Using the EFNS cutoff values significantly reduced CK test sensitivity. Creatine kinase values > 1000IU/L showed a high likelihood (11.04) for myopathies and a low likelihood for polyneuropathies (0).

Discussion

European Federation of Neurological Societies cutoff values significantly reduce CK sensitivity for diagnosing neuromuscular disorders. While low CK values cannot exclude a neuromuscular disease, values > 1000IU/L are associated with a high likelihood of myopathy.

COVID-19 is a global public health emergency with more than one million positive cases across the globe. COVID-19 has a multifaceted presentation. We are herein to report two cases of SARS-CoV-2 induced rhabdomyolysis with an initial presentation of weakness and elevated creatinine kinase (CK). Both patients had no respiratory symptoms, they only complained of generalized weakness and were found to have elevated CK. Routine chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates in both cases and subsequently reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. To the best of our knowledge, there was only one literature to date documented SARS-CoV-2 induced rhabdomyolysis as a late complication of COVID-19 patient. Our cases showed that elevated CK and rhabdomyolysis can be the sole initial presentation of patients with COVID-19 and total CK should be ordered in every patient on admission.

### Muscle weakness with a hidden cause [^114VP4H4]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Summary

Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) represent a diverse group of systemic autoimmune disorders characterised by skeletal muscle weakness with variable clinical manifestations.

Dermatomyositis (DM) is a heterogeneous IIM and is associated with progressive muscle weakness, with characteristic skin features, and with an increased risk of malignancy. Here, we report a previously healthy man in his early 40s who presented to the emergency department with a 14-day history of symmetric progressive proximal muscle weakness. Both upper arms were painful and swollen, and they displayed marked weakness in arm elevation. Climbing stairs was no longer possible due to muscle weakness and pain. A facial and truncal rash as well as periungual erythema were noted. Laboratory analysis revealed highly elevated creatine kinase. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of DM was confirmed. A comprehensive search for malignancy revealed a non-palpable pure seminoma. While DM as a paraneoplastic phenomenon of seminoma is extremely rare, our case underlines the importance of a thorough tumour search.

### The etiology of rhabdomyolysis: an interaction between genetic susceptibility and external triggers [^1128c9Fw]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rhabdomyolysis is a complex condition relevant to many medical disciplines, involving the rapid dissolution of damaged or injured skeletal muscle. This disruption of skeletal muscle integrity leads to the direct release of intracellular muscle components, including myoglobin, creatine kinase (CK), aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase and electrolytes, into the circulation and extracellular space. Clinical manifestations range from a largely asymptomatic illness with isolated serum CK level elevation (hyperCKaemia) to a life‐threatening condition with profound myoglobinuria, often leading to acute renal failure. Definitions vary, but rhabdomyolysis is most commonly defined as a clinical syndrome of severe myalgia, muscle weakness and swelling, with sudden elevation of CK levels, with or without the presence of myoglobinuria, and subsequent fall of CK levels.

Three retrospective cohort studies in a hospital setting, performed in 2005, 2009 and 2012, described the demographics and different causes of rhabdomyolysis. All three studies, performed when diagnostic genetic testing was not yet widely available, focused on external triggers as a cause for the rhabdomyolysis event and identified exogenous toxins as the most frequently reported trigger, followed by traumatic muscle injury [1, 2, 3]. However, recent reports suggest that rhabdomyolysis events can be attributed to a combination of certain environmental factors (e.g. strenuous exercise and/or febrile infection) and a predisposing genotype [4]. A combination of external triggers and genetic predisposition may thus be required for an individual to exceed the threshold for developing rhabdomyolysis (Fig. 1), and the majority of rhabdomyolysis events may therefore have to be considered multifactorial. To identify episodes of rhabdomyolysis suggestive of an underlying genetic susceptibility, we have introduced the acronym RHABDO (Box 1) [5, 6]. This acronym was developed based on an extensive literature review and has been adopted in a recent review on exertional rhabdomyolysis [7]. It aims to distinguish the patients in whom the external triggers are sufficient to explain the episode of rhabdomyolysis from those in whom the external triggers insufficiently explain the (severity of the) rhabdomyolysis event.

### Severe proximal myopathy secondary to Hashimoto's thyroiditis [^1111rCYZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Muscular symptoms in hypothyroidism are common, including myalgia, fatigue and cramps; however, a significantly raised creatine kinase and muscle weakness are rare. Differential diagnosis of patients presenting with muscle weakness and a raised creatine kinase is wide, and hypothyroidism is rarely considered. We report this case of a 30-year-old female presenting with proximal muscle weakness as her primary symptom, hypothyroid symptoms of 3-month duration and a significantly raised creatine kinase. After ruling out other causes of a raised creatine kinase, thyroxine replacement was commenced, which led to complete resolution of her proximal weakness, myalgia and normalisation of creatine kinase level. This case illustrates severe proximal myopathy can be secondary to hypothyroidism, symptoms can resolve with thyroxine replacement and emphasises the importance of measuring thyroid function in patients with proximal weakness/myalgia and a significantly raised creatine kinase.

### Neurogenic disease with high CK: think muscle [^116QoDbv]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

HyperCKaemia is common in several myopathies but can accompany other disorders, including neuropathies. However, distinguishing neurogenic from myopathic hyperCKaemia is not always straightforward. A 58-year-old man had experienced muscle cramps and fatiguability since aged 3 years, with persistently high serum creatine kinase (CK). A positive family history prompted genetic testing for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A, which was positive. However, his serum CK remained persistently high and neurological examination 17 years later identified diffuse muscle atrophy and weakness. Genetic testing for dystrophinopathy identified a novel missense variant on the DMD gene. Patients whose serum CK is in 'myopathic range', even those with definite neurogenic disease, should be investigated for additional myopathy, since this may require additional monitoring for pulmonary and cardiac complications.

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or older, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and concomitant use with certain other drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Data from observational studies indicate that the risk for rhabdomyolysis is increased when fibrates, including fenofibrates, are co-administered with a statin. Avoid concomitant use unless the benefit of further alterations in TG levels is likely to outweigh the increased risk of this drug combination [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.4)].

Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with fenofibrates, including LIPOFEN, co-administered with colchicine. Consider whether the benefit of using colchicine concomitantly with LIPOFEN outweighs the increased risk of myopathy [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Discontinue LIPOFEN if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if LIPOFEN is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue LIPOFEN in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy).

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the LIPOFEN dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

5.4	Increases in Serum Creatinine

Increases in serum creatinine have been reported in patients receiving fenofibrates. These increases tend to return to baseline following discontinuation of LIPOFEN. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Monitor renal function in patients with renal impairment taking LIPOFEN. Renal monitoring should also be considered for patients taking LIPOFEN at risk for renal insufficiency, such as geriatric patients and patients with diabetes. LIPOFEN is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment, including those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and those receiving dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### How to use: creatine kinase [^114vPAEM]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Creatine kinase (CK) remains an essential tool for assessment of muscular weakness and pain in children despite the advent of advanced diagnostic tests in this field. It is also useful in diagnosing and monitoring various other conditions. This article will explore the physiology of CK and clinical situations where the estimation of CK can help the clinicians' decision-making process with the diagnosis and management of these conditions. Some clinical scenarios are used to highlight how the tests can be used in different clinical situations. The role of CK as a biomarker of myocardial injury has been purposefully omitted in this article.

### Pregabalin (Lyrica CR) [^11347Jfp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.11 Creatine Kinase Elevations

LYRICA treatment was associated with creatine kinase elevations. Mean changes in creatine kinase from baseline to the maximum value were 60 U/L for LYRICA‑treated patients and 28 U/L for the placebo patients. In all controlled trials across multiple patient populations, 1.5% of patients on LYRICA and 0.7% of placebo patients had a value of creatine kinase at least 3 times the upper limit of normal. Three LYRICA‑treated subjects had events reported as rhabdomyolysis in premarketing clinical trials. The relationship between these myopathy events and LYRICA is not completely understood because the cases had documented factors that may have caused or contributed to these events. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if these muscle symptoms are accompanied by malaise or fever. Discontinue treatment with LYRICA CR if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected or if markedly elevated creatine kinase levels occur.

5.12 Decreased Platelet Count

Both LYRICA CR and LYRICA treatment were associated with a decrease in platelet count. In the double‑blind phase of controlled studies for pain indication, LYRICA CR‑treated patients experienced a median change from baseline in platelet count of 11 × 103/mm3(for the PHN population) and 14 × 103/mm3(for the FM population) as compared to 1 × 103/mm3in placebo‑treated patients (for both populations). LYRICA‑treated patients experienced a mean maximal decrease in platelet count of 20 × 103/µL, compared to 11 × 103/µL in placebo patients. In the overall database of controlled trials, 2% of placebo patients and 3% of LYRICA patients experienced a potentially clinically significant decrease in platelets, defined as 20% below baseline value and less than 150 × 103/µL. A single LYRICA‑treated subject developed severe thrombocytopenia with a platelet count less than 20 × 103/µL. In randomized controlled trials, LYRICA or LYRICA CR were not associated with an increase in bleeding‑related adverse reactions.

When to refer

All patients with CTCAE ≥ grade 2 inflammatory arthritis should be referred to rheumatology. Also consider referring any patient whose symptoms persist for > 6 weeks or who requires > 20 mg prednisone (or equivalent) daily that cannot be tapered to < 10 mg/day within 4 weeks. All patients with suspected myositis, presenting with muscle weakness and elevated creatine kinase (CK), should be referred to rheumatology or neurology, as this can be a life-threatening adverse event.

Because erosive, irreversible joint damage has been seen within weeks of symptom onset, early involvement of rheumatologists is recommended to determine if additional disease-modifying therapy beyond steroids is required.

For other suspected rheumatologic manifestations (e.g. vasculitis, myositis, scleroderma, etc.), rheumatology referral is advisable even if the symptoms are mild, to ensure that appropriate diagnostic testing and optimal management can be coordinated to prevent permanent organ damage.

### Pitavastatin [^112Pq3oC]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Pitavastatin may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statins, including pitavastatin.

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher pitavastatin dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Drug Interactions (7), and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)]. Dosages of pitavastatin greater than 4 mg once daily were associated with an increased risk for severe myopathy in premarketing clinical studies. The maximum recommended dose of pitavastatin is 4 mg once daily.

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Pitavastatin is contraindicated in patients taking cyclosporine and not recommended in patients taking gemfibrozil [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. There are pitavastatin dosage restrictions for patients taking erythromycin or rifampin [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The following drugs when used concomitantly with pitavastatin may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis: lipid-modifying dosages of niacin (> 1 grams/day), fibrates, and colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Discontinue pitavastatin if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if pitavastatin is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue pitavastatin in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy).

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the pitavastatin dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

ATORVALIQ may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statins, including ATORVALIQ.

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher ATORVALIQ dosage [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)].

CK elevation

The presence of elevated serum myoglobin was once used routinely to diagnose rhabdomyolysis; however, this parameter is not widely available for diagnostic testing and unreliable because myoglobin is rapidly cleared from the blood. Laboratory testing in urine (a positive dipstick for blood with absence of red blood cells on microscopic urinalysis serves as an indirect marker of urinary myoglobin) offers a fast screening tool if serum myoglobin testing is not readily available. Serum CK is the most reliable diagnostic marker of rhabdomyolysis. It usually peaks 24–36 hours after exertion and then decreases back to baseline at a rate of about 40% per day (figure 2).

Figure 2
Rise and fall of myoglobin and creatine kinase (CK) during the course of rhabdomyolysis. Myoglobin is the first enzyme that increases, but returns to normal levels within the first 24 hours after onset of symptoms. CK increases a few hours later, reaches its peak value within the first 24 hours, and remains at these levels for 3 days. Even though the presence of myoglobin in serum is the key feature of rhabdomyolysis, CK is considered to be a more useful marker for the diagnosis and assessment of the severity of muscular injury due to its delayed clearance from the plasma and the wide availability for diagnostic testing. (Reprinted from Giannoglou et al Copyright 2007, with permission from Elsevier).

There is no consensus in the literature concerning the exact level of CK increases required to fulfil the definition of ERM, with suggested CK levels ranging from > 5, > 10, > 20 or even > 50 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). There is, however, some agreement that the limit of a CK value of > 5 times the ULN is very conservative, as it does not take into account documented baseline differences as a function of gender, ethnicity and training levels. These ULN levels vary considerably: 217 and 414 IU/L in Caucasian women and men, and 336 and 801 IU/L in African women and men, respectively.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^117UHuFY]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) and myopathy criteria — The most common symptoms that result in statin intolerance or statin discontinuation are muscle-related; SAMS refers to all muscle symptoms temporally related to statin use but without regard to causality, while pharmacologic SAMS refers specifically to muscle symptoms that are caused by the statin. In statin clinical trials, an alternative myopathy definition requires adverse muscle symptoms with creatine kinase (CK) elevations ≥ 10 X upper limit of normal (ULN), under which statin-induced myopathy occurs with a frequency of 1/1000 in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

### Anti-HMGCR myopathy: a rare and serious side effect of statins [^114S1YRJ]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Since their initial discovery, statins have become the first-line treatment for decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Although they are typically well tolerated, side effects do occur and tend to affect the musculature. Most side effects are benign and resolve after discontinuing the statin. A subset of immune-mediated necrotizing myositis, anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) myopathy is a rare disease that occurs in 0.9 to 1.4 cases per 100,000 people. It causes significant muscle weakness that does not resolve with discontinuation of the statin. Unlike other known complications, it has a late onset, occurring years after the statin was initially prescribed. It can also present in patients previously treated with statins who have not taken them for several years. This case report details the case of a 54-year-old woman who developed anti-HMGCR myopathy after several years of uncomplicated statin use. Differences between other reported cases and this 1 are discussed, including the patient's strong response to steroid therapy which resulted in the normalization of her serum creatinine kinase and alleviation of her muscle weakness. This case highlights the need for clinicians to be aware of anti-HMGCR myopathy and to consider it as a potential cause of proximal muscle weakness and persistent serum creatinine kinase elevations in patients exposed to statins even if they were previously well tolerated by the patient.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

2018 cholesterol clinical practice guidelines — statin safety management: In patients with statin-associated side effects that are not severe, it is recommended to reassess and to rechallenge to achieve a maximal LDL-C lowering by modified dosing regimen, an alternate statin or in combination with nonstatin therapy. In patients with increased diabetes mellitus risk or new-onset diabetes mellitus, it is recommended to continue statin therapy, with added emphasis on adherence, net clinical benefit, and the core principles of regular moderate-intensity physical activity, maintaining a healthy dietary pattern, and sustaining modest weight loss. In patients treated with statins, it is recommended to measure creatine kinase levels in individuals with severe statin-associated muscle symptoms, objective muscle weakness, and to measure liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase) as well as total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (hepatic panel) if there are symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity. In patients at increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk with chronic, stable liver disease (including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) when appropriately indicated, it is reasonable to use statins after obtaining baseline measurements and determining a schedule of monitoring and safety checks. Coenzyme Q10 is not recommended for routine use in patients treated with statins or for the treatment of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), and in patients treated with statins, routine measurements of creatine kinase and transaminase levels are not useful.

### Creatine kinase levels and statin-induced myopathy… [^112wWdc4]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Eligible participants had to have statin-induced myopathy, no increase in creatine kinase levels, and resolution of symptoms when not receiving statins for two weeks. End points included the following: whether patients identified blinded statin therapy and standard measures of muscle functional capacity and strength. During the preliminary analysis of the first 21 patients enrolled, four patients were able to correctly identify statin therapy because of the recurrence of muscle symptoms. Patient 2 developed muscle pain and weakness while receiving lovastatin that resolved when the medication was stopped. Symptoms were reproduced with reintroduction of blinded statin therapy, and muscle biopsy results were consistent with myopathy. Three months after halting statin treatment, a repeat muscle biopsy was negative. Patient 3 developed aching and diffuse muscle weakness while taking atorvastatin that resolved when the medication was stopped.

Blinded resumption of statin therapy caused the weakness to recur. Muscle biopsies showed myopathy during statin treatment with resolution five and one half months after treatment was halted. The authors conclude that although the incidence of statin-induced serious muscle toxicity is very low, pathologic evidence of myopathy may be present among patients with adverse muscle symptoms even when creatine kinase levels are normal. None of the four patients referred to here had elevated statin levels during treatment, thus eliminating the possibility of too much drug or inadequate clearance. The possibility of an underlying metabolic vulnerability to this adverse effect of statins needs further exploration. Grundy recommends avoiding statins or using them in low dosages in patients with these factors.

Less serious myopathy symptoms, including fatigue, muscle pain, and weakness, occurring in patients with normal creatine kinase levels, may arise during treatment with a statin but will probably not lead to permanent muscle damage or chronic myopathy. In addition, many patients thought to have symptoms secondary to statin therapy probably have some other underlying pathology. In high-risk patients, the efficacy of statins in reducing cardiovascular disease probably outweighs the risk of serious or permanent muscle damage. Until further investigation is conducted of less serious muscle symptoms in patients taking statins, there is no reason to stop statin therapy in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disorders because of nonspecific symptoms not clearly related to treatment with a statin.

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis: physiological response or manifestation of an underlying myopathy? [^111AHmcL]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Exertional rhabdomyolysis is characterised by muscle breakdown associated with strenuous exercise or normal exercise under extreme circumstances. Key features are severe muscle pain and sudden transient elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK) levels with or without associated myoglobinuria. Mild cases may remain unnoticed or undiagnosed. Exertional rhabdomyolysis is well described among athletes and military personnel, but may occur in anybody exposed to unaccustomed exercise. In contrast, exertional rhabdomyolysis may be the first manifestation of a genetic muscle disease that lowers the exercise threshold for developing muscle breakdown. Repeated episodes of exertional rhabdomyolysis should raise the suspicion of such an underlying disorder, in particular in individuals in whom the severity of the rhabdomyolysis episodes exceeds the expected response to the exercise performed. The present review aims to provide a practical guideline for the acute management and postepisode counselling of patients with exertional rhabdomyolysis, with a particular emphasis on when to suspect an underlying genetic disorder. The pathophysiology and its clinical features are reviewed, emphasising four main stepwise approaches: (1) the clinical significance of an acute episode, (2) risks of renal impairment, (3) clinical indicators of an underlying genetic disorders and (4) when and how to recommence sport activity following an acute episode of rhabdomyolysis. Genetic backgrounds that appear to be associated with both enhanced athletic performance and increased rhabdomyolysis risk are briefly reviewed.

### Pediatric rhabdomyolysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of etiologies, management, and outcomes [^1157DtUA]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rhabdomyolysis is a systemic metabolic illness, with roughly 26,000 events recorded per year in the United States alone. This syndrome is typically marked by skeletal muscle necrosis which leads to leaking of muscle cell components, such as myoglobin, into the bloodstream. The disorder may appear as an asymptomatic illness with high creatine kinase (CK) values or become a serious health issue with significant elevation in CK, electrolyte deficiencies, acute kidney injury (AKI), and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Clinically, rhabdomyolysis is characterized by a triad of symptoms, comprising myalgia, weakness, and myoglobinuria, which appears as the generally recognized tea-colored urine. However, this stringent description of symptoms may be deceiving since the trio of symptoms is only found in < 10% of patients, and > 50% of patients have no complaints of muscular pain or weakness, despite presenting with stained urine. Therefore, elevated CK level is an exceptionally sensitive laboratory test for detecting muscular injury that has the potential to produce rhabdomyolysis, providing there is no concomitant heart or brain damage.

In adults, the available literature has shown that the most common causes of rhabdomyolysis are drug or alcohol abuse, medicinal drug use, trauma, immobility, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. However, the data in pediatric patients is skewed towards different causes, with viral myositis, trauma, connective tissue disorders, exercise, and drug overdose being reported as the leading causes of rhabdomyolysis in this population. Moreover, the treatment strategies for pediatric rhabdomyolysis remain an area of ongoing clinical debate. Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to identify and categorize etiologies of pediatric rhabdomyolysis, evaluate the different treatment strategies for rhabdomyolysis, and assess the outcomes of children with rhabdomyolysis.

### Exercise responses in patients with chronically high creatine kinase levels [^115qMS7c]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) is often taken to reflect muscle disease, but many individuals have elevated CK without a specific diagnosis. How elevated CK reflects muscle metabolism during exercise is not known.

Methods

Participants (46 men, 48 women) underwent incremental exercise testing to assess aerobic performance, cardiovascular response, and ventilatory response. Serum lactate, ammonia, and CK were measured at rest, 4 minutes into exercise, and 2 minutes into recovery.

Results

High-CK and control subjects demonstrated similar aerobic capacities and cardiovascular responses to incremental exercise. Those with CK ≥ 300 U/L exhibited significantly higher lactate and ammonia levels after maximal exercise, together with increased ventilatory responses, whereas those with CK ≥ 200 U/L but ≤ 300 U/L did not.

Conclusions

We recommend measurement of lactate and ammonia profiles during a maximal incremental exercise protocol to help identify patients who warrant muscle biopsy to rule out myopathy. Muscle Nerve 56: 264–270, 2017.

Polymyalgia-like syndrome during immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy — clinical features and diagnostic testing include proximal severe myalgia and fatigue resembling polymyalgia rheumatica, often with arthralgia and typically without definite synovitis, though inflammatory arthritis can occur; ultrasound or MRI might show a mild shoulder effusion. Patients have pain but not true weakness; rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody are negative, inflammatory markers are highly elevated, creatine kinase levels should generally be within normal limits, and MRI and EMG should not show evidence of myopathy or muscle inflammation.

### Fluvastatin sodium [^115DWUpF]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statins, including fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets.

Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in CK, values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) was < 0.1% in fluvastatin clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Avoid concomitant use of fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets with gemfibrozil, cyclosporin, and fluconazole. When used concomitantly with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets, lipid modifying doses (≥ 1 g/day) of niacin, fibrates, and colchicine may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis

[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK increases may resolve if fluvastatin sodium

extended-release tablets are discontinued. Temporarily discontinue fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, e.g., sepsis, shock, severe hypovolemia, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders, or uncontrolled epilepsy.

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^111q5ZbC]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Returning to normal activities

The risk of recurrence is low if there is no suggestion of an underlying genetic cause: 1%–2% suffered recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis in the US Army study, the risk may be lower in the general population.

Most experts recommend a graded return to exercise. Exercise should be avoided in the first month and until symptoms have disappeared and the serum CK normalised. Light exercise can then be started and gradually increased in extent and duration if symptoms of weakness and/or myalgia do not recur. Eccentric training is best avoided, at least to start with, as is strenuous unaccustomed exercise. Patients with suspected underlying myopathies/genetic disorders need a stricter approach, as described elsewhere.

### Pharmacogenomic study of statin-associated muscle symptoms in the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial [^115Jc3RM]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors (also known as statins) are the most prescribed lipid-modifying medications globally and are the first-line treatment for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Muscle symptoms (eg, myalgia and myopathy) are among the most common adverse events associated with statin use and are collectively referred to as statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). SAMS comprise a clinical spectrum ranging from benign muscle cramping/weakness to severe, life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. This adverse drug reaction can often lead to discontinuation or dosage reduction of statins. Since statins are effective lipid-lowering treatments in high-risk patients, SAMS-dependent statin discontinuation increases the risk of developing major adverse cardiovascular events.

The estimated incidence of SAMS varies depending on study design and clinical definition, but occurs in 5% to 30% of first-time statin users. Several clinical characteristics (eg, age, excess body weight, diabetes, fibromyalgia, and hypothyroidism), external factors (eg, concurrent drug therapies), and genetic factors have been implicated as risk factors for SAMS. A commonly used nonspecific biomarker to assess SAMS severity is the level of serum creatine kinase (CK), an enzyme released from injured muscle cells.CK elevations, however, do not always correlate well with SAMS, as this drug-related toxicity can occur in the absence of CK elevations, and CK elevations can occur due to many conditions other than SAMS. Thus, there are no reliable clinical predictors or biomarkers of SAMS risk for patients in whom statin therapy is indicated.

### Diagnostic evaluation of rhabdomyolysis [^116mXx2Z]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is characterized by severe acute muscle injury resulting in muscle pain, weakness, and/or swelling with release of myofiber contents into the bloodstream. Symptoms develop over hours to days after an inciting factor and may be associated with dark pigmentation of the urine. Serum creatine kinase and urine myoglobin levels are markedly elevated. Clinical examination, history, laboratory studies, muscle biopsy, and genetic testing are useful tools for diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, and they can help differentiate acquired from inherited causes of rhabdomyolysis. Acquired causes include substance abuse, medication or toxic exposures, electrolyte abnormalities, endocrine disturbances, and autoimmune myopathies. Inherited predisposition to rhabdomyolysis can occur with disorders of glycogen metabolism, fatty acid β-oxidation, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Less common inherited causes of rhabdomyolysis include structural myopathies, channelopathies, and sickle-cell disease. This review focuses on the differentiation of acquired and inherited causes of rhabdomyolysis and proposes a practical diagnostic algorithm. Muscle Nerve 51: 793–810, 2015.

### Fenofibric acid [^112TFdVw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules may cause myopathy [muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK)] and rhabdomyolysis.

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or older, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and concomitant use with certain other drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Data from observational studies indicate that the risk for rhabdomyolysis is increased when fibrates, including fenofibrates, are co-administered with a statin. Avoid concomitant use unless the benefit of further alterations in TG levels is likely to outweigh the increased risk of this drug combination [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.4)].

Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules co-administered with colchicine. Consider whether the benefit of using colchicine concomitantly with fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules outweighs the increased risk of myopathy [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Discontinue fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules are discontinued. Temporarily discontinue fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy).

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

### Muscle weakness with a hidden cause [^1157cM6m]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) represent a diverse group of systemic autoimmune disorders characterised by skeletal muscle weakness with variable clinical manifestations. Dermatomyositis (DM) is a heterogeneous IIM and is associated with progressive muscle weakness, with characteristic skin features, and with an increased risk of malignancy. Here, we report a previously healthy man in his early 40s who presented to the emergency department with a 14-day history of symmetric progressive proximal muscle weakness. Both upper arms were painful and swollen, and they displayed marked weakness in arm elevation. Climbing stairs was no longer possible due to muscle weakness and pain. A facial and truncal rash as well as periungual erythema were noted. Laboratory analysis revealed highly elevated creatine kinase. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of DM was confirmed. A comprehensive search for malignancy revealed a non-palpable pure seminoma. While DM as a paraneoplastic phenomenon of seminoma is extremely rare, our case underlines the importance of a thorough tumour search.

### A systematic review on the definition of rhabdomyolysis [^1123GacT]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Rhabdomyolysis (RML) is an interdisciplinary condition due to muscle cell injury followed by the release of cell components into circulation. Etiology of RML has a broad range; a serious complication is acute kidney injury (AKI). Despite its high relevance, there is no established formal definition for RML.

Objectives

A systematic review, focusing on RML definition, providing a recommendation for clinicians.

Method

Systematic literature research in PubMed and Embase (1968–07/2018).

Results

The database research presented 8136 articles in PubMed and 2151 in Embase. After screening, 614 papers were retained for statistical analysis. A retrospective study was the most used design (44%). A definition of RML was stated in 231 studies (37.6%), including a precise creatine kinase level (CK) cut-off most frequently (67.1%). In 53/231 (22.9%) studies the CK cut-off was > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN), and in 64/231 (27.7%) studies > 1000 IU/L. Further components of definitions were elevated CK without specific thresholds, and clinical symptoms. Exclusion criteria referring to the definition of RML were established in 113 studies, including myocardial, renal, cerebral and neuromuscular characteristics.

Conclusion

At present, we recommend a clinical syndrome of acute muscle weakness, myalgia, and muscle swelling combined with a CK cut-off value of > 1000 IU/L/ or CK > 5× ULN for the standard definition of a mild RML. Additionally measured myoglobinuria and AKI indicate a severe type of RML. Exclusion criteria as well as the chronological sequence need to be considered for a conclusive RML definition.

### Independent risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy and relevance to different types of muscle symptom [^115PRBLK]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The findings of this study have implications both to help guide safety monitoring with statin therapy, and to help ensure that patients do not stop their statin therapy due to mistakenly attributing common muscle symptoms to it. The absolute risk of myopathy due to standard statin regimens is low, but individuals can be identified who are at elevated risk by combining a number of independent risk factors in a myopathy risk score. The lack of association of this score with the much more common reports of other muscle symptoms is consistent with the randomized placebo-controlled evidence that statin therapy does not typically cause such symptoms (Take Home Figure). Consequently, CK should be measured in patients who report muscle symptoms on a statin and monitored in the small minority who are found to have moderately elevated CK levels, but otherwise they should be encouraged to continue taking their statin therapy.

5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Pitavastatin tablets may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statins, including pitavastatin tablets.

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher pitavastatin tablets dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)]. Dosages of pitavastatin tablets greater than 4 mg once daily were associated with an increased risk for severe myopathy in premarketing clinical studies. The maximum recommended dose of pitavastatin tablets is 4 mg once daily.

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Pitavastatin tablets is contraindicated in patients taking cyclosporine and not recommended in patients taking gemfibrozil [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. There are pitavastatin tablets dosage restrictions for patients taking erythromycin or rifampin [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The following drugs when used concomitantly with pitavastatin tablets may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis: lipid-modifying dosages of niacin (> 1 grams/day), fibrates, and colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Discontinue pitavastatin tablets if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if pitavastatin tablets is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue pitavastatin tablets in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy).

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the pitavastatin tablets dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

### Mild creatine kinase elevations Do not necessarily reflect… [^111oin4n]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Having hyperCKemia, which is the elevation of creatine kinase found in the patients in the case series, does not necessarily reflect rhabdomyolysis in the absence of muscle symptoms. Only three out of 10 patients had myalgias, and only one presented with weakness; it is unclear if it was muscle weakness or generalized fatigue. Nine patients presented with coughing; therefore, it is more likely that the hyperCKemia resulted from overactivity of respiratory muscles than from myositis. HyperCKemia was mild, with maximal CK values of less than 10, 000 U per L in eight patients. Helpful information that would suggest that hyperCKemia originated from skeletal muscles includes the presence of dark urine and myoglobinuria. One patient presented with confusion, and it is crucial to exclude a cerebral cause of hyperCKemia for that patient.

COVID-19 can also be complicated by myocarditis, myocardial damage, including myocardial infarction and takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which may have been a source of hyperCKemia. In Reply: We appreciate the comments by Drs. Finsterer and Scorza. The classic triad of rhabdomyolysis symptoms is nonspecific and experienced by less than 10% of patients. More than 50% of patients do not complain of muscle pain or weakness. Only one patient had hypokalemia at presentation. None of the patients were taking any of the medications known to cause muscle damage. The patients received chloroquine and azithromycin during their hospitalization for treatment of COVID-19; however, CK levels were already elevated at presentation. A range of potentially life-threatening complications have been associated with rhabdomyolysis. 2 Further studies are needed for the prognostic value of elevated CK in patients with COVID-19.

### Statin-associated myalgias and muscle injury-recognizing and managing both while still lowering the low-density lipoprotein [^112a2neE]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Although statins are generally safe and well tolerated, some patients experience muscle complaints that can be attributed to their use. Those with muscle discomfort but no demonstrable muscle weakness or creatine kinase (CK) elevations may have statin-associated muscle symptoms. Individuals with elevated CK levels, with or without muscle discomfort or weakness, may have statin-associated myotoxicity. Rare patients have statin-associated autoimmune myopathy, a disease characterized by proximal muscle weakness, elevated CK levels, and autoantibodies recognizing hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase. In this review, the author provides the clinician with a practical approach to diagnosing and managing patients with each of these statin side effects.

### Rosuvastatin calcium [^111aKgZm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Rosuvastatin may cause myopathy [muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase(CK)] and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statins, including rosuvastatin.

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher rosuvastatin dosage. Asian patients on rosuvastatin may be at higher risk for myopathy [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.8)]. The myopathy risk is greater in patients taking rosuvastatin 40 mg daily compared with lower rosuvastatin dosages.

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

The concomitant use of rosuvastatin with cyclosporine or gemfibrozil is not recommended. rosuvastatin dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking certain antiviral medications, darolutamide, and regorafenib [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Niacin, fibrates, and colchicine may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Discontinue rosuvastatin if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if rosuvastatin is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue rosuvastatin in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy).

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the rosuvastatin dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

### Management of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy [^1175Lsnq]. Muscle & Nerve (2024). Medium credibility.

The immune-mediated necrotizing myopathies (IMNM) are autoimmune myositides clinically characterized by proximal predominant weakness and elevated creatine kinase (CK). They may be associated with autoantibodies (anti-HMGCR, anti-SRP), triggered by statin use (e.g., anti-HMGCR myopathy), associated with cancer, or may be idiopathic. Immunotherapy is required to improve strength and decrease the CK level, but no therapies are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of IMNM. The optimal treatment strategy for IMNM is currently unknown and wide practice variation exists in the management of this condition. However, observational studies and expert opinion suggest that certain therapies may be more effective for the different serological subtypes of IMNM. HMGCR IMNM often responds favorably to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) even as monotherapy. Signal recognition peptide and seronegative IMNM typically require combination immunotherapy, most often consisting of an oral immunosuppressant, corticosteroids, and IVIG or rituximab. Patients often remain on immunotherapy for years and relapse is common during tapering of immunotherapy. Further studies are needed to guide the optimal management of these patients.

### Sequential targeted exome sequencing of 1001 patients affected by unexplained limb-girdle weakness [^111HHQQU]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Genetic muscle diseases with limb-girdle weakness (LGW) are highly heterogeneous, rare neuromuscular disorders (NMD). In addition to the characteristic progressive pelvic and shoulder girdle muscle weakness, other manifestations may include respiratory insufficiency, cardiomyopathy, contractures, and gastrointestinal complications. Consequently, these disorders diminish an individual's quality of life and can reduce life expectancy. There is a critical need to fully characterize disease etiology to achieve accurate diagnoses and offer appropriate genetic counseling and disease management.

Despite 535 genes known to be associated with 955 distinct NMDs, many muscle disease patients still remain genetically undiagnosed. This is partly because gene-by-gene and small panel testing strategies are usually dictated by phenotype, leaving little power for the expansion of disease associations and novel disease characterizations. An unbiased methodology has thus been sought to enhance standard clinical practices. Consistent with an increased affordability over the past decade, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have been integral in the diagnosis of disorders such as mitochondrial disease among others. Large-scale NGS panels were applied to 504 Italian undiagnosed muscular dystrophy and myopathy patients, and more recently to 4655 limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) patients in the United States. By investigating 93 and 35 NMD genes, respectively, they achieved a diagnostic rate of 43% and 27%. However, to date no study has been carried out where exome sequencing (ES) has been applied to similar limb-girdle cohorts; this allowed us not only to determine the impact that the panel size has on the detection rate, but also to interrogate the exomes beyond the known NMD genes.

We describe here the application of sequential targeted exome sequencing (TES) to a large cohort of undiagnosed patients presenting with proximal muscle weakness and/or elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels: the MYO-SEQ project. We established a partnership between academia, industry, and patient organizations, and developed an international network that connected over 40 specialist neuromuscular referral sites. A total of 1001 exomes were first analyzed for rare pathogenic variants in 169 common NMD genes, and then in a further 260 genes associated with rarer muscle conditions. We identify the most common muscle diseases in this population and suggest that an increased number of patients can be more rapidly tested and diagnosed through an appropriate TES approach.

### Retrospective study of a large population of patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic raised serum creatine kinase levels [^112vHgNA]. Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

A retrospective evaluation of asymptomatic subjects with persistent elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK) levels (hyperCKemia) was made in order to verify the presence of subclinical myopathy or idiopathic hyperCKemia and to define the most appropriate diagnostic pathway. Persistently increased serum CK levels are occasionally encountered in healthy individuals. In 1980 Rowland coined for them the term idiopathic hyperCKemia. Despite the increase of scientific knowledge, several healthy subjects with hyperCKemia still represent a problem for the clinician. We made a retrospective evaluation of 114 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic individuals with incidentally detected persistent hyperCKemia. They underwent neurological examination and laboratory/instrumental evaluation. Skeletal muscle biopsy was performed and thoroughly investigated. Biochemical and genetic investigations were added in selected cases. Logistic regression analysis was applied. We diagnosed a neuromuscular disorder in 21 patients (18.4%), and found, by muscle biopsy and/or EMG, pathological but not conclusive findings in 57 subjects (50%). The statistic correlation between elevated serum CK levels and the probability of making a diagnosis changed according to the age of the patient.

Conclusions

Muscle biopsy is the basic tool for screening asymptomatic subjects with hyperCKemia. It allowed us to make a diagnosis of disease in 18.4% of patients, and to detect skeletal muscle abnormalities in 38.6% of the subjects. Interestingly, 31.6% of individuals had completely normal muscle findings. These best fit the "diagnosis" of idiopathic hyperCKemia.

### Creatine for treating muscle disorders [^111bWK3v]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Progressive muscle weakness is a main symptom of most hereditary and acquired muscle diseases. Creatine improves muscle performance in healthy individuals. This is an update of our 2007 Cochrane review that evaluated creatine treatment in muscle disorders.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of creatine compared to placebo for the treatment of muscle weakness in muscle diseases.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (4 October 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (11 October 2010, Issue 4, 2010 in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2010) and EMBASE (January 1980 to September 2010) for randomised controlled trials (RCT) of creatine used to treat muscle diseases.

Selection Criteria

RCTs or quasi-RCTs of creatine treatment compared to placebo in hereditary muscle diseases or idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently applied the selection criteria, assessed trial quality and extracted data. We obtained missing data from investigators.

Main Results

The updated searches identified two new studies. A total of 14 trials, including 364 randomised participants, met the selection criteria. Meta-analysis of six trials in muscular dystrophies including 192 participants revealed a significant increase in muscle strength in the creatine group compared to placebo, with a weighted mean difference of 8.47%; (95% confidence intervals (CI) 3.55 to 13.38). Pooled data of four trials including 115 participants showed that a significantly higher number of patients felt better during creatine treatment compared to placebo with a risk ratio of 4.51 (95% CI 2.33 to 8.74). One trial in 37 participants with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies also showed a significant improvement in functional performance. No trial reported any clinically relevant adverse event. In metabolic myopathies, meta-analyses of three cross-over trials including 33 participants revealed no significant difference in muscle strength. One trial reported a significant deterioration of ADL (mean difference 0.54 on a 1 to 10 scale; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.93) and an increase in muscle pain during high-dose creatine treatment in McArdle disease.

Authors' Conclusions

High quality evidence from RCTs shows that short- and medium-term creatine treatment increases muscle strength in muscular dystrophies. There is also evidence that creatine improves functional performance in muscular dystrophy and idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. Creatine is well tolerated in these people. High quality but limited evidence from RCTs does not show significant improvement in muscle strength in metabolic myopathies. High-dose creatine treatment impaired ADL and increased muscle pain in McArdle disease.

### Statin-associated myopathy [^1157vY8W]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) are associated with skeletal muscle complaints, including clinically important myositis and rhabdomyolysis, mild serum creatine kinase (CK) elevations, myalgia with and without elevated CK levels, muscle weakness, muscle cramps, and persistent myalgia and CK elevations after statin withdrawal. We performed a literature review to provide a clinical summary of statin-associated myopathy and discuss possible mediating mechanisms. We also update the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reports on statin-associated rhabdomyolysis. Articles on statin myopathy were identified via a PubMed search through November 2002 and articles on statin clinical trials, case series, and review articles were identified via a PubMed search through January 2003. Adverse event reports of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis were also collected from the FDA MEDWATCH database. The literature review found that reports of muscle problems during statin clinical trials are extremely rare. The FDA MEDWATCH Reporting System lists 3339 cases of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis reported between January 1, 1990, and March 31, 2002. Cerivastatin was the most commonly implicated statin. Few data are available regarding the frequency of less-serious events such as muscle pain and weakness, which may affect 1% to 5% of patients. The risk of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects with statin use can be exacerbated by several factors, including compromised hepatic and renal function, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and concomitant medications. Medications such as the fibrate gemfibrozil alter statin metabolism and increase statin plasma concentration. How statins injure skeletal muscle is not clear, although recent evidence suggests that statins reduce the production of small regulatory proteins that are important for myocyte maintenance.

### Myotoxicity associated with lipid-lowering drugs [^1133yvRH]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Lipid-lowering drugs are associated with myotoxicity, which ranges in severity from myalgias to rhabdomyolysis resulting in renal failure and death. Although rhabdomyolysis is rare, muscle symptoms and serum creatine kinase elevations are sufficiently frequent during the course of lipid-lowering drug therapy to pose diagnostic challenges for the clinician. Progress in our understanding of this form of myotoxicity is reviewed.

Recent Findings

Muscle pain and weakness are the cardinal symptoms and often interfere with vigorous exercise. These symptoms may occur with or without serum creatine kinase elevations. The risk of myotoxicity is increased by combination statin-fibrate therapy as well as by factors that elevate tissue levels of the lipid-lowering drug, including the dose, drug-drug interactions, and host factors. Underlying neuromuscular diseases may become clinically apparent during statin therapy and may predispose to myotoxicity. The pathophysiology of myotoxicity most probably involves metabolic effects of the statins on the isoprenoid pool and on mitochondrial function.

Summary

Management of myotoxicity requires an evaluation of risk factors prior to prescribing lipid-lowering drugs, attention to muscle symptoms, and withdrawal of drug in the event of significant abnormalities.

### Independent risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy and relevance to different types of muscle symptom [^115RySnN]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Large-scale meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials show that statin therapy reduces the risks of myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, and ischaemic stroke by about one-fifth for each mmol/L LDL-C reduction, largely irrespective of patient characteristics. As a consequence, statins are prescribed to millions of people worldwide, with simvastatin still constituting ∼40% of all statin prescriptions in the UK in 2019 and being the second most commonly prescribed statin in the USA.

Evidence from randomized controlled trials indicates that statin therapy is safe and well-tolerated. Statin therapy does rarely cause myopathy, which is a potentially serious side-effect characterized by muscle pain or weakness associated with markedly elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels (e.g. > 10× upper limit of normal [ULN]). In contrast, muscle pain or weakness without elevated blood levels of CK is reported as often by patients receiving a statin as by patients receiving matching placebo, suggesting almost all such reports are not caused pharmacologically by the statin (i.e. they are a 'nocebo' effect). The incidence of myopathy is typically ∼1 per 10 000 person-years with standard statin regimens (such as simvastatin 40 mg daily), but factors that increase blood statin levels — such as higher statin doses, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g. strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, amiodarone), Chinese ethnicity, and SLCO1B1 genotype, — can increase the risk. As myopathy is rare, there is little reliable information about the independent relevance of these or other risk factors, or of the relative strength of their associations.,

This observational study aims to assess the relevance of independent risk factors for myopathy based on 171 systematically diagnosed cases among 58 390 simvastatin-treated participants from three large trial populations, and to examine the association between risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy and risk of other muscle symptoms.

Background

There is currently limited evidence on the mode of presentation, serological investigation and optimal treatment of newly described forms of clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (CADM), which is associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD). This case study outlines the presentation, diagnosis and subsequent management of a patient admitted under the Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Epidemiology at Princess Alexandra Hospital.
