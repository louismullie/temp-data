## Question

Can diclofenac potassium elevate potassium levels

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether diclofenac potassium can elevate potassium levels and, if so, how confident we can be about this, what the mechanism and risk factors are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic class and whether NSAIDs as a class affect potassium. Then, I should verify whether diclofenac specifically has documented hyperkalemia signals in regulatory labeling. Next, I will examine the proposed pathophysiology to ensure mechanistic plausibility. After that, I should review clinical evidence quantifying risk, including observational studies and case reports. Finally, I will identify high-risk patient populations and outline practical monitoring and management implications, anchoring to guideline-level sources where possible.

> Let me first confirm the drug class and general mechanism. Diclofenac potassium is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and NSAIDs can impair renal potassium handling via prostaglandin-dependent pathways that regulate renin and aldosterone, so a class effect on potassium is biologically plausible and described in labeling and reviews, which supports the premise that NSAIDs can raise serum potassium in susceptible patients [^115G2Fy3] [^111NimAT].

> Wait, let me verify the specific signal for diclofenac. Multiple FDA labels for diclofenac formulations explicitly warn about hyperkalemia, stating that increases in serum potassium, including frank hyperkalemia, have been reported with NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment, and attribute this in part to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. This applies across diclofenac salt forms and is reiterated in brand-specific labeling such as Lofena and film-coated diclofenac potassium products, which strengthens the case that diclofenac itself carries this risk [^115G2Fy3] [^116TTKYD] [^11735njY] [^111yEsn5].

> I need to check the mechanistic explanation to ensure it aligns with physiology. NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase, reducing renal prostaglandin synthesis, which can blunt renin release and downstream aldosterone, producing a functional hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism that decreases distal tubular potassium secretion. In parallel, NSAIDs can reduce renal blood flow and GFR in vulnerable states, further limiting potassium excretion, so both endocrine and hemodynamic mechanisms plausibly contribute to hyperkalemia risk with diclofenac [^115G2Fy3] [^111NimAT] [^111XW4c8].

> Next, I should review clinical evidence beyond labeling. A large nested case-control study in new NSAID users found that diclofenac was among the NSAIDs associated with elevated risk of moderate-to-severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 6.0 mEq/L), suggesting a signal specific to diclofenac even after adjustment for comorbidities and co-medications. Additionally, a population-based study in older adults showed that NSAID initiation was associated with higher 30-day risk of hyperkalemia, reinforcing a temporal association and dose-related risk in real-world settings [^1116ECs3] [^111Lz48e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about magnitude without context. The absolute risk increase appears modest in general populations, but the relative risk and clinical impact rise substantially in high-risk subgroups. For example, in older adults, new NSAID use was associated with a 30-day hyperkalemia risk of 0.40% vs 0.27% in nonusers (OR 1.50), and the nested case-control analysis identified diclofenac among NSAIDs with elevated hyperkalemia risk, consistent with a class effect with inter-drug variability and strong interaction with patient factors and co-exposures [^111Lz48e] [^1116ECs3].

> I should confirm who is most at risk so I can prioritize monitoring. High-risk features include chronic kidney disease, diabetes with hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, heart failure, dehydration or hypovolemia, liver dysfunction, and older age. Concomitant medications that further impair potassium handling or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis function — such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, amiloride), and direct renin inhibitors — markedly amplify risk, and these cautions are repeatedly emphasized in diclofenac labeling and nephrology guidelines [^115G2Fy3] [^113mghML] [^116omAWy].

> Let me consider formulation and route, because I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. The hyperkalemia warning applies to systemic NSAID exposure. Topical diclofenac has minimal systemic absorption and is less likely to cause hyperkalemia, though rare systemic effects can occur with excessive application or in highly susceptible patients, so the clinical risk is primarily with oral or parenteral diclofenac rather than topical use [^116gZQz4].

> I should double-check monitoring guidance so recommendations are actionable. For patients with CKD, heart failure, diabetes, or those on RAAS inhibitors, obtain baseline potassium and renal function before starting diclofenac, recheck within 1–2 weeks of initiation, and monitor periodically thereafter; if potassium exceeds 5.5 mmol/L, consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interacting drugs and address modifiable contributors, aligning with UK hyperkalemia guidance and VA/DoD CKD recommendations [^113pqGhr].

> But wait, what if the patient presents with severe hyperkalemia while on diclofenac and RAAS therapy — what should I do immediately? I need to ensure we follow acute management principles: stabilize the cardiac membrane with IV calcium if there are ECG changes, shift potassium intracellularly with insulin/dextrose and beta-agonists, and remove potassium with loop diuretics if volume replete and a binder or dialysis as indicated. Concurrently, discontinue or reduce offending agents, including NSAIDs and RAAS inhibitors when appropriate, and arrange urgent follow-up labs per UKKA guidance [^112gR5dH] [^111ncDVe].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Yes, diclofenac potassium can elevate serum potassium and cause hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with CKD, diabetes, heart failure, dehydration, older age, or when combined with RAAS inhibitors or potassium-sparing diuretics. The mechanism is multifactorial via NSAID-induced hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism and reduced renal perfusion, and the risk is sufficient to warrant baseline and periodic potassium and renal function monitoring in at-risk patients, with avoidance or dose minimization when feasible [^115G2Fy3] [^113mghML] [^1116ECs3] [^111Lz48e].

Diclofenac potassium can cause **hyperkalemia** [^115G2Fy3], especially in patients with renal impairment, heart failure, diabetes, or those taking ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or potassium-sparing diuretics [^111NimAT] [^116omAWy]. The risk is due to NSAID-induced **impaired renal potassium excretion** [^111XW4c8] and hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism [^115G2Fy3]. Monitor serum potassium in high-risk patients [^113YChVW] and avoid diclofenac potassium in advanced renal disease or when combined with other hyperkalemia-inducing drugs [^11735njY] [^111NimAT].

---

## Mechanisms of hyperkalemia induced by diclofenac potassium

Diclofenac potassium, like other NSAIDs, can cause hyperkalemia through **two primary mechanisms**:

---

### Impaired renal potassium excretion

NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, reducing renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which impairs potassium excretion [^111NimAT]. This effect is **pronounced in patients with pre-existing renal impairment**, heart failure, or dehydration [^115G2Fy3].

---

### Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism

NSAIDs can induce a **hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism state**, characterized by reduced aldosterone secretion, leading to decreased renal potassium excretion and subsequent hyperkalemia [^115G2Fy3]. This mechanism is particularly relevant in patients with normal renal function who still develop hyperkalemia during NSAID therapy [^11735njY].

---

## Clinical evidence of hyperkalemia associated with diclofenac potassium

Several clinical studies and case reports have documented **hyperkalemia associated with diclofenac potassium**:

- A nested case-control study found that diclofenac use was associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 6.0 mEq/L), particularly when combined with other medications that affect potassium homeostasis [^1116ECs3].
- A population-based study in older adults demonstrated that NSAID initiation, including diclofenac, significantly increased the risk of hyperkalemia within 30 days of use [^111Lz48e] [^1116ECs3].
- Case reports have documented severe hyperkalemia resulting in life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and even death, particularly in patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant medications that increase potassium levels [^1178zsXp].

---

## Risk factors for hyperkalemia with diclofenac potassium

The risk of hyperkalemia with diclofenac potassium is influenced by **several patient-specific and medication-related factors**:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Renal impairment | Reduced GFR impairs potassium excretion, increasing hyperkalemia risk [^111XW4c8] [^116omAWy] |
| Heart failure | Reduced renal perfusion and impaired potassium excretion [^111NimAT] |
| Diabetes mellitus | Often associated with hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism [^116MgUnZ] [^111XW4c8] |
| Advanced age | Increased risk due to reduced renal function and comorbidities [^111Lz48e] |
| Concomitant medications | ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics, and potassium supplements increase risk [^113MwkGx] [^1116ECs3] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the **importance of monitoring serum potassium levels** in patients taking diclofenac potassium, particularly those with risk factors:

- The FDA recommends monitoring renal function and serum potassium levels in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia [^115G2Fy3].
- The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend avoiding NSAIDs, including diclofenac, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or heart failure due to the risk of hyperkalemia and renal impairment [^notfound].
- The UK Kidney Association (UKKA) recommends regular monitoring of serum potassium levels in patients taking NSAIDs, especially when combined with other medications that increase potassium levels [^notfound].

---

## Clinical management of hyperkalemia induced by diclofenac potassium

Management of hyperkalemia induced by diclofenac potassium includes:

- **Immediate discontinuation** of diclofenac potassium and other contributing medications [^notfound].
- **Administration of intravenous calcium** to stabilize cardiac membranes [^111ncDVe].
- **Intravenous insulin and glucose** to promote intracellular potassium shift [^111ncDVe].
- **Loop diuretics** to enhance renal potassium excretion [^116MgUnZ].
- **Potassium binders** (e.g. patiromer, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) to reduce serum potassium levels [^117FVX6D].
- **Dialysis** in severe cases or in patients with renal failure [^1156gGZL].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Diclofenac potassium can cause **hyperkalemia**, particularly in patients with renal impairment, heart failure, diabetes, or those taking concomitant medications that affect potassium homeostasis. Clinicians should carefully assess patient risk factors, monitor serum potassium levels, and consider alternative analgesic therapies in high-risk patients. If hyperkalemia occurs, prompt discontinuation of diclofenac potassium and appropriate management strategies should be implemented to prevent serious complications [^113mghML].

Background

The normal range for potassium is within narrow limits. Hyperkalemia is an electrolyte disorder that frequently affects patients in the emergency department (ED), and can result in significant morbidity and mortality if not identified and treated rapidly.

Objective

This article provides an evidence-based narrative review of the management of hyperkalemia, with focused updates for the emergency clinician.

Methods

We searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases for articles in English published in peer-reviewed journals and indexed up until May 2020. We used multiple search terms, including hyperkalemia, potassium, acute hyperkalemia, emergency department, dyskalemia, potassium disorders, kidney disease, epidemiology, electrolyte disturbance, severe hyperkalemia, and emergency management.

Discussion

In the ED, interventions aimed to protect patients from the immediate dangers of elevated serum potassium are divided into the following: stabilizing cardiac membrane potentials, reducing serum potassium levels through shift from the extracellular fluid to intracellular fluid, and elimination of potassium through excretion via urinary or fecal excretion. Calcium is widely recommended to stabilize the myocardial cell membrane, but additional research is necessary to establish criteria for use, dosages, and preferred solutions. Redistribution of potassium ions from the bloodstream into the cells is based on intravenous insulin or nebulized β2-agonists.

Conclusions

Hyperkalemia is a frequent electrolyte disorder in the ED. Because of the risk of fatal dysrhythmia due to cardiac membrane instability, hyperkalemia is a medical emergency. There is a lack of scientific evidence on the optimal management of hyperkalemia and more research is needed to establish optimal strategies to manage acute hyperkalemia in the emergency department.

Geriatric Use

Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects (see WARNINGS: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events, Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation, Hepatotoxicity, Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Monitoring).

Diclofenac is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, ADVERSE REACTIONS).

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hyperkalemia [^114dKtnY]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia generally is attributable to cell shifts or abnormal renal potassium excretion. Cell shifts account for transient increases in serum potassium levels, whereas sustained hyperkalemia generally is caused by decreased renal potassium excretion. Impaired renal potassium excretion can be caused by a primary decrease in distal sodium delivery, a primary decrease in mineralocorticoid level or activity, or abnormal cortical collecting duct function. Excessive potassium intake is an infrequent cause of hyperkalemia by itself, but can worsen the severity of hyperkalemia when renal excretion is impaired. Before concluding that a cell shift or renal defect in potassium excretion is present, pseudohyperkalemia should be excluded.

5.7 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease.

Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets.

Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.

Hyperkalemia

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

5.8 Anaphylactic Reactions

Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets have been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to the individual components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacodynamic drug–drug interactions with antihypertensive medications — cautionary and advantageous combinations are outlined: Any antihypertensive medication with NSAIDs is associated with reduced BP effect ("Reduced BP lowering via sodium retention"), and sympathomimetic agents or venlafaxine similarly show "Reduced BP lowering". Nondihydropyridine CCB with beta blockers can cause "Bradycardia or atrioventricular block". With ACEi, combinations with ARBs lead to "AKI, hyperkalemia"; with potassium-sparing diuretics, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, or potassium supplements lead to "Hyperkalemia"; and with NSAIDs can cause "AKI". CNS depressants with clonidine, methyldopa, or guanfacine cause "Sedation", and clonidine with noncardioselective BB can result in "Unopposed alpha agonism upon BB withdrawal leading to hypertensive crisis". Advantageous interactions include dihydropyridine CCB plus RAS inhibitor with "Reduced risk of dihydropyridine CCB-induced lower leg swelling", RAS inhibitors with diuretics showing "Balanced effects on serum potassium levels with diminished possibility for hypokalemia (with diuretics) or hyperkalemia (with RAASi)", RAS inhibitors with a potassium binder to "Lowers risk of hyperkalemia from the RAS inhibitor", and a diuretic with a potassium supplement to "Lowers risk of hypokalemia from the diuretic".

Potassium disorders are the most common electrolyte abnormality identified in clinical practice. Presenting symptoms are similar for both hypo- and hyperkalemia, primarily affecting the cardiac, neuromuscular, and gastrointestinal systems. Generally, mild hypokalemia is the most common potassium disorder seen clinically; however, severe complications can occur. Hyperkalemia is less common but more serious, especially if levels are rising rapidly. The etiologies and treatments for both hypo- and hyperkalemia are discussed, with special emphasis on the role medications play in the etiologies of each.

NSAIDs in chronic kidney disease — adverse effects and reversibility: NSAIDs may cause gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and kidney adverse events and, by blunting prostaglandin-associated regulation of renal hemodynamics, can induce renal ischemia. NSAIDs can also increase blood pressure, cause edema and sodium retention (mostly mild), induce hyperkalemia, and contribute to heart failure, and NSAID-induced kidney injury is typically reversible with prompt discontinuation.

### Impact of plasma potassium normalization on short-term mortality in patients with hypertension and hyperkalemia [^112RDEXp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Exposure Variable

Normal plasma potassium interval varies within populations. Therefore, different reference intervals are used worldwide. 9, 10, 11 The Nordic Reference Interval Project defines hypokalemia as plasma potassium concentrations < 3.5 mmol/L and hyperkalemia and potassium levels > 4.6 mmol/L. 10

As potassium does not have a linear relationship with mortality, the second potassium measurement was divided into 8 intervals: 2.2 to 2.9 mmol/L, 3.0 to 3.4 mmol/L, 3.5 to 3.7 mmol/L, 3.8 to 4.0 mmol/L, 4.1 to 4.6 mmol/L, 4.7 to 5.0 mmol/L, 5.1 to 5.5 mmol/L, and 5.6 to 7.8 mmol/L. Plasma potassium interval 4.1 to 4.6 mmol/L was used as the reference for statistical analyses. We chose this interval as the reference group on the basis of the study of Krogager et al 3 and the lowest mortality risk observed in a restricted cubic spline curve (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Restricted cubic spline curve showing the adjusted hazard ratios for all‐cause mortality as a function of second plasma potassium measurement.

Knots at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of plasma potassium. The model is adjusted for age, sex, plasma sodium, renal insufficiency, malignancy, heart failure, chronic liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, stroke, atrial flutter/fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, inflammatory bowel disease, antihypertensive therapy, corticosteroids, antimicrobials, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, xanthines, laxatives, digoxin, and potassium supplements.

Outcome

The primary outcome of the study was all‐cause mortality within 90 days of the second plasma potassium measurement occurring 6 to 100 days after the first plasma potassium measurement indicating hyperkalemia. The secondary outcome was cardiovascular death within 90 days of the second potassium measurement.

### Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide (losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide) [^116RyqgK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium

Coadministration of losartan with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

7.2 Lithium

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists or thiazide diuretics. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide and lithium.

7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors

Losartan Potassium In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including losartan) may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving losartan and NSAID therapy.

The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including losartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

Hydrochlorothiazide The administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent including a selective COX-2 inhibitor can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective COX-2 inhibitors are used concomitantly, observe closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.

In patients receiving diuretic therapy, coadministration of NSAIDs with angiotensin receptor blockers, including losartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide, losartan, and NSAID therapy.

Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation.

Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac potassium tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac potassium tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.

Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac potassium tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac potassium tablets (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). Avoid the use of diclofenac potassium tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac potassium tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.

Hyperkalemia

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

Anaphylactic Reactions

Diclofenac has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to diclofenac and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS: Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity).

Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity

A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross- reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac potassium tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). When diclofenac potassium tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115KhjSU]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are common electrolyte disorders caused by changes in potassium intake, altered excretion, or transcellular shifts. Diuretic use and gastrointestinal losses are common causes of hypokalemia, whereas kidney disease, hyperglycemia, and medication use are common causes of hyperkalemia. When severe, potassium disorders can lead to life-threatening cardiac conduction disturbances and neuromuscular dysfunction. Therefore, a first priority is determining the need for urgent treatment through a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory, and electrocardiography findings. Indications for urgent treatment include severe or symptomatic hypokalemia or hyperkalemia; abrupt changes in potassium levels; electrocardiography changes; or the presence of certain comorbid conditions. Hypokalemia is treated with oral or intravenous potassium. To prevent cardiac conduction disturbances, intravenous calcium is administered to patients with hyperkalemic electrocardiography changes. Insulin, usually with concomitant glucose, and albuterol are preferred to lower serum potassium levels in the acute setting; sodium polystyrene sulfonate is reserved for subacute treatment. For both disorders, it is important to consider potential causes of transcellular shifts because patients are at increased risk of rebound potassium disturbances.

### Diclofenac potassium, tablet usp… [^115LULBx]. FDA (DailyMed) (2013). Low credibility.

CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. In patients with renal dysfunction, peak concentrations of metabolites 4'-hydroxy- and 5-hydroxy-diclofenac were approximately 50% and 4% of the parent compound after single oral dosing compared to 27% and 1% in normal healthy subjects. Renal Effects Caution should be used when initiating treatment with diclofenac potassium tablets in patients with considerable dehydration. Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that diclofenac can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure, as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.

Lithium: NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity. Abnormal renal function, anemia, dizziness, edema, elevated liver enzymes, headaches, increased bleeding time, pruritus, rashes and tinnitus. Additional adverse experiences reported occasionally include: Body as a Whole: fever, infection, sepsis Cardiovascular System: congestive heart failure, hypertension, tachycardia, syncope.

Digestive System: dry mouth, esophagitis, gastric/peptic ulcers, gastritis, gastrointestinal bleeding, glossitis, hematemesis, hepatitis, jaundice Hemic and Lymphatic System: ecchymosis, eosinophilia, leukopenia, melena, purpura, rectal bleeding, stomatitis, thrombocytopenia.

5.11 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

​ Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, acute renal failure, and other renal injury.

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

SYMBRAVO is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency and is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency who are at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion.

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of meloxicam in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of SYMBRAVO may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease.

Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating SYMBRAVO. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of SYMBRAVO [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Avoid the use of SYMBRAVO in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If SYMBRAVO is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Hyperkalemia

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

### Fatal hyperkalemia related to combined therapy with a COX-2 inhibitor, ACE inhibitor and potassium rich diet [^1178zsXp]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a 77-year old mildly hypertensive woman with no underlying renal disease who was admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) in a comatose state with fever. The patient had been on low dose enalapril and a potassium rich diet. Five days before admission, rofecoxib, a new selective COX-2 inhibitor nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), was added for leg pain. She was found to have severe hyperkalemia and died 90 min after her arrival. We cannot absolutely determine whether the COX-2 inhibitor was the dominant contributor to the development of hyperkalemia or the combination itself, with an intercurrent infection and some degree of dehydration. Physicians should be aware of this possible complication and only prescribe NSAIDs, including the new COX-2 drugs, to the elderly under close monitoring of kidney function and electrolyte tests.

Hyperkalemia

[see OVERDOSAGE]

In patients with impaired mechanisms for excreting potassium, the administration of potassium salts can produce hyperkalemia and cardiac arrest. This occurs most commonly in patients given potassium by the intravenous route but may also occur in patients given potassium orally. Potentially fatal hyperkalemia can develop rapidly and be asymptomatic. The use of potassium salts in patients with chronic renal disease, or any other condition which impairs potassium excretion, requires particularly careful monitoring of the serum potassium concentration and appropriate dosage adjustment.

Interaction with Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

Hypokalemia should not be treated by the concomitant administration of potassium salts and a potassium-sparing diuretic (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride) since the simultaneous administration of these agents can produce severe hyperkalemia.

Interaction with Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors

Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), spironolactone, eplerenone, or aliskiren produce potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone production. Closely monitor potassium in patients receiving concomitant RAAS therapy.

Interaction with Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may produce potassium retention by reducing renal synthesis of prostaglandin E and impairing the renin-angiotensin system. Closely monitor potassium in patients receiving concomitant NSAID therapy.

### DICLOFENAC POTASSIUM, TABLET USP… [^115PmuKh]. FDA (DailyMed) (2013). Low credibility.

Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. Renal Effects Caution should be used when initiating treatment with diclofenac potassium tablets in patients with considerable dehydration. Cyclosporine: Diclofenac potassium tablets, like other NSAIDs, may affect renal prostaglandins and increase the toxicity of certain drugs. Therefore, concomitant therapy with diclofenac potassium tablets may increase cyclosporine's nephrotoxicity. Caution should be used when diclofenac potassium tablets are administered concomitantly with cyclosporine. Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that diclofenac can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.

During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure, as well as to assure diuretic efficacy. Lithium: NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity. Abnormal renal function, anemia, dizziness, edema, elevated liver enzymes, headaches, increased bleeding time, pruritus, rashes and tinnitus.

Definitions of hyperkalemia

Definitions of hyperkalemia vary by geographic region. In Europe, mild hyperkalemia is defined as serum potassium 5.0–5.4 mEq/L, moderate as 5.5–5.9 mEq/L, and severe as ≥ 6.0 mEq/L. The American Heart Association uses cutoffs of 5–6 mEq/L (mild), 6–7 mEq/L (moderate), and > 7 mEq/L (severe). However, in this review, we refer to the standard potassium values specified in the guidelines published by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare entitled "Classification criteria for the seriousness of adverse drug reactions of medical agents", wherein serum potassium values of ≥ 5.5 mEq/L and < 6.0 mEq/L are classified as Grade 2 adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and values of ≥ 6.0 mEq/L are classified as Grade 3 ADRs. For patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), Japanese nephrology guidelines recommend maintaining serum potassium between 4.0 and 5.5 mEq/L to avoid hypo- or hyperkalemia. Of note, mild to moderate hyperkalemia generally cannot be diagnosed from electrocardiogram (ECG) changes; a study in hospitalized patients indicated that the first ECG changes occurred at serum potassium levels above 7.2 mEq/L, a level that already indicates severe hyperkalemia.

### The burden of hyperkalemia in Germany-a real world evidence study assessing the treatment and costs of hyperkalemia [^114LR5UT]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperkalemia (HK) is a potentially life-threatening metabolic condition characterized by an increased serum concentration of potassium. Normal values of potassium have a range from 3.5 to 5 mmol/l, and hyperkalemia is defined by a value of ≥ 5.1 mmol/l; some authors prefer a low limit of 5.5 mmol/l.

Clinical symptoms of hyperkalemia are inconstant and unspecific (fatigue, muscular weakness), however, hyperkalemia can cause arrhythmia and heart arrest without pre-occurring clinical signs. The condition of hyperkalemia is usually detected in the context of routine laboratory screening. In the light of possibly life-threatening consequences, a finding of hyperkalemia implies an urgent demand for medical clarification and treatment.

The predominant risk factor of hyperkalemia is advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). In patients with CKD ≥ 3 (GFR < 60 ml/min), the decreased ability to excrete potassium, especially in combination with diabetes mellitus and/or heart failure frequently results in recurrent and chronic hyperkalemia. Medication (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)-Inhibitors and lifestyle (irregular nutrition and circadian rhythm) are additional risk factors.

The true incidence and prevalence of hyperkalemia in the general population is not known, as there are no population-wide studies that examine it. A retrospective analysis based on a selected Canadian population (≥ 65 years) demonstrates that 2.6% of the individuals from the emergency department and 3.5% of the hospitalized patients were hyperkalemic. Further retrospective US researches deliver similar incidence rates between 2.5 and 3.2%. However, due to the low sensitivity, the true frequency in the general population is assumed to be considerably higher.

5.8 Heart Failure and Edema

The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.

Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions [e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)].

Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium topical gel in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium topical gel is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.

5.9 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.

Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

No information is available from controlled clinical trials regarding the use of diclofenac sodium topical gel in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium topical gel may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease.

Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium topical gel. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium topical gel [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium topical gel in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium topical gel is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.

Hyperkalemia

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

### Managing hyperkalemia: another benefit of exercise in people with chronic kidney disease? [^115ujuko]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of hyperkalemia, an electrolyte abnormality that can cause serious, sometimes fatal, cardiac arrhythmias. Muscle contraction causes potassium to be released from cells, increasing serum potassium concentrations. However, these effects are transient, and the long-term impact of exercise training on hyperkalemia risk in CKD patients is largely unknown. In this review, we examine the effects of exercise on factors affecting potassium balance in people with CKD, highlighting the potential benefits of regular exercise on hyperkalemia risk in this population. Although regular exercise is already recommended for people with CKD, research examining this hypothesis may lead to novel therapeutic treatments for this life-threatening condition.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^113hTA5U]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperkalemia:

- **Definition**: Hyperkalemia is defined as an increase in serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of hyperkalemia involves disruptions in potassium balance due to excess potassium intake, impaired potassium excretion, or transcellular shifts. The etiology is often multifactorial, with impaired renal function, medication use, and hyperglycemia being the most common contributors.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyperkalemia in the US is estimated at 1,550 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Mild and moderate hyperkalemia are usually asymptomatic. Severe cases may manifest as muscle weakness, ascending paralysis, heart palpitations, and paresthesias. ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, P-wave flattening, PR-interval prolongation, widening of the QRS complex, and sine waves.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of hyperkalemia is dependent on the severity of the condition and the promptness of treatment. Severe untreated hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.

NSAIDs and other conditions

All NSAIDs can also raise blood pressure and interfere with the blood pressure lowering effects of certain medication classes, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The concomitant use of NSAIDs with diuretics increases the likelihood of nephrotoxicity as well as interfering with their blood pressure lowering effects. Electrolyte issues — particularly hyperkalaemia, are also associated with NSAID use. NSAIDs, both traditional and Cox-2 selective inhibitors must, therefore, be used with caution in all patients with renal failure. Congestive heart failure can also be exacerbated by traditional and Cox-2 selective NSAIDs.

---

### Hyperkalemia [^116MgUnZ]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening metabolic problem caused by inability of the kidneys to excrete potassium, impairment of the mechanisms that move potassium from the circulation into the cells, or a combination of these factors. Acute episodes of hyperkalemia commonly are triggered by the introduction of a medication affecting potassium homeostasis; illness or dehydration also can be triggers. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, hyperkalemia may be caused by the syndrome of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. The presence of typical electrocardiographic changes or a rapid rise in serum potassium indicates that hyperkalemia is potentially life threatening. Urine potassium, creatinine, and osmolarity should be obtained as a first step in determining the cause of hyperkalemia, which directs long-term treatment. Intravenous calcium is effective in reversing electrocardiographic changes and reducing the risk of arrhythmias but does not lower serum potassium. Serum potassium levels can be lowered acutely by using intravenous insulin and glucose, nebulized beta2 agonists, or both. Sodium polystyrene therapy, sometimes with intravenous furosemide and saline, is then initiated to lower total body potassium levels.

5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of TIVORBEX in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of TIVORBEX may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.

Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating TIVORBEX. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of TIVORBEX [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid the use of TIVORBEX in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If TIVORBEX is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.

It has been reported that the addition of the potassium-sparing diuretic, triamterene, to a maintenance schedule of indomethacin resulted in reversible acute renal failure in two of four healthy volunteers. Indomethacin and triamterene should not be administered together.

Hyperkalemia

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

Both indomethacin and potassium-sparing diuretics may be associated with increased serum potassium levels. The potential effects of indomethacin and potassium-sparing diuretics on potassium levels and renal function should be considered when these agents are administered concurrently.

5.7 Anaphylact ic Reactions

Indomethacin has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to indomethacin and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In 718 patients treated for shorter periods, i.e., 2 weeks or less, with diclofenac potassium immediate-release tablets, adverse reactions were reported one-half to one-tenth as frequently as by patients treated for longer periods. In a 6-month, double-blind trial comparing diclofenac potassium tablets (N = 196) versus VOLTRAREN (N = 197) versus ibuprofen (N = 197), adverse reactions were similar in nature and frequency.

Precautions

The diagnosis of potassium depletion is ordinarily made by demonstrating hypokalemia in a patient with a clinical history suggesting some cause for potassium depletion. In interpreting the serum potassium level, the physician should bear in mind that acute alkalosis per se can produce hypokalemia in the absence of a deficit in total body potassium, while acute acidosis per se can increase the serum potassium concentration into the normal range even in the presence of a reduced total body potassium. The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis, requires careful attention to acid-base balance and appropriate monitoring of serum electrolytes, the electrocardiogram, and the clinical status of the patient.

Information for patients

To minimize the possibility of gastrointestinal irritation associated with the oral ingestion of concentrated potassium salt preparations, patients should be directed to dissolve each dose completely in the stated amount of water.

Each dose should be taken immediately after a meal or with food. Patients should avoid low-salt foods and salt substitutes, unless approved by physician. The patient should be cautioned to comply strictly with the regimen, particularly when taking diuretics or digitalis, to visit the physician regularly and to report at once any unusual symptoms (e.g. blackish stools, a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding). As with any other medicine, the patient should be counseled on this background information and advised to report to the physician any changes in routine (e.g. starting a fitness program). Proper storage and handling of the product is important. Tablets should not be removed from foil pouch until shortly before use.

Laboratory tests

Frequent clinical evaluation of the patient should include an ECG and a serum potassium level; also, as appropriate, renal function, serum magnesium and serum pH.

Drug Interactions

The simultaneous administration of potassium supplements and a potassium-sparing diuretic can produce severe hyperkalemia (see Contraindications). Potassium supplements should be used cautiously in patients who are using salt substitutes, because most of the latter contain substantial amounts of potassium. Such concomitant use could result in hyperkalemia.

Moreover, the following drugs may produce unfavorable interactions when used concomitantly with potassium supplements: angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, heparin, low-salt foods, other potassium containing medications, digitalis glycosides and others.

### Potassium management with finerenone: practical aspects [^114ypRXH]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

2 SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND

2.1 Definition of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia can be classified as acute (as occurring in an emergent setting), chronic, or recurrent, depending on the onset and number of hyperkalemia episodes that have occurred. The decision of whether emergency therapy is warranted is largely based on subjective clinical judgement. The lack of robust and evidence‐based treatment guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia in the emergency department poses a challenge for treatment.

Although the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and other organizations, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Hearth Failure Society of America (HFSA)have issued guidelines, the concentration of potassium that is labelled as hyperkalemia varies. Serum potassium concentrations of 5.0,5.5, or 6.0 mmol/Lare commonly used cutoffs for the definition of hyperkalemia.

The KDIGO controversies' conference report defines the severity of hyperkalemia by both serum potassium concentration and ECG changes. The most common ECG change is peaked T waves, followed by QRS prolongation. Hyperkalemia is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on potassium concentration and the presence or absence of ECG changes. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 5.0–5.9 mmol/L are typically defined as mild and ≥ 6.0–6.4 mmol/L as moderate. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 6.5 mmol/L are typically defined as severe.

### Pain-free today, weak tomorrow: a case of electrolyte disorder due to diclofenac misuse [^113RLiCR]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The treatment of electrolyte disorders does not follow guidelines and has no consensus as to the pathogenic mechanism involved. In general, a broad group of drugs were used in this case to rebalance the biochemical and clinical situation. In particular, potassium and magnesium supplementation and calcium regulation restored the patient's physiological situation. Muscle paralysis achieved immediate improvement after correction of plasma potassium with oral potassium chloride and plasma calcium with calcium carbonate.

In contrast to findings documented in the literature for other NSAIDs, the presented case exhibited no discernible alteration in renal function, as evidenced by the absence of changes in creatinine indices or a reduction in diuresis.

In fact, of particular interest in our patient was the profound hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia with normal renal function which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been previously reported with a misuse of diclofenac. We excluded the use of proton pump inhibitors or drugs interfering with magnesium absorption or elimination or a reduced intake. Indeed, the patient followed a mediterranean diet. The precise mechanism by which the administration of diclofenac in our patient led to the cumulative electrolyte damage remains unclear. We hypothesized that multiple mechanisms can act in the development of these disturbances: firstly, the possible inhibition of carbonic anhydrase II existing in both distal and proximal renal tubules, leading to the lack of bicarbonate ions reabsorption, as already described for ibuprofen. Therefore, the metabolic acidosis is triggered and sodium reabsorption is also impaired, leading to increased sodium delivery in the distal tubule, and increased excretion of potassium by the kidneys. Secondly, diclofenac could act as a strong inducer of oxidative stress. Thirdly, in vivo studies clearly showed that the use of diclofenac can affect mitochondria metabolism.

In conclusion, this case underscores the imperative of acknowledging this potential risk and the potential for life-threatening, albeit reversible, electrolyte and acid-base disturbances that may arise with the widespread availability of these specific types of NSAIDs.

8.7 Renal Impairment

Patients with renal impairment have reduced urinary excretion of potassium and are at substantially increased risk of hyperkalemia. Patients with impaired renal function, particularly if the patient is on RAAS inhibitors or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, should usually be started at the low end of the dosing range because of the potential for development of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.3)]. The serum potassium level should be monitored frequently. Renal function should be assessed periodically.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia in older adults: a population-based study [^111Lz48e]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical guidelines caution against nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use in older adults. The study objective was to quantify the 30-day risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and hyperkalemia in older adults after NSAID initiation and to develop a model to predict these outcomes.

Methods

We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada from 2007 to 2015 of patients ≥ 66years. We matched 46 107 new NSAID users with 46 107 nonusers with similar baseline health. The primary outcome was 30-day risk of AKI and secondary outcomes were hyperkalemia and all-cause mortality.

Results

NSAID use versus nonuse was associated with a higher 30-day risk of AKI {380 [0.82%] versus 272 [0.59%]; odds ratio (OR) 1.41 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20–1.65]} and hyperkalemia [184 (0.40%) versus 123 (0.27%); OR 1.50 (95% CI 1.20–1.89); risk difference 0.23% (95% CI 0.13–0.34)]. There was no association between NSAID use and all-cause mortality. A prediction model incorporated six predictors of AKI or hyperkalemia: older age, male gender, lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, higher baseline serum potassium, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use or diuretic use. This model had moderate discrimination [C-statistic 0.72 (95% CI 0.70–0.74)] and good calibration.

Conclusions

In older adults, new NSAID use compared with nonuse was associated with a higher 30-day risk of AKI and hyperkalemia but not all-cause mortality. Prescription NSAID use among many older adults may be safe, but providers should use caution and assess individual risk.

Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of LOFENA patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of LOFENA may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.

Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac potassium tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac potassium tablets (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

Avoid the use of diclofenac potassium tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac potassium tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.

Hyperkalemia

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

Anaphylactic Reactions

Diclofenac has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to diclofenac and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS: Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity).

Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity

A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, LOFENA is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). When LOFENA is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.

7 HYPERKALEMIA AS AN OBSTACLE TO OPTIMUM HF TREATMENT

Drug‐induced hyperkalemia is one of the most common causes of hyperkalemia in HF. Unfortunately, this fear results in clinicians' inertia who very often discontinue or down‐titrate medications that induce it. On the other hand, disease modifying drugs statistically reduce the risk of mortality in HF patients, and their adverse effect, such as hyperkalemia, contribute to an improvement of prognosis only when serum potassium levels show moderate elevation. Meanwhile, the development of hypokalemia worsens prognosis and increases mortality. The same effect was observed if the potassium level was over ≥ 6.0 mmol/L. Although mild hyperkalemia is not a clinical problem, given the risk of development of more severe hyperkalemia, serum potassium levels should be closely monitored inhigh‐risk patients. While in the era of trials such as RALES and EMPHASIS‐HF, 30, 42 the rate of discontinuation is low in clinical practice, among new users of MRA therapy rates of discontinuation in the first year are high even with mild hyperkalemia. Of the patients who experience hyperkalemia, almost half discontinue the drug, with only a small percentage trying a reduced dose, and of those who discontinue the drug because of hyperkalemia, few restart. 48 In a large retrospective clinical trial in patients with new onset HF, serum potassium concentrations outside 4.0 to 5.0 mmol/L were associated not only with elevated mortality risk, but also with increased likelihood of RAASi discontinuation. 49

### Diclofenac sodium [^113hWnmr]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of diclofenac sodium ER PO:
- **Anemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of anemia. Monitor hemoglobin levels and for signs of bleeding.
- **Edema**: use caution in patients taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, as diclofenac may blunt the cardiovascular effects of these agents. Avoid using in patients with severe HF unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening HF.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as diclofenac has been associated with an increased risk of elevations of serum transaminases and, rarely, severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure. Monitor liver enzymes periodically in patients on long-term treatment.
- **Hypertension**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as diclofenac has been associated with an increased risk of new-onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension. Monitor BP.
- **Increased serum potassium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as diclofenac has been associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia.
- **Mask symptoms of infection**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as diclofenac reduces inflammation and fever, potentially diminishing the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.
- **Renal toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term use of diclofenac has been associated with an increased risk of renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, AKI, and other renal injury, especially in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration or hypovolemia, taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, and in the elderly. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration, or hypovolemia.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as diclofenac has been associated with an increased risk of exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and DRESS syndrome.

5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, ACE inhibitors or the ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of celecoxib may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.

Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating celecoxib. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of celecoxib [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If celecoxib is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.

Hyperkalemia

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

5.7 Anaphylactic Reactions

Celecoxib has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to celecoxib and in patients with aspirin sensitive asthma. Celecoxib is a sulfonamide and both NSAIDs and sulfonamides may cause allergic type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Seek emergency help if any anaphylactic reaction occurs.

Background

The nephrotoxic effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely acknowledged. In particular, diclofenac is the most commonly prescribed NSAIDs, but no previous findings of electrolyte disturbances were reported following its administration.

Case Report

We presented the case of a man who experienced significant weakness associated with severe deficiencies in potassium, calcium, and magnesium after misusing diclofenac because of severe back pain.

Conclusions

This case emphasizes the need of awareness about the electrolyte imbalances and electrolyte disturbances associated with the misuse of diclofenac, which is a widely available drug. This is a case report which does not need a Clinical Trial Number.

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia? [^1179Cqu6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder appreciated with greater frequency in patients with renal disease, heart failure, and with use of certain medications such as renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. The traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by electrocardiogram and that particular levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypic presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations of morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperkalemia but these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and in differing clinical presentations. Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and degree of concurrent illness might predispose certain patients presenting with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked; yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia is in determining patient outcome. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hyperkalemia: Patients with decreased renal function, diabetes, proteinuria or patients who are taking ARBs, NSAIDs or moderate CYP3A inhibitors are at increased risk. Monitor serum potassium levels and adjust dose as needed. (5.1)

5.1 Hyperkalemia

The risk of hyperkalemia is higher in patients with impaired renal function, proteinuria, diabetes and those concomitantly treated with ARBs, NSAIDs and moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Minimize the risk of hyperkalemia with proper patient selection and monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.2), and Drug Interactions (7)]. Monitor patients for the development of hyperkalemia until the effect of eplerenone is established. Patients who develop hyperkalemia (5.5–5.9 mEq/L) may continue eplerenone therapy with proper dose adjustment. Dose reduction decreases potassium levels. Patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors that cannot be avoided should have their dose of eplerenone reduced [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### Dispensed selective and nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the risk of moderate to severe hyperkalemia: a nested case-control study [^1116ECs3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

It is not known whether nonselective and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) differ in terms of hyperkalemia risk. The aim of this study was to compare the differential risk of hyperkalemia associated with various NSAIDs.

Study Design

Nested case-control study.

Setting & Participants

New NSAID users receiving care in the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system from October 2000 to September 2006. PREDICTOR OF FACTOR: Different NSAIDs ordered by COX-2 selectivity.

Outcomes & Measurements

Risk of hyperkalemia (defined as first serum potassium value ≥ 6.0 mEq/L) was estimated with a multivariate conditional logistic model adjusting for age, race, morbidities, medications, and contrast media.

Results

We identified 18,326 cases of hyperkalemia and 355,106 matched controls. Risk of hyperkalemia did not differ in patients using a single NSAID (adjusted OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.98–1.08) or 2 or more NSAIDs (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.96–1.41) compared with patients no longer using an NSAID. However, risk varied by specific NSAID and elevated risks were found for use of rofecoxib, celecoxib, diclofenac, and indomethacin, but not meloxicam, etodolac, piroxicam, sulindac, ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketorolac. Interactions were found between NSAID use and exposure to renin-angiotensin blockers and contrast media.

Limitations

Some NSAIDs are available over the counter and women are under-represented in the VA population.

Conclusions

NSAIDs may not by themselves carry a higher risk of moderate to severe hyperkalemia. Certain NSAIDs may increase the risk of hyperkalemia, but it is not related to COX-2 selectivity of the NSAID and may depend on concurrent exposure to other agents.

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^1157By8d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

There have been significant recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain potassium homoeostasis and the clinical consequences of hyperkalemia. In this article we discuss these advances within a concise review of the pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences of hyperkalemia. We highlight aspects that are of particular relevance for clinical practice. Hyperkalemia occurs when renal potassium excretion is limited by reductions in glomerular filtration rate, tubular flow, distal sodium delivery or the expression of aldosterone-sensitive ion transporters in the distal nephron. Accordingly, the major risk factors for hyperkalemia are renal failure, diabetes mellitus, adrenal disease and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or potassium-sparing diuretics. Hyperkalemia is associated with an increased risk of death, and this is only in part explicable by hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to its well-established effects on cardiac excitability, hyperkalemia could also contribute to peripheral neuropathy and cause renal tubular acidosis. Hyperkalemia-or the fear of hyperkalemia-contributes to the underprescription of potentially beneficial medications, particularly in heart failure. The newer potassium binders could play a role in attempts to minimize reduced prescribing of renin-angiotensin inhibitors and mineraolocorticoid antagonists in this context.

### Potassium chloride extended-release (Potassium chloride) [^117W95TH]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Hyperkalemia (see OVERDOSAGE): In patients with impaired mechanisms for excreting potassium, the administration of potassium salts can produce hyperkalemia and cardiac arrest. This occurs most commonly in patients given potassium by the intravenous route but may also occur in patients given potassium orally. Potentially fatal hyperkalemia can develop rapidly and be asymptomatic. The use of potassium salts in patients with chronic renal disease, or any other condition which impairs potassium excretion, requires particularly careful monitoring of the serum potassium concentration and appropriate dosage adjustment.

Interaction with Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

Hypokalemia should not be treated by the concomitant administration of potassium salts and a potassium-sparing diuretic (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride) since the simultaneous administration of these agents can produce severe hyperkalemia.

Interaction with Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors

Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), spironolactone, eplerenone, or aliskiren produce potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone production. Closely monitor potassium in patients receiving concomitant RAAS therapy.

Interaction with Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may produce potassium retention by reducing renal synthesis of prostaglandin E and impairing the renin-angiotensin system. Closely monitor potassium in patients receiving concomitant NSAID therapy.

### Pain-free today, weak tomorrow: a case of electrolyte disorder due to diclofenac misuse [^115KdeNy]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The patient refused hospitalization and intravenous treatment, so he was treated as an outpatient clinic patient. He was treated with 600 mg orally potassium chloride tid. Subsequently, his serum potassium levels exhibited a gradual increase, reaching 3.2 mmol/L in the following days. Concurrent hypomagnesemia was corrected with magnesium supplementation with a daily dosage of 1,500 mg, resulting in an improvement of magnesium levels. Additionally, calcium supplementation was instituted with calcium carbonate at a dosage of 1000 mg tid, along with calcitriol administered at 0.5 micrograms tid. This intervention led to an elevation in serum calcium levels, reaching up to 8 mg/dl.

At the subsequent visit, on day 15 following the start of the therapy, laboratory assessments revealed potassium levels of 4 mmol/L, calcium levels of 10 mg/dL, and magnesium levels of 1.6 mg/dL (Table 1). After a month, all values of the above-mentioned electrolytes normalized, and the previously reported weakness resolved.

Heart Failure and Edema

The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalization for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.

Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) (see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions).

Avoid the use of diclofenac potassium tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac potassium tablets are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.

Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation.

Abstract

There have been significant recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain potassium homoeostasis and the clinical consequences of hyperkalemia. In this article we discuss these advances within a concise review of the pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences of hyperkalemia. We highlight aspects that are of particular relevance for clinical practice. Hyperkalemia occurs when renal potassium excretion is limited by reductions in glomerular filtration rate, tubular flow, distal sodium delivery or the expression of aldosterone-sensitive ion transporters in the distal nephron. Accordingly, the major risk factors for hyperkalemia are renal failure, diabetes mellitus, adrenal disease and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or potassium-sparing diuretics. Hyperkalemia is associated with an increased risk of death, and this is only in part explicable by hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to its well-established effects on cardiac excitability, hyperkalemia could also contribute to peripheral neuropathy and cause renal tubular acidosis. Hyperkalemia — or the fear of hyperkalemia — contributes to the underprescription of potentially beneficial medications, particularly in heart failure. The newer potassium binders could play a role in attempts to minimize reduced prescribing of renin–angiotensin inhibitors and mineraolocorticoid antagonists in this context.

2.2 Risk factors of hyperkalemia

Abnormal serum potassium concentrations represent one of the most important electrolyte disorders in clinical practice. In this regard, potassium plays a critical role in normal cell membrane electrophysiology, with both hyperkalemia and hypokalemia leading to electrophysiological perturbations. While mild hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic, high potassium concentrations can cause life‐threatening cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or paralysis. The kidneys play a central role in potassium homeostasis. Kidney dysfunction and acquired or inherited defects in potassium excretion in the distal nephron are among the most important risk factors for hyperkalemia. Accordingly, the main risk factors for hyperkalemia are kidney failure, diabetes mellitus, and adrenal disease.

An international meta‐analysis of over 1.2 million patients with CKD from 27 different cohorts examined the risk factors leading to hyperkalemia. The risk of hyperkalemia correlated strongly with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): a decrease in eGFR of 15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 approximately doubled the risk of hyperkalemia. While lower eGFR was a strong risk factor for hyperkalemia, higher albuminuria was a weaker risk factor. Furthermore, medications such as potassium‐sparing diuretics, MRAs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, direct renin antagonists, β‐blockers, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, heparin, and penicillin are associated with hyperkalemia. Potassium supplements and potassium‐based salt substitutes may also be a cause of hyperkalemia, especially in patients with underlying CKD or concomitant use of hyperkalemia‐inducing drugs.

7.1 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium

Coadministration of losartan with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

7.2 Lithium

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists or thiazide diuretics. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide and lithium.

7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors

Losartan Potassium

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including losartan) may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving losartan and NSAID therapy.

The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including losartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

Hydrochlorothiazide

The administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent including a selective COX-2 inhibitor can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective COX-2 inhibitors are used concomitantly, observe closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.

In patients receiving diuretic therapy, coadministration of NSAIDs with angiotensin receptor blockers, including losartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide, losartan, and NSAID therapy.

Renal Risks

In addition to the GI and CV effects of NSAIDs, epidemiological and pathologic data also associate NSAID use with the potential for both acute and chronic kidney disease (CKD).–Renal side effects which include sodium and water retention with edema, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury may precipitate renal failure resulting in acute dialysis. Risk factors include older age, renal impairment, heart failure, liver disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), and concurrent prescription with antihypertensive drugs (eg, diuretics, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors). Again, mechanisms of NSAID-induced kidney damage relate to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and are dose- and duration-dependent. Low levels of COX-2 are constitutively expressed in the macula densa, with COX-2 inhibition leading to a reduction in renal blood flow and resulting functional impairment. NSAIDs may also accumulate in renal tubular cells during secretion. While NSAID-induced sodium retention is COX-2-mediated, NSAID-induced reductions in glomerular filtration rate are mediated via COX-1.

Consistent with the dual COX-1/COX-2-dependent mechanisms, which predict the possibility of differences in renal toxicity for different NSAIDs, there are limited data to suggest clinically relevant differences. In the MEDAL program, etoricoxib had a greater risk of renovascular adverse events than diclofenac. In PRECISION, the risk of renal events was significantly lower with celecoxib compared with ibuprofen, and was similar for celecoxib compared with naproxen. In a meta-analysis, NSAIDs with high COX-2 selectivity had a lower association with acute kidney injury (AKI) compared to NSAIDs with low COX-2 selectivity. Overall, NSAIDs have a low but tangible risk in causing AKI, electrolyte imbalances and increased BP, but their role in progressive kidney disease is associated only with long-term use in high cumulative doses. In patients with CKD, withdrawal of NSAID use is recommended by nephrology consensus groups, but initiation of alternatives such as opioids conveys different and no less important drug-related concerns. In a study conducted in China that included age- and sex-matched controls of NSAID users, long-term (≥ 48 months) use of NSAIDs was independently associated with reduced renal function. It is recommended that patients with risk factors for renal impairment have preventative strategies in place that include using the lowest effective NSAID dose for the shortest possible time, as well as monitoring renal function, fluid retention and electrolyte abnormalities. The concomitant use of NSAIDs and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be avoided.

### Celecoxib (generic drug) [^113c171i]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, ACE inhibitors or the ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of celecoxib may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.

Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating celecoxib. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of celecoxib [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If celecoxib is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.

Hyperkalemia

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

5.7 Anaphylactic Reactions

Celecoxib has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to celecoxib and in patients with aspirin sensitive asthma. Celecoxib is a sulfonamide and both NSAIDs and sulfonamides may cause allergic type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Seek emergency help if any anaphylactic reaction occurs.

### Pain-free today, weak tomorrow: a case of electrolyte disorder due to diclofenac misuse [^113RkqxE]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most prescribed medications in pain management; they act through the inhibition of cyclooxygenases, thus reducing the production of many different prostaglandins which are involved in multiple physiopathological pathways.

The pleiotropic action of prostaglandins explains both the analgesic and anti-inflammatory action and the adverse effects such as the impairment of kidney and platelet function with an increasing risk of renal injury and bleeding; moreover, NSAIDs can also cause gastric and duodenum ulcers by reducing the secretion of protective mucus. Here we reported for the first time in the literature a case of hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia related to the misuse of diclofenac, which is one of the most commonly used NSAIDs.

### Management of severe hyperkalemia [^116Vgddg]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia, and a rational approach to its management.

Methods

This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include search of MEDLINE, and bibliographic search of current textbooks and journal articles.

Results and Conclusions

A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^1136PaYq]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Although the management of hyperkalemia in these patient populations may include reduction or discontinuation of RAASi, this may have a negative impact on outcomes. Adverse cardiorenal outcomes have been observed to increase with RAASi dose reduction or discontinuation, particularly in cohorts with CKD and HF. 50 Therefore, optimizing the therapeutic dosage of RAASi is encouraged, despite any difficulties in managing hyperkalemia. Due to the high prevalence of comorbidities among patients with HF, there is a risk that target doses of the disease‐modifying drugs cannot be achieved, reducing the effectiveness of the therapy.

Although the problem of hyperkalemia in these patients appears significant, one if its clear causes are the lack of sufficient control of potassium levels in primary care, which leads to the hyperkalemia rates described above, together with their complications. Nilsson et al. examined patients starting MRA therapy between 2007 and 2010 in Sweden and found that only 24% were adequately monitored at the recommended intervals. 51 The prompt recognition of hyperkalemia usually leads to its treatment, improving the rates of optimum treatment in HF patients.

In general, HF patients with renal dysfunction, high potassium levels (> 5.0 mEq/L) or bilateral renal stenosis might need a rechecking of potassium levels within 1 to 2 weeks after the initiation of RAASi and then every 3 to 5 months, while treatment may be stopped or the dose reduced when potassium is > 5.5 mEq/L. Regarding MRAs in these patients, potassium is checked after 1 week, then 4, and then every 3 months; again, treatment is stopped or tapered when the potassium level reaches > 5.5 mEq/L.

In every case, we should try to restart treatment. HF treatment guidelines do not encourage MRAs use in patients with an eGFR < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m² or serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L. In addition, it is important to instigate dietary counseling regarding potassium and reappraise concomitant medications (eg, potassium supplements, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, etc.) in those patients.

Pharmacodynamic drug–drug interactions with antihypertensive medications — cautionary combinations include any antihypertensive medication with NSAIDs (reduced BP lowering via sodium retention) or venlafaxine (reduced BP lowering), nondihydropyridine CCB with beta blockers (bradycardia or atrioventricular block), and several ACEi pairings: with ARBs (AKI, hyperkalemia), potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, amiloride; hyperkalemia), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (hyperkalemia), potassium supplements (hyperkalemia), or NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen, naproxen; AKI); additional cautions include clonidine, methyldopa, or guanfacine with CNS depressants (sedation) and clonidine with noncardioselective BB (unopposed alpha agonism upon BB withdrawal leading to hypertensive crisis). Advantageous combinations noted are dihydropyridine CCB with a RAS inhibitor (reduced risk of dihydropyridine CCB-induced lower leg swelling), RAS inhibitors with diuretics (balanced effects on serum potassium with diminished possibility for hypokalemia or hyperkalemia), RAS inhibitors with a potassium binder (lowers risk of hyperkalemia from the RAS inhibitor), and diuretic with potassium supplement (lowers risk of hypokalemia from the diuretic).

Geriatric Use

Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions, If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects (see WARNINGS; Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events, Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation, Hepatotoxicity, Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia, PRECAUTIONS; Laboratory Monitoring).

Diclofenac is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, ADVERSE REACTIONS).

5.4 Hypertension

NSAIDs, including the ibuprofen in COMBOGESIC, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.

5.5 Heart Failure and Edema

The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.

Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of ibuprofen may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Avoid the use of COMBOGESIC in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If COMBOGESIC is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.

### Can novel potassium binders liberate people with chronic kidney disease from the low-potassium diet? A cautionary tale [^117Bq6M8]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

The advent of new potassium binders provides an important breakthrough in the chronic management of hyperkalemia for people with CKD. In addition to the direct benefits of managing hyperkalemia, many researchers and clinicians view these new medications as a possible means to safely transition patients away from the low-potassium diet to a more healthful eating pattern. In this review, we examine the mechanisms of potassium binders in the context of hyperkalemia risk related to dietary potassium intake in people with CKD. We note that whereas these medications target hyperkalemia caused by potassium bioaccumulation, the primary evidence for restricting dietary potassium is risk of postprandial hyperkalemia. The majority of ingested potassium is absorbed alongside endogenously secreted potassium in the small intestines, but the action of these novel medications is predominantly constrained to the large intestine. As a result and despite their effectiveness in lowering basal potassium levels, it remains unclear whether potassium binders would provide protection against hyperkalemia caused by excessive dietary potassium intake in people with CKD. Until this knowledge gap is bridged, clinicians should consider postprandial hyperkalemia risk when removing restrictions on dietary potassium intake in people with CKD on potassium binders.

Case presentation

A 73-year-old man presented to our clinic complaining of back pain for approximately three days, for which he took a diclofenac 75 mg intramuscular injection, yielding no relief. Due to the ongoing painful symptoms, he received two additional diclofenac intramuscular injections on the same day. He noted that four hours after the last diclofenac injection, he started experiencing nausea and dizziness, followed by acute muscle paralysis in both lower extremities. He denied any other medication; in particular, he did not take diuretics; he denied any variations in his diet during those painful days and he did not suffer from any kind of eating disorder. He was affected by hypertension treated with amlodipine. He exhibited previous biochemical exams, which were normal. There was no history of diarrhea or vomiting and family history was unremarkable; he was recently diagnosed with spondylarthrosis without signs of compression and no neurological deficits were found. Furthermore, electromyographic study and abdominal ultrasound showed no pathological findings. Arterial blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg and electrocardiogram showed no relevant alterations. He did not present symptoms or sign of infections. Blood tests at the time of symptoms showed hypokalaemia (serum potassium 2.6 mmol/L), hypocalcaemia (serum calcium 6.2 mg/dl), hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium 0.5 mg/dl) with a normal renal function. Urinary pH was 6.5. The arterial blood gas analysis revealed a metabolic hyperchloremic acidosis with normal anion gap. Thyroid function and autoimmune tests were in normal ranges. Supine plasma renin activity was 1.5 microU/ml, and plasma aldosterone concentration was normal.

### Updates on medical management of hyperkalemia [^117FVX6D]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hyperkalemia is a potentially fatal electrolyte disorder, more commonly present when the potassium excretion capacity is imparied. Hyperkalemia can lead to adverse outcomes, especially due to severe cardiac arrhythmias. It can also impair the cardiovascular effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis) and potassium rich diets, as hyperkalemia frequently leads to their discontinuation.

Recent Findings

Potassium is a predictor of mortality and should be monitored closely for patients who are at risk for hyperkalemia. Acute hyperkalemia protocols have been revised and updated. Randomized trials have shown that the new anti-hyperkalemic agents (patiromer and zirconium cyclosilicate) are effective hyperkalemia treatment options. The use of anti-hyperkalemic agents may allow for a less restrictive potassium diet and lower RAASi discontinuation rates.

Summary

Hyperkalemia should be monitored closely for high-risk patients, as it is associated with adverse outcomes. New therapies have demonstrated effective control, offering hope for potential use in patients that would benefit from diet or medications associated with an increase in serum potassium, indicating that the use of hyperkalemic agents can be associated with better outcomes.

Hyperkalemia: Patients with decreased renal function, diabetes, proteinuria or patients who are taking ACEs and ARBs, NSAIDs or moderate CYP3A inhibitors are at increased risk. Monitor serum potassium levels and adjust dose as needed. (5.1)

5.1 Hyperkalemia

The risk of hyperkalemia is higher in patients with impaired renal function, proteinuria, diabetes and those concomitantly treated with ACEs, ARBs, NSAIDs and moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Minimize the risk of hyperkalemia with proper patient selection and monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.2), and Drug Interactions (7)]. Monitor patients for the development of hyperkalemia until the effect of INSPRA is established. Patients who develop hyperkalemia (5.5–5.9 mEq/L) may continue INSPRA therapy with proper dose adjustment. Dose reduction decreases potassium levels. Patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors that cannot be avoided should have their dose of eplerenone reduced [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

- **Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory drugs**: Monitor for hyperkalemia (7.3)

7.1 Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

Use with potassium-sparing diuretics can produce severe hyperkalemia. Avoid concomitant use.

7.2 Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors

Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), spironolactone, eplerenone, or aliskiren produce potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone production. Closely monitor potassium in patients receiving concomitant RAAS therapy.

7.3 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

NSAIDS may produce potassium retention by reducing renal synthesis of prostaglandin E and impairing the renin-angiotensin system. Closely monitor potassium in patients on concomitant NSAIDs.

### Diclofenac epolamine (Licart) [^113xmvw9]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of diclofenac epolamine TOP (also known as Licart, Flector):
- **Anemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of anemia. Monitor hemoglobin levels and for signs of bleeding.
- **Edema**: use caution in patients taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, as diclofenac may blunt the cardiovascular effects of these agents. Avoid using in patients with severe HF unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening HF.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as diclofenac has been associated with an increased risk of elevations of serum transaminases and, rarely, severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure. Monitor liver enzymes periodically in patients on long-term treatment.
- **Hypertension**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as diclofenac has been associated with an increased risk of new-onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension. Monitor BP.
- **Increased serum potassium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as diclofenac has been associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia.
- **Mask symptoms of infection**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as diclofenac reduces inflammation and fever, potentially diminishing the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.
- **Renal toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term use of diclofenac has been associated with an increased risk of renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, AKI, and other renal injury, especially in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration or hypovolemia, taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, and in the elderly. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration, or hypovolemia.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as diclofenac has been associated with an increased risk of exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and DRESS syndrome.

5.7 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease.

Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.

Hyperkalemia

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

5.8 Anaphylactic Reactions

Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to the individual components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.
