## Question

Adrenal insufficiency symptoms and work up

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about adrenal insufficiency symptoms and diagnostic work-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the symptom patterns and red flags, including adrenal crisis. Then, I should classify etiologies into primary, secondary, and glucocorticoid-induced forms. Next, I will outline the initial laboratory approach with morning cortisol and ACTH, clarify assay-dependent thresholds and confounders, and detail dynamic testing with cosyntropin. After that, I will map the etiologic work-up by subtype, consider special populations, and close with a pragmatic, stepwise diagnostic pathway and key limitations to avoid misinterpretation.

> Let me first confirm the symptom landscape to set pre-test probability. Fatigue, anorexia with weight loss, and nausea or vomiting are common but nonspecific, which explains frequent misdiagnoses and delayed recognition, while hypotension, dizziness, and weakness often point toward hemodynamic involvement, and hyperpigmentation suggests primary disease due to high ACTH, whereas hypoglycemia can be more prominent in secondary adrenal insufficiency, so I should keep these distinctions in mind before testing [^111cmN7E]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; diagnostic delay is the rule rather than the exception, with less than 30% of women and 50% of men diagnosed within 6 months and two-thirds initially misdiagnosed, so I need a low threshold for evaluation when symptoms cluster or risks exist [^1156W7Cv]. Adrenal crisis presents with severe hypotension and shock and is frequently missed; many patients cannot self-inject rescue hydrocortisone during crisis, which reinforces the urgency of early recognition and treatment while the work-up proceeds in parallel [^114g8kSL] [^115N17RS].

> Next, I should categorize etiologies because that determines the subsequent work-up. Primary adrenal insufficiency typically shows low cortisol with ACTH more than twice the upper limit of normal, reflecting intrinsic adrenal failure that also risks mineralocorticoid deficiency, while secondary adrenal insufficiency presents with low or inappropriately normal ACTH due to pituitary or hypothalamic disease, and glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is the most prevalent form due to exogenous steroid suppression of the HPA axis, so I need to ask about all glucocorticoid routes and potencies up front [^1178vPcg] [^111cmN7E] [^111eLqtG]. Wait, let me verify whether opioid use or immune checkpoint inhibitors might mimic or cause central etiologies; both can be culprits and should be captured in history because they alter pre-test probability and imaging decisions [^111LDakn] [^11641FBL] [^116kR85X].

> I will now outline the initial testing sequence. I should obtain an 8:00–9:00 am serum cortisol together with a plasma ACTH to both screen for adrenal insufficiency and immediately point toward primary versus secondary pathophysiology, ensuring that any glucocorticoid is held for at least 24 hours, with dexamethasone as the only acceptable bridge if needed during evaluation, and aiming to test only once the patient has been tapered to physiologic dose if this is a recovery assessment after chronic steroid use [^117JUADt]. I need to ensure electrolytes and glucose are checked because hyponatremia and hyperkalemia support primary adrenal insufficiency and hypoglycemia can occur in secondary disease, which can further refine suspicion while waiting for dynamic testing if needed [^111cmN7E].

> Hold on, I should verify the assay-aware morning cortisol thresholds before interpreting results. Cortisol greater than approximately 310–354 nmol/L (about 11.2–12.8 μg/dL by older immunoassays) strongly argues against glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, while values less than about 124–152 nmol/L (4.5–5.5 μg/dL) are highly predictive of adrenal insufficiency and prompt confirmation or treatment depending on acuity, yet the gray zone between about 124–354 nmol/L necessitates dynamic testing and clinical correlation, particularly because cutoffs shift with assay platform and binding protein alterations such as pregnancy, estrogen therapy, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, and circadian disruption [^1162vUxs] [^111r3g3a]. Wait, let me double-check LC–MS/MS data; with mass spectrometry, a value above about 327 nmol/L has high sensitivity and negative predictive value, while a value below 152 nmol/L has high specificity and PPV, but these figures still require local validation and must be interpreted in context, not in isolation [^112zENbA].

> Next, I should review dynamic testing with cosyntropin. The standard 250 μg ACTH stimulation test is preferred, with cortisol measured at baseline and 30 and 60 minutes, and a peak below 500 nmol/L (18 μg/dL) indicating adrenal insufficiency, with pediatric dose adjustments for infants and children, which I need to remember to avoid dosing errors that could confound interpretation [^1152153f]. Initially I thought the 1 μg low-dose ACTH test could replace the standard test broadly in secondary adrenal insufficiency, but wait, I should correct that; although meta-analyses show similar overall accuracy, both tests are better at ruling in than ruling out secondary adrenal insufficiency because the negative likelihood ratios are suboptimal, so a normal test does not reliably exclude secondary disease and clinical context remains paramount [^1138iNPT] [^112LBu1Z]. I should confirm that cortisol responses are stimulus- and assay-dependent and that local cutoffs are necessary to avoid misclassification, especially around the 18 μg/dL threshold used by historical immunoassays versus platform-specific lower cutoffs on some modern assays [^113ADgBo].

> If primary adrenal insufficiency is confirmed or strongly suspected, I need to check 21-hydroxylase antibodies for autoimmune adrenalitis, 17-hydroxyprogesterone when congenital adrenal hyperplasia is plausible, and very long-chain fatty acids in males with negative antibodies to assess for adrenoleukodystrophy, while obtaining adrenal imaging with CT if the etiology remains unclear to evaluate for infiltration, infection, hemorrhage, or metastases, and I should also assess renin and aldosterone to define mineralocorticoid deficiency that will influence ongoing management and monitoring [^11469Efd] [^115TXjkC]. Let me not forget longitudinal care; I should consider periodic screening for associated autoimmune diseases at least annually when an autoimmune origin has not been excluded, which changes the scope of follow-up [^117HGqgn].

> If the pattern indicates secondary adrenal insufficiency, I should review other pituitary axes and arrange targeted pituitary MRI because mass lesions, hypophysitis, infiltrative disease, or apoplexy may be causal, and in patients exposed to immune checkpoint inhibitors I need a high index of suspicion for hypophysitis even with subtle cortisol reductions, integrating DHEA-S and repeat morning cortisol as supportive data when appropriate [^111cmN7E] [^116kR85X] [^114ys3hi]. Hold on, I should verify that in acute, unstable settings a random cortisol plus ACTH before steroids can be acceptable to guide immediate therapy when adrenal crisis or pituitary apoplexy is suspected, with formal dynamic testing deferred until stabilization, to avoid delays in life-saving treatment [^114ys3hi].

> For glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, I need to check cumulative exposure across all routes, recognize that long-acting agents such as dexamethasone suppress the HPA axis more profoundly and impair recovery, consider CYP3A4 inhibitor co-medications that raise steroid exposure, and remember that intra-articular, epidural, or high-dose inhaled or topical steroids can also cause clinically significant suppression requiring monitoring and a low threshold for testing after recent injections or multiple formulations, especially within two months [^111Ve9bU] [^111mNXLm] [^112pzZu6]. Let me reconsider the taper strategy; taper only when the underlying disease is controlled, transition from long- to short-acting steroids to facilitate recovery, approach a physiologic dose first, and then assess morning cortisol after holding 24 hours, recognizing that values greater than about 300 nmol/L suggest recovery whereas 150–300 nmol/L warrants repeat testing or dynamic assessment, always coupling biochemical results to symptoms because biochemical suppression is more common than clinically relevant adrenal crisis risk during recovery [^112xM1E2] [^115YqNaN] [^117JUADt] [^111hsJH7]. I should double-check that patient education is embedded early since confidence in self-management is often low and education reduces crisis risk during taper and recovery, which is a key safety step in this population [^116Enp9S] [^115yKF5Y].

> I will now examine special populations to avoid missteps. In pregnancy, I should monitor clinically each trimester for over- and under-replacement and provide stress-dose hydrocortisone in labor similar to major surgery, which affects testing and peri-delivery planning [^114B4MYZ] [^116H14a4]. In critical illness, I should consider CIRCI when shock persists despite fluids and vasopressors and use pragmatic thresholds such as a delta cortisol less than 248 nmol/L after 250 μg ACTH or a random cortisol less than 276 nmol/L to support the diagnosis, while treating hemodynamic instability with hydrocortisone 100 mg bolus followed by 200 mg per 24 hours plus fluids and glucose as recommended, recognizing the controversies and prioritizing clinical response [^117JtdCE] [^112fXtMS]. In children, congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a leading cause of primary adrenal insufficiency and weight-based ACTH dosing is required, so I should tailor interpretation and replacement with attention to growth and puberty in follow-up [^113TvWc1]. For immune checkpoint inhibitor recipients, morning cortisol gray zones are common and dynamic testing thresholds may need assay-specific calibration, so I should maintain vigilance for primary, secondary, or mixed defects during therapy [^114n2LC5] [^116kR85X].

> But wait, I need to underscore crisis recognition and immediate actions since this intersects with the work-up. If adrenal crisis is suspected, I should not delay treatment for testing; administer hydrocortisone 100 mg IV immediately, begin aggressive isotonic fluids and glucose support, and obtain blood for cortisol and ACTH if feasible beforehand, recognizing that many patients cannot self-administer rescue injections and that structured education and practical training for patients and families are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality [^112fXtMS] [^115N17RS]. I should confirm patients receive sick-day rules for minor stress and carry a medical alert identification and steroid card to prevent delays in emergency care when they present outside endocrine settings, which is a safety net extending beyond diagnosis [^112xJ9A1] [^111p9BMb] [^113RVW44].

> Finally, let me synthesize the stepwise diagnostic pathway in plain language to ensure nothing is missed. Start with history, risk factors, and exam signs such as hyperpigmentation and orthostatic hypotension, then obtain 8–9 am cortisol with simultaneous ACTH and basic chemistries; if cortisol is clearly low, move to confirmatory testing or treat if unstable, if clearly high, adrenal insufficiency is unlikely, and if intermediate, perform a standard 250 μg cosyntropin test with 30–60 minute sampling, using local assay-calibrated cutoffs and caution in suspected secondary disease where sensitivity is limited, and then, based on ACTH and test results, pursue etiology-specific labs and imaging as indicated for primary or secondary disease while reviewing steroid exposures for glucocorticoid-induced forms [^1152153f] [^1162vUxs] [^1178vPcg] [^11469Efd]. Hold on, I should verify that when chronic exogenous steroid use is present, recovery assessment uses morning cortisol after reaching a physiologic dose and holding 24 hours, with repeat monitoring guiding step-down or dynamic testing, to avoid premature labeling of persistent adrenal insufficiency during washout of long-acting agents [^117JUADt] [^111hsJH7].

> I need to acknowledge key uncertainties to avoid overconfidence in single cutoffs. Assay heterogeneity can shift diagnostic thresholds by 30–40% across immunoassays compared with LC–MS/MS, and binding protein and circadian effects can mislead interpretation, so I should use institutional cutoffs and consider clinical context before declaring or excluding disease, especially in intermediate ranges [^111r3g3a]. Moreover, neither the 250 μg nor the 1 μg ACTH test reliably rules out secondary adrenal insufficiency given suboptimal negative likelihood ratios, so I should integrate clinical probability, repeat testing if needed, and pursue pituitary evaluation when warranted despite a normal stimulation test [^1138iNPT].

Adrenal insufficiency presents with **nonspecific symptoms** such as fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, nausea, vomiting [^111cmN7E], abdominal pain, dizziness, and hypotension, with hyperpigmentation and salt craving suggesting primary disease [^1156W7Cv]. The diagnostic workup includes an **8 am serum cortisol and ACTH** [^1178vPcg], a standard 250 mcg ACTH stimulation test [^1152153f], and plasma renin/aldosterone to assess mineralocorticoid status [^115TXjkC]. Additional tests (21-hydroxylase antibodies, adrenal CT, pituitary MRI) are used to determine etiology [^11469Efd] [^111cmN7E]. In suspected adrenal crisis, give **immediate IV hydrocortisone and fluids** without waiting for test results [^112fXtMS] [^111Ncj1V].

---

## Clinical symptoms and signs

Symptoms of adrenal insufficiency are **often nonspecific** and easily mistaken for other conditions [^111cmN7E] [^111aHRUH]. Common manifestations include:

- **Fatigue and weakness**: Persistent, nonspecific fatigue and muscle weakness are common [^111cmN7E].

- **Weight loss and anorexia**: Unintentional weight loss and reduced appetite are frequent [^115nwdEw].

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea are common [^111cmN7E].

- **Dizziness and hypotension**: Orthostatic hypotension and dizziness, especially upon standing, are typical [^1151VFKR].

- **Hyperpigmentation**: Characteristic of primary adrenal insufficiency, particularly in sun-exposed areas, palmar creases, and mucous membranes [^1156W7Cv].

- **Salt craving**: Suggests mineralocorticoid deficiency, more common in primary adrenal insufficiency [^115TXjkC].

- **Hypoglycemia**: More common in children and secondary adrenal insufficiency [^113TvWc1].

- **Psychiatric symptoms**: Depression, irritability, and cognitive impairment may occur [^113FmDe1] [^111aHRUH].

---

## Diagnostic workup

The diagnostic evaluation of adrenal insufficiency combines **clinical assessment, laboratory testing, and imaging** [^1152153f] [^11469Efd].

---

### Initial laboratory tests

- **Morning serum cortisol and ACTH**: Measure cortisol and ACTH levels at 8 am [^1178vPcg]. Low cortisol with elevated ACTH indicates primary adrenal insufficiency, while low cortisol with low or normal ACTH suggests secondary adrenal insufficiency [^111cmN7E] [^111QFfsb] [^1152153f].

- **Electrolytes**: Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia are common in primary adrenal insufficiency [^1152153f].

- **Plasma renin and aldosterone**: Elevated renin with low aldosterone indicates mineralocorticoid deficiency, characteristic of primary adrenal insufficiency [^115TXjkC].

---

### Confirmatory tests

**ACTH stimulation test** is the standard 250 mcg protocol and the gold standard for diagnosis; a peak cortisol level below 500 nmol/L (18 mcg/dL) at 30 or 60 minutes indicates adrenal insufficiency [^1152153f] [^1138iNPT]. **Insulin tolerance test** evaluates secondary adrenal insufficiency by measuring the cortisol response to hypoglycemia [^114ys3hi] [^113ADgBo].

---

### Imaging studies

**Adrenal CT** is recommended to identify adrenal infiltrative processes, metastases, or structural abnormalities in primary adrenal insufficiency [^11469Efd]. **Pituitary MRI** is indicated in secondary adrenal insufficiency to evaluate pituitary or hypothalamic lesions [^1156W7Cv].

---

### Additional tests for underlying etiology

Additional tests for underlying etiology include **21-hydroxylase antibodies** to diagnose autoimmune adrenalitis, the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency [^11469Efd]. Measure plasma very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) to evaluate for adrenoleukodystrophy in males with negative 21-hydroxylase antibodies [^116rsRRT], and serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone to assess for congenital adrenal hyperplasia in infants and selected children and adults [^11469Efd].

---

## Management of adrenal crisis

Adrenal crisis is a **life-threatening emergency** that requires immediate treatment:

- **Immediate intravenous hydrocortisone**: Administer 100 mg IV or IM immediately [^112fXtMS], followed by 200 mg hydrocortisone per 24 hours (continuous infusion or 50 mg every 6 hours) [^114g8kSL].

- **Fluid resuscitation**: Rapid intravenous administration of 0.9% saline solution [^111Ncj1V].

- **Glucose supplementation**: Administer glucose if hypoglycemia is present [^1151VFKR].

- **Identify and treat underlying triggers**: Address infections, trauma, or other precipitating factors [^112fXtMS].

---

Adrenal insufficiency presents with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, gastrointestinal disturbances, dizziness, and hypotension, with hyperpigmentation and salt craving suggesting primary disease [^111cmN7E]. The diagnostic workup includes morning serum cortisol and ACTH, ACTH stimulation test [^1152153f], plasma renin and aldosterone, and imaging studies [^11469Efd]. Immediate treatment with **intravenous hydrocortisone and fluid resuscitation** is essential in adrenal crisis [^112fXtMS].

### Adrenal insufficiency [^111aHRUH]. Lancet (2003). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency is caused by either primary adrenal failure, mostly due to autoimmune adrenalitis, or by hypothalamic-pituitary impairment of the corticotropic axis, predominantly due to pituitary disease. It is a rare disease but is life-threatening when overlooked. Main presenting symptoms, such as fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss, are non-specific, which often leads to a delay in diagnosis.

The diagnostic work-up is well established, but some pitfalls remain, particularly in the identification of secondary adrenal insufficiency. Despite optimized life-saving glucocorticoid-replacement and mineralocorticoid-replacement therapy, health-related quality of life in adrenal insufficiency is more severely impaired than previously thought. Dehydroepiandrosterone-replacement therapy has been introduced and could help to restore quality of life.

Monitoring the quality of glucocorticoid-replacement is hampered by a lack of objective assessment methods and is therefore largely based on clinical grounds. Thus, long-term management of patients with adrenal insufficiency remains a challenge, requiring an experienced specialist. However, all doctors should be knowledgeable in the diagnosis and management of suspected acute adrenal failure.

### Adrenal insufficiency in adults: A review [^111cmN7E]. JAMA (2025). High credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency is a syndrome of cortisol deficiency and is categorized as primary, secondary, or glucocorticoid-induced. Although primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency are rare, affecting less than 279 per 1 million individuals, glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is common.

- **Observations**: Primary adrenal insufficiency, which involves a deficiency of all adrenocortical hormones, is caused by autoimmune destruction, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, pharmacological inhibition (e.g. high doses of azole antifungal therapy), infection (e.g. tuberculosis, fungal infections), or surgical removal of adrenal cortical tissue. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is caused by disorders affecting the pituitary gland, such as tumors, hemorrhage, inflammatory or infiltrative conditions (e.g. hypophysitis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis), surgery, radiation therapy, or medications that suppress corticotropin production, such as opioids. Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is caused by administration of supraphysiological doses of glucocorticoids. Patients with adrenal insufficiency typically present with nonspecific symptoms, including fatigue (50%-95%), nausea and vomiting (20%-62%), and anorexia and weight loss (43%-73%).

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should be suspected in patients who have recently tapered or discontinued a supraphysiological dose of glucocorticoids. Early-morning (approximately 8 am) measurements of serum cortisol, corticotropin, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) are used to diagnose adrenal insufficiency.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111eLqtG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

At least 1% of the population uses chronic glucocorticoid therapy as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. Virtually every discipline of medicine applies glucocorticoids via multiple modes of administration, including oral, inhaled, intranasal, intra-articular, topical, and intravenous methods, frequently for a prolonged duration. Suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is an inevitable effect of chronic exogenous glucocorticoid therapy, and recovery of adrenal function varies greatly among individuals. Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency necessitates careful education and management, and in rare cases of adrenal crisis, prompt diagnosis and therapy.

Considering the widespread use of glucocorticoids and the risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, the present clinical practice guideline provides guidance on this clinically relevant condition to aid endocrinology specialists, as well as general practitioners and other specialists involved in the care of these patients.

### Diagnosis and management of adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis in the emergency department [^111Ncj1V]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency can result in significant patient morbidity and mortality, but due to the range of symptoms, variable clinical course, and etiologies, it can be a challenging condition to diagnose and manage.

- **Objective**: This narrative review discusses the evaluation of an adult patient at risk for a new diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency and the management of a patient with known or suspected adrenal insufficiency.

- **Discussion**: A new presentation of adrenal insufficiency can range from nonspecific, minor symptoms, including fatigue, to a life-threatening adrenal crisis with hemodynamic instability. Due to the variety of signs and symptoms, the diagnosis is often missed. Those with known adrenal insufficiency are at risk for adrenal crisis, which may occur due to a variety of triggers. Initial evaluation includes assessment for the underlying etiology or concomitant condition, laboratory analysis, and imaging when clinically indicated. Although not necessary for evaluation in the emergency department setting, the diagnosis is confirmed by specific testing, such as the cosyntropin stimulation test. The mainstay of treatment in adrenal crisis is hydrocortisone, intravenous fluid, glucose repletion, and treatment of the underlying acute trigger.

- **Conclusions**: Emergency clinicians must be prepared to recognize, evaluate, and manage those with known or suspected adrenal insufficiency or adrenal crisis.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111pknCB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency can occur with any glucocorticoid formulation and there is no established safe level of dose exposure. Published studies provide some guidance on the overall degree of risk in patients treated with glucocorticoids; however, establishing the risk on an individual basis is challenging and relies on clinical judgment. We suggest that some groups of non-oral glucocorticoid users carry a higher risk, although evidence is limited.

- **Suspected cases**: Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should be suspected in patients with recent use of non-oral glucocorticoid formulations presenting with signs and symptoms indicative of adrenal insufficiency. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency are often non-specific and can overlap with other conditions, including those for which glucocorticoids were prescribed. It is imperative that healthcare professionals maintain a high degree of suspicion for the presence of adrenal insufficiency.

### Critical illness-induced corticosteroid insufficiency: What it is not and what it could be [^1137UBTL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

First, the term critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) should not be used to describe impaired function of the HPA axis already present prior to the onset of a critical illness, which is exacerbated by an acute triggering event. In Case 1, the patient was likely suffering from a pre-existing (undiagnosed/untreated/latent) intrinsic disease affecting the HPA axis (e.g. Addison's disease) that led to a full-blown adrenal crisis triggered by the elective nephrectomy, which may have included ipsilateral adrenalectomy. People with latent diseases affecting the HPA axis should always be monitored carefully in the peri-operative phase after elective surgery, as well as when admitted in an urgent setting (e.g. trauma or burn victims). Appropriate treatment should be given promptly when an adrenal crisis is suspected (clinical practice guidelines; primary, secondary, and tertiary adrenal insufficiency is reviewed).

- **Diagnostic approach and treatment**: Figure 1 illustrates the diagnostic approach and steroid treatment for suspected adrenal crisis, refractory septic shock, and critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency.

In Case 2, we briefly described a prototypical phenotype of an emergency ICU admission of a patient with septic shock. According to the guidelines established in 2017 for the diagnosis and management of CIRCI, despite the lack of consensus on a single test to reliably diagnose CIRCI, the patient's increment in plasma total cortisol of ≤ 9 µg/dL after ACTH stimulation could be interpreted as relative adrenal insufficiency.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1162vUxs]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

The clinical question addressed is: What is the diagnostic accuracy of a morning cortisol value versus the 250 μg ACTH (1–24) test in diagnosing glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency?

Three studies were included, and the GRADE evidence table is provided in Supplementary Table S7, with study specifics in Supplementary Table S8 (refer to the section on Supplementary Material). All studies assessed the diagnostic performance of a morning serum cortisol value versus the 250 µg ACTH (1–24) test. Of note, in the studies by Sagar et al. and Sbardella et al, ACTH (1–24) was administered intramuscularly or intravenously, and results could not be stratified for intravenous ACTH (1–24) only. Both studies measured cortisol using immunoassay techniques.

In the study by Sagar et al, 100% of patients with a morning cortisol level of 350 nmol/L (> 12.6 μg/dL) successfully passed the ACTH (1–24) test (see Supplementary Table S8 for cut-off values for the ACTH (1–24) test in the included studies). The study by Sbardella et al. showed that a morning cortisol level of ≥ 336 nmol/L (≥ 12.1 μg/dL) had a specificity of 100% for predicting a normal ACTH (1–24) test, whereas a morning cortisol level of ≤ 124 nmol/L (≤ 4.5 μg/dL) was 100% sensitive for predicting test failure. Positive and negative predictive values were not reported. However, Debono et al. found that a baseline serum cortisol level of > 310 nmol/L (> 11.2 μg/dL) as measured by immunoassay excluded glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency with a sensitivity of 98% and a negative predictive value of 97% (information was obtained after contacting the authors).

### Presentation of primary adrenal insufficiency in childhood [^113TvWc1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency is typically diagnosed in infancy or adulthood; however, cases presenting in childhood have not been systematically reviewed. Our objective was to determine the etiologies, signs, and symptoms of primary adrenal insufficiency presenting in childhood.

We conducted a retrospective chart review at a tertiary-care pediatric hospital. Patients included in the study were children diagnosed with corticoadrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid deficiency, or mineralocorticoid deficiency.

Seventy-seven cases were identified between 1999 and 2010. Of these, 35 patients had congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and were not reviewed further. Forty-two patients (20 diagnosed at our institution) had primary adrenal insufficiency with the following etiologies: autoimmune (18), autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome (an additional five), ACTH resistance (four), adrenoleukodystrophy (three), adrenal hypoplasia congenita (two), adrenal hemorrhage (two), IMAGe syndrome (one), and idiopathic (two).

Among the 20 patients diagnosed at our institution, two were monitored until adrenal insufficiency developed and were not included in the analysis of presenting signs and symptoms. Thirteen of 18 patients were hypotensive, and 12 of 18 had documented hyperpigmentation. Hyponatremia (5.0 mEq/liter) was noted in nine patients. Hypoglycemia and ketosis were documented in four of 15 and four of six patients in whom it was evaluated, respectively. Fifteen patients underwent cosyntropin stimulation testing with median baseline and s… (Text appears truncated and ends abruptly here.)

Regarding medical management for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, specifically with respect to tapering corticosteroids, the ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend considering any of the following for patients on a physiologic daily dose equivalent aiming to discontinue corticosteroid therapy:

- **Continued gradual taper**: In conjunction with clinical monitoring for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency.
- **Testing with a morning serum cortisol**: To assess adrenal function.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111Ve9bU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Use of long-acting glucocorticoids with higher glucocorticoid potency predisposes patients to a more pronounced suppression of the HPA axis and subsequent adrenocortical function impairment. This is due to the continuous and non-circadian glucocorticoid effect of these drugs, especially when administered systemically.

Long-acting glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone or betamethasone — even in physiological daily dose equivalents — are more likely to cause HPA axis suppression, exogenous Cushing syndrome, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome when being tapered. HPA axis recovery is impossible in the setting of continuous administration of long-acting glucocorticoids. In contrast, intermediate- or short-acting glucocorticoids, which have both a shorter biological half-life and lower glucocorticoid potency, are more likely to allow HPA recovery, provided that they are not administered at nighttime. Nighttime administration can more pronouncedly inhibit ACTH production and the early-morning rise of endogenous cortisol.

If treatment with long-acting glucocorticoids is no longer needed, we recommend changing to shorter-acting formulations such as prednisone, prednisolone, hydrocortisone, or cortisone acetate to promote recovery of the HPA axis. For patients on non-oral glucocorticoids (e.g. inhaled steroids) who are at risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, a switch to short-acting oral glucocorticoids would be appropriate when non-oral glucocorticoids are no longer needed.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism [^113ADgBo]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Hypopituitarism is a deficiency of one or more pituitary hormones, with adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) deficiency being the most serious and potentially life-threatening. It may occur in isolation or, more commonly, as part of more widespread pituitary failure. Diagnosis requires demonstrating a subnormal cortisol rise in response to stimulation with hypoglycemia, glucagon, ACTH(1–24), or in the setting of acute illness.

The choice of diagnostic test should be individualized for the patient and clinical scenario. A random cortisol and ACTH level may be adequate to make a diagnosis in an acutely ill patient with suspected adrenal crisis, such as pituitary apoplexy. Often, however, a dynamic assessment of cortisol reserve is needed. The cortisol response is both stimulus and assay-dependent, and normative values should be derived locally. Results must be interpreted within the clinical context and with an understanding of potential pitfalls of the test used.

Empowering patients with knowledge of the benefits and risks of glucocorticoid therapy is critical. Patients require information in a format appropriate for their age, education level, and learning style, along with access to supportive social resources such as family members, care providers, and disease-oriented support groups. We recommend the inclusion of at least one family member or primary caregiver in all education sessions.

Patient education and empowerment to adjust glucocorticoid doses according to stressors are essential to prevent severe symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis. Confidence in self-management to prevent adrenal crisis was demonstrated to be low in a large study that surveyed patients with adrenal insufficiency, including those with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Poor disease knowledge and lack of awareness of adrenal insufficiency subtype diagnosis were associated with higher rates of adrenal crisis. Standardized patient education programs for patients and their relatives proved useful for sustainably improving the level of knowledge regarding the prevention of adrenal crisis and enhancing self-confidence in managing the disease.

- **Risk factors**: The risk for developing adrenal insufficiency and the potential for adrenal crisis during glucocorticoid treatment and taper is low but increases with the cumulative number of risk factors, including glucocorticoid potency, administration route, dose, and treatment duration.

### Apadaz [^111LDakn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Adrenal insufficiency**: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs, including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried, as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.

- **Severe hypotension**: Apadaz may cause severe hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concomitant administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Regularly evaluate these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of Apadaz.

In patients with circulatory shock, Apadaz may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of Apadaz in patients with…

### Adrenal insufficiency during treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitors: How to simplify the diagnostic pathway [^114n2LC5]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Early identification of adrenal insufficiency (AI) during treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is crucial to prevent life-threatening consequences; however, the diagnosis is challenging.

- **Design, patients and measurement**: In this prospective observational study, ICI-treated cancer patients with morning serum cortisol (SC) within the gray zone (83–414 nmol/L) were enrolled. A low-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test was performed to assess peak stimulated SC, preceded by re-evaluation of morning SC. The aim of the analysis was to refine morning SC cut-offs to minimize the diagnostic gray zone, thereby reducing the need for ACTH stimulation. To interpret the results of the ACTH test, both the threshold for peak stimulated SC provided by the Endocrine Society guidelines (500 nmol/L) and an assay-specific cut-off for the Abbott platform recently proposed in literature (414 nmol/L) were employed. Moreover, the utility of salivary cortisol and cortisone upon awakening was explored.

- **Results**: In 30 ICI-treated patients, a strong positive correlation between morning and peak stimulated SC was confirmed (r = 0.72, p < 0.001). New suggested cut-offs for morning SC were identified: > 196 nmol/L and ≤ 397 nmol/L when considering a pathological peak stimulated SC ≤ 500 nmol/L; > 163 nmol/L and ≤ 251 nmol/L when considering a pathological peak stimulated SC ≤ 414 nmol/L. Additionally, salivary cortisol and cortisone upon awakening positively correlated with these parameters, indicating their potential utility in the diagnostic process.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112Bs4iG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Despite their efficacy as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents, chronic use of glucocorticoids can induce manifestations of Cushing syndrome, along with central and eventually permanent adrenal insufficiency (suppression of the entire HPA axis). For this reason, clinicians prescribing glucocorticoids for non-endocrine reasons are advised to employ the lowest effective dose and duration of therapy, and consider tapering glucocorticoid doses when treatment is no longer necessary for the underlying condition.

Given the widespread use of glucocorticoids, it is imperative that treating physicians of any discipline be well-versed in the clinical consequences of long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. It is equally critical to recognize signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and be experienced in methods to taper and/or stop glucocorticoids once their pharmacologic effects are no longer required.

The management of glucocorticoid therapy is considered a general medical skill that should be handled by the prescribing clinician, also taking into consideration the underlying disease as a determinant of tapering speed. Furthermore, the number of affected patients (at least 1% of the general population) is too large, with too few endocrinology providers available to perform consultations for each instance of glucocorticoid tapering. When prescribing clinicians decide that glucocorticoid therapy is no longer required, they should educate their patients on methods to safely discontinue use.

When interpreting the values of morning cortisol measurement, it has to be taken into account that several factors can affect the results. Cortisol production is affected by the sleep-awake cycle, with cortisol secretion reaching its peak just minutes before waking up. Thus, morning serum cortisol can appear falsely low in individuals with disrupted circadian rhythm, such as night shift workers, those experiencing jet lag, and individuals with severe insomnia. Additionally, serum cortisol concentrations can be elevated in patients with elevated cortisol-binding globulin, as observed during pregnancy and in women on oral estrogens. By contrast, serum cortisol concentrations can be decreased in patients with low albumin and cortisol-binding globulin, as seen in hypoalbuminemic states like advanced cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, and malnutrition, and during prolonged critical illness.

The interpretation of serum cortisol varies depending on the assays used. Available techniques for measuring serum cortisol, listed from least to most accurate, include immunoassays using polyclonal antibodies, immunoassays with more specific monoclonal antibodies to cortisol, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. For example, in a large study of patients undergoing a 250 µg ACTH (1–24)-test, baseline cortisol that excluded adrenal insufficiency varied between 336 nmol/L (12.2 μg/dL) and 506 nmol/L (18.3 μg/dL) when measured by three different immunoassays. Most prior studies utilized different forms of immunoassays rather than mass spectrometry-based assays. Therefore, it is important to point out that, ideally, physicians should be aware of the assay used for their patients.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^117JUADt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024).

Due to ease, convenience of testing, experience, and validation, a morning serum cortisol level (measured between 8:00 and 9:00, after holding the glucocorticoid dose for at least 24 hours) is the recommended test to examine the recovery of the HPA axis following glucocorticoid therapy. The test should be done only after reaching the range of a physiologic equivalent daily dose (e.g. prednisone 4–6 mg daily or hydrocortisone 15–25 mg total daily dose).

Several other approaches to HPA axis assessment exist, including the measurement of waking salivary cortisone, morning DHEA-S measurement, 250 µg ACTH (1–24) test, overnight metyrapone test, and insulin tolerance test. However, the literature comparing different tests for adrenal insufficiency in the context of glucocorticoid use is very limited. Importantly, test results are hardly related to clinically relevant outcomes. Assessment should be done at least 24 hours after the last dose of glucocorticoids (excluding dexamethasone).

It should be emphasized that biochemical testing for adrenal insufficiency is sensitive, but not specific. Persistence of biochemical suppression or insufficient recovery of the HPA axis is a prerequisite for clinical adrenal insufficiency. Yet, even among those patients with biochemical insufficiency, the risk for clinically meaningful adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis remains very low. This is due to the low prevalence of clinically relevant adrenal insufficiency despite the high prevalence of biochemical adrenal insufficiency.

### Approach to the patient: Diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency in adults [^1156W7Cv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) is easy to diagnose and treat when suspicion of the disease is raised. However, a previous study demonstrated that less than 30% of women and 50% of men receive a diagnosis within the first 6 months of symptom onset, and 20% were symptomatic for more than 5 years before the correct diagnosis was made. More than two-thirds consulted at least three physicians, and two out of three were primarily given incorrect diagnoses, most often psychiatric or gastrointestinal disorders. These examples illustrate that the main difficulty lies in considering PAI as a differential diagnosis, as most physicians rarely encounter more than a few patients during their careers due to the rarity of the disease.

Prevalence numbers vary across populations, with the highest figures reported from Scandinavia, notably 15 to 20 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Incidence has been reported at about 5 per million per year. Numbers from other European countries are approximately 10 per 100,000. There are very few reports from countries outside of Europe, though a national survey from Korea reported a much lower number of 0.4 per 100,000. Reports from developing countries are lacking.

### Secondary adrenal insufficiency: Recent updates and new directions for diagnosis and management [^111QFfsb]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Low credibility.

Secondary adrenal insufficiency is the most common subtype of adrenal insufficiency; it is caused by certain medications and pituitary destruction, such as pituitary masses, inflammation, or infiltration, and is rarely associated with certain germline variants. In this review, we discuss the etiology, epidemiology, and clinical presentation of secondary adrenal insufficiency, focusing on the diagnostic and management challenges. We also review the management of selected special populations of patients and discuss patient-important outcomes associated with secondary adrenal insufficiency.

### Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency [^112LBu1Z]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The cosyntropin stimulation test is the initial endocrine evaluation for suspected primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency.

- **Purpose**: To critically review the utility of the cosyntropin stimulation test for evaluating adrenal insufficiency.

- **Data sources**: The MEDLINE database was searched from 1966 to 2002 for all English-language papers related to the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.

- **Study selection**: Studies with fewer than 5 persons with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency or with fewer than 10 persons as normal controls were excluded. For secondary adrenal insufficiency, only studies that stratified participants by integrated tests of adrenal function were included.

- **Data extraction**: Summary receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated from all studies that provided sensitivity and specificity data for 250-microg and 1-microg cosyntropin tests; these curves were then compared using area under the curve (AUC) methods. All estimated values are given with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

- **Data synthesis**: At a specificity of 95%, sensitivities were 97%, 57%, and 61% for summary ROC curves in tests for primary adrenal insufficiency (250-microg cosyntropin test), secondary adrenal insufficiency (250-microg cosyntropin test), and secondary adrenal insufficiency (1-microg cosyntropin test). The area under the curve for primary adrenal insufficiency was significantly greater than the AUC for secondary adrenal insufficiency for the high-dose cosyntropin test (P < 0.001), but AUCs for the 250-microg and 1-microg cosyntropin tests did not differ.

### Approach to the patient with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^11347Xd2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is caused by exogenous glucocorticoid suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and is the most prevalent form of adrenal insufficiency. The condition is important to diagnose given the risk of life-threatening adrenal crisis and its impact on patients' quality of life. The diagnosis is made with a stimulation test such as the ACTH test.

Until now, testing for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency has often been based on clinical suspicion rather than routinely conducted; however, accumulating evidence indicates that a significant number of cases remain unrecognized. During ongoing oral glucocorticoid treatment, or initially after withdrawal, about 50% of patients have adrenal insufficiency, but outside clinical studies, less than 1% of patients have adrenal testing recorded. More than 70% of cases are identified during acute hospital admission, where the diagnosis can easily be missed because symptoms of adrenal insufficiency are nonspecific and overlap with those of the underlying conditions.

Treatment of severe glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should follow the principles for treatment of central adrenal insufficiency. The clinical implications and thus indication to treat mild-to-moderate adrenal deficiency after glucocorticoid withdrawal have not been established. Also, the indication of adding stress dosages of glucocorticoid during ongoing glucocorticoid treatment remains unclear. In patients with established glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, there are high rates of poor confidence in self-management and delays in treatment.

### Tecentriq [^116kR85X]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency

Tecentriq can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue Tecentriq depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.4% (11/2616) of patients receiving Tecentriq as a single agent, including Grade 3 (< 0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.2%) adverse reactions. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of Tecentriq in one patient and withholding of Tecentriq in one patient.

Systemic corticosteroids were required in 82% (9/11) of patients with adrenal insufficiency; of these, 3 patients remained on systemic corticosteroids. The single patient in whom Tecentriq was withheld for adrenal insufficiency did not reinitiate Tecentriq.

In the IMpower010 study, immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in 1.2% (6/495) of patients receiving Tecentriq as a single agent, including Grade 3 (0.4%) adverse reactions. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of Tecentriq in 0.6% and withholding of Tecentriq in 0.2% of patients.

Systemic corticosteroids were required in 83% (5/6) of patients with adrenal insufficiency; of these, 4 patients remained on systemic corticosteroids.

Hypophysitis

Tecentriq can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field cuts. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as clinically indicated.

### International recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with adrenoleukodystrophy: A consensus-based approach [^116rsRRT]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency is an important concern in boys and men with adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). Screening for adrenal insufficiency should be routinely conducted using early morning cortisol and adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) measurements. This screening should start within the first 6 months of life. It is recommended to perform screenings every 3–6 months before the age of 10 years, and annually thereafter. Where possible, screening should be conducted alongside MRI exams.

If symptoms indicative of adrenal insufficiency develop, patients need immediate evaluation to prevent an adrenal crisis. During a crisis, measuring random cortisol and ACTH levels is sufficient, provided that serum is drawn before glucocorticoid administration. For mild symptoms, early morning fasted cortisol and ACTH measurements are preferred for accurate assessment.

Patients screened or diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency should also be evaluated for mineralocorticoid deficiency using plasma renin and serum electrolytes. Symptoms suggestive of mineralocorticoid deficiency warrant prompt assessment to address potential health risks.

Primary adrenal insufficiency is prevalent among male ALD patients but rare in female patients. Nonetheless, adult screening should continue regardless of age, as it is cost-effective and early diagnosis can provide significant health benefits. Adrenal insufficiency is typically characterized by low or normal levels of cortisol and ACTH.

### "Relative" adrenal insufficiency in critical illness [^112Dwsum]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

To present a recommended approach to the problem of "relative" adrenal insufficiency (RAI) in the intensive care unit (ICU), we examine historical data supporting the traditional concepts of adrenal insufficiency. The idea that an increase in cortisol secretion during stress is necessary for survival is evaluated. The controversial use of treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs) in patients with sepsis and septic shock in the ICU, and thus its survival benefit, is briefly discussed.

During the past decade, the concept of RAI as the failure of cortisol secretion to increase in response to stress, in order to sustain the patient through that stress, has gained strength. In some studies, it has been suggested that as many as 75% of patients in an ICU setting have RAI. Experimental support for the concept is not possible because there is no clinically useful laboratory measure of GC action. Therefore, diagnosis is generally based on interpretation of the cosyntropin stimulation test.

The best clinical judgment should always guide interpretation of any test results, and sharp categorization of patients based on a single cutoff criterion should be avoided. Overall, the concept of RAI has no clinical utility. In these cases, administration of GCs adds cost without benefit and incurs increased risk.

Robust evidence about the impact of intra-articular glucocorticoid injections on the HPA axis is lacking. Glucocorticoids can be detected in the urine for months after injections, suggesting prolonged systemic absorption. We suggest that patients are monitored for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and that healthcare professionals have a low threshold for testing, especially within two months of injections and in patients who receive simultaneous or multiple injections over a short period.

Commonly used intra-articular glucocorticoid preparations often lead to a suppression of four weeks; therefore, low morning cortisol values are expected during that time frame, and recovery can be confirmed in the following four weeks. Evidence regarding epidural glucocorticoid injections is also very limited, but patients receiving multiple injections and higher doses appear to carry a higher risk of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.

Most glucocorticoids are metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors — which include food ingredients such as grapefruit juice, several antibiotics, antifungals, and the protease inhibitor ritonavir, among others — have been shown to significantly increase circulating concentrations of glucocorticoids and hence substantially increase the risk of suppressing the HPA axis. Several cases of exogenous Cushing syndrome linked to oral and non-oral glucocorticoid formulations in patients using strong CYP3A4 inhibitors have been published. Ritonavir is the most commonly reported offending medication, used as part of antiviral therapies.

### Adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients with human immunodeficiency virus [^114mcorA]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The adrenal gland is the endocrine organ most commonly involved in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is crucial to recognize patients with adrenal insufficiency, as this disorder may be fatal if untreated. The incidence of adrenal insufficiency in critically ill HIV-infected patients is unclear, partly due to the different criteria used to diagnose it. To help clarify this incidence, we compared it based on stress cortisol concentration, low-dose corticotropin stimulation test, and high-dose corticotropin stimulation test.

- **Setting**: Medical intensive care unit.

- **Patients**: Twenty-eight critically ill patients with HIV, mean age 43 ± 9 years; 20 were male; 54% died.

- **Interventions**: We performed a 1-microg (low-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone; LD-ACTH) and 249 microg (high-dose; HD-ACTH) corticotropin stimulation test in HIV-infected critically ill patients not receiving corticosteroids. According to the results of the stress serum cortisol concentration and both LD-ACTH and HD-ACTH tests, patients were classified as having adrenal insufficiency or as normal.

The results of newly revised diagnostic criteria for adrenal insufficiency (i.e. stress cortisol concentration and cortisol response to LD-ACTH < 25 microg/dL) were compared with the traditional criteria (i.e. stress cortisol level and response to HD-ACTH < 18 microg/dL). In addition, the associations between adrenal insufficiency and the CD4 count, human cytomegalovirus antigenemia, and other parameters were examined.

### ACTH stimulation tests for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138iNPT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is clinically challenging and often requires ACTH stimulation tests.

- **Objective**: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the high- (250 mcg) and low- (1 mcg) dose ACTH stimulation tests in the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.

- **Methods**: We searched six databases through February 2014. Pairs of independent reviewers selected studies and appraised the risk of bias. Diagnostic association measures were pooled across studies using a bivariate model.

- **Data synthesis**: For secondary adrenal insufficiency, we included 30 studies enrolling 1,209 adults and 228 children. High- and low-dose ACTH stimulation tests had similar diagnostic accuracy in adults and children using different peak serum cortisol cutoffs. In general, both tests had low sensitivity and high specificity resulting in reasonable likelihood ratios for a positive test (adults: high dose, 9.1; low dose, 5.9; children: high dose, 43.5; low dose, 7.7) but a fairly suboptimal likelihood ratio for a negative test (adults: high dose, 0.39; low dose, 0.19; children: high dose, 0.65; low dose, 0.34). For primary adrenal insufficiency, we included five studies enrolling 100 patients. Data were only available to estimate the sensitivity of the high-dose ACTH stimulation test (92%; 95% confidence interval, 81–97%).

- **Conclusion**: Both high- and low-dose ACTH stimulation tests had similar diagnostic accuracy. Both tests are adequate to rule in, but not rule out, secondary adrenal insufficiency. Our confidence in these estimates is low to moderate due to the likely risk of bias.

Patients need to be educated on the stress dosing of glucocorticoids to prevent adrenal crises and their negative sequelae, as discussed in sections R1.2, R1.3, and R3.2 (Fig. 3). Potential adrenal insufficiency and the need for stress dosing should be considered even after discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy and replacement, particularly in patients who had not undergone biochemical testing to confirm recovery of the HPA-axis. Based on a retrospective analysis, mortality is increased, particularly in the immediate period following the cessation of glucocorticoid therapy.

Patients with recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and who are under minor stress (e.g. fever, infection requiring antibiotics, physical trauma, significant emotional stress) not leading to hemodynamic instability and with no evidence of oral glucocorticoid malabsorption (vomiting, diarrhea), or who are undergoing a surgical procedure under local anesthesia, will require coverage with a stress dose of oral glucocorticoids. The recommended stress dose of hydrocortisone is the same as for patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency of other etiology: patients should receive double the physiologic replacement dose (i.e. hydrocortisone 40 mg daily, usually split into three doses: 20 mg on rising, 10 mg at midday, and 10 mg at 5 pm). In patients using other glucocorticoid formulations, a dose equivalent to 40 mg hydrocortisone is suggested.

If the withdrawal syndrome is severe, it is recommended to temporarily increase the corticosteroid dose to the most recent one that was tolerated and extend the duration of the tapering regimen.

Studies assessing the recovery of HPA axis function through the measurement of morning cortisol or low-dose 1 µg ACTH (1–24) test were not formally included in the systematic review (see "Clinical questions, eligibility criteria, and definition of endpoints"), but reported recovery incidence rates of 17% to 100% within a range of 4 days to 3 years. It is plausible that in studies reporting recovery at re-testing, already following a couple of days, initial cortisol levels may have represented adrenal suppression due to remaining circulating long-acting exogenous glucocorticoids rather than true adrenal insufficiency.

- **Clinical sub-question Ia**: Which clinical/biochemical parameters predict recovery of HPA axis function in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency?

	- Both studies included for clinical question I also assessed predictors of recovery of adrenal function. In the study by Baek et al, patients recovering adrenal function had higher cortisol increments during the first ACTH (1–24) test than patients without recovery (219 vs 99 nmol/L (10.3 vs 6.7 μg/dL), OR 1.58 per μg/dL increase in cortisol, 95%CI 1.02–2.46) when adjusting for confounders, basal cortisol concentration, and basal ACTH levels. In the study by Leong et al, patients recovering adrenal function had higher ambulatory morning cortisol values in between retesting with ACTH (1–24) test than patients not recovering (286 vs 186 nmol/L (7.9 vs 3.6 μg/dL), OR 1.02 per μg/dL increase in cortisol, 95%CI 1.01–1.04). There were no studies assessing clinical parameters predicting HPA axis recovery.

Regarding quality improvement for primary adrenal insufficiency, specifically concerning medical alert bracelets, the ES 2016 guidelines recommend equipping all patients with a steroid emergency card and medical alert identification. This serves to alert health personnel about the need for increased corticosteroid doses to avert or treat adrenal crises, and the necessity for immediate parenteral steroid treatment in the event of an emergency.

### The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of adrenal emergencies [^114g8kSL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Emergency medicine physicians should be able to identify and treat patients whose clinical presentations — including key historical, physical examination, and laboratory findings — are consistent with diagnoses of primary, secondary, and tertiary adrenal insufficiency, adrenal crisis, and pheochromocytoma. Failure to make a timely diagnosis leads to increased morbidity and mortality. As great mimickers, adrenal emergencies often present with a constellation of nonspecific signs and symptoms that can lead even the most diligent emergency physician astray. The emergency physician must include adrenal emergencies in the differential diagnosis when encountering such clinical pictures.

### The approach to the adult with newly diagnosed adrenal insufficiency [^1151VFKR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency, primarily presenting as an adrenal crisis, is a life-threatening emergency and requires prompt therapeutic management including fluid resuscitation and stress dose hydrocortisone administration. Primary adrenal insufficiency is most frequently caused by autoimmune adrenalitis, and hypothalamic-pituitary tumors represent the most frequent cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency. However, the exact underlying diagnosis needs to be confirmed by a stepwise diagnostic approach, with attention to other differential diagnostic possibilities. Chronic replacement therapy with glucocorticoids and, in primary adrenal insufficiency, mineralocorticoids requires careful monitoring. Replacement strategies still require optimization, as evidenced by recent studies demonstrating significantly impaired subjective health status and increased mortality in patients with primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency. Future studies will need to explore the potential of dehydroepiandrosterone replacement and modified delayed-release hydrocortisone to improve the prospects of patients with adrenal insufficiency.

The methods used for guideline development have been described in detail previously. In short, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used as a methodological basis. The first step was to define the clinical questions, followed by systematic literature searches. We estimated an average effect for specific outcomes where possible and rated the quality of the evidence behind the recommendations as very low (⊕○○○), low (⊕⊕○○), moderate (⊕⊕⊕○), or strong (⊕⊕⊕⊕). Not all recommendations were formally graded.

Considered for the recommendations were the quality of the evidence, the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes, and individual values and preferences, such as patient preferences, goals for health, costs, management inconvenience, and feasibility of implementation. The recommendations are worded as "recommend" (strong recommendation) or "suggest" (weak recommendation). The meaning of a strong recommendation is that all reasonably informed persons (clinicians, policymakers, and patients) would want the management in accordance with the recommendation. For a weak recommendation, most individuals would still act in accordance with the guideline, but a substantial number would not.

Formal evidence syntheses were performed and graded only for recommendations addressing our initial clinical questions. Recommendations that were based on good clinical practice and experience of the authors are also considered, although they were not formally graded.

- **Use of multiple corticosteroid formulations**.

- **Use of high-dose inhaled or topical corticosteroids**.

- **Prolonged use of inhaled or topical corticosteroids** for longer than one year.

- **Recent corticosteroid injections**, such as intra-articular corticosteroid injections in the previous two months.

- **Rationale**: Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome occurs due to dependence on supraphysiologic glucocorticoids while decreasing the dose of glucocorticoids. Patients should be informed that glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms are expected during the glucocorticoid dose reduction and understand the differences between glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, and an underlying disease flare. It should be emphasized that an insufficient glucocorticoid supply is not expected when the glucocorticoid dose is greater than the physiologic daily dose equivalent. As exceptions, it should be noted that the glucocorticoid requirement may be significantly higher in cases of critical illness or that glucocorticoid absorption is not guaranteed in gastroenteritis.

	Many of the symptoms of the withdrawal syndrome are nonspecific and overlap with symptoms of the underlying disease, especially in inflammatory musculoskeletal disorders. Managing glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome and a glucocorticoid taper in these patients may be especially challenging. Patients should be educated on symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal to avoid anxiety related to unexpected symptoms or reactive, unnecessary, or excessive increases in glucocorticoid use.

Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is reported to occur in 40–67% of patients tapering glucocorticoids following curative adrenalectomy in adrenal Cushing syndrome. The duration of exogenous glucocorticoid use, glucocorticoid dose and type, and individual susceptibility likely impact the severity and duration of glucocorticoid withdrawal.

Regarding medical management for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to tapering corticosteroids, the ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend attempting to taper corticosteroids in patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy only if the underlying disease for which corticosteroids were prescribed is controlled, and corticosteroids are no longer required. Taper corticosteroids in these cases until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent (4–6 mg prednisone).

### Predictive factors of adrenal insufficiency in patients admitted to acute medical wards: A case control study [^112emZUJ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency is a relatively rare but potentially lethal disease if missed during acute settings. Symptoms, signs, and biological markers associated with adrenal failure are well known by clinicians. However, the relative importance of these symptoms, signs, and markers has not been fully studied in patients admitted to acute medical wards. Adrenal insufficiency is defined as primary or secondary. Autoimmune and tuberculous adrenalitis are the principal etiologies for primary adrenal failure, which is characterized by low cortisol levels and elevated plasma concentrations of ACTH. Impairment of the hypothalamic-pituitary corticotropic axis is responsible for secondary causes of adrenal insufficiency. These situations are characterized by low circulating levels of cortisol and ACTH. The most frequent cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency is a tumor of the hypothalamic-pituitary region, but administration of supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids may alter a normal hypothalamic response with secondary adrenal failure once individuals are weaned from the glucocorticoid treatment. Bilateral adrenalectomy or drug-induced adrenal insufficiency may be considered as iatrogenic etiologies for adrenal failure.

### Percocet [^11641FBL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more frequently following use greater than one month. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover, and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function restores. Other opioids may be tried, as some cases reported using a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The available information does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.

Percocet may cause severe hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure is already compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions]. Regularly evaluate these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of Percocet. In patients with circulatory shock, Percocet may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of Percocet with circulatory shock.

### Diagnosis and management of adrenal insufficiency [^113FmDe1]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency continues to be a challenge for patients, their physicians, and researchers. During the past decade, long-term studies have shown increased mortality and morbidity and impaired quality of life in patients with adrenal insufficiency. These findings might, at least partially, be due to the failure of glucocorticoid replacement therapy to closely resemble physiological diurnal secretion of cortisol. The potential effect of newly developed glucocorticoid drugs is a focus of research, as are the mechanisms potentially underlying increased morbidity and mortality. Adrenal crisis remains a threat to lives, and awareness and preventative measures now receive increasing attention. Awareness should be raised in medical teams and patients about adrenal insufficiency and management of adrenal crisis to improve clinical outcomes.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary adrenal insufficiency, specifically concerning plasma ACTH measurements, the ES 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining plasma ACTH levels to establish a diagnosis of PAI. In patients with confirmed cortisol deficiency, a plasma ACTH level that is more than two times the upper limit of normal (ULN) is consistent with PAI.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112zENbA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

For serum cortisol measured by LC-MS/MS, a value > 327 nmol/L (> 11.8 μg/dL) resulted in a sensitivity of 98% and a negative predictive value of 99% for excluding glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, while a value < 152 nmol/L (< 5.5 μg/dL) resulted in a specificity of 98% and a positive predictive value of 99% for confirming glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.

The quality of evidence was moderate due to applicability concerns, and the numbers were too small to draw firm conclusions on the value of morning cortisol as a stand-alone test to diagnose glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Importantly, test results of both serum cortisol and the 250 µg ACTH(1–24) test were not related to clinical endpoints such as adrenal crisis.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111hsJH7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

In patients with higher serum cortisol levels but below 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), HPA axis recovery is possible. We suggest that the most cost-effective and practical strategy is for these patients to continue with physiologic daily dose equivalent glucocorticoid replacement and have morning serum cortisol re-checked every few weeks until recovery occurs. If cortisol levels remain between 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) and 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), dynamic testing can be considered.

In a study of patients with suspected primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, morning cortisol ≥ 354 nmol/L (12.8 μg/dL) predicted normal adrenal function with 100% sensitivity. One might also extrapolate some of the cut-off values from experiences with therapy of endogenous Cushing syndrome. In patients recovering from endogenous hypercortisolism, morning cortisol ≥ 276 nmol/L (10.0 μg/dL) was associated with no reported symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome or instances of adrenal crisis. Given these considerations, and the fact that there is substantial variability in the calibration between different cortisol assays, we consider cortisol values greater than 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) as a reasonable threshold to indicate recovery of HPA function following glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.

### Consensus statement on the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with primary adrenal insufficiency [^115nwdEw]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI), or Addison's disease, is a rare, potentially deadly, but treatable condition. Most cases of PAI are caused by autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortex, placing patients at a higher risk of developing other autoimmune diseases. The diagnosis of PAI is often delayed by many months, with most patients presenting with symptoms of acute adrenal insufficiency. Due to its rarity, even specialists in this area manage only a few patients. The procedures for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of PAI vary significantly across Europe. The common autoimmune form of PAI is characterized by the presence of 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies; alternative causes should be investigated if no autoantibodies are detected.

Acute adrenal crisis is a life-threatening condition that demands immediate treatment. Standard replacement therapy includes multiple daily doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone acetate combined with fludrocortisone. Annual follow-up by an endocrinologist is recommended to optimize replacement therapy and detect new autoimmune diseases. Patient education for self-adjustment of dosages and crisis prevention is crucial. The authors have collaborated within an EU project (Euadrenal) to study the pathogenesis, describe the natural course, and improve treatment for Addison's disease. This consensus is based on a synthesis of research, available literature, and the authors' views and experiences.

### People with adrenal insufficiency who are in adrenal crisis are frequently unable to self-administer rescue injections [^115N17RS]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Individuals with adrenal insufficiency (AI) are at risk of acute adrenal crisis and death, particularly during illness or trauma, and may require rapid treatment with parenteral glucocorticoid such as hydrocortisone to manage a crisis. Guidelines recommend timely self-injection in an evolving crisis; however, little is known about patient experiences with emergency injections. We surveyed people with AI regarding success with emergency injections.

In 2022, a survey was conducted through the National Adrenal Diseases Foundation website, targeting individuals with AI or their caregivers about their experiences managing an adrenal crisis. They reported on adrenal crisis events that required an emergency cortisol injection and their success or failure, as well as the context of the events and reasons for failure.

Nearly half (41%) of adrenal insufficient patients were unable to self-administer an emergency glucocorticoid injection, citing effects of their crisis-associated illness and confusion as major barriers. Failed injections led to adverse outcomes (such as the patient becoming sicker, requiring hospitalization, or death) in 36% of cases.

Effective, timely management of an impending adrenal crisis can prevent progression to hospitalization, multisystem failure requiring intensive care unit care, and death. Reliance solely on patient self-injection may result in worse outcomes. Treating physicians should include patient education about injections and specific practical instruction in the technique, as well as the potential need for assistance in a crisis.

### Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients: Consensus statements from an international task force by the American College of Critical Care Medicine [^1177twrz]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this consensus statement is to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients.

A multidisciplinary, multispecialty task force of experts in critical care medicine was convened from the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Additionally, international experts in endocrinology were invited to participate.

Task force members reviewed published literature and provided expert opinions from which the consensus was derived. The consensus statements were developed using a modified Delphi methodology. The strength of each recommendation was quantified using the Modified GRADE system, classifying recommendations as strong (grade 1) or weak (grade 2) and the quality of evidence as high (grade A), moderate (grade B), or low (grade C). These classifications were based on factors such as study design, consistency of results, and the directness of evidence.

The task force coined the term "critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency" to describe the dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis occurring during critical illness. This condition is caused by adrenal insufficiency along with tissue corticosteroid resistance and is characterized by an exaggerated and protracted proinflammatory response. It should be suspected in hypotensive patients who have responded poorly to fluids and vasopressor agents.
