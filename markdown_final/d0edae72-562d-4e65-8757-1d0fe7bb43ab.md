## Question

What is tne mechanism of action of tranexamic acid?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about tranexamic acid's mechanism of action. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug class and chemical nature. Then, I should verify the primary molecular target and its binding sites. Next, I will examine how binding translates into functional antifibrinolytic effects at therapeutic concentrations. After that, I need to consider important nuances and potential paradoxical effects, especially with delayed administration. Finally, I will synthesize the mechanism, contrast it with related agents, and connect it to clinical outcomes, dosing, timing, and safety signals.

> Let me first confirm the drug class and chemical nature: tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic lysine analog whose lysine-mimetic structure is foundational to its antifibrinolytic action, a point consistently described in authoritative regulatory labeling and high-quality reviews [^111mB93D] [^115bZewv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the direct clot target; at first glance one might think TXA binds fibrin, but wait, let me verify the principal target: TXA binds plasminogen at its lysine-binding sites rather than fibrin itself, thereby preventing plasminogen from docking onto fibrin and localizing fibrinolysis to the clot surface [^111mB93D] [^111KE4ES].

> I will now examine the binding site architecture to ensure mechanistic accuracy: native human plasminogen possesses multiple lysine-binding sites, including 4–5 low-affinity sites (Kd ≈ 750 μmol/L) and a single high-affinity site (Kd ≈ 1.1 μmol/L), with the high-affinity site being critical for plasminogen–fibrin interactions [^111mB93D].

> Next, I should review the nature of TXA–plasminogen binding and the relevance of therapeutic concentrations; TXA engages these lysine-binding sites reversibly and competitively, and at clinically achieved levels (approximately 10–150 μg/mL or 60–950 μmol/L) can saturate the high-affinity site, functionally acting as a lysine-mimic decoy that blocks plasminogen's recognition of fibrin [^111ZUhJs] [^111mB93D].

> Let me think about the immediate functional consequence of this binding; saturation of the high-affinity site displaces plasminogen from the fibrin surface, disrupting the spatial colocalization required for efficient tPA-mediated activation to plasmin at the clot, which is the pivotal step that TXA interrupts [^111mB93D].

> I should confirm the downstream effect on fibrinolysis; by preventing plasminogen from binding to fibrin, TXA reduces fibrin-localized plasmin generation and thereby inhibits fibrinolysis, stabilizing the hemostatic plug while allowing that some plasmin may still form in circulation but without effective access to the fibrin matrix [^115nFsYd] [^115bZewv] [^111mB93D].

> Wait, let me verify a common point of confusion: does TXA directly inhibit active plasmin? The primary mechanism is preventive — not neutralizing preformed plasmin — but hold on, I should double-check structural data; although clinical pharmacology treats TXA as relatively ineffective against active plasmin, crystallographic and biochemical work on TXA-derived moieties suggests only weak or indirect plasmin active-site effects, supporting that TXA is not a robust direct plasmin inhibitor in vivo [^112aY922] [^112csfm2].

> I need to ensure I capture the site-specificity nuance; TXA primarily exerts a local effect by blocking plasminogen's docking onto fibrin rather than broadly suppressing systemic plasminogen activation, which explains its clot-sparing antifibrinolytic profile without global shutdown of fibrinolysis [^111mB93D] [^112vnCc6].

> But wait, what if concentrations are high or administration is delayed in a hyperfibrinolytic milieu; I should review the lower-certainty mechanistic signals that uPA-driven plasmin generation and α2-antiplasmin depletion can create paradoxical plasmin activity in plasma with TXA present, potentially explaining the diminished or harmful effects with late administration observed in trauma and PPH trials, although these are hypothesis-generating in vitro findings that warrant caution in interpretation [^114ftKFN] [^113teGAz] [^1129EUXf] [^116gASu6] [^115bZewv].

> Let me synthesize the complete mechanism succinctly: TXA is a competitive, reversible blocker of plasminogen's high-affinity lysine-binding site, preventing plasminogen–fibrin binding, thereby reducing fibrin-surface plasmin formation and stabilizing clots; this is mechanistically distinct from aprotinin, which directly inhibits plasmin as a serine protease inhibitor [^111mB93D] [^112csfm2].

> Next, I should review the clinical translation carefully; across surgery, TXA reliably reduces transfusion exposure by roughly one-third without a clear signal for arterial thrombosis, and in acute trauma and PPH, early administration within 3 hours reduces death from bleeding, whereas delayed use loses benefit or may be harmful, underscoring the time-sensitive, mechanism-consistent effect [^113mmGgC] [^113mB7Zh] [^116gASu6] [^115nFsYd].

> Hold on, I should verify context-specific safety differences; in gastrointestinal bleeding, the large HALT-IT trial showed no mortality benefit and increased venous thromboembolism with a high-dose 24-hour infusion, and contemporary reviews emphasize that thrombotic risk may be context-dependent, even as overall major-bleeding populations do not show consistent thrombotic excess with appropriately dosed TXA [^1127EbmD] [^112vnCc6].

> I should confirm timing and dosing guidance that align with the mechanism; major trauma guidelines recommend 1 g IV over 10 minutes followed by 1 g over 8 hours, administered as early as possible and within 3 hours of injury, a pattern also reflected in national and regional practice statements emphasizing early use in those bleeding or at risk [^114Pc711] [^115kTKre] [^112wEUD7].

> Let me consider safety monitoring and dose-related adverse effects; seizures appear dose-related and are most reported with higher exposures, while labeling highlights rare but serious thromboembolic and ocular events and the need for caution in renal impairment, all of which argue for using the lowest effective dose in time-critical indications and avoiding prolonged high-dose infusions without clear benefit [^114SbALE] [^111sGU2U] [^1171Cm2Y] [^117ExdE9].

> In summary, after double-checking the mechanistic and clinical signals, TXA's core action is competitive, reversible blockade of plasminogen's high-affinity lysine site to prevent fibrin-surface plasmin generation, thereby inhibiting fibrinolysis and stabilizing clots; early, appropriately dosed use translates into reduced transfusions and time-dependent mortality benefits in trauma and PPH, while context-specific cautions apply in settings like GI bleeding and with high-dose regimens, consistent with its mechanistic profile and safety data [^111mB93D] [^113mmGgC] [^113mB7Zh] [^115nFsYd] [^1127EbmD] [^112vnCc6].

Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine analogue that exerts its antifibrinolytic effect by **competitively binding to lysine sites on plasminogen** [^111mB93D], thereby **preventing plasminogen from binding to fibrin** [^112csfm2] and inhibiting its activation to plasmin [^111KE4ES]. This preserves the fibrin matrix and stabilizes clots, reducing bleeding [^113mmGgC] without directly affecting coagulation factors or platelets [^111mB93D]. The antifibrinolytic effect is **dose-dependent and reversible**, with therapeutic concentrations maintained in tissues for about 17 hours and in serum for 7–8 hours [^111mB93D]. TXA does not directly inhibit active plasmin [^112csfm2], so delayed administration (> 3 hours) can be less effective or harmful due to ongoing fibrinolysis and α2-antiplasmin depletion [^114ftKFN].

---

## Molecular mechanism of action

Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine derivative that **competitively binds lysine-binding sites on plasminogen** [^111mB93D], preventing plasminogen from binding to fibrin and its activation to plasmin, the enzyme responsible for fibrin degradation [^112csfm2]. By blocking plasminogen-fibrin interactions, TXA stabilizes the fibrin matrix [^115bZewv] and prevents clot dissolution [^111mB93D].

---

## Pharmacodynamics

TXA's antifibrinolytic effect is **dose-dependent and reversible** [^111mB93D]. At 1 and 10 mg/mL, TXA prolongs thrombin time, indicating inhibition of fibrinolysis [^111mB93D]. Therapeutic concentrations persist in tissues for approximately 17 hours and in serum for 7–8 hours [^111mB93D]. It does not significantly affect platelet count, coagulation time, or coagulation factors at concentrations up to 10 mg/mL [^111mB93D].

---

## Clinical implications

TXA is widely used to reduce bleeding in trauma, surgery, and obstetric hemorrhage, and its efficacy depends on **early administration** [^114Pc711] — typically within 3 hours of bleeding onset [^113mB7Zh] — to maximize antifibrinolytic effects and minimize complications [^114ftKFN]. Conversely, delayed administration (> 3 hours) [^115nFsYd] may be less effective or harmful due to ongoing fibrinolysis and depletion of α2-antiplasmin, a natural plasmin inhibitor [^114ftKFN].

---

## Safety considerations

TXA is generally safe, but high doses or prolonged use can increase the **risk of seizures** [^114SbALE], especially in patients with renal impairment or neurological disorders [^111sGU2U]. It may also cause visual disturbances, hypersensitivity reactions, and, rarely, thromboembolic events [^111sGU2U] [^112vnCc6].

Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine analogue that **competitively inhibits plasminogen activation** [^111mB93D], stabilizing fibrin clots and reducing bleeding [^113mmGgC]. Its antifibrinolytic effect is dose-dependent and reversible, with therapeutic concentrations maintained in tissues and serum for several hours [^111mB93D].

### Increased urokinase and consumption of α-antiplasmin as an explanation for the loss of benefit of tranexamic acid after treatment delay [^114ftKFN]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Low credibility.

We hypothesize that uPA and α 2‐antiplasmin are key factors in the mechanism accounting for the loss of efficacy of TXA in controlling bleeding after treatment delay. Hemorrhage associated with trauma, childbirth, and surgical interventions will lead to activation of clotting and fibrinolysis and generation of tPA and uPA, subsequently plasmin. Importantly, ongoing fibrinolysis causes the depletion of α 2‐antiplasmin. The application of TXA is very effective at protecting fibrin, but TXA can stimulate plasminogen activation by uPA and protect plasmin in circulation from α 2‐antiplasmin. Free plasmin can induce coagulopathy by proteolyzing coagulation factors, including fibrinogen, FV, FVIII, and FXIII, and can damage the blood-brain barrier. At the stage where there is overt hyperfibrinolysis, direct inhibition of plasmin by exogenous inhibitors may be necessary. However, more information is needed on the time-course and magnitude of uPA production in trauma patients, particularly the minority that develop life-threatening hyperfibrinolysis.

### Cyklokapron [^111mB93D]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure.

	- The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 μmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 μmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL, prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours and in the serum for up to 7 or 8 hours.

	- Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time, or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects.

### The current place of aprotinin in the management of bleeding [^112csfm2]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

There is a considerable difference between the mechanism of action of the lysine analogues, tranexamic acid and epsilon-aminocaproic acid, and the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin. Aprotinin acts to inactivate free plasmin, but with little effect on bound plasmin, whereas the lysine analogues are designed to prevent excessive plasmin formation by fitting into plasminogen's lysine-binding site to prevent the binding of plasminogen to fibrin.

Aprotinin is associated with a reduction in bleeding and transfusion requirements following major surgery and has a dose-response profile, compared with no dose-response effect in the one study investigating tranexamic acid in cardiac surgical patients. Following its withdrawal in 2007, which is explained in detail in this review, the regulators have now licensed aprotinin for myocardial revascularisation only, which is relatively low-risk for bleeding.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on surgical bleeding: Systematic review and cumulative meta-analysis [^113mmGgC]. BMJ (2012). High credibility.

To assess the effect of tranexamic acid on blood transfusion, thromboembolic events, and mortality in surgical patients, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted.

Data was sourced from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, and Embase, from inception to September 2011, as well as the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and reference lists of relevant articles. Randomised controlled trials comparing tranexamic acid with no tranexamic acid or placebo in surgical patients were selected. Outcome measures of interest included the number of patients receiving a blood transfusion; the number of patients with a thromboembolic event, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism; and the number of deaths. Trials were included irrespective of language or publication status.

A total of 129 trials, involving 10,488 patients and conducted between 1972 and 2011, were included in the review. Tranexamic acid was found to reduce the probability of receiving a blood transfusion by a third (risk ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 0.65; P < 0.001). This effect remained significant when the analysis was restricted to trials using adequate allocation concealment (risk ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.62 to 0.74; P < 0.001). However, the effect of tranexamic acid on myocardial infarction (risk ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 1.09; P = 0.11), stroke (risk ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 2.00; P = 0.65), deep vein thrombosis (risk ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.53 to 1.39; P = 0.54), and pulmonary embolism (risk ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.25 to 1.47; P = 0.27) was uncertain. Fewer deaths were reported in the tranexamic acid group (risk ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.38 to 0.98; P = 0.04), although when the analysis was truncated here.

### Tranexamic acid for preventing postpartum haemorrhage after caesarean section [^115nFsYd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an antifibrinolytic drug that inhibits fibrinolysis by blocking the interaction between plasmin and fibrin. Since it was first identified in the early 1960s, TXA has primarily been used for heavy menstrual bleeding and for reducing bleeding during surgical procedures in high‐risk patients. More recently, early treatment with TXA has been shown to be effective in patients with life‐threatening haemorrhage caused by trauma and childbirth.

In the CRASH 2 Trial, TXA given within one hour reduced mortality by 32%; given between one and three hours, by 21%; and beyond three hours, TXA increased mortality by 44% (P = 0.004). The mechanism for this increase in mortality is unclear. TXA has multiple pharmacological effects. A pharmacovigilance study found a 32.6-fold increase in adverse renal vascular and ischaemic conditions in women of childbearing age.

The World Maternal Antifibrinolytic (WOMAN) trial assessed the effects of intravenous TXA in 20,060 participants with a clinical diagnosis of PPH. The results showed that TXA reduces the risk of bleeding to death after PPH by one-third (risk ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.52 to 0.91; P = 0.008) when given within three hours of birth, with no apparent increase in adverse events. As a result, the WHO recommends early intravenous TXA as a treatment for established PPH. However, neither the overall risk of death nor the risk of hysterectomy (the predefined primary outcome) was reduced.

Many deaths from PPH occur on the day of birth, most w

### The never ending success story of tranexamic acid in acquired bleeding [^115bZewv]. Haematologica (2020). High credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an anti-fibrinolytic agent that acts by inhibiting plasminogen activation and fibrinolysis. Although its first clinical use dates back more than 50 years, this hemostatic agent is still the object of intense clinical and developmental research. In particular, renewed interest in TXA has arisen following evidence that it has a beneficial effect in reducing blood loss in a variety of medical and surgical conditions at increased risk of bleeding. Given this characteristic, TXA is currently considered a mainstay of patient blood management programs aimed at reducing patients' exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion. Importantly, recent large randomized controlled trials have consistently documented that the use of TXA confers a survival advantage in a number of globally critical clinical conditions associated with acute bleeding, including traumatic injury and post-partum hemorrhage, without increasing the thromboembolic risk.

### Figo recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022 [^116MQfLD]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of postpartum hemorrhage, in particular concerning the use of tranexamic acid, FIGO 2022 guidelines recommend administering 1 g (100 mg/mL) of tranexamic acid intravenously at 1 mL/min over 10 minutes. If bleeding continues after 30 minutes or restarts within 24 hours of completing the first dose, a second dose of 1 g IV should be administered.

### Serum concentrations and pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid after two means of topical administration in massive weight loss skin-reducing surgery [^113CA1Yc]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Topical application of tranexamic acid can provide adequate concentrations in the wound with a low systemic concentration, thus lessening the risk of systemic adverse events. Topical application is receiving increasing attention, as it is inexpensive and simple, and may reduce bleeding from all surgical surfaces. Large studies from joint replacement surgery have confirmed that topical use of tranexamic acid reduces blood loss at least as well as intravenous administration.

- **Studies from cardiac and thoracic surgery**: These are fewer, smaller, and not unambiguous.
- **Studies on topical use from other surgical areas**: So far, these have been scarce.

Topical use of tranexamic acid in surgery consists mostly of administration as a bolus into a confined space or by adding it to the irrigation fluid. Moistening a wound surface can be performed with a small volume with a high drug concentration, whereas irrigation or local bolus administration needs larger volumes with lower drug concentrations. The lowest tranexamic acid concentration that can be administered in a solution and still have a topical hemostatic effect is unknown, but concentrations below 5 mg/ml have been shown to be effective. In oral and dental surgery, a high-concentration mouthwash (48 mg/ml) has been reported but is not commercially available. Only a few studies have measured systemic tranexamic acid concentrations after topical use in surgery, and then mostly at a single time point, rendering peak levels uncertain and precluding a complete pharmacokinetic analysis.

Finally, we would like to outline the safety aspects that emerge from an overall analysis of the various RCT. The risk of thromboembolic events – including pulmonary embolism, deep-vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and stroke – did not differ between the TXA and placebo groups. These data provide strong evidence demonstrating the safety of TXA and render any residual concern unjustified.

### Tranexamic acid use in the surgical arena: A narrative review [^117JgdaJ]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a potent antifibrinolytic drug that inhibits the activation of plasmin by plasminogen. While not a new medication, TXA has quickly gained traction across a variety of surgical subspecialties to prevent and treat bleeding. Knowledge on the use of this drug is essential for the modern surgeon to continue to provide excellent care to their patients.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive review of the PubMed database was conducted for articles published within the last 10 years (2014–2024) relating to TXA and its use in various surgical subspecialties. Seminal studies regarding the use of TXA older than 10 years were included from the author's archives.

- **Results**: Indications for TXA are not limited to trauma alone, and TXA is utilized across a variety of surgical subspecialties from neurosurgery to hepatic surgery to control hemorrhage. Overall, TXA is well tolerated with common dose-dependent adverse effects, including headache, nasal symptoms, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue. More severe adverse events are rare and easily mitigated by not exceeding a dose of 50 mg/kg.

- **Conclusions**: The administration of TXA as an adjunct to treat trauma saves lives. The ability of TXA to induce seizures is dose dependent with identifiable risk factors, making this serious adverse effect predictable. As for the potential for TXA to cause thrombotic events, uncertainty remains. If this association is proven to be real, the risk will likely be small, since the use of TXA is still advantageous in most situations because of its efficacy for a more common concern, bleeding.

### Effect of tranexamic acid by baseline risk of death in acute bleeding patients: a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data from 28 333 patients [^112QkdTC]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2020). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid appears to be safe and effective regardless of the baseline risk for patients treated within 3 hours since injury. Because many deaths occur in patients at low and intermediate risk, tranexamic acid use should not be restricted to the most severely injured or bleeding patients. As tranexamic acid is safe, it should be considered an early preventive measure rather than a treatment for severe coagulopathic bleeding.

### Prophylactic tranexamic acid in patients with hematologic malignancy: a placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial [^111KE4ES]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

Hematologic malignancies accounted for approximately 10% of new cancers in the United States in 2020. Ten-year survival rates have improved with aggressive therapy but require substantial transfusion support during prolonged marrow hypoplasia. As early as 1966, prophylactic platelet transfusion was proven to decrease bleeding incidence in acute leukemia. More than 2 million platelet doses and 11 million red cell units were transfused in 2013, with hematology and/or oncology services accounting for 43% of platelets and almost 20% of red cells transfused.

Despite prophylactic platelet transfusion therapy, the TOPPS (Trial of Prophylactic Platelets) study reported that 43% of patients experienced WHO grade 2 bleeding (supplemental File 2, Appendix A, available on the Blood Web site). In the PLADO (Platelet Dose Study), WHO grade 2 bleeding occurred in 70% of the 1272 enrolled patients and 79% of patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. WHO grades 3 and 4 bleeding events occurred in 10% of enrolled patients.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) and ε-aminocaproic acid inhibit fibrinolysis by blocking lysine binding sites on plasminogen. Both decrease bleeding and mortality in orthopedic, cardiothoracic, and organ transplantation surgery, in trauma, and in obstetrical bleeding. Antifibrinolytics are commonly used to prevent and treat bleeding in patients with platelet function disorders and inherited coagulopathies. Platelets are the largest cellular source of plasminogen activator inhibitors. Clots formed in the presence of thrombocytopenia are friable.

### Increased urokinase and consumption of α-antiplasmin as an explanation for the loss of benefit of tranexamic acid after treatment delay [^113teGAz]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Low credibility.

Plasmin generation by uPA and TXA shows that TXA can protect fibrin from breakdown in various formats when either tPA or uPA is the activator or with directly applied plasmin. By adjusting the methods used in Figures 1 and 3 so that plasmin chromogenic substrate was added to preformed clots along with uPA or tPA, it was possible to detect the generation of plasmin released from the clot.

- **Figure content**: Figure 4 (A) presents results from the halo/plasma clot system (no added Alexa Fluor fibrinogen) and Figure 4 (B) shows results from the other microtiter plate plasma clot lysis system (as shown in Fig. 1), now including S‐2251. In both formats, active plasmin was released by uPA, but not tPA, in the presence of TXA. Stimulation begins above 10 μmol L−1 of TXA and peaks at around 100 μmol L−1, followed by a decline as shown in Figure 4 (B); however, this decline is not observed in the halo format, Figure 4 (A). Figure 4 (B) also demonstrates that the plasmin inhibitor, aprotinin, can block plasmin activity generated by uPA and TXA, with calculations on the dose response of aprotinin giving an estimated IC₅₀ of 530 (± 119) nmol L−1 (see Fig. 4 B inset).

### The effect of tranexamic acid on blood transfusion in lower gastrointestinal bleeding-a double blind prospective randomised controlled trial [^113XSicj]. World Journal of Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is a common emergency. Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces clot breakdown by inhibiting the action of plasmin and has been shown to reduce the need for blood transfusion in trauma, surgical procedures, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This study examined the efficiency of intravenous TXA in patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding.

- **Methods**: Eighty-one patients aged > 18 years with lower GI hemorrhage, presenting as active rectal bleeding and anemia (hemoglobin lower than 11 g/dL or a decrease of 2 g/dL from the patient's base level), were enrolled in this single-center, double-blind prospective research. Patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous TXA or placebo from admission until colonoscopy took place. The need for transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and the number of units was recorded and compared between the two groups.

- **Results**: Eighty-one patients were randomized in this study, thirty-nine in the TXA arm and forty-two in the placebo arm. Patient characteristics did not differ between the groups. Forty-three out of the 81 patients received blood transfusion; twenty-two were in the placebo arm and twenty-one in the TXA arm (p = 0.89). Twenty-nine patients required 2 or more units, 14 in the TXA arm and 15 in the placebo arm (p = 0.98).

- **Conclusions**: Intravenous TXA has no significant effect on blood requirement in patients with lower GI bleeding. There was no difference in the consumption of PRBC units among the patients in the placebo and TXA groups. It seems that tranexamic acid has no significant effect on the outcome.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on children with traumatic bleeding: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116ryfAj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid (TXA) in the treatment of traumatic bleeding in children.

- **Methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science for relevant cohort and randomized controlled trials. Studies were excluded if they involved other anti-bleeding treatments or patients with underlying bleeding disorders. The outcomes included mortality, ICU admission, surgical intervention, transfusions, hospital stay, seizures, and thromboembolic events. Statistical analysis employed odds ratios (OR) in random-effects models.

- **Results**: Ten studies (1 randomized controlled trial, 9 retrospective cohorts; n = 34,144) were included. The pooled results revealed that TXA significantly reduced mortality (OR 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38–0.89), especially with a 1 g initial dose. However, no significant differences were found in other outcomes. TXA use was associated with a slight increase in seizures but no rise in thromboembolic events. The overall safety profile was favorable.

- **Conclusion**: Our study highlights the potential benefits of TXA in reducing mortality in pediatric trauma cases and underscores the need for further research to determine optimal dosing and timing strategies.

### Tranexamic acid for gastrointestinal bleeding: A systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^111f1dAK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is a common life-threatening emergent condition. Immediate tranexamic acid is useful for reducing hemorrhage following operations and bleeding trauma, but evidence on its effects in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding is limited or highly heterogeneous. It is still unclear about using tranexamic acid in the emergent condition of gastrointestinal bleeding. This study, therefore, aimed to determine whether or not tranexamic acid should be used in gastrointestinal bleeding management through systematic review and meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: We searched three biomedical databases for relevant randomized controlled trials on this topic. Two authors independently selected studies and extracted data for bias assessment and meta-analysis of bleeding, further intervention, mortality, transfusion, and intensive care unit admission. Available data were pooled using a random-effects model, and the results were presented as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity and small study effects were also assessed.

- **Results**: Thirteen randomized controlled trials (n = 2271) were included in the present synthesis. Our meta-analysis revealed that tranexamic acid significantly reduced the rates of continued bleeding (RR = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43–0.84), urgent endoscopic intervention (RR = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.24–0.50), and mortality (RR = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45–0.80) compared with the placebo.

- **Conclusion**: According to the available evidence, the present synthesis confirms that tranexamic acid is an effective medication for gastrointestinal bleeding.

- **Local infiltration or topical application**: Although local infiltration may provide higher and longer-lasting levels of tranexamic acid in the tissue, infiltrated tranexamic acid may not reach the raw wound surface to the same extent as free-flowing, topically applied tranexamic acid. Although topical (i.e. intraarticular) application of tranexamic acid has been proven noninferior to intravenous administration in orthopedic surgery, studies assessing infiltration are few and find less effect.

In liposuction, systemic or infiltrative administration are the only options. In larger open surgery, complete contact between the raw wound surface and tranexamic acid is more easily achieved through moistening than infiltration. In surgeries with smaller wound areas, such as dermal surgeries, rhinoplasties, face lifts, and blepharoplasties, sufficiently large volumes of cocktail solutions may be injected to ensure contact between tranexamic acid and the raw wound, providing a longer-lasting depot effect. Dosing and practicality may guide the mode of administration.

### Tranexamic acid for upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^113sLVMH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid reduces hemorrhage through its antifibrinolytic effects. In a previous version of the present review, we found that tranexamic acid may reduce mortality. This review includes updated searches and new trials.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of tranexamic acid versus no intervention, placebo, or other antiulcer drugs for upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

- **Search methods**: We updated the review by performing electronic database searches in July 2014, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index, as well as manual searches.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials were included, irrespective of language or publication status.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used the standard methodological procedures of The Cochrane Collaboration. All-cause mortality, bleeding, and adverse events were the primary outcome measures. We performed fixed-effect and random-effects model meta-analyses and presented results as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and used I² as a measure of between-trial heterogeneity. We analyzed tranexamic acid versus placebo or no intervention and tranexamic acid versus antiulcer drugs separately. To analyze sources of heterogeneity and robustness of the overall results, we performed subgroup, sensitivity, and sequential analyses.

- **Main results**: We included eight randomized controlled trials on tranexamic acid for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Additionally, we identified one large ongoing pragmatic randomized controlled trial from which data are not yet available.

### Sex discrimination after injury: Is inequity in tranexamic acid administration just the tip of the iceberg [^113jrdp2]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). High credibility.

There is emerging evidence of inequalities in healthcare provision between women and men. Trauma care is no exception, with a number of studies indicating lower levels of prioritization for injured female patients. The antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid reduced trauma deaths to a similar extent in females and males in the international Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage (CRASH) randomised controlled trials, but in real-world practice, national registry data shows females are less likely to receive tranexamic acid than males. Inequity in the provision of tranexamic acid may extend beyond sex (and gender), and further study is required to examine the effect of age and mechanism of injury differences between men and women in the decision to treat.

### Increased urokinase and consumption of α-antiplasmin as an explanation for the loss of benefit of tranexamic acid after treatment delay [^111ZUhJs]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Low credibility.

In a controlled surgical setting where tranexamic acid (TXA) can be administered before bleeding starts, a wide range of dose regimens is found across different types of surgery, including cardiac, gynecological, liver, orthopedic, and neurosurgery. Effective circulating concentrations of 10–150 μg/mL or 60–950 μmol/L are cited as providing clinically significant levels of antifibrinolytic activity that reduce blood loss. However, higher levels of TXA have been reported to cause seizures, which are a significant risk factor after surgery. Despite this, dosing guidelines for TXA have been developed empirically, with little hard supporting evidence, leaving ideal dose regimens unidentified.

Better information is needed on the effective concentrations of TXA in vivo and how TXA activity in vitro relates to the in vivo situation. With this information, it may be possible to optimize TXA administration protocols to achieve maximum antifibrinolytic activity with the lowest risk of side effects. Possible mechanisms behind the three-hour window of effectiveness of TXA observed in the CRASH-2 and WOMAN trials have been considered, but clear evidence is lacking. The generation of plasmin activity by urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and TXA is the focus of this work, which builds on earlier physicochemical and biochemical studies, as well as animal models. The study observes that the potential for proteolytic damage caused by uncontrolled plasmin activity, generated by uPA and TXA, increases as α2-antiplasmin is consumed during ongoing fibrinolysis. Targeting unwanted plasmin activity may offer solutions to this challenge.

### The utility and safety of prophylactic tranexamic acid in tonsillectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113UKRDF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Our systematic review (SR) has several strengths. We opted for a strong design, including only randomized controlled trials (RCTs), to generate high-quality evidence. Our primary outcome was chosen based on practical considerations and intentions with the endpoint being a reduction in tonsillectomy-related morbidity. We performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses to address heterogeneity across included studies and to explore the impact of tranexamic acid (TXA) among special groups of interest, such as adults vs. pediatric patients. We also evaluated the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations using the GRADE system. Additionally, a qualitative data analysis was conducted to assess the definitions of post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage (PTH) used in each of the included RCTs.

Falbe-Hansen et al. defined PTH as bleeding requiring treatment in the operating room (OR). Consequently, this study was subsequently excluded in the sensitivity analysis we performed. We believe that a broad and inclusive definition of PTH is more appropriate. Any type of PTH needs to be reported, whether it is simply blood-tinged saliva or bleeding that requires intervention in the OR. PTH can be distressing for patients regardless of its severity. Patients have no direct way of visualizing or controlling their bleeding. Bleeding may be recurring, and minor bleeding can be the first sign (sentinel bleed) of more significant, life-threatening bleeding. Some patients, particularly children, may swallow or aspirate blood rather than spit it out. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate all cases of PTH.

Our study has some limitations. First, there is difficulty in extracting data and combining results from trials that utilize different surgical practices and definitions.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on surgical bleeding: Systematic review and cumulative meta-analysis [^114sJMZE]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of tranexamic acid on blood transfusion, thromboembolic events, and mortality in surgical patients.

- **Design**: Systematic review and meta-analysis.

- **Data sources**: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, and Embase, from inception to September 2011; World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and reference lists of relevant articles.

- **Study selection**: Randomised controlled trials comparing tranexamic acid with no tranexamic acid or placebo in surgical patients were selected. Outcome measures of interest included the number of patients receiving a blood transfusion, the number of patients experiencing thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism), and the number of deaths. Trials were included irrespective of language or publication status.

- **Results**: A total of 129 trials involving 10,488 patients conducted between 1972 and 2011 were included. Tranexamic acid reduced the probability of receiving a blood transfusion by a third (risk ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 0.65; P < 0.001). This effect persisted when the analysis was restricted to trials using adequate allocation concealment (0.68, 0.62 to 0.74; P < 0.001). The effect of tranexamic acid on myocardial infarction (0.68, 0.43 to 1.09; P = 0.11), stroke (1.14, 0.65 to 2.00; P = 0.65), deep vein thrombosis (0.86, 0.53 to 1.39; P = 0.54), and pulmonary embolism (0.61, 0.25 to 1.47; P = 0.27) was uncertain. Fewer deaths occurred in the tranexamic acid group (0.61, 0.38 to 0.98; P = 0.04).

### Safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid to minimise perioperative bleeding in hepatic surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1149WVdR]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Perioperative bleeding poses a major risk during liver surgery, which can result in increased transfusion requirements, morbidity, and mortality. Tranexamic acid (TXA) effectively reduces perioperative bleeding and transfusion requirements in trauma patients. However, there remains a lack of evidence of its use in liver surgery. This meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of TXA in liver resection and transplantation.

- **Method**: A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases was undertaken to identify studies from January 1947 to September 2021. The outcomes of the need for blood transfusion, thromboembolic events, and mortality were extracted from the included studies. Quantitative pooling of data was based on the random effects model.

- **Results**: Six studies reporting on 429 patients were included. TXA reduced the need for perioperative blood transfusion in liver resection and transplantation (OR 0.09; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.72). More importantly, TXA did not increase the incidence of thromboembolic events (OR 2.22; 95% CI 0.47 to 10.43) or mortality (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.13 to 2.76).

- **Conclusion**: TXA safely reduces the need for blood transfusion in patients undergoing liver resection and transplantation.

### X-ray crystal structure of plasmin with tranexamic acid-derived active site inhibitors [^112aY922]. Blood Advances (2017). Low credibility.

The zymogen protease plasminogen and its active form, plasmin, perform key roles in blood clot dissolution, tissue remodeling, cell migration, and bacterial pathogenesis. Dysregulation of the plasminogen/plasmin system results in life-threatening hemorrhagic disorders or thrombotic vascular occlusion. Accordingly, inhibitors of this system are clinically important. Currently, tranexamic acid (TXA), a molecule that prevents plasminogen activation by blocking its recruitment to target substrates, is the most widely used inhibitor for the plasminogen/plasmin system in therapeutics. However, TXA lacks efficacy on the active form of plasmin. Thus, there is a need to develop specific inhibitors that target the protease active site.

Here, we report the crystal structures of plasmin in complex with the novel YO (trans-4-aminomethylcyclohexanecarbonyl-l-tyrosine-n-octylamide) class of small molecule inhibitors. We found that these inhibitors form key interactions with the S1 and S3' subsites of the catalytic cleft. The TXA moiety of the YO compounds inserts into the primary (S1) specificity pocket, suggesting that TXA itself may function as a weak plasmin inhibitor, a hypothesis supported by subsequent biochemical and biophysical analyses. Mutational studies reveal that F587 of the S' subsite plays a key role in mediating the inhibitor interaction. Taken together, these data provide a foundation for the future development of small molecule inhibitors to specifically regulate plasmin function in a range of diseases and disorders.

### Tranexamic acid for preventing postpartum haemorrhage [^114wFbC9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of labour. Several options for preventing PPH are available, but further advances in this field are important, especially the identification of safe, easy to use, and cost-effective regimens. Tranexamic acid (TA), which is an antifibrinolytic agent that is used widely to prevent and treat haemorrhage, merits evaluation to assess whether it meets these criteria.

- **Objectives**: To determine, from the best available evidence, whether TA is effective and safe for preventing PPH in comparison to placebo or no treatment (with or without uterotonic co-treatment), or to uterotonic agents.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 January 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: All published, unpublished, and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the use of TA alone or in addition to uterotonics in the third stage of labour or during caesarean section (CS) to prevent PPH.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion all the potential studies identified as a result of the search strategy. We entered the data into Review Manager software and checked for accuracy.

- **Main results**: Twelve trials involving 3285 healthy women at low risk of excessive bleeding undergoing elective CS (nine trials, 2453 participants) or spontaneous birth (three trials, 832 participants) satisfied inclusion criteria and contributed data to the analysis. All participants received…

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: Sixth edition [^114Pc711]. Critical Care (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for transfusion strategies in critical care, specifically concerning tranexamic acid, the ABC-T 2023 guidelines recommend administering tranexamic acid to patients with trauma who are bleeding or at risk of significant bleeding as soon as possible. If feasible, this should be done en route to the hospital and within 3 hours after injury. The recommended dosage is a loading dose of 1 g infused over 10 minutes, followed by an intravenous infusion of 1 g over 8 hours.

### The utility and safety of prophylactic tranexamic acid in tonsillectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116VRXoj]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

We evaluated the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The final quality of evidence was classified as high, moderate, low, or very low for each clinical outcome. Two reviewers conducted the classification of GRADE independently.

- **Data synthesis**: All statistical analyses were conducted using RevMan Web, version 6.4.0. For continuous data (blood volume loss), a mean difference and 95% confidence interval (CI) were utilized. For dichotomous outcomes (post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage (PTH), need for transfusion, need for further intervention, and adverse effects), relative risk or risk ratio (RR) with its corresponding 95% CI were used. We implemented random‐effect models with inverse variance methods (Der Simonyan and Laird method). We also calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) with tranexamic acid (TXA) to achieve one less PTH using the formula: NNT = 1/[π₀ × (1 − RR)], assuming a comparator risk (π₀) of 4.5%. Heterogeneity across individual studies was assessed using the I² index, where heterogeneity was considered significant for an I² value greater than 50%. We assessed publication bias visually using funnel plots.

We conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses based on predefined hypotheses to explain potential statistical heterogeneity: the risk of bias of trials, age of patients (adults vs. children; with adults defined as age ≥ 18 years old), indication for surgery, mode of administration of TXA, and dose of TXA.

### SPL drug information for tranexamic acid [^1171Cm2Y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of tranexamic acid PO (also known as Lysteda, Cyklokapron):

- **Arterial thromboembolism, VTE**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as tranexamic acid is associated with an increased risk of arterial and venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and retinal vascular occlusions.

- **Cerebral edema, AIS**: Use extreme caution in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.

- **Exacerbation of dizziness**: Use caution when taken concomitantly with other medications that may cause dizziness, as this could exacerbate the effect. Advise patients to refrain from driving or operating machinery until they understand how the drug impacts them.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as tranexamic acid may increase the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from mild pruritus to severe conditions such as angioedema, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylactic shock.

- **Ligneous conjunctivitis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as tranexamic acid has been associated with a risk of ligneous conjunctivitis.

- **Myoclonus, seizures**: Use extreme caution in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery, females, individuals over 70 years old, those in poor health, patients with renal impairment, or those with prior neurological or cardiovascular disorders, including a history of stroke.

- **Visual impairment, vision loss, conjunctivitis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as tranexamic acid is associated with visual disturbances and retinal vascular occlusions. Patients expected to be treated for over 3 months should undergo regular visual acuity assessments and optical evaluations.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on mortality in patients with traumatic bleeding: Prespecified analysis of data from randomised controlled trial [^113mB7Zh]. BMJ (2012). High credibility.

To examine whether the effect of tranexamic acid on the risk of death and thrombotic events in patients with traumatic bleeding varies according to baseline risk of death, and to assess the extent to which protocols for treatment with tranexamic acid maximize benefits to patients, a prespecified stratified analysis of data from an international multicentre randomised controlled trial (the CRASH-2 trial) was conducted. This analysis included an estimation of the proportion of premature deaths that could potentially be averted through the administration of tranexamic acid.

Participants included 13,273 trauma patients from the CRASH-2 trial who were treated with tranexamic acid or placebo within three hours of injury, along with trauma patients enrolled in the UK Trauma and Audit Research Network, stratified by risk of death at baseline (50%).

- **Intervention**: Tranexamic acid (1 g over 10 minutes followed by 1 g over eight hours) or matching placebo.

- **Main outcome measure**: Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for death in hospital within four weeks of injury, deaths from bleeding, and fatal and non-fatal thrombotic events associated with the use of tranexamic acid according to baseline risk of death. Unless there was strong evidence against the null hypothesis of homogeneity of effects (P < 0.001), the overall odds ratio was used as the most reliable guide to the odds ratios in all strata.

Results indicated that tranexamic acid was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality and deaths from bleeding. In each stratum of baseline risk, there were fewer deaths among patients treated.

### Tranexamic acid for acute hemorrhage: A narrative review of landmark studies and a critical reappraisal of its use over the last decade [^1138qjj8]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). High credibility.

The publication of the Clinical Randomization of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Hemorrhage-2 (CRASH-2) study and its intense dissemination prompted a renaissance for the use of the antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid (TXA) in acute trauma hemorrhage. Subsequent studies led to its widespread use as a therapeutic as well as prophylactic agent across different clinical scenarios involving bleeding, such as trauma, postpartum, and orthopedic surgery.

However, results from the existing studies are confounded by methodological and statistical ambiguities and are open to varied interpretations. Substantial knowledge gaps remain on dosing, pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, and clinical applications for TXA. The risk for potential thromboembolic complications with the use of TXA must be balanced against its clinical benefits.

The present article aims to provide a critical reappraisal of TXA use over the last decade and a "thought exercise" in the potential downsides of TXA. A more selective and individualized use of TXA, guided by extended and functional coagulation assays, is advocated in the context of the evolving concept of precision medicine.

### Intravenous tranexamic acid in gastrointestinal bleeding: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1157fqk1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Gastrointestinal bleeding is a critical condition associated with high morbidity and mortality, necessitating effective management strategies. Tranexamic acid (TXA), an anti-fibrinolytic agent, has been proposed as a therapeutic option to reduce bleeding complications. However, recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have produced conflicting results regarding its efficacy and safety.

- **Method**: This systematic review and meta-analysis followed PRISMA guidelines and included RCTs evaluating the use of intravenous TXA in adult patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. Comprehensive searches were conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar, yielding 518 publications, with 7 RCTs meeting inclusion criteria. Data were synthesized using mainly a random-effects model to assess outcomes, including mortality, rebleeding, failure to control bleeding, thromboembolic events, and blood transfusion requirements.

- **Result**: The analysis included 7 RCTs of 13,608 participants, revealing that IV TXA was statistically significant in reducing rebleeding rates (OR 0.64; 95% CI: 0.45–0.91, P = 0.01) and failure to control bleeding (OR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.45–0.91, P = 0.03). However, there was no significant reduction in mortality (OR 0.77; 95% CI: 0.56–1.07, P = 0.12) or blood transfusion requirements (OR 0.94; 95% CI: 0.61–1.43, P = 0.76). While thromboembolic events showed no significant difference in the random-effects model (OR 1.28; 95% CI: 0.51–4.51, P = 0.46), fixed-effect analysis suggested a statistical significance (OR 1.28; 95% CI: 1.07–1.55, P = 0.009).

### Increased urokinase and consumption of α-antiplasmin as an explanation for the loss of benefit of tranexamic acid after treatment delay [^115dxeuT]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Low credibility.

Delayed treatment with tranexamic acid results in a loss of efficacy and poor outcomes. Increasing urokinase activity may account for the adverse effects of late tranexamic acid treatment. The combination of urokinase and tranexamic acid produces plasmin in plasma or blood, disrupting clotting. Additionally, α 2-antiplasmin consumption, when paired with ongoing fibrinolysis, increases plasmin-induced coagulopathy.

Tranexamic acid is an effective antifibrinolytic agent with a proven safety record. However, large clinical trials demonstrate that it becomes ineffective or harmful if treatment is delayed beyond three hours. The underlying mechanism remains unknown, but the urokinase plasminogen activator has been implicated.

- **Methods**: The inhibitory mechanisms were explored in various clot lysis systems using plasma and whole blood. Lysis by tissue plasminogen activator and plasmin were investigated. Coagulopathy was assessed using activated partial thromboplastin time.

- **Results**: IC50 values for antifibrinolytic activity varied from 1000 μmol L−1 depending on the system; however, good fibrin protection was observed in the presence of plasmin. In plasma or blood, active plasmin was generated by urokinase and tranexamic acid, leading to coagulopathy and resulting in poor or no clot formation. The extent of coagulopathy was sensitive to available α 2-antiplasmin. No clot formed with plasma containing 40% normal α 2-antiplasmin after short incubation with urokinase and tranexamic acid. Adding purified α 2-antiplasmin progressively restored clotting. Plasmin could be inhibited by aprotinin, with an IC50 of 530 nmol L−1, in plasma.

- **Conclusions**: Tranexamic acid protects against fibrinolysis under specific conditions. However, when combined with urokinase, it can generate active plasmin, thus compromising clot formation by depleting α 2-antiplasmin reserves.

### Tranexamic acid in neurosurgery: A controversy indication-review [^117GpsSr]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is one of the measures indicated to reduce bleeding and the need for volume replacement. However, data on risks and benefits are controversial. This study analyzes the effectiveness and risks of using tranexamic acid in neurosurgery. Articles published from 1976 to 2019 were selected from PubMed, EMBASE, Science Direct, and The Cochrane Database using the descriptors: "tranexamic acid", "neurosurgery", "traumatic brain injury", "subdural hemorrhage", "brain aneurysm", and "subarachnoid hemorrhage".

TXA can reduce blood loss and the need for blood transfusion in trauma and spinal surgery. Despite the benefits of TXA, moderate-to-high doses are potentially associated with neurological complications, such as seizures, transient ischemic attack, and delirium, in adults and children. In cases of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, the use of TXA can considerably reduce the risk of rebleeding, but there is weak evidence regarding its influence on mortality reduction. The use of TXA in brain surgery does not present a benefit, though this conclusion is limited due to the scarcity of studies.

TXA in neurosurgeries is a promising method for maintaining hemostasis in affected patients, particularly in traumatic brain injury and spinal surgery. However, there is a lack of evidence in brain and vascular surgeries. Many questions remain unanswered, such as how to determine the dosage that triggers the onset of associated complications or how to adjust the dose for chronic kidney disease patients.

### Effects of a high-dose 24-h infusion of tranexamic acid on death and thromboembolic events in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding (HALT-IT): an international randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1127EbmD]. Lancet (2020). High credibility.

The HALT-IT study was published by HALT-IT Trial Collaborators and colleagues in 2020 in the journal Lancet. This study addresses diseases such as non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding, variceal hemorrhage, and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The trial question in HALT-IT was: what is the effect of a high-dose 24-hour infusion of tranexamic acid in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding? The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

The study population consisted of 12,009 patients (4,266 female, 7,743 male). Inclusion criteria required adult patients with significant upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding, defined as being at risk of bleeding to death. Key exclusion criteria involved the responsible clinician's 'uncertainty' regarding the use of an antifibrinolytic agent in these patients.

The interventions in the study were as follows: 5,994 patients received tranexamic acid (a slow intravenous infusion of a 1 g loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 3 g over 24 hours) and 6,015 patients received a placebo (a matching intravenous infusion of sodium chloride 0.9%).

The primary outcome showed no significant difference in the rate of death due to bleeding within 5 days (3.7% vs. 3.8%; RR 0.99, 99% CI 0.82 to 1.18). Secondary outcomes indicated no significant difference in arterial thromboembolic events, such as myocardial infarction or stroke (0.7% vs. 0.8%; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.39). However, there was a significant increase in venous thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

### Efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid in prevention of postpartum hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 18,649 patients [^111RfdYQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). High credibility.

In recent years, TXA has gained attention as an effective treatment for PPH. Several studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of TXA in PPH. The WOMAN trial, a large randomized controlled trial involving over 20,000 women from 21 countries, found that TXA reduced the risk of death due to bleeding by 31% when given within three hours of birth. Another study conducted in Nigeria also showed that TXA reduced the need for blood transfusion and hysterectomy in women with PPH.

While some studies have shown promising results of TXA, limited studies represented a full understanding of its effectiveness and potential side effects. Therefore, this meta-analysis aims to update clinical evidence and determine the clinical efficacy and safety of TXA in the prevention of PPH. We collected up-to-date studies on both CB and VB, which will assist physicians in deciding whether to include TXA in their routine preoperative prophylaxis for PPH.

### Tranexamic acid for upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^111seujY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid reduces haemorrhage through its antifibrinolytic effects. In a previous version of the present review, we found that tranexamic acid may reduce mortality. The present review includes updated searches of randomized trials on tranexamic acid versus placebo, cimetidine, or lansoprazole.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of tranexamic acid for upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

- **Search methods**: Electronic searches (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index) and manual searches were combined. The last search update was in October 2011.

- **Selection criteria**: Trials in which patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding were randomized to receive either tranexamic acid or placebo, or any anti-ulcer drug, were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data. All-cause mortality was the primary outcome measure. Random-effects model meta-analyses were performed, and results presented as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subgroup, sensitivity, regression, and sequential analyses were performed to analyze sources of intertrial heterogeneity and the robustness of the overall result.

- **Main results**: Seven double-blind randomized trials on tranexamic acid versus placebo, cimetidine, or lansoprazole were included. One trial offered endoscopic treatment to all patients randomized. Random-effects model meta-analysis found that tranexamic acid reduced mortality compared with placebo (41 of 829 versus 68 of 825 patients; RR: 0.61, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.89). The beneficial effect was not confirmed.

### Is topical tranexamic acid effective in treating epistaxis [^115RDyhF]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Low credibility.

A review of relevant literature suggests that topical tranexamic acid (TXA) could potentially be a useful adjunct in the management of anterior epistaxis. However, the evidence is somewhat flawed, and multiple limitations have been identified. Further study is warranted to ascertain the role of topical TXA in the management of epistaxis.

### Tranexamic acid-associated seizures: Causes and treatment [^114SbALE]. Annals of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) was initially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating patients with hemophilia undergoing dental surgery and for women experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding. The clinical indications for TXA have expanded rapidly, now including multiple "off-label" uses, such as cardiac, gastrointestinal, and orthopedic surgery, as well as the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently included TXA in its "Model List of Essential Medicines", recommending its use to reduce blood loss in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass procedures, in trauma patients with significant hemorrhage, and in patients with postpartum hemorrhage.

The broad introduction of TXA into surgical care has resulted in an increased reported incidence of seizures, particularly during the early postoperative period following cardiac surgery. Retrospective analyses have shown that the incidence of seizures in postoperative cardiac patients has risen from 0.5–1.0% to 6.4–7.3% with higher doses of TXA. Additionally, several multicenter retrospective studies confirm increased seizures in postoperative patients who received TXA, with an incidence ranging from 0.9% to 2.5%. A single prospective trial found that seizures occurred in 3% (3 of 100 patients) of post-cardiac surgical patients treated with TXA. Although the incidence of TXA-associated seizures after cardiac surgery varies between studies, treatment with TXA was associated with higher seizure rates.

### Tranexamic acid - a narrative review for the emergency medicine clinician [^113S96By]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Over the last decade, tranexamic acid (TXA) has been incorporated into treatment algorithms for a multitude of emergent conditions, and the evidence surrounding its role in emergency medicine continues to evolve.

- **Objective**: The objective of this literature review is to provide an evidence-based approach to the utilization of TXA in the emergency department.

- **Discussion**: The most robust trials suggest TXA may offer a modest improvement in mortality in patients at risk of significant bleeding from trauma, but is not beneficial in spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding. The role of TXA in other clinical scenarios is less clear and requires clinical judgment.

- **Conclusion**: Tranexamic acid appears to be a reasonable adjunct for the emergency medicine clinician to consider in the management of many hemorrhagic conditions and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema. Additional high-quality research in these areas is needed to further identify patients who may benefit most from TXA.

### When to use tranexamic acid for the treatment of major bleeding [^112vnCc6]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). High credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an antifibrinolytic agent originally developed for the management of bleeding in the setting of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Over the last 15 years, there has been accumulating evidence on the use of TXA for the treatment of active bleeding in a variety of clinical contexts. Clinical trials have shown that the efficacy and safety of TXA for the treatment of bleeding differ according to the clinical context in which it is being administered, timing of administration, and dose. Early administration is important for efficacy, particularly in trauma and PPH. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms by which TXA provides benefit, optimal modes of administration and dosing, and its effect in some clinical settings, such as spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.

There is no evidence that TXA increases the risk of thrombotic events in patients with major bleeding overall. However, there is evidence of increased risk of venous thrombosis in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. There is also evidence of increased risk of seizures with the use of higher doses. This review summarizes the evidence for the use of TXA for patients with active bleeding and highlights the importance of generating evidence of efficacy and safety of hemostatic interventions specific to the bleeding contexts — as findings from one clinical setting may not be generalizable to other contexts — and that of individual patient assessment for bleeding, thrombotic, and other risks, as well as important logistical and other practical considerations, to optimize care and outcomes.

Regarding the medical management of traumatic hemorrhage, particularly concerning tranexamic acid, the BSH 2022 guidelines recommend administering tranexamic acid as soon as possible after injury, and no later than 3 hours, for patients with traumatic injury, including mild to moderate traumatic brain injury. The guidelines specify an administration of a 1 g bolus dose IV over 10 minutes, followed by a maintenance infusion of 1 g over 8 hours.

### Increased urokinase and consumption of α-antiplasmin as an explanation for the loss of benefit of tranexamic acid after treatment delay [^1129EUXf]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Low credibility.

Plasma clots are stabilized by α2-antiplasmin, but in situations of ongoing fibrinolysis, α2-antiplasmin may be depleted, rendering the system more susceptible to fibrinolysis. A series of experiments were performed using clots made from euglobulin, which is known to have reduced levels of inhibitors, including α2-antiplasmin. Representative clot lysis profiles are shown where 5 nmol L−1 scuPA, the single-chain zymogen of uPA, could catalyze fibrinolysis. Marked stimulation of fibrinolysis was achieved by adding 0.6 nmol L−1 tPA to scuPA (note the shorter time on the x-axis).

Using euglobulin as a substrate, the speed of fibrinolysis correlated with the observed IC50 for TXA blocking fibrinolysis. For example, for 5 and 10 nmol L−1 scuPA alone, estimates of IC50 values were 13 (± 3) and 214 (± 90) μmol L−1, and with the addition of 0.6 nmol L−1 tPA, the IC50 values were 380 (± 144) and 490 (± 231) μmol L−1 (± values are SE for curve fitting). Euglobulin clots were more sensitive to the direct application of plasmin compared with plasma clots, and IC50 values for TXA were high, estimated to be 600–1900 (± 31–90) μmol L−1. Thus, reducing available intrinsic inhibitors of fibrinolysis increased the concentration of TXA required to block fibrinolysis.

### Tranexamic acid for reducing mortality in emergency and urgent surgery [^11391WMo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Emergency or urgent surgery, which can be defined as surgery that must be performed promptly to save life, limb, or functional capacity, is associated with a high risk of bleeding and death. Antifibrinolytic agents, such as tranexamic acid, inhibit blood clot breakdown (fibrinolysis) and can reduce perioperative bleeding. Tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce the need for a blood transfusion in adult patients undergoing elective surgery, but its effects in patients undergoing emergency or urgent surgery are unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of tranexamic acid on mortality, blood transfusion, and thromboembolic events in adults undergoing emergency or urgent surgery.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register (22 August 2012); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2012, Issue 8 of 12); MEDLINE (Ovid SP) 1950 to August Week 2, 2012; PubMed 1 June 2012 to 22 August 2012; EMBASE (Ovid SP) 1980 to 2012 Week 33; ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) 1990 to 22 August 2012; ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) 1970 to 22 August 2012. We also searched online trial registers on 22 August 2012 to identify unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing tranexamic acid with no tranexamic acid or placebo in adults undergoing emergency or urgent surgery.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors examined titles, abstracts, and keywords of citations from the electronic databases for eligibility.

### Prophylactic tranexamic acid in patients with hematologic malignancy: a placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial [^114Z1GUU]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

Evidence of the effectiveness of prophylactic use of tranexamic acid (TXA) in thrombocytopenia is lacking. To determine whether TXA safely reduces bleeding incidence in patients undergoing treatment for hematologic malignancies, a randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted from June 2016 through June 2020. Of 3120 screened adults, 356 patients were eligible and enrolled, and 337 patients (mean age, 53.9; 141 [41.8%] women) were randomized to receive either 1300 mg TXA orally or 1000 mg TXA intravenously (n = 168) versus a placebo (n = 169) thrice daily for a maximum of 30 days. Three hundred thirty patients were activated when their platelet counts fell below 30,000 per µL; 279 (83%) had complete outcome ascertainment. World Health Organization (WHO) grade ≥ 2 bleeding was observed in the 30 days following activation in 50.3% (73/145) and 54.2% (78/144) of patients in the TXA and placebo groups, respectively, with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.50–1.34; p = 0.44).

There was no statistically significant difference in the mean number of platelet transfusions (mean difference, 0.1; 95% CI, -1.9 to 2.0), mean days alive without grade ≥ 2 bleeding (mean difference, 0.8; 95% CI, -0.4 to 2.0), thrombotic events (6/163 [3.7%] TXA, 9/163 [5.5%] placebo), or deaths due to serious bleeding.

The most common adverse events were diarrhea (116/164 [70.7%] TXA and 114/163 [69.9%] placebo), febrile neutropenia (111/164 [67.7%] TXA and 105/163 [64.4%] placebo), fatigue (106/164 [64.6%] TXA and 109/163 [66.9%] placebo), and nausea (104/164 [63.4%] TXA and 97/163 [59.5%] placebo). Among patients with hematologic malignancies, these findings suggest that prophylactic TXA does not significantly reduce WHO grade ≥ 2 bleeding compared to placebo.

Tranexamic acid in acute bleeding conditions

In addition to the preventive use of TXA, a number of studies have investigated the role of this anti-fibrinolytic agent in patients presenting with acute, critical bleeding. In trauma patients, the largest body of evidence stems from the Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage (CRASH) trials. In the CRASH-2 trial, 20,211 severely injured adults with confirmed or suspected hemorrhage were randomly assigned within 8 hours from the occurrence of trauma to receive TXA (loading bolus dose of 1 g and then an infusion of 1 g over 8 hours) or placebo. Despite no difference in bleeding rate and transfusion use, all-cause mortality was lower in the treatment group than in the placebo group (14.5% vs. 16%, respectively; RR 0.91; 95% CI: 0.85–0.97, P = 0.0035). Similarly, the rate of deaths attributed to bleeding was reduced from 5.7% to 4.9% (P = 0.0077).

From a sub-analysis of CRASH-2, the timing of TXA administration was crucial for patients' outcomes. Early infusion of TXA within 1 hour after trauma was associated with the largest survival benefit (absolute reduction = 2.4%, number needed to treat = 41). TXA infused between 1 and 3 hours also reduced the risk of death due to bleeding (absolute reduction = 1.3%, number needed to treat = 77), but a later administration (> 3 hours after trauma) was associated with an increased risk of death from bleeding compared with the risk among patients receiving placebo (RR 1.44, 95% CI: 1.12–1.84; P = 0.004). There was no evidence that TXA increased the risk of vascular occlusions.

### Tranexamic acid in trauma: How should we use it [^117U4KxE]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces blood loss by inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown of fibrin. It is often used in surgery to decrease bleeding and the need for blood transfusion. In 2011, results from a multi-center, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial (CRASH-2 trial) showed that TXA (1 g loading dose over 10 min followed by an infusion of 1 g over 8 h) safely reduces mortality in bleeding trauma patients. Initiation of TXA treatment within 3 h of injury reduces the risk of hemorrhage death by about one-third, regardless of baseline risk. Because it does not have any serious adverse effects, TXA can be administered to a wide spectrum of bleeding trauma patients. Limiting its use to the most severely injured or those with a diagnosis of 'hyperfibrinolysis' would result in thousands of avoidable deaths. A clinical trial (CRASH-3 trial) of TXA in patients with traumatic brain injury is now in progress.

### The utility and safety of prophylactic tranexamic acid in tonsillectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111tjKyP]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

An important question that wasn't specifically addressed and answered in this systematic review is whether tranexamic acid (TXA) impacts primary or secondary hemorrhage. From a basic pharmacology standpoint, TXA is a synthetic analogue of the amino acid lysine. It promotes antifibrinolysis by competitively binding to the lysine-binding site on plasmin and plasminogen, thereby precluding subsequent fibrin clot degradation by plasmin. It seems reasonable to believe that TXA primarily impacts primary posttonsillectomy hemorrhage (PTH) by the preservation of fibrin clot and prevention of its early degradation. We hypothesize, however, that TXA may also reduce secondary PTH by reducing perioperative bleeding and oozing. The proposed pathophysiological mechanism of action is illustrated in Figure 11. This hypothesis remains to be verified in future works.

### The never ending success story of tranexamic acid in acquired bleeding [^111L9oMy]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

Recent evidence indicates that tranexamic acid (TXA) usage results in a significant reduction of obstetric bleeding. In the landmark randomized double-blind World Maternal Antifibrinolytic (WOMAN) trial, more than 20,000 women with postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) following vaginal or Cesarean delivery were assigned to receive either TXA (1 g intravenously as soon as possible, followed by another 1 g if bleeding continued after 30 minutes or restarted within 24 hours of the initial dose) or placebo. The trial showed a decreased overall mortality due to bleeding in the TXA group (RR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.65–1.00; P = 0.045), and no differences in venous or arterial thromboembolic events were observed between women in the two arms. Similar to the CRASH trials, in the WOMAN trial, patients receiving TXA within 3 hours of delivery had the most marked mortality reduction (89 deaths in the TXA group vs. 127 deaths in the placebo group, RR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.52–0.91; P = 0.008).

Thanks to the results of this global trial, a 2017 World Health Organization recommendation for the treatment of PPH states that TXA should be recognized as a life-saving intervention and thus made readily available for the management of PPH in settings where emergency obstetric care is provided, regardless of the level of healthcare system resources. In addition, the recent NATA consensus statement recommends the administration of TXA (1 g by intravenous route) as soon as possible within the first 3 hours after PPH onset, with this dose repeated after 30 minutes if bleeding continues (grade 1B recommendation).

All in all, these large trials document…

### Tranexamic acid for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage [^115UX9sL]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2015). High credibility.

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal mortality, accounting for one-quarter of all maternal deaths worldwide. Uterotonics after birth are the only intervention that has been shown to be effective for PPH prevention. Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic agent, has been investigated as a potentially useful complement for both prevention and treatment because its hypothesized mechanism of action in PPH supplements that of uterotonics. It has been proved to reduce blood loss in elective surgery, bleeding in trauma patients, and menstrual blood loss.

This review covers evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for PPH prevention after caesarean (n = 10) and vaginal (n = 2) deliveries and for PPH treatment after vaginal delivery (n = 1). It discusses the efficacy and side effects of TXA overall and in relation to the various doses studied for both indications. TXA appears to be a promising drug for the prevention and treatment of PPH after both vaginal and caesarean delivery. Nevertheless, the level of evidence supporting its efficacy is insufficient, as are the data about its benefit:harm ratio. Large, adequately powered multicentre RCTs are required before its widespread use for preventing and treating PPH can be recommended.

### Coagulation support during perioperative bleeding management [^112z54Fc]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid

Multiple trauma trials report the benefit of antifibrinolytic use of tranexamic acid (TXA) with early administration in severely injured patients. However, despite its extensive use, administration for severe (isolated) traumatic brain injury and gastrointestinal bleeding is debated due to the potential of increased thromboembolic risk. In trauma patients, there is concern regarding administering TXA in patients who demonstrate fibrinolytic shutdown, a consideration based on observational data reporting the association of TXA with fibrinolytic shutdown and mortality. However, in European guidelines, TXA is routinely administered.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on surgical bleeding: Systematic review and cumulative meta-analysis [^115wboCE]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Overall, 44 (34%) trials were judged to be at low risk of bias for sequence generation and five (4%) to be at high risk (see the supplementary file for the risk of bias judgments for each methodological quality item for the included trials). The risk of bias in the remaining 80 (62%) trials was unclear owing to lack of information. Allocation was adequately concealed in 36 trials (28%) and inadequately concealed in six (5%), with the other 87 (67%) presenting insufficient information to allow judgment. Of the 95 trials with data on blood transfusion, 69 (73%) were judged at low risk of blinding, four (4%) at high risk, and 22 (23%) were unclear. The risk of bias for blinding was similar for thromboembolic outcomes (myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism), with about 70% judged to be at low risk, 5% at high risk, and 25% at unclear risk. All 72 trials with mortality outcomes were judged to be at low risk of bias for blinding. Of 115 trials reporting eligible outcome data, 72 (63%) were at low risk of bias for incomplete outcome data, 17 (15%) at high risk, and 26 (23%) did not describe adequate information to permit judgment.

### The never ending success story of tranexamic acid in acquired bleeding [^112jUKQf]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

There is a growing body of evidence documenting the efficacy of tranexamic acid (TXA) in preventing bleeding across a variety of major surgical procedures, especially cardiac surgery, as part of patient blood management (PBM) programs. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, TXA was shown to reduce blood loss in surgical patients by nearly one-third compared to placebo. These results were consistent with a Cochrane systematic review, which included 129 trials with 10,488 participants, showing that TXA reduced the probability of receiving a blood transfusion by one-third (relative risk [RR] 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.58–0.65; P < 0.001).

More recently, TXA has been widely used to minimize bleeding and exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in major orthopedic surgery. Several large randomized controlled trials (RCT) and meta-analyses have consistently confirmed that the intravenous administration of this medication effectively and safely reduces perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirements during major orthopedic operations such as total hip and knee arthroplasty. Some concerns still remain among users over the hypothetical increased risk of thromboembolic complications following the systemic infusion of this antifibrinolytic agent, given that orthopedic surgery is associated with a high risk of both bleeding and thrombosis. Thus, to refute this unjustified, non-evidence-based perception, which represents the main obstacle to a broader use of TXA in this clinical context, we recently conducted a systematic review.

### Tranexamic acid for the management of obstetric hemorrhage [^114Pxgsv]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). High credibility.

Obstetric hemorrhage remains the most common cause of maternal mortality worldwide. It is believed that increased fibrinolytic activity, secondary to the release and activation of endothelial tissue plasminogen activator, is involved in its pathogenesis. Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic agent, has been shown to be beneficial in trauma patients if used within 3 hours of injury. A recent large randomized controlled trial demonstrated that TXA administered to hemorrhaging women within 3 hours after delivery was associated with a decreased risk of death from bleeding, with no increase in thromboembolic complications. Limited evidence suggests that prophylactic TXA reduces blood loss at the time of delivery and decreases transfusion rates in the obstetric population. Tranexamic acid appears to be a safe and effective option for the treatment of obstetric hemorrhage. In addition, the limited available evidence supports the need for a well-designed, adequately powered clinical trial to test its benefit as a prophylactic agent.

### Efficacy of high dose tranexamic acid (TXA) for hemorrhage: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117ExdE9]. Injury (2023). High credibility.

Standard dose (≤ 1 g) tranexamic acid (TXA) has established a mortality benefit in trauma patients. The role of high dose IV TXA (≥ 2 g or ≥ 30 mg/kg as a single bolus) has been evaluated in the surgical setting; however, it has not been studied in trauma. We reviewed the available evidence of high dose IV TXA in any setting with the goal of informing its use in the adult trauma population.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and unpublished sources from inception until July 27, 2022, for studies that compared standard dose with high dose IV TXA in adults (≥ 16 years of age) with hemorrhage. Screening and data abstraction were done independently and in duplicate. We pooled trial data using a random effects model and considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational cohort studies separately. We assessed the individual study risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational cohort studies. The overall certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

- **Results**: We included 20 studies with a combined total of 12,523 patients. Based on pooled RCT data, and as compared to standard dose TXA, high dose IV TXA probably decreases transfusion requirements (odds ratio [OR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 0.97, moderate certainty) but with possibly no effect on blood loss (mean difference [MD] 43.31 mL less, 95% CI 135.53 to 48.90 mL less, low certainty), and an uncertain effect on thromboembolic events (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.27, very low certainty).

### SPL drug information for tranexamic acid [^111sGU2U]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of tranexamic acid IV (also known as Lysteda, Cyklokapron):

- **Arterial thromboembolism, VTE**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as tranexamic acid is associated with an increased risk of arterial and VTE, including DVT, PE, and retinal vascular occlusions.

- **Exacerbation of dizziness**: Use caution when taken concomitantly with other medications that may cause dizziness, as this could exacerbate the effect. Advise patients to refrain from driving or operating machinery until they understand how the drug impacts them.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as tranexamic acid may increase the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from mild pruritus to severe conditions such as angioedema, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylactic shock.

- **Myoclonus, seizures**: Use extreme caution in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery, females, individuals over 70 years old, those in poor health, patients with renal impairment, or those with prior neurological or cardiovascular disorders, including a history of stroke.

- **Visual impairment, vision loss, conjunctivitis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as tranexamic acid is associated with visual disturbances and retinal vascular occlusions. Patients expected to be treated for over 3 months should undergo regular visual acuity and optical coherence assessments. If visual disturbances or ocular symptoms occur, refer the patient to an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive evaluation, including a dilated retinal examination.
