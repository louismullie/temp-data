## Question

How should I conduct a fall risk assessment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to conduct a step-by-step fall risk assessment for older adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about anchoring the framework to the World Guidelines for Falls (WFG 2022) and related high-credibility evidence. Then, I should structure the flow into screening, stratification, multifactorial assessment by domains, special populations, linking assessment to interventions, and follow-up. Next, I need to check for any internal inconsistencies and preserve any mistakes with self-correction. Finally, I should ensure every paragraph is referenced and that key caveats and implementation notes are explicit and evidence-based.

> Let me first confirm the overarching approach and scope so I don't jump to conclusions. The WFG 2022 emphasizes risk stratification to guide the depth of assessment and the tailoring of interventions, integrated within a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment to keep the process person-centered and goal-concordant, which I should keep front and center as I refine the flow [^112mJ744].

> I should double-check the screening and initial stratification logic. A brief screen centered on fall history in the last 12 months, injury requiring treatment, and observed or self-reported gait/balance problems stratifies to low, intermediate, or high risk; low risk warrants primary prevention and annual reassessment, intermediate risk triggers targeted strength/balance exercise, and high risk mandates a comprehensive multifactorial assessment and intervention, especially when there are two or more falls, an injurious fall, frailty, prolonged time on the floor, or suspected transient loss of consciousness [^115aJ2aT] [^114Z5xZR] [^1141a4wt].

> Now, for gait and balance, let me verify the tools and thresholds so I don't propagate an error. The Timed Up and Go (TUG) and Berg Balance Scale (BBS) are feasible and informative, and gait speed is often useful; however, no single test alone reliably predicts falls, so they must be interpreted within a multifactorial context. Wait, I initially wrote "Gait speed: cut-off of 15 seconds", but that mixes units because gait speed is typically reported in m/s, whereas 12–15 seconds thresholds often refer to TUG; I should correct this and state that guidelines support measuring gait speed and considering TUG, while acknowledging mixed evidence and the need for combined risk factor assessment. BBS values above 50 generally indicate lower fall risk in community-dwelling adults, but again, context matters and single-test prediction is limited [^114wYxLq] [^116rYAqL] [^1153Juyq].

> Hold on, I should verify the psychological domain. Concerns about falling should be assessed with a standardized tool such as the FES-I or Short FES-I; meta-analytic evidence supports concerns-about-falling as an independent predictor of future falls, whereas balance confidence on the ABC scale does not consistently predict falls. Let me reconsider instrument properties: FES-I variants demonstrate strong measurement properties, which supports their routine use in both community and hospital settings [^114joxHc] [^1162rSZY] [^115dJw3p] [^115pa7uz].

> Next, I should review sensory domains. Visual assessment should include acuity and consideration of hemianopia or neglect when appropriate, and hearing should be measured with referral as needed; both are key modifiable contributors to fall risk that I must not overlook [^111RWW6W] [^114X9bMX].

> I will now examine cognition and mood because executive dysfunction and depression meaningfully elevate fall risk. Cognitive screening should be obtained as part of the multifactorial assessment, and depressive symptoms should be screened and evaluated further when indicated; executive function deficits, slower processing speed, and reaction time are particularly salient mechanisms that I should keep in mind [^111Sye1Z] [^112Jss6V] [^111TvHb3].

> Let me think about pain and medications, since these are often modifiable. Pain warrants routine inquiry with more detailed evaluation when indicated, and medication review should precede initiating drugs that may increase fall risk, with special attention to psychotropics, cardiovascular agents, antiepileptics, opioids, and polypharmacy; I should ensure deprescribing and dose minimization strategies are considered where appropriate [^113FW58c] [^113Pgcaz] [^112MrzV8] [^112me3gD].

> I need to ensure the environment and function/goals are integrated, not tacked on. A home and surroundings hazard assessment, coupled with appraisal of the person's capacities and behaviors, is recommended, and for those at high risk, formal environmental assessment and modifications are appropriate. Functional status in ADLs/IADLs and eliciting the individual's goals, priorities, tolerance for risk, and willingness/capability to engage in interventions should shape the plan [^111YF6AT] [^1144ULTC] [^115P7ef8].

> Hold on, I should verify cardiovascular testing indications so we avoid overtesting. Further cardiovascular evaluation should be selective rather than routine, pursued when initial assessment reveals abnormalities or when syncope or unexplained falls suggest a cardiovascular mechanism, which aligns with a prudent, hypothesis-driven approach [^113aEsyA].

> Let me now consider special populations, starting with hospitalized older adults. WFG 2022 advises against scored fall risk screening tools in the hospital because they do not reduce falls and consume resources; instead, perform a multifactorial assessment on all hospitalized adults 65+, reassess with changes in condition, and complete an immediate post-fall evaluation to identify mechanism, injuries, precipitating factors, and necessary care plan updates. But wait, what if fall risk labeling inadvertently reduces mobility? Evidence suggests high-risk categorization can correlate with lower mobility, so I should balance fall prevention with mobility preservation and consider tools that proactively identify hospital-acquired mobility impairment risk on day 1 to target early therapy [^115EWvHw] [^1176oUsj] [^112iVWz3].

> Next, I should review disease-specific guidance. In Parkinson's disease, a brief disease-specific triad — prior-year falls, recent freezing of gait, and slow gait speed — provides focused risk stratification and should trigger targeted assessment and interventions for this subgroup [^113zf6gN].

> I will now link assessment to action, which is where patient benefit materializes. For low risk, I should provide primary prevention advice and plan annual reassessment; for intermediate risk, evidence-based strength and balance exercise is indicated; for high risk, a multiprofessional, multifactorial intervention that addresses identified modifiable factors is warranted. I should confirm alignment with preventive recommendations for community-dwelling older adults from USPSTF and population-level evidence underscoring multicomponent strategies [^115aJ2aT] [^1141a4wt] [^115aJ2aT] [^113E3621].

> I should double-check the follow-up cadence to avoid gaps in care. Low-risk individuals should be reassessed annually or sooner with condition changes, high-risk individuals need more frequent review based on clinical judgment, and every fall should trigger an immediate post-fall assessment with iterative plan adjustment following any intervention cycle to ensure effectiveness [^115aJ2aT] [^115EWvHw].

> Let me not forget key implementation cautions. No single gait, balance, or mobility test can predict falls with high certainty, so I should resist over-reliance on any one measure. Even those screened as "not at risk" can still fall, with substantial injury burden, so messaging must avoid false reassurance and consider universal gait speed appraisal to surface hidden risk. Standardized documentation and multiprofessional teamwork improve learning and prevention, and while sensor-based assessments show promise for objective measurement, variability in parameters and methods means they should remain adjunctive rather than replacements until validated [^1153Juyq] [^116boXJY] [^1141a4wt] [^113XpNW4] [^116rYAqL].

> To summarize the clinical flow without losing nuance, I should state it plainly and verify alignment with the guidelines: screen quickly with fall history and gait/balance observation, stratify risk to determine depth of assessment, conduct a multifactorial assessment across mobility, psychological concerns, sensory, cognition, mood, pain, medications, environment, function and goals, and selective cardiovascular testing as indicated, then implement person-centered interventions matched to risk tier and identified modifiable factors, and reassess at defined intervals or after any fall, which preserves the intent and structure of WFG 2022 [^112mJ744] [^1141a4wt] [^115aJ2aT].

---

To assess fall risk, use a **multifactorial approach** [^112mJ744] that includes a structured history (prior falls, medications, comorbidities), physical exam (gait, balance, strength, vision [^111RWW6W], cognition [^111Sye1Z]), and environment review [^111YF6AT] [^114joxHc]. Apply **validated tools** such as TUG, gait speed [^114wYxLq], and FES-I [^114joxHc] [^115dJw3p], and stratify risk to guide interventions [^112ah6ej]. Reassess **annually** [^115aJ2aT] or after any fall or health change [^115EWvHw], and **document findings** to support individualized, evidence-based prevention [^112mJ744].

---

## Step 1: initial screening and history-taking

Begin with a **structured history** to identify key risk factors:

- **Previous falls**: Strong predictor of future falls [^111TvHb3] [^112mJ744].
- **Medications**: Especially psychotropics, antihypertensives, sedatives, and polypharmacy [^112MrzV8] [^111TvHb3].
- **Comorbidities**: Cognitive impairment [^111Sye1Z], depression [^112Jss6V], Parkinson's disease [^113zf6gN], osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease [^113aEsyA].
- **Functional status**: Difficulties with ADLs, use of mobility aids, gait or balance problems [^1176oUsj] [^112mJ744].
- **Environmental hazards**: Home hazards, poor lighting, uneven surfaces [^111YF6AT] [^112GwQun].

---

## Step 2: physical examination and functional assessment

Conduct a focused **physical examination and functional assessment**:

- **Gait and balance**: Observe gait, balance, and posture; use TUG [^1153Juyq] and gait speed [^114wYxLq] [^115Syuip].
- **Strength and mobility**: Assess lower limb strength and mobility (e.g. chair stand test) [^1153Juyq] [^114wYxLq].
- **Vision and hearing**: Measure visual acuity [^111RWW6W] and screen for hearing impairment [^114X9bMX].
- **Cognition and mood**: Screen for cognitive impairment [^111Sye1Z] and depression [^112Jss6V].

---

## Step 3: use of validated assessment tools

Incorporate **validated tools** to quantify risk:

| **Tool** | **Purpose** | **Recommended use** |
|-|-|-|
| Timed Up and Go (TUG) | Gait and balance | Community and clinical settings [^114wYxLq] [^1153Juyq] |
| Gait speed | Mobility assessment | Community and clinical settings [^114wYxLq] [^116boXJY] |
| Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) | Fear of falling | Community and clinical settings [^114joxHc] [^115dJw3p] |
| Berg Balance Scale (BBS) | Balance assessment | Clinical settings [^1153Juyq] [^116rYAqL] |

---

## Step 4: risk stratification

Stratify patients into **risk categories** to guide interventions. Define low risk as no falls, no gait/balance problems, and independent mobility; intermediate risk as a single non-severe fall or gait/balance problems; and high risk as multiple falls, severe injury, frailty, cognitive impairment, or inability to rise following a fall [^112mJ744] [^114Z5xZR]. Use this stratification to align prevention intensity with risk level.

---

## Step 5: individualized intervention planning

Develop **tailored interventions** based on risk level:

- **Low risk**: Primary prevention, education, and annual reassessment [^115aJ2aT] [^112mJ744].
- **Intermediate risk**: Strength and balance exercises [^112ah6ej], medication review [^112MrzV8], vision correction [^111RWW6W], environmental modifications [^1144ULTC] [^112mJ744].
- **High risk**: Multifactorial interventions [^112ah6ej] [^113E3621], comprehensive geriatric assessment [^1141a4wt], specialist referral, and close follow-up [^112mJ744].

---

## Step 6: documentation and follow-up

Document **all findings** [^112mJ744], risk stratification, and interventions. Reassess **annually** or after any fall or significant health change [^115EWvHw] [^115aJ2aT].

---

A comprehensive fall risk assessment uses a **multifactorial approach** with structured history, physical exam, validated tools, and risk stratification to guide individualized interventions and reduce falls [^112ah6ej].

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: A global initiative [^112mJ744]. Age and Ageing (2022). High credibility.

Fall risk stratification involves a standard approach to assess an individual's estimated level of risk for falls in order to apply a proportionate detailed assessment and intervention according to the level of risk. The assessment process identifies and measures the falls risk factors across multiple domains, using recommended tools if available, to indicate potentially modifiable areas for intervention. Combined with other components of a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), this enables a person-centered approach.

Management and interventions describe various approaches to fall prevention, including recommended treatments or actions which can reduce the risk of falls and may be suitable as single interventions or in combinations. The assessment and treatment algorithm links the three stages of initial risk stratification, assessment, and management, and encourages a 'person-centered' approach to design an individualized intervention.

### A systematic review of fall prediction models for community-dwelling older adults: Comparison between models based on research cohorts and models based on routinely collected data [^111jz9YU]. Age and Ageing (2024). Low credibility.

The aim of this review is to provide an overview of prediction models for falls in community-dwelling older adults and to compare models derived from routinely collected data (RCD) against models derived from cohorts. This comparison focuses on various aspects, including development, final included predictors, predictive performance, predicted outcomes, presentation, internal and external validation, reporting quality, and risk of bias.

### Risk prediction models for falls in hospitalized older patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112me3gD]. BMC geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Falls in older adults are a complex issue with both intrinsic (individual characteristics) and extrinsic (environmental) risk factors. Most falls involve a combination of advanced age, health conditions, and interactions with the environment. Due to this complexity, predicting fall risk is challenging.

This study summarized the most commonly reported influences on falls based on the final models' results. The top four factors identified were mobility limitations, history of falls, medications, and mental cognition. While mobility testing is crucial for fall risk assessment, relying solely on a single test (e.g. single leg stance test, timed up and go) is insufficient. Combining these tests with other factors improved accuracy.

Indeed, although numerous fall risk assessment tools exist, achieving both high sensitivity and specificity remains difficult. Therefore, a more precise prediction model for hospitalized older adults is urgently needed for clinical application.

A history of falls is a strong predictor of future falls and a major focus in clinical assessments. This is likely due to both the physical consequences (functional decline) and psychological impact (fear of falling (FOF)) of falls. Notably, FOF is prevalent, affecting 40–73% of older adults with a history of falls, and even half of those without.

Polypharmacy and specific medications like cardiovascular and psychotropic drugs significantly increase fall risk in hospitalized older adults with high comorbidity. Certain medications, including antiepileptic drugs, opioids, and those used in high quantities, pose a particularly high risk.

### Does concern about falling predict future falls in older adults? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1162rSZY]. Age and Ageing (2025). High credibility.

The 2022 World Falls Guidelines recommend assessing concerns (or 'fears') about falling in multifactorial fall risk assessments. However, the evidence base for this recommendation is limited. This review evaluated the evidence for concerns about falling as an independent predictor of future falls, applying the Bradford Hill criteria for causality.

- **Methods**: Systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted (PROSPERO registration ID: CRD42023387212). MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO were searched for studies examining associations between baseline concerns about falling and future falls in older adults (minimum 6-month follow-up). Meta-analyses examined associations between concerns about falling and future falls. Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted Newcastle Ottawa Scale for cohort studies, and evidence certainty was rated with GRADE.

- **Results**: About 53 studies, comprising 75,076 participants, were included. Meta-analysis showed a significant independent association between baseline concerns and future falls when using the Falls Efficacy Scale-International to assess concerns (full scale version, pooled OR = 1.03 [95% CI = 1.02–1.05] per 1-point increase; short scale version, pooled OR = 1.08 [95% CI = 1.05–1.11]). Significant associations were also observed when using single-item measures of concerns (pooled OR = 1.60 [95% CI = 1.36–1.89] for high vs. low concerns). In contrast, balance confidence (Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale) did not predict future falls (pooled OR = 0.97 [95% CI = 0.93–1.01]). Despite 26 studies rated as poor quality, the overall evidence supports assessing concerns about falling as a predictor of future falls.

### Identifying sensors-based parameters associated with fall risk in community-dwelling older adults: An investigation and interpretation of discriminatory parameters [^116rYAqL]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). High credibility.

During the experiment phase, participants were required to complete two sets of tests: the BBS assessment and the 3 m-TUG test.

- **BBS assessment**: The BBS consists of 14 items examining the balance capability of older adults, and each item is scored on a scale of 0 to 4. If the participant is unable to do the task, the score is recorded as 0, and if the participant is able to complete the task according to the criteria assigned to it, the score is 4. The maximum total score on the test is 56. The BBS was developed as a balance assessment to objectively assess a person's ability to control balance in a functional task. For the prediction of falls in community-dwelling older adults, a cutoff score of 50 was proposed. Participants were labeled as low-fall-risk individuals if their BBS score was > 50; otherwise, they were labeled as high-fall-risk individuals. Therefore, we identified twenty-six low-fall-risk individuals and fifteen high-fall-risk individuals.

- **3 m-TUG test**: Participants were required to stand up from a chair, walk 3 m, turn around 180°, then walk back around and sit in the chair again. The TUG is a simple and feasible tool that can be administered in any setting and at any time. It involves basic mobility skills such as rising, turning, sitting, and walking. Therefore, it is recommended as a screening tool to identify older adults with balance or gait impairments. In our experiment, all participants finished the TUG without any walking assistance.

### Is independence of older adults safe considering the risk of falls [^112KJjAV]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

In the group of subjects prone to falls, difficulties in going out, feeling unsafe outside the home, and vision impairment were the dominant factors in the EASY-Care Standard 2010 risk of falls scale. A total of 74.81% of people prone to falls and 21.07% of those not prone to falls experienced previous falls.

The study found a negative correlation between the risk of falls scale in EASY-Care Standard 2010 and AMTS score (rₛ = −0.1696, p = 0.007) and a positive correlation with GDS (rₛ = 0.2347, p < 0.001). Analysis indicates that the risk of falls increases with poorer mental ability (as indicated by a lower AMTS score) and increased depression (as shown by a higher GDS score). Additionally, a negative correlation was observed between levels of functioning in both basic activities of daily living (p < 0.001) and complex activities (p < 0.001) and the risk of falls. The risk of falls increased with poorer functioning in these areas.

- **Statistical analysis**: Individual EASY-Care Standard 2010 fields analysis found activities that cause significant difficulties in independent functioning. These activities might be responsible for falls and were not included in the risk of falls scale.

As part of the risk of falls factors, the following demographic variables were analyzed: sex, age, and form of residence. A relationship with age (chi-square test, p < 0.001) was identified, but no significant relationship was found with sex (chi-square test, p = 0.215) or form of residence (chi-square test, p = 0.803).

### Predicting the risk of falling: Efficacy of a risk assessment tool compared to nurses' judgement: A cluster-randomised controlled trial [^111v5VQ9]. BMC Geriatrics (2005). High credibility.

The primary outcome is the number of participants with at least one fall at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures include the number of falls, clinical consequences such as fall and injury prevention measures applied, and side effects of the two risk assessment strategies. Side effects are defined as the application of physical or pharmacological restraints. In addition, injuries and fractures related to falls, hospital admissions, consultations with a physician related to falls irrespective of the reason for falls, and costs will also be recorded.

Nursing staff will fill in a specially developed documentation sheet in case of a fall event and complete a documentation sheet on measures used to prevent falls once a month. Data will be checked monthly during personal visits by the investigators. It is not possible to objectify the documented falls. Nevertheless, in Germany, nurses are legally required to document falls in nursing homes. Interrater reliability of the Downton Index will be determined in a subgroup of nurses in the interventional group clusters.

Sample size calculation assumes that about 45% of the participants in the control group will experience at least one fall in 12 months, with an intra-class correlation coefficient of ICCC = 0.075. A cluster-randomisation with about 20 participants in each cluster leads to a variation inflation factor of VIF = 2.425. It is assumed that 20% of the participants will not complete follow-up and furthermore assumes an absolute difference of 15% (incidence of fallers in the Downton Index group: 30%) to reach a significant result.

### Ecological gait as a fall indicator in older adults: A systematic review [^112HCF7G]. The Gerontologist (2020). Low credibility.

Falls represent a major threat for elders, affecting their life quality and expectancy. Clinical tests and questionnaires have shown low diagnostic value with respect to fall risk. Modern sensor technology enables in-home gait assessments, allowing for the registration of ecological mobility in older adults. This technology potentially improves accuracy in determining fall risk. Thus, we studied the correlation between standardized assessments and ecological gait measures, comparing their ability to identify fall risk and predict prospective falls.

- **Research design and method**: A systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines.

- **Results**: From a total of 938 studies screened, nine articles with an observational study design were included. Evidence from selected works was subcategorized into (i) correlations between ecological and clinical measures, and comparative statistics of (ii) prospective fall prediction and (iii) fall risk identification. A significant number of correlations were observed between single ecological gait assessments and multiple clinical fall risk evaluations. Moreover, the combination of daily-life features and clinical test outcomes seemed to improve diagnostic accuracy in fall risk identification and fall prediction. However, the extent of this enhancement could not be fully understood due to the high variability in models' parameters.

- **Discussion and implications**: Evidence suggested that sensor-based ecological assessments of gait could boost diagnostic accuracy in identifying and predicting fall risk.

### Does concern about falling predict future falls in older adults? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113oReKf]. Age and Ageing (2025). Low credibility.

The grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation was conducted using the GRADE approach. The certainty of the evidence was assessed by two independent reviewers (L.M. and T.J.E.). The GRADE approach includes evaluation on the scales of high, moderate, low, and very low for prognostic factors and future outcomes.

- **Factors considered for downgrading evidence**: The evaluation considered several factors for potential downgrading:
	- Risk of bias
	- Inconsistency
	- Imprecision (e.g. whether 95% CIs overlap unity)
	- Indirectness
	- Publication bias

No upgrades were applied in this review. Since this was a prognostic review, the starting point was an assumption of high certainty evidence. Initial inter-rater agreement between reviewers was 85%, and any disagreements were resolved through consensus with a third neutral reviewer (J.V.).

### Identifying sensors-based parameters associated with fall risk in community-dwelling older adults: An investigation and interpretation of discriminatory parameters [^117LseDF]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). High credibility.

Falls pose a severe threat to the health of older adults worldwide. Determining gait and kinematic parameters related to an increased risk of falls is essential for developing effective intervention and fall prevention strategies. This study aimed to investigate discriminatory parameters, which lay an important basis for developing effective clinical screening tools for identifying high-fall-risk older adults.

- **Methods**: Forty-one individuals aged 65 years and above living in the community participated in this study. The older adults were classified as high-fall-risk and low-fall-risk individuals based on their BBS scores. The participants wore an inertial measurement unit (IMU) while conducting the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Simultaneously, a depth camera acquired images of the participants' movements during the experiment. After segmenting the data according to subtasks, 142 parameters were extracted from the sensor-based data. A t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was performed on the parameters for distinguishing older adults at high risk of falling. Logistic regression was used to further quantify the role of different parameters in identifying high-fall-risk individuals. Furthermore, we conducted an ablation experiment to explore the complementary information offered by the two sensors.

- **Results**: Fifteen participants were defined as high-fall-risk individuals, while twenty-six were defined as low-fall-risk individuals. Seventeen parameters were tested for significance with p-values less than 0.05. Some of these parameters, such as the usage of walking [incomplete section].

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the measurement properties of concerns-about-falling instruments in older people and people at increased risk of falls [^1141usdH]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

- **Strengths and limitations**: This study followed COSMIN methodology and employed a rigorous approach to evaluate the quality and certainty of the evidence. Methodological quality was assessed using the COSMIN Risk of Bias (RoB) Checklist, and the quality of each individual result was evaluated by applying COSMIN's criteria for good measurement properties. The evidence was summarized, and its certainty was graded using a modified GRADE system.

	- The study's limitation was that measurement properties were not investigated based on individual diseases or conditions, as there were insufficient data for meta-analysis. However, subgroup analysis was conducted by comparing measurement properties in generally healthy older people versus people with conditions that might affect mobility and balance, where possible. Additionally, the study could not include two studies in Farsi (Persian) due to the inability to secure high-quality translations.

### Fall risk stratification of community-living older people. Commentary on the world guidelines for fall prevention and management [^113525Wk]. Age and Ageing (2023). Low credibility.

The Task Force on Global Guidelines for Falls in Older Adults has put forward a fall risk stratification tool for community-dwelling older adults. This tool takes the form of a flowchart and is based on expert opinion and evidence. It divides the population into three risk categories and recommends specific preventive interventions or treatments for each category. In this commentary, we share our insights on the design, validation, usability, and potential impact of this fall risk stratification tool with the aim of guiding future research.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: A global initiative [^113aEsyA]. Age and Ageing (2022). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for falls in the elderly, specifically concerning risk prediction in cardiovascular assessment, the WFG 2022 guidelines recommend not obtaining further cardiovascular assessment in the absence of abnormalities on initial cardiovascular assessment unless syncope is suspected, such as described or witnessed syncope/pre-syncope or unexplained falls.

### Development and applicability of a risk assessment tool for hospital-acquired mobility impairment in ambulatory older adults [^112iVWz3]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). High credibility.

Mobility loss is common in hospitalized older adults, and resources to prevent mobility impairment are finite. Our goal was to use routinely collected data to develop a risk assessment tool that identifies individuals at risk of losing the ability to walk during hospitalization on the first hospital day. Furthermore, we determined if the tool could inform the use of mobility-preserving interventions.

- **Methods**: We included patients admitted to a general medical service, aged ≥ 65 years, who walked occasionally or frequently on admission (Braden Scale Activity subset ≥ 3). Patients were considered to have a new mobility impairment if, at discharge, their ability to walk was severely limited or nonexistent or they were confined to bed (Braden Scale Activity subset < 3). We used predictors available on the first hospital day to develop (2017–18 cohort) and validate (2019 cohort) a risk assessment tool. We determined the association between predicted risk and therapy use in the validation cohort to highlight the model's clinical utility.

- **Results**: A total of 5542 patients were included (median age 76 years, 48% women); 7.6% were discharged unable to walk. The model included five predictors: age, medication administrations, Glasgow Coma Scale verbal score, serum albumin, and urinary catheter presence. In the validation cohort, the model discriminated well (c-statistic 0.75) and was strongly associated with hospital-acquired mobility impairment (lowest decile 1%, highest decile 25%). In the validation cohort, therapy consultation ordering increased linearly with predicted risk; however, observation of this relationship was truncated.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^115aJ2aT]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

There are several tests available for assessing gait and balance impairment. For risk stratification, we recommend the use of gait speed with a cut-off value of 15 seconds, although evidence for fall risk stratification is mixed. There is evidence that the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test is predictive of falls in lower functioning adults.

An older adult without a history of falling, or with a single non-severe fall and no gait or balance problems, is deemed to be at low risk. Since low risk does not mean 'no risk at all', we recommend primary prevention for these older adults. This 'low risk' group should be reassessed annually. Older adults who have experienced a single non-severe fall and also have gait and/or balance problems should be considered at 'intermediate risk' and would benefit from a strength and balance exercise intervention, as evidence shows that this type of exercise effectively reduces falls risk.

Finally, those at 'high risk' include older adults with a fall and one or more of the following characteristics: (i) accompanying injury, (ii) multiple falls (≥ 2 falls) in the previous 12 months, (iii) known frailty, (iv) inability to get up after the fall without help for at least an hour, and (v) accompanied by (suspected) transient loss of consciousness. These high-risk older adults should be offered a multifactorial intervention approach.

### Risk prediction models for falls in hospitalized older patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117No2rN]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Existing fall risk assessment tools in clinical settings often lack accuracy. Although an increasing number of fall risk prediction models have been developed for hospitalized older patients in recent years, it remains unclear how useful these models are for clinical practice and future research.

- **Objectives**: To systematically review published studies of fall risk prediction models for hospitalized older adults.

- **Methods**: A search was performed of the Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Embase databases to retrieve studies of predictive models related to falls in hospitalized older adults from their inception until January 11, 2024. Data from included studies were extracted, covering study design, data sources, sample size, predictors, model development and performance, and more. Risk of bias and applicability were assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) checklist.

- **Results**: A total of 8,086 studies were retrieved, and after screening, 13 prediction models from 13 studies were included. Four models were externally validated. Eight models reported discrimination metrics, and two models reported calibration metrics. The most common predictors of falls were mobility, fall history, medications, and psychiatric disorders. All studies indicated a high risk of bias, primarily due to inadequate study design and methodological flaws. The AUC values of eight models ranged from 0.630 to 0.851.

- **Conclusions**: In the present study, all included studies had a high risk of bias, primarily due to the lack of prospective study design.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the measurement properties of concerns-about-falling instruments in older people and people at increased risk of falls [^115dJw3p]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

The 16-item Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) is widely used to assess concerns about falling. Variants include the 7-item Short FES-I, the 30-item Iconographical Falls Efficacy Scale (Icon FES), and the 10-item Short Icon FES. No comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis has been conducted to synthesize evidence regarding the measurement properties of these tools.

- **Objectives**: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the measurement properties of four FES-I variants.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were searched systematically, and articles were assessed for eligibility independently. The methodological quality of eligible studies was assessed using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) Risk of Bias checklist. The quality of measurement properties was assessed using COSMIN criteria for good measurement properties. Where possible, meta-analysis was conducted; otherwise, narrative synthesis was performed. Overall certainty of evidence was rated using a modified Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system approach.

- **Results**: The review included 58 studies investigating the measurement properties of the four instruments. There was high-quality evidence to support internal consistency, reliability, and construct validity of all instruments. Moderate- to high-certainty evidence suggests a one-factor structure of FES-I with two underlying dimensions, a one-factor structure of Short FES-I, and a two-factor structure of Icon FES.

### Falls in older adults: Risk assessment, management and prevention [^111BXNuW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Falls are a common and serious problem for older adults. This article reviews practical aspects of the evaluation and management of this disorder in the ambulatory setting. Older patients should be screened for falls or changes in mobility as part of their annual health maintenance examination. Most falls are due to multiple factors, including disorders of gait, balance, strength, and vision. Polypharmacy and certain medications contribute to falls in many patients and can be a remediable factor. Many falls can be prevented through individualized multicomponent interventions. Exercise programs, rehabilitation, medication management, and treatment of vitamin D deficiency are the most effective single interventions. Referral to a geriatrician should be considered for patients with other common geriatric syndromes, such as cognitive impairment, incontinence, or depression.

### Revealing the tension: The relationship between high fall risk categorization and low patient mobility [^1176oUsj]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). High credibility.

Using an inpatient fall risk assessment tool helps categorize patients into risk groups, which can then be targeted with fall prevention strategies. While potentially important in preventing patient injury, fall risk assessment may unintentionally lead to reduced mobility among hospitalized patients. Here we examined the relationship between fall risk assessment and ambulatory status among hospitalized patients.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutively admitted adult patients (n = 48,271) to a quaternary urban hospital that provides care for patients of broad socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds. Non-ambulatory status, the primary outcome, was defined as a median Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility < 6 (i.e. patient walks less than 10 steps) throughout hospitalization. The primary exposure variable was the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) category (Low, Moderate, High). The capacity to ambulate was assessed using the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC). Multivariable regression analysis controlled for clinical demographics, JHFRAT items, AM-PAC, comorbidity count, and length of stay.

- **Results**: 8% of patients at low risk for falls were non-ambulatory, compared to 25% and 54% of patients at moderate and high risk for falls, respectively. Patients categorized as high risk and moderate risk for falls were 4.6 (95% CI: 3.9–5.5) and 2.6 (95% CI: 2.4–2.9) times more likely to be non-ambulatory compared to patients categorized as low risk, respectively. For patients with high ambulatory potential (AM-PAC 18–2)

### A systematic review of fall prediction models for community-dwelling older adults: Comparison between models based on research cohorts and models based on routinely collected data [^114PxyJz]. Age and Ageing (2024). Low credibility.

Prediction models can identify fall-prone individuals. Prediction models can be based on either data from research cohorts (cohort-based) or routinely collected data (RCD-based). We review and compare cohort-based and RCD-based studies describing the development and/or validation of fall prediction models for community-dwelling older adults.

- **Methods**: Medline and Embase were searched via Ovid until January 2023. We included studies describing the development or validation of multivariable prediction models of falls in older adults (60+). Both risk of bias and reporting quality were assessed using the PROBAST and TRIPOD, respectively.

- **Results**: We included and reviewed 28 relevant studies, describing 30 prediction models (23 cohort-based and 7 RCD-based), and external validation of two existing models (one cohort-based and one RCD-based). The median sample sizes for cohort-based and RCD-based studies were 1,365 [interquartile range (IQR) 426–2,766] versus 90,441 (IQR 56,442–128,157), and the ranges of fall rates were 5.4% to 60.4% versus 1.6% to 13.1%, respectively. Discrimination performance was comparable between cohort-based and RCD-based models, with the respective area under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranging from 0.65 to 0.88 versus 0.71 to 0.81. The median number of predictors in cohort-based final models was 6 (IQR 5–11); for RCD-based models, it was 16 (IQR 11–26). All but one cohort-based model had high bias risks, primarily due to deficiencies in statistical analysis and outcome determination.

### Predicting the risk of falling: Efficacy of a risk assessment tool compared to nurses' judgement: A cluster-randomised controlled trial [^111fdpY6]. BMC Geriatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Older people living in nursing homes are at high risk of falling because of their general frailty and multiple pathologies. The prediction of falls might lead to an efficient allocation of preventive measures. Although several tools to assess the risk of falling have been developed, their impact on clinically relevant endpoints has never been investigated. The present study will evaluate the clinical efficacy and consequences of different fall risk assessment strategies.

- **Study design**: Cluster-randomised controlled trial with nursing home clusters randomized either to the use of a standard fall risk assessment tool alongside nurses' clinical judgment or to nurses' clinical judgment alone. Standard care of all clusters will be optimized by structured education on best evidence strategies to prevent falls and fall-related injuries. Fifty-four nursing home clusters, including 1,080 residents, will be recruited. Residents must be ≥ 70 years, not bedridden, and living in the nursing home for more than three months. The primary endpoint is the number of participants with at least one fall at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures are the number of falls and clinical consequences, including side effects of the two risk assessment strategies. Other measures are fall-related injuries, hospital admissions and consultations with a physician, and costs.

### Fall risk stratification in older adults: Low and not-at-risk status still associated with falls and injuries [^116boXJY]. Age and Ageing (2025). High credibility.

**Key points**: Forty-one percent of those screened 'not-at-risk' had a fall during the follow-up period, and 63% of them sustained injuries. Being screened as 'not-at-risk' for falls does not mean no risk at all. Assessing gait speed universally — in all older adults screened — can detect those at-risk of injurious falls. Individuals classified as 'not-at-risk' who walk slower than 1 m/s experienced double the risk of injuries, and they could benefit from primary prevention, including falls prevention exercises.

### Predicting falls in older adults: an umbrella review of instruments assessing gait, balance, and functional mobility [^1169ccNn]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Three reviewers (KR, DBJ, GO) extracted the data using a pre-defined data extraction form developed specifically for this review. The following data were extracted:

- **Review details**: Authors, year of publication, country of lead author, type of participants, review objective, number of participants, age range of participants, mean age of participants, proportion of women.

- **Search details**: Sources searched, type of analysis (narrative review, systematic review without meta-analysis, or systematic review with meta-analysis), number of studies included, design of included studies, countries of conducted studies.

- **Critical appraisal**: Date range of included studies, critical appraisal tool(s) used, critical appraisal score.

- **Gait, balance, and functional mobility tests assessed**: Fall prediction outcome, measurement of falls, predictive ability, reliability, validity (specificity and sensitivity).

- **Cost analysis**: Any cost analysis conducted was noted.

Three reviewers (KR, DBJ, GO) assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews (ROBIS), which assesses four domains:

1. Study eligibility criteria
2. Identification and selection of studies
3. Data collection and study appraisal
4. Synthesis and findings

To provide key clinical and research recommendations on assessment tools for fall prevention, the findings were synthesized for the most commonly reported gait, balance, and functional mobility assessments.

### Population-based interventions for preventing falls and fall-related injuries in older people [^113E3621]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

We prepared summary of findings tables for each category of interventions and included data from RCTs and non-randomised trials in separate tables. We presented summary of findings tables for:

- **Medication or nutrition interventions**: Evidence derived from RCTs.
- **Multicomponent interventions**: Evidence derived from RCTs and multicomponent interventions with evidence derived from non-randomised trials.

In cases where robust data were available from more than one study for these categories, we described the intervention components in the footnotes of the summary of findings tables. Some studies reported outcomes using measures that did not precisely meet our outcome criteria (e.g. rate of events rather than the number of people experiencing one or more events). While we reported these data in the Effects of Interventions section for completeness, we did not include these data in the summary of findings tables. Similarly, if studies reported a breakdown of data according to subgroups (such as participant age) in addition to the overall group, we included these data in the Effects of Interventions section but not the summary of findings tables.

We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence as it relates to the primary and secondary outcomes listed in Types of Outcome Measures (Schünemann 2020). The rating of high certainty is reserved for a body of evidence based on RCTs. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to moderate, low, or very low depending on the presence and extent of certain factors.

### Predicting falls in older adults: An umbrella review of instruments assessing gait, balance, and functional mobility [^1153Juyq]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

To review the validated instruments that assess gait, balance, and functional mobility to predict falls in older adults across different settings.

- **Methods**: Umbrella review of narrative and systematic reviews, with or without meta-analyses, of all study types. Reviews that focused on older adults in any settings and included validated instruments assessing gait, balance, and functional mobility were included. Medical and allied health professional databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, and Cochrane) were searched from inception to April 2022. Two reviewers independently undertook title, abstract, and full-text screening. Review quality was assessed through the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews (ROBIS). Data extraction was completed in duplicate using a standardized spreadsheet, and a narrative synthesis was presented for each assessment tool.

- **Results**: Among 2,736 articles initially identified, 31 reviews were included; 11 were meta-analyses. Reviews were primarily of low quality, thus at high risk of potential bias. The most frequently reported assessments were Timed Up and Go, Berg Balance Scale, gait speed, dual-task assessments, single-leg stance, Functional Reach Test, tandem gait and stance, and the chair stand test. Findings on the predictive ability of these tests were inconsistent across the reviews.

- **Conclusions**: We found that no single gait, balance, or functional mobility assessment in isolation can be used to predict fall risk in older adults with high certainty. Moderate evidence suggests gait speed can be useful in predicting fall risk.

### How accurate are geriatricians' fall predictions [^115p15ns]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Worldwide, the percentage of persons over the age of 60 years is growing faster than any other age group, and fall-related injuries are a major source of morbidity and mortality for older adults, accounting for 40% of all injury-related deaths. In 2018 in the United States, 27.5% of adults 65 years of age and older reported at least one fall in the previous year, and 10.2% reported at least one fall-related injury. Health care spending on older adult falls in the U.S. is estimated to be $50 billion per year.

While falls are highly prevalent in older adults, they also represent a preventable source of morbidity, mortality, and cost to the health care system. If older adult fallers can be identified prior to an injurious fall, multifactorial risk factor assessment and intervention may prevent falls. However, over 100 fall risk assessment tools have been developed and published without a clear "gold standard" emerging. Given their clinical training, which includes fall risk assessment, geriatricians may be anticipated to possess a high degree of accuracy for predicting fall risk in older adults. However, there is a paucity of data to either support or refute this assertion, and a search of the medical literature reveals no publications directly comparing geriatricians' clinical gestalt for fall risk with more objective screening tools. The purpose of this study is to compare the geriatricians' predictions of faller/non-faller to (a) comprehensive assessment by a single examining geriatrician reference standard and (b) participant falls reported at 6–12 months after.

### Everyday experiences of physical function and awareness of fall risk in older adulthood [^111PQpv1]. Innovation in Aging (2023). Low credibility.

Falls are the leading cause of death and disability among older adults, occurring when the demands of daily activities surpass the ability to maintain balance. An estimated 30% of older adults misestimate their physical function, placing them at greater risk of falling. This study examined how experiences of physical function are linked to awareness of fall risk in daily life.

For 30 consecutive days following a fall-risk assessment, 41 older adults (observations = 1,135; 56% women; age: 65–91) self-assessed objective and subjective fall risk using a custom smartphone application. Alignment of objective and subjective fall risk was indexed as awareness of fall risk. Postural sway was measured by the application. Physical and mobility symptoms and fear of falling were reported daily.

At baseline, 49% of participants misestimated their fall risk. Awareness of fall risk varied from day to day, and fall risk was misestimated on 40% of days. Multilevel multinomial models showed individual differences in the level of daily symptoms increase the tendency to misestimate fall risk. Daily symptoms and fear of falling increased awareness of high fall risk, but daily symptoms threatened awareness of low fall risk.

Findings suggest that misestimation of fall risk is common in older adulthood and informed by appraisals of physical function. Fall prevention strategies could support older adults in understanding their everyday physical function and provide tools to adjust.

### Older persons' experiences with wearable sensor-based fall risk screening in free-living conditions - a qualitative study [^112hhv2J]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Various methods have been used to identify older persons at risk of falling. Commonly, both self-reported and performance measures for fall risk assessment are used. Subjective measures (i.e. self-reported), such as question-based tools, can be used by either older persons or healthcare personnel. In a study by Frisendahl et al, older persons found the use of a question-based screening tool for fall risk in clinical settings to be meaningful, as it increased their awareness of their own abilities. The older persons felt motivated to prevent falls, but a low fall risk could create a false sense of security.

However, the predictive value of question-based tools for fall risk assessment has been questioned, and it is recommended that healthcare personnel use the tools with caution due to their limitations in identifying persons at risk. Alternative methods to measure fall risk include objective measures (i.e. performance), including physical tests of gait and balance, and functional mobility assessment. However, the predictive ability of the most used objective measures for fall risk assessment in community-dwelling older persons is inconsistent, as no single physical test to assess objective measures can be used alone to predict falls in community-dwelling older persons. These findings point to the need for alternative methods for assessing fall risks among older persons more accurately.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: A global initiative [^114Z5xZR]. Age and Ageing (2022). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for falls in the elderly, more specifically with respect to risk prediction, the WFG 2022 guidelines recommend viewing adult patients sustaining an injury requiring medical (including surgical) treatment, reporting two or more falls in the previous 12 months, with a history of lying on the floor unable to rise independently for at least one hour, deemed frail, or suspected to have experienced a transient loss of consciousness as at high risk of future falls.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the measurement properties of concerns-about-falling instruments in older people and people at increased risk of falls [^115pa7uz]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

This comprehensive systematic review addresses the measurement properties of Falls Efficacy Scale International variants, which has been lacking until now. The review includes 58 studies examining reliability, validity, responsiveness, feasibility, and/or interpretability of four tools. There is evidence supporting excellent measurement properties for all four instruments. We recommend the use of these tools with healthy older adults and individuals at risk of falls, particularly in conditions that might affect mobility or balance. These findings have contributed to the development of the World Guidelines for Falls Prevention in Older Adults.

### Predicting falls in older adults: An umbrella review of instruments assessing gait, balance, and functional mobility [^11424Yx9]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). High credibility.

To the authors' knowledge, this is the first umbrella review examining gait, balance, and functional mobility assessments in the prediction of falls for older adults. Further strengths of this umbrella review included following PRISMA reporting guidelines, conducting a comprehensive search for evidence with the support of a research librarian, clearly stating the objectives beforehand, and ensuring transparency with the published protocol. Furthermore, the selection of the included studies was performed in duplicate, with a third reviewer resolving any conflicts. The reviewers assessed the quality of the included studies in pairs, using a quality assessment tool designed specifically to assess the risk of bias in systematic reviews, and differences were discussed and resolved between reviewers.

However, this umbrella review has some limitations. The included studies were too heterogeneous to allow for direct comparison of results in a unified meta-analysis. In addition, studies involved both prospectively and retrospectively reported falls, which might have contributed to some of the heterogeneity. Also, many of the included review studies were considered to have a high or unclear risk of bias with a lack of clear reporting. This limited the data that could be extracted and synthesized. The differences in the included studies were not statistically assessed, following advice from a statistician that it was not possible to do so due to heterogeneity between studies. We excluded review papers that were not available in English due to resource limitations.

### Are triage questions sufficient to assign fall risk precautions in the ED [^111heNfW]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The American College of Emergency Physicians Geriatric Emergency Department (ED) Guidelines and the Centers for Disease Control recommend that older adults be assessed for fall risk. The standard ED assessment involves a verbal query of fall risk factors, which may be inadequate. We hypothesized that adding a functional balance test, endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control Stop Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries Falls Prevention Guidelines, the 4-Stage Balance Test (4SBT), would improve the detection of patients at risk for falls.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective pilot study involving a convenience sample of ambulatory adults aged 65 years and older in the ED. All participants received the standard nursing triage fall risk assessment. After stabilization in their ED room, the 4SBT was administered.

- **Results**: Among the 58 participants, the average age was 74.1 years (range 65–94), with 40.0% being women, and 98% were community dwelling. Five participants (8.6%) presented to the ED with a fall-related chief complaint. The nursing triage screen identified 39.7% (n = 23) as at risk for falls, whereas the 4SBT identified 43% (n = 25). Combining triage questions with the 4SBT identified 60.3% (n = 35) as at high risk for falls, compared with 39.7% (n = 23) using triage questions alone (p < 0.01). Ten patients (17%) at high risk by 4SBT, not identified by triage questions, were unaware that they were at risk for falls (new diagnoses).

- **Conclusions**: Incorporating a quick functional test of balance into the ED assessment for fall risk is feasible and significantly increases the detection of patients at risk for falls.

### Novel sensing technology in fall risk assessment in older adults: a systematic review [^113XpNW4]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, a wide range of sensor technologies have been utilized in fall risk assessment in older adults. Overall, these devices have the potential to provide an accurate, inexpensive, and easy-to-administer, objective fall risk assessment. However, the variation in measured parameters, assessment tools, sensor sites, movement tasks, and modeling techniques precludes a firm conclusion on their ability to predict future falls.

There is potential that these assessments can be undertaken regularly both in clinical and non-clinical settings. To generate clinically meaningful and easy-to-interpret information, proper sensor-based predictors need to be identified. Additionally, a gap between clinical functionality and user experience remains.

### Everyday experiences of physical function and awareness of fall risk in older adulthood [^112pHnk7]. Innovation in Aging (2023). Low credibility.

Accurate awareness of fall risk, the primary study outcome, was conceptualized as the alignment of subjective and objective functional capacity above and below the established fall-risk cutoffs. When objective fall risk was low, awareness of fall risk was indexed as aware of low risk (Q1) or underconfident (Q2), when aligned or misaligned with subjective fall risk, respectively. When objective fall risk was high, awareness of fall risk was indexed as aware of high risk (Q3) or overconfident (Q4), when aligned or misaligned with subjective fall risk, respectively.

Subjective fall risk was assessed at baseline and daily during the study using the validated activity-specific balance confidence scale (ABC). The ABC scale is correlated and exchangeable with the Falls-Efficacy Scale and was chosen to minimize the risk of priming participants to consider fear of falling while completing study tasks. The scale was modified for daily assessment. Participants indicated their confidence in maintaining balance while completing common activities today (e.g. "bend over and pick up a slipper from the front of a closet floor" or "stand on a chair and reach for something") by typing a number between 0 and 100 in the text box. Items were averaged to create a balance confidence score at baseline and for each day in the study, with higher values indicating greater confidence. Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.94 to 0.97 during the study period, indicating high interitem reliability. Baseline and daily scores below 67 indicated low balance confidence and high subjective fall risk.

### Translation, validity and reliability of the fall risk scale for older adults [^114mCeZX]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). High credibility.

A fall is defined as inadvertently falling onto the floor or another lower level, excluding intentional change of position to lean on furniture, walls, or other objects. Falls commonly occur in community-dwelling older adults (OA), as well as in patients with various levels of disability. It is considered a common public health problem among OAs in various regions of the world.

In recent years, several studies have highlighted falls as a common and serious threat to the health and functional independence of OAs, causing psychological distress, inability to participate in activities of daily living, brain injury, internal organ damage, fractures, loss of independence, and even death.

Each year, it is estimated that 30–40% of patients over the age of 65 will fall at least once. The risk of falls increases with age. Therefore, falls prevention among older adults has become one of the priority public health issues in our rapidly aging society.

In Chile, the population aged 65 years and older for the year 2019 was projected to be 2,260,222 people, corresponding to 11.9% of the Chilean population. Chile is considered one of the countries in the region whose demographic aging process has been more accelerated compared to its neighbors in South America.

Consequently, due to the accelerated aging process Chile has been undergoing in recent years, there is a clear need for methods to assess the risk of falls in the OA population. In fact, as far as is known, there are a variety of instruments available.

### Is independence of older adults safe considering the risk of falls [^114VmqjF]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Falls affect approximately 30% of the elderly population each year, leading to major injuries and reduced independence in older adults' functioning. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the degree of independence and identify fall risk factors in the study group.

- **Methods**: The study included 506 older adults recruited from GP clinics and two senior centers. The study duration was 12 months. Our study tools included the EASY-Care Standard 2010 questionnaire, Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS), Index Barthel, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADL), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and Timed Up and Go (TUG) test.

- **Results**: The study comprised 357 (70.6%) female and 149 (29.4%) male subjects, with a mean age of 75.7 years ± 8.0. Most subjects were independent in both basic (Index Barthel) and instrumental (IADL) activities. Gait fluency, evaluated on the TUG scale, found slow and unsteady gait in 33.7% of the subjects. Additionally, 27.5% used mobility aids when walking. In the Risk of Falls scale, 131 subjects (25.89%) were at risk. Logistic regression identified the main fall risk determinants (p < 0.05) as age, previous falls, foot problems, lack of regular care, impaired vision, urinary incontinence, pain, sleeping disorders, and lowered mood.

- **Conclusions**: Risk of falls increases in individuals less independent in basic and complex life activities and those with depression. Most risk factors are modifiable, highlighting the necessity for intervention.

### Validation and inter-rater reliability of a three item falls risk screening tool [^116pb6PZ]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Falls are one of the most common adverse events that occur during hospitalization. They can result in injury, increased morbidity, longer hospital stays, and higher healthcare costs. It is estimated that the incidence is between 3 and 13 falls per 1000 bed days, with approximately one in three people who fall in hospital sustaining an injury. A recent study showed that people who fell in hospital had a longer length of stay of around 4 days, and the presence of an injury further increased the length of stay by an additional 4 days.

Over recent years, there has been an increasing emphasis on reducing falls in hospital. This emphasis is reflected in the accreditation standards for Australian hospitals (National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards), which include 'Preventing falls and harm from falls' as one of the ten Accreditation Standards. One requirement of the standard is that patients are screened for risk of a fall. While several tools have been developed, it is important to validate the tool in the setting in which it will be used.

Austin Health is a large tertiary hospital with approximately 980 beds, providing acute and subacute care over three campuses. To assist compliance with accreditation guidelines, a system for falls risk screening that could be implemented across the health service was required. As nursing staff complete a number of assessments on admission, the falls screening tool needed to be completed quickly, maximizing compliance and minimizing documentation burden.

### Population-based interventions for preventing falls and fall-related injuries in older people [^111TvHb3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Falls represent a global public health concern, with nearly 700,000 accidental deaths globally every year, and they are the second-leading cause of mortality due to unintentional injury, following road traffic injuries. People aged 60 years and older account for the majority of fall-related mortality cases. There is no universally agreed-upon age cut-off to determine older people; generally, a cut-off of 60 years and older or 65 years and older is used.

A fall can be defined as "an unexpected event in which the participant comes to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level". Physiological, cognitive, and environmental risk factors contribute to an increased risk of falls and fall-related injuries in older people. These risk factors include:

- **Socio-demographic factors**: Such as age and sex.
- **Psychological factors**: Including cognitive impairment, depression, and concerns about falling.
- **Medical conditions**: Covering multiple comorbidities, Parkinson's disease, stroke, etc.
- **Medication use**: Considering the total number and types of medication, such as antiepileptics, sedatives, and antihypertensive drugs.
- **Mobility and sensory issues**: Including history of falls, use of walking aids, gait problems, disability, vision or hearing impairment, and physical inactivity.

Cognitive risk factors are related to deficits in executive function, such as slower processing speed and reaction times. Environmental factors comprise poor footwear, inadequate lighting, and uneven surfaces.

### Novel sensing technology in fall risk assessment in older adults: A systematic review [^114pv2Uo]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

This systematic review examined the existing evidence from 2011 to 2017 regarding sensor technology used in assessing fall risk in older adults. By measuring movement during selected structured activities such as walking, stepping, sit-to-stand, stand-to-sit, and standardized tests like TUG and BBS, the sensing technology has proven to be a viable assessment tool for fall risk. Overall, these devices provide an accurate, inexpensive, and easily administered objective fall risk assessment.

Over half of the reviewed papers utilized retrospective fall history and/or clinical assessment tools as the standard for identifying individuals at high risk for falls. However, despite their widespread use, clinical assessment tools such as TUG, Tinetti, and BBS do not achieve 100% diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, retrospective fall recall may lack reliability due to patients' poor recollection. A history of falling can also lead to gait pattern changes due to injury or fear of falling. Therefore, prospective fall occurrence tracking should be employed in future fall risk assessment research, with a follow-up period of at least six months after the initial assessment.

### Mobility screening for fall prediction in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA): Implications for fall prevention in the decade of healthy ageing [^114u5Tmz]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is one of the only population-based studies to examine the predictive accuracy of commonly used mobility screening tests for fall risk assessment in community-dwelling older adults, and the first to consider stratification by age and sex. Our study makes several important contributions:

- **Common mobility test accuracy**: Commonly used mobility tests do not appear to have sufficient accuracy for identifying community-living older adults at risk for just one fall.
- **Role in multiple fall risk identification**: Mobility screening, alongside other fall risk factors, may have a role in identifying older adults at risk for multiple falls.
- **Variation by age and sex**: The predictive accuracy and optimal cut-off values of mobility screening tests for identifying fallers vary by age and sex.

These findings have valuable implications for best practices in fall prevention among community-dwelling older adults.

An abundance of evidence has shown that falls can be prevented by 25%–40%, amounting to billions of dollars in potential savings. Given that most falls result from a loss of balance while walking and that poor balance is a leading risk factor for falls, mobility testing is consistently recommended to identify older persons at risk of falls who require further assessment and intervention. Our findings suggest that existing mobility screening tests used for this purpose may lack sufficient predictive accuracy to identify older adults at risk for one or more falls, even when applied to individuals that meet first-level screening criteria (i.e. those with a history of a fall or self-reported mobility problem).

### Multifactorial and functional mobility assessment tools for fall risk among older adults in community, home-support, long-term and acute care settings [^113KeErk]. Age and Ageing (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review of published studies that test the validity and reliability of fall-risk assessment tools for use among older adults in community, home-support, long-term, and acute care settings.

- **Methods**: Searches were conducted using EbscoHost and MEDLINE for published studies in the English language between January 1980 and July 2004. The primary or secondary purpose of these studies was to test the predictive value of one or more fall assessment tools on a population primarily aged 65 years and older. The primary outcome of the tools had to be falls, fall-related injury, or gait/balance. Only studies that used prospective validation were considered.

- **Findings**: Thirty-four articles testing 38 different tools met the inclusion criteria. The community setting had the largest number of studies (14) and tools (23) tested, followed by acute care (12 studies and 8 tools), long-term care (LTC) (6 studies and 10 tools), and home-support (4 studies and 4 tools). Eleven of the 38 tools are multifactorial assessment tools (MAT) that cover a wide range of fall-risk factors, and 27 are functional mobility assessment tools (FMA) involving measures of physical activity related to gait, strength, or balance.

- **Conclusion**: Fall-risk assessment tools exist that show moderate to good validity and reliability in most health service delivery areas. However, few tools were tested more than once or in multiple settings, and therefore, no single tool can be recommended for implementation in all settings or for all subpopulations within each setting.

### Association of longitudinal mobility levels in the hospital and injurious inpatient falls [^114G2Rb1]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2024). Low credibility.

Falls are one of the most common adverse events in hospitals, and patient mobility is a key risk factor. In hospitals, risk assessment tools are used to identify patient-centered fall risk factors and guide care plans, but these tools have limitations. To address these issues, we examined daily patient mobility levels before injurious falls using the Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility, which quantifies key patient mobility milestones from low-level to community distances of walking. We aimed to identify longitudinal characteristics of patient mobility before a fall to help identify fallers before the event.

Conducting a retrospective matched case-control analysis, we compared mobility levels in the days leading up to an injurious fall between fallers and nonfallers. We observed that patients who experienced an injurious fall, on average, spent 28% of their time prefall at a low mobility level (Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility levels 1–4), compared with nonfallers who spent 19% of their time at a low mobility level (mean absolute difference, 9%; 95% confidence interval, 1%-16%; P = 0.026; relative difference, 44%). This suggests that assessing a patient's mobility levels over time can help identify those at an increased risk for falls and enable hospitals to manage mobility problems more effectively.

### Fall risk stratification of community-living older people. Commentary on the world guidelines for fall prevention and management [^114wjHS9]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

The potential impact of fall risk models on healthcare systems largely depends on the proportion of individuals across risk categories. Thus, simulation studies should estimate the proportion of individuals assigned to each category using the GGF algorithm. These simulations should also consider the effect of opportunistic time scheduling, given the variability of healthcare visits among individuals with different levels of fall risk. Furthermore, we suggest that a risk model producing a continuous risk score, in combination with flexible thresholds, would make it easier to adjust the implementation of the GGF recommendations according to local context and resources.

Finally, the clinical effectiveness of the GGF risk stratification tool, like all screening tools, relies on the efficacy of the recommendations for preventive intervention or treatment. In hospital settings, it was found that fall risk stratification tools were not effective in reducing fall rates, besides taking considerable time to administer. At the time of writing, much of the research on artificial intelligence-based fall risk prediction models has focused on accurately predicting falls without providing any link to fall prevention interventions or treatments. The new GGF further underscores the growing importance of shifting the research focus towards the development of complete clinical decision support systems for fall prevention and treatment, combining prediction with recommendations on effective and targeted interventions.

### The role of medical assessment and intervention in the prevention of falls [^1154hkJV]. Age and Ageing (2006). Low credibility.

Evidence that falls amongst older people can be prevented now requires researchers and policymakers to elucidate the most comprehensive and cost-effective approach to implementation. The syndrome of falls and fractures in later life reflects the combined age-associated influences of cumulative susceptibility to health problems and reduced adaptive reserve. The major contribution of health factors to falling has long been recognized clinically and has also emerged clearly in epidemiological studies of risk.

A fall in an older adult, especially if recurrent, may be a key signal of unmet medical need and should accordingly trigger an in-depth diagnostic process and clinical intervention by an appropriately skilled physician. Although well-designed controlled studies specifying this approach as part of a multifactorial intervention are comparatively few, recent published trials have confirmed the anticipated substantial returns in fall prevention achieved for community-dwelling patients with a history of falling. Larger-scale studies are now required, and further research is needed to achieve effective prevention strategies in institutional care.

Combined calcium and vitamin D may act via neuromuscular and skeletal mechanisms in fracture prevention. The requirement for medical assessment has now appropriately been incorporated into national and international guidelines.

### Fall risk stratification of community-living older people. Commentary on the world guidelines for fall prevention and management [^112GrYC8]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

- **Key points**: We comment on the fall risk stratification tool for community-dwelling older adults of the Global Guidelines for Falls (GGF). The GGF is a highly needed standardized risk stratification tool that combines evidence-based and expert-based recommendations. Additional validation is warranted to evaluate the accuracy, impact, and clinical effectiveness of the tool. Stratifying in three categories is straightforward. A continuous risk score could better adapt to local context and resources. Multifactorial fall risk prediction models could have better accuracy, although their usability requires further research.

We read with interest the recommendations for fall prevention and management proposed by the Task Force on Global Guidelines for Falls in Older Adults (GGF) and the tool proposed for fall risk stratification. As a group of researchers focused on fall risk in older adults, and as members of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Focus Group on 'Artificial Intelligence for Health', we would like to offer our perspective on the design, validation, usability, and potential impact of this tool, and provide suggestions on future directions for the field. The GGF algorithm is a flowchart that includes two entry points, three output risk categories, and three binary split nodes at the center. The first entry point relates to individuals having an annual health visit or an update to their health record, while the second relates to those presenting to healthcare services subsequent to a fall.

### Exploration of the association between quality of life, assessed by the EQ-5D and ICECAP-O, and falls risk, cognitive function and daily function, in older adults with mobility impairments [^1169kBSC]. BMC Geriatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important construct for healthy aging; it describes an individual's overall health status. Previous studies have demonstrated significant associations between self-efficacy, mobility, cognition, and HRQoL. Specifically, HRQoL is highly associated with mobility impairments and cognitive status in older adults. Critically, functional abilities such as walking are associated with changes in both physical and mental HRQoL.

Impaired mobility is also significantly associated with quality of life (QoL) — a construct that is distinct from HRQoL in that it captures gains or losses to an individual's QoL beyond considering health alone. Specifically, older adults with impaired mobility experience a multitude of consequences beyond health including loss of independence and social isolation. Thus, evidence strongly suggests older adults with impaired mobility are at significant risk for decline in both HRQoL and QoL. Further, QoL is associated with cognitive status in older adults.

One key question remains unanswered: Are we adequately assessing HRQoL and QoL among older adults with mobility impairments? To address this question, we first need to ascertain the association between falls risk, cognitive function, general balance, and mobility, and health-related quality of life and quality of life among older adults with mobility impairments.

Two examples of feasible measures as relevant tools for this population of older adults that evaluate HRQoL and QoL, respectively, include the EQ-5D and the ICECAP-O.

### Fall-risk evaluation and management: Challenges in adopting geriatric care practices [^113RvXWu]. The Gerontologist (2006). Low credibility.

One third of older adults fall each year, placing them at risk for serious injury, functional decline, and health care utilization. Despite the availability of effective preventive approaches, policy and clinical efforts at preventing falls among older adults have been limited. In this article, we present the burden of falls, review evidence concerning the effectiveness of fall-prevention services, describe barriers for clinicians and for payers in promoting these services, and suggest strategies to encourage greater use of these services. The challenges are substantial, but strategies for incremental change are available while more broad-based changes in health care financing and clinical practice evolve to better manage the multiple chronic health conditions, including falls, experienced by older Americans.

In the classification and risk stratification for falls in the elderly, particularly concerning risk prediction and general principles, the WFG 2022 guidelines recommend inquiring about the goals and priorities, attitudes toward activities, independence, and risk. Additionally, assessing willingness and capability is essential as part of a multifactorial falls risk assessment in older adults to inform decision-making on potential interventions.

### Risk prediction models for falls in hospitalized older patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Ymuwb]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Existing fall risk assessment tools in clinical settings often lack accuracy. Although an increasing number of fall risk prediction models have been developed for hospitalized older patients in recent years, it remains unclear how useful these models are for clinical practice and future research.

- **Objectives**: To systematically review published studies of fall risk prediction models for hospitalized older adults.

- **Methods**: A search was performed of the Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Embase databases to retrieve studies of predictive models related to falls in hospitalized older adults from their inception until January 11, 2024. Data were extracted from included studies, covering study design, data sources, sample size, predictors, model development and performance, among others. Risk of bias and applicability were assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) checklist.

- **Results**: A total of 8086 studies were retrieved, and after screening, 13 prediction models from 13 studies were included. Four models were externally validated. Eight models reported discrimination metrics and two models reported calibration metrics. The most common predictors of falls were mobility, fall history, medications, and psychiatric disorders. All studies indicated a high risk of bias, primarily due to inadequate study design and methodological flaws. The AUC values of eight models ranged from 0.630 to 0.851.

- **Conclusions**: In the present study, all included studies had a high risk of bias, primarily due to the lack of prospective study designs and methodological flaws.

Falls in hospitals

- **Risk stratification and assessment**: Conditional recommendation. Perform a multifactorial falls risk assessment in all hospitalized older adults over 65 years of age. We recommend against using scored falls risk screening tools in hospitals for multifactorial falls risk assessment in older adults (Appendix 2, available in Age and Ageing online). GRADE: 2B.

- **Concerns about falling**: Strong recommendation. We recommend using the FES-I or especially the Short FES-I for assessing concerns about falling in acute care hospitals. GRADE: 1B.

- **Post-fall assessment**: Expert recommendation. We recommend conducting a post-fall assessment in hospitalized older adults following a fall in order to identify the mechanism of the fall, any resulting injuries, any precipitating factors (such as new illness, complications, or delirium), to reassess the individual's fall risk factors, and adjust the intervention strategy accordingly. GRADE: E.

- **Recommendation details and justification**: Falls risk screening tools and multifactorial falls risk assessments are sometimes used interchangeably, but there are substantial differences. There is a case for dis-investing from fall risk screening tool scoring in the hospital setting as it does not reduce falls and takes valuable time. Falls risk assessment is a more detailed process used to identify underlying risk factors and inform the development of a care plan to reduce falls and injuries. Falls risk assessments should be reviewed if there is a change in an individual's condition or if the older adult falls.

### How accurate are geriatricians' fall predictions [^113DEcq1]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Older patients are at increased risk of falling, which can lead to serious morbidity and mortality from falls. Accurately identifying older patients at increased fall risk allows for the implementation of interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality. Geriatricians are trained to assess for fall risk in older patients. If geriatricians can accurately predict fallers — as opposed to merely evaluating individual risk factors — a more aggressive and earlier intervention strategy could be employed to reduce falls among older adults. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the accuracy of geriatricians' fall risk predictions. This study aims to determine the accuracy of geriatricians in predicting falls.

- **Methods**: Between October 2018 and November 2019, a convenience sample of 100 subjects was recruited from an academic geriatric clinic population seeking routine medical care. Subjects performed a series of gait and balance assessments, completed the Stay Independent Brochure, and were surveyed about fall incidence 6–12 months after study entry. Five geriatricians, blinded to subjects and fall outcomes, were provided the subjects' data and asked to categorize each as a faller or non-faller. No requirements were imposed on the geriatricians' use of the available data. These predictions were compared to those of an examining geriatrician who performed the assessments and the fall outcomes reported by subjects.

- **Results**: Kappa values for the 5 geriatricians who used all available data to classify participants as fallers or non-fallers were compared.

Regarding specific circumstances for falls in the elderly, particularly concerning patients with Parkinson's disease, the World Fall Guidelines (WFG) 2022 recommend obtaining a falls risk assessment. This assessment should include a self-report 3-risk factor tool, which comprises a history of falls in the previous year, episodes of freezing of gait in the past month, and slow gait speed, specifically for older patients with Parkinson's disease.
