## Question

What are the acute risks associated with severe hypercalcemia in a patient with sarcoid kidney disease? The hypercalcemia has been recurrent, improves with treatment, then recurs. Calcium is 15; 2 months ago it was 9.5; 5 months ago it was 12 (hospitalized and treated). He is asymptomatic. What symptoms would be expected? What are the acute risks of untreated hypercalcemia?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what symptoms to expect, what the acute risks of untreated severe hypercalcemia are in an asymptomatic patient with sarcoidosis and a recurrent severe hypercalcemia of 15 mg/dL, and how sarcoid kidney disease modifies urgency and therapy, along with immediate treatment priorities. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming severity and the biochemical mechanism in sarcoidosis. Then, I should verify expected clinical manifestations at this calcium level, even if the patient currently feels well. Next, I will assess the short-term risks, especially renal, cardiac, and neurologic decompensation. After that, I need to consider how coexisting sarcoid kidney involvement changes prognosis and thresholds for dialysis. Finally, I will outline immediate evidence-based management steps, including fluids, calcitonin, antiresorptives, corticosteroids, monitoring, and indications for urgent hemodialysis, making sure I check for any nuances like albumin correction, ionized calcium, and electrolyte co-derangements along the way [^1134KfPY] [^116KxB7p].

> Let me first confirm the severity categorization and measurement issues. A total serum calcium of 15 mg/dL is unequivocally severe hypercalcemia, commonly associated with neurologic and renal dysfunction even before overt symptoms appear; I should also correct total calcium for albumin and, ideally, check ionized calcium because albumin shifts and acid-base status can mislead the total estimate, particularly during rehydration; this is standard in hypercalcemia assessments and is explicitly emphasized in regulatory and clinical guidance [^1116XWrr] [^111h89Hk] [^1113AxgX].

> Next, I need to verify the mechanism in sarcoidosis. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — while malignancy and primary hyperparathyroidism cause most cases, sarcoidosis classically causes non–PTH-mediated hypercalcemia via macrophage/granuloma overexpression of 1-α hydroxylase leading to excess calcitriol, which increases intestinal calcium (and phosphate) absorption and bone resorption; this often suppresses PTH and can be protracted or recurrent if granulomatous activity is ongoing, aligning with the patient's trajectory of relapse despite prior treatment [^117UQjw1] [^1134KfPY] [^1125vNMf].

> I will now examine expected clinical manifestations at this level. Even if asymptomatic at presentation, calcium ≥ 12 mg/dL typically causes fatigue, weakness, cognitive clouding, and with levels around 15 mg/dL, risk escalates for confusion, delirium, seizures, and coma; renal concentrating defects drive polyuria and dehydration, and ECG changes with QT shortening increase arrhythmia risk while potentiating digitalis toxicity; recognizing these patterns early is critical to preempt deterioration [^1113AxgX] [^111p9nHq] [^114MpTx8].

> Wait, let me verify renal and electrolyte implications specifically. Severe hypercalcemia induces nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with polyuria and volume depletion, lowers GFR via afferent vasoconstriction, and promotes nephrocalcinosis; kaliuresis and magnesiuresis are common with diuresis. I need to check phosphate carefully: in calcitriol-mediated sarcoidosis, phosphate is often high due to increased intestinal absorption and renal tubular reabsorption, so hyperphosphatemia rather than hypophosphatemia may be seen, which can further predispose to metastatic calcification if calcium remains uncontrolled [^117UQjw1] [^11436HwS].

> But wait, what about cardiovascular and neurologic catastrophe risk right now. Shortened QT and conduction abnormalities rise with higher calcium bands, and cohort data in severe hypercalcemia show high rates of ECG abnormalities and measurable mortality; PRES, although rare, has been reported with malignant hypercalcemia and can reverse with calcium correction, underscoring why we should not be reassured by an initially normal neurologic exam [^111p9nHq] [^114X8552].

> Next, I should review the acute risks of no treatment. The most immediate threat is acute kidney injury from volume depletion and direct vasoconstrictive/tubular effects of calcium; once established, hypercalcemia-induced renal failure can leave chronic impairment despite disease control, a particularly important message in sarcoidosis where renal involvement may already exist; severe hypercalcemia cohorts requiring dialysis report high AKI rates and nontrivial mortality, emphasizing the narrow window for prevention with early intervention [^111p9nHq] [^113jFo4a].

> Let me think about how sarcoid kidney disease changes the calculus. Dual injury from granulomatous interstitial nephritis plus hypercalcemia-mediated tubular damage reduces renal reserve and limits the kidney's ability to excrete calcium, creating a vicious cycle; in such contexts, thresholds for considering hemodialysis with a low-calcium bath drop when there is refractory hypercalcemia, worsening AKI, or life-threatening complications such as coma or unstable arrhythmias, and case-based evidence demonstrates rapid biochemical and clinical recovery with dialysis as a bridge to disease-directed therapy [^116KxB7p] [^116TCRBq].

> I should confirm how fast we must act. The steep calcium rise from 9.5 to 15 mg/dL over a few months, the sarcoid mechanism with likely elevated calcitriol, and reduced renal functional reserve together argue for emergency therapy now to prevent renal and neurologic decompensation; historical hypercalcemic crisis series report very high morbidity without prompt, aggressive care, while modern outcomes improve substantially with early, protocolized management [^115Pifru] [^117UQjw1].

> Now, I will outline immediate management steps while I double-check nuances. First, initiate aggressive isotonic saline resuscitation to restore intravascular volume and enhance calciuresis, with careful monitoring to avoid fluid overload in those at cardiac risk; after volume repletion, a loop diuretic can be used judiciously to maintain negative calcium balance, although it is not first-line for initial calcium reduction; these are standard emergency measures in severe hypercalcemia [^116M4fpB] [^11436HwS].

> Hold on, I should verify rapid calcium-lowering adjuncts. Calcitonin at 4–8 units/kg every 6–12 hours subcutaneously or intramuscularly provides a prompt but transient reduction within hours, useful as a bridge while antiresorptives and steroids take effect; tachyphylaxis limits use to about 48 hours, so I need to plan definitive agents in parallel [^112WBYfC].

> Next, I should review antiresorptive therapy selection and dosing. An IV bisphosphonate, such as pamidronate 90 mg for severe hypercalcemia infused over 2–24 hours with renal function monitoring, or zoledronic acid per institutional protocols, provides sustained calcium lowering within 24–72 hours; longer infusions reduce nephrotoxicity risk, which matters here given sarcoid kidney vulnerability; careful electrolyte surveillance for hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia after treatment is necessary, even when baseline phosphate was high [^111h89Hk] [^112oZfub].

> I need to ensure sarcoid-specific disease control. High-dose systemic corticosteroids are first-line to suppress granulomatous 1-α hydroxylase activity and calcitriol production, thereby addressing the mechanistic driver of sarcoid hypercalcemia; ATS guidance highlights high response rates of sarcoid renal dysfunction and hypercalcemia to immunosuppression when instituted early, which supports prompt steroid initiation once infection exclusions and contraindications are considered [^116KxB7p] [^113jFo4a].

> Let me first confirm monitoring and co-management details. I should obtain frequent ionized calcium, BMP with magnesium and phosphorus, and serial creatinine, monitor strict input/output and daily weights, place the patient on continuous telemetry with ECGs for QT and conduction changes, and involve nephrology early for potential low-calcium bath hemodialysis if calcium remains refractory, AKI progresses, or life-threatening complications emerge; cohort and case data support dialysis effectiveness under these conditions, and endocrine guidance in hypercalcemia care emphasizes systematic electrolyte monitoring during therapy [^111p9nHq] [^116TCRBq] [^113nCtSD].

> Finally, I should double-check precipitating and perpetuating factors to prevent relapse. Stop exogenous calcium and vitamin D, avoid thiazide diuretics, and screen for hidden vitamin D sources, as supplementation can unmask or worsen tissue-level calcitriol effects in sarcoidosis; ATS recommendations caution about supplementation in sarcoid patients and endorse targeted vitamin D testing when replacement is contemplated, which is directly relevant in preventing future episodes [^112KNAU1] [^117UQjw1].

Severe hypercalcemia (serum calcium > 14 mg/dL) in sarcoid kidney disease is dangerous even when asymptomatic [^113jFo4a], carrying a **high risk of acute kidney injury** [^1134KfPY] and **life-threatening arrhythmias** if left untreated [^114MpTx8] [^111p9nHq]. Expected symptoms include polyuria, polydipsia, dehydration, nausea, vomiting, constipation, muscle weakness, confusion, and, at higher levels, stupor or coma [^1113AxgX] [^1134KfPY]. If untreated, it can progress to acute renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, encephalopathy, pancreatitis, and death [^115Pifru] [^116ey6KB]. Immediate treatment is **required** to prevent these complications.

## Expected symptoms of severe hypercalcemia

Even if currently asymptomatic, severe hypercalcemia **commonly causes polyuria and polydipsia** due to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, with dehydration, nephrolithiasis, and acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening chronic kidney disease (CKD) [^1134KfPY] [^113jFo4a]. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, constipation, anorexia, abdominal pain, and pancreatitis [^1116XWrr] [^1134KfPY]. Neurological manifestations include fatigue, weakness, confusion with cognitive impairment, lethargy, depression, headache, seizures, and coma [^1113AxgX] [^114X8552]. Cardiovascular findings include hypertension, a shortened QT interval on ECG, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest [^111p9nHq] [^1134KfPY]. Musculoskeletal complaints include muscle weakness, bone pain, and osteopenia or osteoporosis [^1134KfPY].

## Acute risks of untreated severe hypercalcemia

Untreated severe hypercalcemia poses **significant acute risks**, especially in patients with underlying renal disease such as sarcoid kidney disease:

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Severe hypercalcemia can cause renal vasoconstriction, decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and acute tubular injury, leading to AKI or worsening CKD [^1134KfPY] [^113jFo4a].

- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: Hypercalcemia can cause significant cardiac conduction abnormalities, including shortened QT interval, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest [^114MpTx8] [^111p9nHq].

- **Neurological impairment**: Severe hypercalcemia can lead to encephalopathy, seizures, and coma [^114X8552].

- **Pancreatitis**: Hypercalcemia can precipitate acute pancreatitis, a potentially life-threatening condition [^113xm85b] [^116ey6KB].

- **Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances**: Hypercalcemia-induced polyuria and vomiting can cause severe dehydration and electrolyte disturbances, further exacerbating renal and cardiac complications [^1113AxgX] [^116M4fpB].

- **Hypercalcemic crisis**: This is a life-threatening emergency characterized by severe hypercalcemia, AKI, cardiac arrhythmias, and neurological impairment, requiring immediate medical intervention [^115Pifru] [^11436HwS].

## Pathophysiology of hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis

Hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis is primarily driven by increased extrarenal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) by activated macrophages within granulomas, which increases intestinal calcium absorption and bone resorption. This mechanism is **independent of parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulation**, making it particularly challenging to manage [^117UQjw1] [^1174AKph].

---

## Clinical implications of recurrent hypercalcemia in sarcoid kidney disease

Recurrent hypercalcemia in sarcoid kidney disease significantly **increases the risk of chronic kidney disease progression**, nephrolithiasis, and permanent renal impairment, and can also lead to vascular and soft tissue calcification, further compromising renal and cardiovascular health [^113jFo4a] [^114MpTx8].

---

## Management strategies for severe hypercalcemia in sarcoid kidney disease

Immediate management of **severe hypercalcemia** includes:

- **Intravenous hydration**: Aggressive IV hydration with normal saline to correct dehydration and promote renal calcium excretion [^116M4fpB] [^11436HwS].

- **Bisphosphonates or denosumab**: These agents inhibit bone resorption and are effective in lowering serum calcium levels [^114YJv7v] [^111h89Hk].

- **Glucocorticoids**: Prednisone or other corticosteroids are particularly effective in sarcoidosis-related hypercalcemia by reducing calcitriol production [^117UQjw1] [^116KxB7p].

- **Dialysis**: In cases of refractory hypercalcemia or severe renal impairment, dialysis may be necessary to rapidly lower calcium levels [^116TCRBq] [^111p9nHq].

Long-term management requires regular monitoring of **serum calcium and renal function**, with careful medication adjustments to prevent recurrence [^113nCtSD].

---

Severe hypercalcemia in sarcoid kidney disease is a **medical emergency** with significant acute risks, including AKI, cardiac arrhythmias, neurological impairment, and pancreatitis. Immediate and aggressive management is **essential** to prevent these complications and preserve renal function [^1134KfPY].

### Calcium gluconate [^1113AxgX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Overdosage of calcium gluconate injection may result in hypercalcemia. Symptoms of hypercalcemia typically develop when the total serum calcium concentration is ≥ 12 mg/dL. Neurologic symptoms include depression, weakness, fatigue, and confusion at lower levels, with patients experiencing hallucinations, disorientation, hypotonicity, seizures, and coma. Effects on the kidney include a diminished ability to concentrate urine and diuresis.

If an overdose of calcium gluconate injection occurs, immediately discontinue administration and provide supportive treatments to restore intravascular volume, as well as promote calcium excretion in the urine, if necessary.

### Ganite [^1116XWrr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia may produce a spectrum of signs and symptoms, including anorexia, lethargy, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dehydration, renal insufficiency, impaired mental status, coma, and cardiac arrest. A rapid rise in serum calcium may cause more severe symptoms for a given level of hypercalcemia. Since calcium is bound to serum proteins, which may fluctuate in concentration as a response to changes in blood volume, changes in total serum calcium (especially during rehydration) may not accurately reflect changes in the concentration of free-ionized calcium.

In the absence of a direct measurement of free-ionized calcium, measuring the serum albumin concentration and correcting the total serum calcium concentration may help assess the severity of hypercalcemia. The patient's acid-base status should also be taken into consideration while assessing the degree of hypercalcemia. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (e.g. saline hydration, with or without diuretics). The patient's cardiovascular status should be considered when using saline. In patients who have an underlying cancer type that may be sensitive to corticosteroids (e.g. hematologic cancers), the use or addition of corticosteroid therapy may be indicated.

- **Hypocalcemic activity**: A randomized double-blind clinical study comparing Ganite with calcitonin was conducted in patients with a serum calcium concentration (corrected for albumin) ≥ 12.0 mg/dL following 2 days of hydration. Ganite was given as a continuous intravenous infusion at a…

### Severe hypercalcemia requiring acute hemodialysis: A retrospective cohort study with increased incidence during the Covid-19 pandemic [^111p9nHq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The Covid-19 pandemic has had dramatic consequences on the progression of numerous pathologies, especially neoplastic ones. The orientation of hospital activities toward the care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection has caused significant delays in the diagnosis and therapy of many other pathologies. What about severe hypercalcemia? The aim of this work was to determine the clinical and biological presentation, etiologies, mortality, and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on severe hypercalcemia.

- **Material and methods**: We conducted a retrospective study for 84 months (September 2014 to September 2021) at the Nephrology Unit in University Hospital Mohammed VI, Oujda, Morocco. Included were all adult patients diagnosed with severe hypercalcemia (defined as corrected total serum calcium of > 3.5 mmol/l or > 14.0 mg/dl) and who had benefited from one or more hemodialysis sessions.

- **Results**: Sixty-six episodes of severe hypercalcemia occurred in 64 patients. The mean age was 57 ± 15 years and 57.6% were female. The mean corrected serum calcium at admission was 16.9 ± 2.1 mg/dl and 33.3% had more than 18.0 mg/dl. Malignancies represented 80.4% of all etiologies. Acute kidney injury was observed in 69.7%. The delta drop in serum calcium 48 hours after initiation of medical treatment was 4.64 ± 1.63 mg/dl. Mortality was noted in 14% of all cases. Electrocardiographic abnormalities were observed in 58.3%, 87.5%, and 85.7%, respectively, in group 1 (14.0–16.0 mg/dl), group 2 (16.1–18.0 mg/dl), and group 3 (> 18.0 mg/dl) (p = 0.04). The mean serum potassium value was 5.1 ± 1.3, 4.0 ±.

### Hypercalcemia: A review [^1134KfPY]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Hypercalcemia can result from various causes. Among these, Paget's disease, Williams syndrome, and immobilization-induced hypercalcemia are notable. Vitamin D intoxication, hematologic malignancies, metastasis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple myeloma are also significant contributors. Primary hyperparathyroidism and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia are common endocrine causes, while conditions such as berylliosis, metastatic neoplasm, adult T-cell leukemia, and VIPoma are also implicated.

Other causes include parathyroid carcinoma, sarcoidosis, hyperthyroidism, growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, and adrenal cortex insufficiency. Neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphatasia, and certain forms of hyperparathyroidism are relevant in specific populations. Subcutaneous fat necrosis of newborns and hypokalemic distal renal tubular acidosis are of particular concern in pediatrics.

Metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (Jansen type) and milk-alkali syndrome are additional rare causes, as are hypercalcemia of malignancy and paraneoplastic syndrome. Endocrine disorders like thyrotoxicosis, acromegaly, and Addison's disease should also be considered. Pheochromocytoma, tuberculosis, and fungal infections like coccidioidomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, and histoplasmosis can lead to hypercalcemia, as can Crohn's disease, candidiasis, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

Additional infectious and inflammatory conditions such as leprosy, talc granuloma, cat scratch disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and Pneumocystis pneumonia are noteworthy. Hypervitaminosis A, chronic kidney disease, rhabdomyolysis, and lactase deficiency also contribute to elevated serum calcium levels.

Medications play a role in hypercalcemia. These include cholecalciferol, vitamin A, teriparatide, paricalcitol, and parathyroid hormone. Lithium carbonate, danazol, abaloparatide, chlorthalidone, theophylline, capecitabine, megestrol, and revumenib are also implicated. Other medications like atezolizumab/hyaluronidase (human recombinant), calcitriol, calcipotriene, denosumab, bismuth subsalicylate, and the combination of drospirenone/ethinylestradiol can elevate serum calcium levels.

### Recurrent hepatic sarcoidosis post-liver transplantation manifesting with severe hypercalcemia: a case report and review of the literature [^115i9kKH]. Liver Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease primarily involving the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, eyes, and nervous system. Liver involvement is asymptomatic in most cases. However, once clinical symptoms develop, liver disease is usually progressive, often necessitating orthotopic liver transplantation. There are a few reports of asymptomatic sarcoidosis developing within the liver allograft.

We report a case of early recurrence of sarcoidosis in the liver allograft diagnosed on biopsy in a patient who presented with severe hypercalcemia, kidney dysfunction, and an increase in the size of abdominal lymph nodes. The liver chemistry tests were within normal limits. The patient responded well to steroid treatment by normalizing serum calcium and creatinine levels and reducing lymph node size. At the time of writing, there has been no report in the literature of symptomatic recurrence of hepatic sarcoidosis following orthotopic liver transplantation.

### Treatment of extreme hypercalcaemia: the role of haemodialysis [^116TCRBq]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A patient with an extremely high calcium level of 23.9 mg/dL (5.97 mmol/L) was admitted to our department unconscious, with a pathological ECG recording demonstrating a shortening of the QT interval. The patient was treated with fluid resuscitation, bisphosphonates, salmon calcitonin, and steroids. Haemodialysis with a low calcium bath was promptly provided, leading to an improvement in consciousness and a reduction in calcium levels. ECG changes disappeared.

Subsequent investigations revealed hyperparathyroidism, and a large parathyroid adenoma was surgically removed. Extreme and rapid calcium elevation (parathyroid crisis) is rarely seen in primary hyperparathyroidism and is usually distinctive for malignancy. In the context of acute kidney injury and refractory hypercalcaemia with life-threatening complications (such as coma and ECG changes with impending danger of arrhythmia), haemodialysis may effectively decrease calcium levels. It should be pointed out that dialysis is an efficient method of treating refractory hypercalcaemia and parathyroid crisis, but it is rarely used due to its invasive nature.

### Steroid responsive idiopathic calcitriol induced hypercalcemia: A case report and review of the literature [^111mBKGu]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

Idiopathic calcitriol-induced hypercalcemia is a rare cause of the common condition of hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia is most commonly the result of hyperparathyroidism and, together with hypercalcemia of malignancy, accounts for over 95% of cases. Idiopathic calcitriol-induced hypercalcemia can mimic hypercalcemia secondary to granulomatous diseases like sarcoidosis, but with an apparent absence of both imaging and physical exam findings consistent with the disease. We report here a 51-year-old man who presented with renal nephrolithiasis, hypercalcemia, and acute kidney injury.

- **Case presentation**: A 51-year-old man presented with severe back pain and mild hematuria. He had a history of renal nephrolithiasis over the course of a 15-year period. On presentation, his calcium was elevated at 13.4 mg/dL, creatinine was 3.1 mg/dL (from a baseline of 1.2 mg/dL), and his PTH was reduced at 5 pg/mL. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed acute nephrolithiasis, which was managed medically. The work-up for the hypercalcemia included an SPEP, which was normal. Vitamin D, 1,25 (OH)2 was elevated at 80.4 pg/mL, and a CT scan of the chest showed no evidence of sarcoidosis. Management with 10 mg prednisone showed marked improvement in the hypercalcemia, and he no longer had any symptoms of hypercalcemia.

- **Conclusion**: Idiopathic calcitriol-induced hypercalcemia is a rare cause of hypercalcemia. All reported cases benefit from more intensive long-term immunosuppression. This report helps consolidate the diagnosis of idiopathic calcitriol-induced hypercalcemia and encourages researchers to better investigate its underlying pathology.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^116KxB7p]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

- **Committee conclusions**: The guideline committee recognized that the prevalence of renal dysfunction identified among patients with sarcoidosis was modest. However, the committee's discussion led to the following conclusions: 1) renal sarcoidosis is often asymptomatic; 2) progressive or persistent renal dysfunction is associated with poor clinical outcomes; 3) renal function testing is not harmful; and 4) most patients respond to therapy. The last conclusion is based on both the committee's clinical experience and the systematic review, which suggested that roughly 90% of patients treated with immune suppression to suppress granulomatous inflammation and related vitamin D–mediated hypercalcemia, together with intravenous fluids and/or other therapies to further correct hypercalcemia (a cause of renal dysfunction in sarcoidosis), had improvement or correction of coexisting renal dysfunction. However, the systematic review was not designed to assess treatment effects, and therefore, better evidence about the treatment of renal sarcoidosis may exist.

- **Testing implications**: The combination of serum creatinine testing being safe and potentially detecting a condition with a poor prognosis that responds well to treatment if detected early prompted the guideline committee to conclude that the desirable consequences of renal function testing exceed the undesirable consequences. The committee acknowledged its uncertainty about whether serum creatinine is the best test to screen for renal sarcoidosis, because many studies used 24-hour urine collection. It decided that creatinine testing is easy and less costly.

### Sclerosing lipogranulomatosis-induced chronic hypercalcemia and acute pancreatitis [^116ey6KB]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 61-year-old Asian-American woman was referred to the dermatology department for a 7-year history of a progressively enlarging rash on her buttocks and lateral thighs. She reported receiving cosmetic injections of synthol oil by an unlicensed individual 10 years earlier. She noted leakage of an oil-like substance from the injection sites, which ceased shortly after the injections. She experienced intermittent pain requiring ice packs in the evening but denied pruritus or difficulty with sitting or movement. Her medical history included cardiomegaly, gastric ulcer, hypercalcemia, and pancreatitis, with no reported medications. Family history was noncontributory.

Approximately 1 year before presentation, the patient was hospitalized for acute pancreatitis likely caused by hypercalcemia, measured at 15.4 mg/dL (normal range: 8.4–10.5 mg/dL). The angiotensin-converting enzyme level was reported high, though the value was unknown, and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D was elevated at 103 pg/mL (normal range: 21–65 pg/mL). Upon resolution of her pancreatitis, evaluation of her hypercalcemia was initiated by the endocrinology department. A follow-up non-contrast computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a normal configuration of the pancreas, suggesting resolution of pancreatitis. There was also non-compartmentalized high-density heterogeneous material with intervening low-density foci throughout the gluteal subcutaneous space bilaterally and extending to the proximal thigh regions posterolaterally. Bilaterally enlarged internal and external iliac nodes were reported.

### Hypercalcaemia in gastrointestinal stromal tumour and sarcoidosis: A case report [^1168uUvq]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**

- **GIST and hypercalcaemia**: Malignancy-associated hypercalcaemia is mediated via three mechanisms: tumour secretion of PTHrP, metastatic disease to bone, and over-production of 1,25(OH)2 D. While PTHrP and bony metastases account for the majority of cases of malignancy-associated hypercalcaemia, in GISTs, the most common mechanism appears to be over-production of 1,25(OH)2 D.

	- We found 11 case reports of GIST-associated hypercalcaemia in the literature, with 6 cases documenting an elevation of 1,25(OH)2 D. High 1,25(OH)2 D can arise from direct ectopic tumour secretion or from tumour production of 1-α hydroxylase, leading to the catalytic conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) to 1,25(OH)2 D. The subsequent hyperabsorption of dietary calcium and increased renal tubular calcium reabsorption leads to hypercalcaemia.

	- Of the 11 case reports, elevated levels of PTHrP were observed in 2 cases. PTHrP functions similarly to PTH, increasing the synthesis of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa (RANK) ligand and activating osteoclasts, resulting in bone resorption and calcium release. The true prevalence of PTHrP-mediated mechanisms for hypercalcaemia in GIST may be underreported owing to the variable availability of PTHrP testing at different sites, including ours. The remaining 3 case reports do not document a specific cause for hypercalcaemia.

	- GIST-associated metastatic bone disease occurs rarely, and there are no case reports of this as the cause for hypercalcaemia. Metastatic disease, however, is common; 9 out of 11 case reports we found reported metastat.

### Elevated 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with protracted treatment in sarcoidosis [^1125vNMf]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Active vitamin D metabolite, 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D, has pleomorphic effects on both innate and acquired immunity. Sarcoid granuloma-derived 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D leads to hypercalcemia, but the association of 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D with the clinical phenotype of the disease is currently unknown.

- **Objective**: To determine the relationship between serum 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels and the degree of sarcoidosis disease chronicity.

- **Design**: Serum 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels were measured and associated with sarcoidosis activity and phenotypes as assessed by Sarcoidosis Severity Score and Sarcoidosis Clinical Activity Classification respectively.

- **Results**: Fifty-nine patients were recruited, with 44% having a sub-acute onset and the chronic disease phenotype. There was no significant difference in serum 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels by chest radiograph stage (p = 0.092), nor did the levels correlate with the Sarcoidosis Severity Score (r = -0.16; p = 0.216). Serum 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels were associated with patients requiring repeated regimens of systemic immunosuppressive therapy or > 1 year of therapy (SCAC Class 6). Increasing quartiles of serum 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D level were associated with increased odds of the chronic phenotype (OR 1.82, 95% CI, 1.11, 2.99, p = 0.019). The majority (71%) of patients with levels > 51 pg/mL required chronic immunosuppressive therapy as defined by SCAC class 6.

- **Conclusions**: In patients with sarcoidosis, elevated 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with chronic treatment needs.

### Approaches to the treatment of some of the troublesome manifestations of sarcoidosis [^117BpePs]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis can present a major therapeutic challenge given its varied clinical presentations, combinations of organ involvement, severity, and unpredictable longitudinal behavior. Six manifestations of sarcoidosis are particularly difficult to manage:

- **Incomplete knowledge of causation**: Fatigue and small fiber neuropathy.
- **Rare occurrence in sarcoidosis**: Intra-abdominal complications.
- **Potentially life-threatening consequences in some patients**: Neurological disease, pulmonary hypertension, and hypercalcemia.

In none of these situations has a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of any therapy been conducted. Despite the absence of a firm evidence base to support therapeutic recommendations, these six entities can be extremely problematic for the practicing clinician. It is for this reason that we have focused in this review on these six disease manifestations and provided a synopsis of each problem, together with suggested treatment approaches based on an analysis of the literature.

A 66-year-old woman presented with features of encephalopathy accompanied by asterixis, which was preceded by unsteadiness of gait and behavioral abnormalities. Subsequent investigations revealed a hypercalcaemic crisis and compromised renal function. A stepwise approach to determine the cause of hypercalcaemia and renal impairment uncovered an underlying granulomatous disease, specifically sarcoidosis. The development of a maculopapular rash and a subsequent biopsy from the lesion confirmed the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Her clinical and biochemical parameters improved considerably upon the initiation of conservative pharmacological therapy.

### Intramuscular synthol injections cause hypercalcemia in long-term observation: A case report study [^113GMBSN]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is diagnosed when the serum calcium concentration is greater than 10.5 mg/dL. It is considered mild if the plasma calcium concentration is between 10.5 and 11.9 mg/dL, moderate if it is between 12 and 13.9 mg/dL, and severe if it is above 14 mg/dL. Up to 99% of total body calcium is stored in the skeleton. Among the 1–2% of calcium that is not stored in bones, half remains ionized in the active form, 40% is bound to proteins such as albumin, and 10% is bound to organic anions.

Calcium homeostasis is maintained by parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitriol (1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol), and calcitonin. PTH is an amino acid hormone synthesized by the parathyroid glands and released in response to low serum calcium concentrations. PTH increases serum calcium levels by enhancing bone resorption by osteoclasts, stimulating the reabsorption of calcium in renal tubules, and activating the conversion of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to calcitriol. Calcitriol, a steroid hormone and the active form of vitamin D, is produced in the skin after exposure to ultraviolet B radiation or delivered in the diet. It is then hydroxylated first in the liver and finally in the kidneys, increasing calcium absorption in the intestines. Calcitonin, synthesized by the thyroid gland in response to high serum calcium levels, decreases serum calcium concentrations by inhibiting osteoclast activity and promoting renal calcium excretion.

### Relevance of concurrent hypercalcemia in ureteric sarcoidosis complicated with bladder urothelial carcinoma: a case report [^116pnPEF]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

A 60-year-old man with no medical history or comorbidities presented with anorexia and weight loss, decreasing from 59.4 kg before admission to 55.9 kg on admission. Physical examination did not reveal any findings. Blood tests indicated renal dysfunction with a creatinine level of 2.27 mg/dL and hypercalcemia, where the total serum calcium corrected for albumin was 12.2 mg/dL. A urine test showed hypercalciuria without proteinuria.

- **Biochemical analysis results**:
	- The hypercalcemia was treated with the administration of elcatonin and normal saline infusion for fluid replacement. Computed tomography (CT) revealed left hydronephrosis associated with left lower ureteral wall thickening, which showed high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Although the voided urinary cytology result was negative, a 5-mm papillary pedunculated tumor was detected on the left lateral wall of the bladder during cystoscopy. Additionally, a 2-cm long stenosis in the left lower ureter was revealed by retrograde ureterography, indicating a suspected ureteral cancerous lesion.

### Chronic kidney disease: Identification and management in primary care [^114KjNnF]. Pragmatic and Observational Research (2016). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be associated with a diverse range of conditions and symptoms, including hematuria, sarcoidosis, and chest pain. It is linked to multiple myeloma, vomiting, increased serum phosphate, and increased serum anion gap. Patients may experience loss of appetite, headache, and diabetes mellitus. Further complications include kidney stones, sickle cell disease, lactic acidosis, and renal artery stenosis. Tobacco use, hiccups, decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), peripheral neuropathy, and decreased serum pH can also be present.

- **Metabolic and electrolyte disturbances**: Decreased serum calcium levels, diabetic nephropathy, acute kidney injury (AKI), hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, peripheral edema, erectile dysfunction, increased serum creatinine, increased serum cystatin C.

- **Dermatological and hematological signs**: Lindsay's nails, fatigue, anemia.

- **Cardiovascular and respiratory complications**: Coronary artery disease, increased serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), nausea, muscle cramps, dyspnea, sleep disorders.

- **Growth and development issues**: Growth restriction, obesity, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

- **Renal disorders**: Acute pyelonephritis, glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, Fabry disease, Alport syndrome.

- **Systemic conditions**: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), pericarditis, pulmonary hypertension.

- **Neurological and cognitive effects**: Seizures, coma, cognitive impairment.

- **Other symptoms and complications**: Cardiovascular disease, pallor, increased urine protein, increased serum urea, pruritus, weight loss, bone pain, the effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome due to malignant hypercalcemia: Physiopathological considerations [^114X8552]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a neurological entity characterized by seizures, headache, and reversible subcortical vasogenic edema. It is associated with many etiologies, most often hypertension, chronic renal failure, and chemotherapy. Hypercalcemia is rarely associated with PRES.

The aim of this study is to describe and discuss a case of PRES that developed in a patient with malignant hypercalcemia, with emphasis on the possible pathophysiological mechanisms involved.

A 38-year-old woman presented with altered mental status. She had a 2-month history of lumbar pain of moderate intensity, weight loss, and gastrointestinal complaints, in addition to a mass in her left breast. Her corrected serum calcium was 14.5 mg/dL. She was normotensive, had no focalizing signs, and her cerebrospinal fluid was normal. Despite treatment, her neurological state did not resolve, and she developed severe headaches on day 4 of her admission. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a bilateral and symmetric hyperintensity in the occipital and parietal lobes on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging, a characteristic highly suggestive of PRES. After correction of hypercalcemia, her symptoms and imaging abnormalities resolved.

The development of PRES in the setting of severe hypercalcemia is extremely rare. Hypercalcemia could lead to PRES in the absence of hypertension by various mechanisms, including vasospasm, endothelial dysfunction, and an inflammatory state. A high index of suspicion is essential for diagnosis in such cases.

### Onco-nephrology: The pathophysiology and treatment of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia [^11436HwS]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia complicates the course of 10%-30% of all patients with malignancies and can signal a very poor prognosis and advanced malignancy. Prompt recognition of the nonspecific signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia and the initiation of therapy can be lifesaving, providing the opportunity to address the underlying etiology.

- **Mechanisms of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia**: The mechanisms generally fall into three categories: humoral hypercalcemia due to secreted factors (such as parathyroid-related hormone), local osteolysis due to tumor invasion of bone, and absorptive hypercalcemia due to excess vitamin D produced by malignancies.

- **Mainstays of therapy**: The mainstays of therapy for hypercalcemia include aggressive intravenous volume expansion with saline, bisphosphonate therapy, and possibly loop diuretics. Adjunctive therapy may involve calcitonin and corticosteroids.

- **Refractory cases**: In refractory cases, gallium nitrate and possibly denosumab are alternatives. In patients presenting with severe acute kidney injury (AKI), hemodialysis with a low-calcium bath can be effective.

In most cases, therapy normalizes calcium levels and allows for palliation or curative therapy of the malignancy.

### Calcitriol-mediated hypercalcemia as an immune-related adverse event in a patient receiving nivolumab and ipilimumab for metastatic renal cell carcinoma, case report [^113qwq8S]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

His inpatient workup was significant for an elevated 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) level of 142 pg/mL (reference 20–79 pg/mL) in the presence of low-normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25{OH} D) at 36.7 ng/mL (reference 30–100 ng/mL), suggesting alpha hydroxylation. Other hypercalcemia testing revealed an elevated phosphorus level of 5.4 mg/dL (reference 2.2–4.6 mg/dL), a suppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) of less than 6.3 pg/mL (reference 14.0–72.0 pg/mL), a low parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) of 0.7 pmol/L (reference ≤ 4.2 pmol/L), an elevated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level of 273.0 pg/mL (reference 9.0–50.0 pg/mL), an elevated cortisol level of 37.03 mcg/dL (reference 3.09–22.40 mcg/dL), a normal alkaline phosphatase level of 110 U/L (reference 32–126 U/L), and a normal angiotensin-converting enzyme level of 62 ng/dL (reference 9–67 ng/dL). FDG-PET imaging showed multiple hypermetabolic mediastinal, hilar, and intra-abdominal lymph nodes (max SUV of 15), as illustrated in Fig. 1. The liver lesions themselves were not FDG-avid but were stable in size, as were his prior lung nodules.

He underwent a bronchoscopy with biopsy of four separate lymph nodes, none of which demonstrated malignancy nor granulomatous disease. He was initially treated with intravenous normal saline, calcitonin 4 units/kg every 12 hours, and 4 mg zoledronic acid. Despite seven days of aggressive treatment, his hypercalcemia persisted, as shown in Fig. 2. He was then started on 1 mg/kg of…

### Parathyroid hormone-related protein: An unusual mechanism for hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis [^112hkJvF]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

To describe parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) as a mediator of hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis, we present a detailed case report including history, physical, laboratory testing, pathology findings, and follow-up data over two years. We also propose a possible mechanism for PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis.

A 56-year-old man presented with abdominal pain, fatigue, and excess thirst. Routine laboratory testing demonstrated severe hypercalcemia. The patient was admitted for treatment and work-up. Inpatient work-up was significant for suppressed parathyroid hormone, low 25-hydroxyvitamin D, normal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and elevated PTHrP. The patient was treated for hypercalcemia and discharged for follow-up. Malignancy screening included computed tomography of the chest, which revealed parenchymal nodules and diffuse lymphadenopathy. Biopsy revealed nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation with positive PTHrP staining by immunohistochemistry. After treatment with intravenous hydration and glucocorticoids, the hypercalcemia resolved, and on subsequent follow-up, PTHrP levels had normalized to 0.5 pmol/L.

PTHrP may be a possible mediator of hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis. The differential diagnosis of PTHrP-induced hypercalcemia should include sarcoidosis, and further research is needed to establish the incidence and source of PTHrP in sarcoidosis.

### Rapid fire: Hypercalcemia [^116M4fpB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is commonly encountered in the clinical setting and requires identification by the clinician to avoid disastrous patient outcomes. The two most common causes are malignancy and hyperparathyroidism. The underlying cause for hypercalcemia may be readily known at presentation or may require further investigation. After identification, the acuity of treatment will depend on the severity of the calcium level and symptoms. In the emergency setting, intravenous hydration with isotonic fluids is the treatment mainstay.

- **Additional medications**: Other commonly used medications to further decrease calcium include bisphosphates, calcitonin, steroids, and (rarely) furosemide.
- **Life-threatening circumstances**: In life-threatening circumstances, dialysis can be implemented.

### Intramuscular synthol injections cause hypercalcemia in long-term observation: a case report study [^113ucJne]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is one of the most common ionic disorders and is diagnosed when the serum calcium concentration is greater than 10.5 mg/dL. While mainly associated with primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy, it can also be caused by multiple derangements. Almost every part of the body can be affected by excess calcium, which might be very dangerous and even lethal.

- **Case presentation**: We report a rare trigger of increased serum calcium level — synthol intramuscular injections. A 60-year-old man who suffered from general weakness, weight loss, and acute kidney injury, associated with unidentified hypercalcemia, was under review for proper diagnosis. Endocrine disorders, malignancies, sarcoidosis, and iatrogenic medication-related causes were excluded. Patient history, physical examination, blood chemistry, 24-hour urine collection, computed tomography, and endoscopy were performed. Finally, a biopsy of muscle explained the source of the increased serum calcium concentrations.

- **Conclusions**: Hypercalcemia is a common disorder with a wide range of triggers. Synthol intramuscular injections are among the causes of elevated serum calcium levels. It is important to make proper and quick diagnoses and begin therapy. Unfortunately, surgical resection of the synthol seems to be the only reasonable option for hypercalcemia treatment.

### Prolia [^115ZQPwk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Prolia can cause severe hypocalcemia, and fatal cases have been reported. Pre-existing hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to initiating therapy with Prolia. All patients should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Contraindications (4), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Severe hypocalcemia and mineral metabolism changes**: In patients without advanced chronic kidney disease who are predisposed to hypocalcemia and disturbances of mineral metabolism (e.g. history of hypoparathyroidism, thyroid surgery, parathyroid surgery, malabsorption syndromes, excision of the small intestine, or treatment with other calcium-lowering drugs), serum calcium and mineral levels (phosphorus and magnesium) should be assessed 10 to 14 days after Prolia injection. In some post-marketing cases, hypocalcemia persisted for weeks or months, requiring frequent monitoring and intravenous and/or oral calcium replacement, with or without vitamin D.

- **Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease**: Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease [i.e. eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²], including dialysis-dependent patients, are at greater risk for severe hypocalcemia following Prolia administration. Severe hypocalcemia has resulted in hospitalization, life-threatening events, and fatal cases. The presence of underlying chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD, renal osteodystrophy) markedly increases the risk of hypocalcemia. Concomitant use of calcimimetic drugs may also worsen the risk of hypocalcemia.

### Pamidronate disodium [^111h89Hk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Consideration should be given to the severity as well as the symptoms of hypercalcemia of malignancy. Vigorous saline hydration alone may be sufficient for treating mild, asymptomatic hypercalcemia. Overhydration should be avoided in patients who have the potential for cardiac failure. In hypercalcemia associated with hematologic malignancies, the use of glucocorticoid therapy may be helpful.

- **Moderate hypercalcemia**: The recommended dose of pamidronate disodium for Injection USP in moderate hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium* of approximately 12–13.5 mg/dL) is 60 to 90 mg given as a single-dose, intravenous infusion over 2 to 24 hours. Longer infusions (i.e. > 2 hours) may reduce the risk of renal toxicity, particularly in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency.

- **Severe hypercalcemia**: The recommended dose of pamidronate disodium for Injection USP in severe hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium* > 13.5 mg/dL) is 90 mg given as a single-dose, intravenous infusion over 2 to 24 hours. Longer infusions (i.e. > 2 hours) may reduce the risk of renal toxicity, particularly in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency.

*Albumin-corrected serum calcium (CCa, mg/dL) = serum calcium, mg/dL + 0.8 (4.0 - serum albumin, g/dL).

- **Retreatment**: A limited number of patients have received more than one treatment with pamidronate disodium for hypercalcemia. Retreatment with pamidronate disodium for Injection USP, in patients who show complete or partial response initially, may be carried out.

### Calcium acetate [^117SJqvZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Treat mild hypercalcemia by reducing or interrupting calcium acetate and Vitamin D. Severe hypercalcemia may require hemodialysis and discontinuation of calcium acetate. Hypercalcemia may aggravate digitalis toxicity.

- **Hypercalcemia**: Patients with end-stage renal disease may develop hypercalcemia when treated with calcium, including calcium acetate. Avoid the use of calcium supplements, including calcium-based nonprescription antacids, concurrently with calcium acetate.

	- An overdose of calcium acetate may lead to progressive hypercalcemia, which may require emergency measures. Therefore, early in the treatment phase, during the dosage adjustment period, monitor serum calcium levels twice weekly. Should hypercalcemia develop, reduce the calcium acetate dosage or discontinue the treatment, depending on the severity of hypercalcemia.

	- More severe hypercalcemia (Ca > 12 mg/dL) is associated with confusion, delirium, stupor, and coma. Severe hypercalcemia can be treated by acute hemodialysis and discontinuing calcium acetate therapy.

	- Mild hypercalcemia (10.5 to 11.9 mg/dL) may be asymptomatic or manifest as constipation, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Mild hypercalcemia is usually controlled by reducing the calcium acetate dose or temporarily discontinuing therapy. Decreasing or discontinuing Vitamin D therapy is recommended as well.

	- Chronic hypercalcemia may lead to vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Radiographic evaluation of suspected anatomical regions may be helpful in early detection of soft tissue calcification.

### Elevated PTH with normal serum calcium level: a structured approach [^111PJEAj]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016).

Normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism is a common biochemical finding, usually identified during an assessment of bone or renal health. Hypercalcaemia must be considered by calculating adjusted calcium, and a careful history should be taken to assess dietary calcium intake and the possibility of a malabsorption syndrome. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) level should be measured and replaced if indicated. The management plan for the patient is influenced by the context in which calcium and PTH levels were measured. In this brief review, we describe the assessment of a patient with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism.

### Rare causes of hypercalcemia: 2021 update [^116b7eai]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy are the etiologies in 90% of cases of hypercalcemia. When these entities are not the cause, uncommon conditions need to be considered. In 2005, Jacobs and Bilezikian published a clinical review of rare causes of hypercalcemia, focusing on mechanisms and pathophysiology. This review is an updated synopsis, extending the observations of the original article.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Articles reporting rare associations between hypercalcemia and unusual conditions were identified through a comprehensive PubMed-based search using the search terms "hypercalcemia" and "etiology", as well as examining the references in identified case reports. We categorized the reports by adults versus pediatric and further categorized the adult reports based on etiology. Some included reports lacked definitive assessment of etiology and are reported as unknown mechanism with discussion of likely etiology.

- **Evidence synthesis**: There is a growing understanding of the breadth of unusual causes of hypercalcemia. When the cause is elusive, a focus on mechanism and review of prior reported cases is key to successful determination of the etiology.

The ever-expanding reports of patients with rare and even unknown mechanisms of hypercalcemia illustrate the need for continued investigation into the complexities of human calcium metabolism.

### Vitamin D-mediated hypercalcemia: Mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment [^117UQjw1]. Endocrine Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia occurs in up to 4% of the population in association with malignancy, primary hyperparathyroidism, ingestion of excessive calcium and/or vitamin D, ectopic production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], and impaired degradation of 1,25(OH)2D. The ingestion of excessive amounts of vitamin D3 (or vitamin D2) results in hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria due to the formation of supraphysiological amounts of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] that bind to the vitamin D receptor, albeit with lower affinity than the active form of the vitamin, 1,25(OH)2D, and the formation of 5,6-trans 25(OH)D, which binds to the vitamin D receptor more tightly than 25(OH)D.

In patients with granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis or tuberculosis and tumors such as lymphomas, hypercalcemia occurs as a result of the activity of ectopic 25(OH)D-1-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) expressed in macrophages or tumor cells and the formation of excessive amounts of 1,25(OH)2D. Recent work has identified a novel cause of non-PTH-mediated hypercalcemia that occurs when the degradation of 1,25(OH)2D is impaired as a result of mutations of the 1,25(OH)2D-24-hydroxylase cytochrome P450 (CYP24A1). Patients with biallelic and, in some instances, monoallelic mutations of the CYP24A1 gene have elevated serum calcium concentrations associated with elevated serum 1,25(OH)2D, suppressed PTH concentrations, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and on occasion, reduced bone density. Of interest, first-time calcium renal stone formers have elevated 1,25(OH)2D and evidence of impaired degradation.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: Finding the balance [^112WBYfC]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

In patients with severe hypercalcaemia, the hormone calcitonin is an important adjunctive treatment that acts within 4 hours of administration and can be used to immediately reduce calcium plasma concentrations. Calcitonin reduces calcium concentration by inhibiting osteoclast activity and increasing renal calcium clearance. It should be administered at a dose of 4–8 units/kg subcutaneously or intramuscularly every 6–12 hours; the duration of dosing is limited to 48 hours due to the development of tachyphylaxis and decreased responsiveness.

Currently, the standard treatment for hypercalcaemia of malignancy includes rehydration combined with intravenous bisphosphonate therapy, with zoledronic acid preferred over pamidronate. In some countries, denosumab is approved for use in patients with bisphosphonate-refractory hypercalcaemia. Additionally, calcitonin may be useful for patients with severe or life-threatening hypercalcaemia because it causes a rapid, albeit transient, decrease in high serum calcium levels.

### Surviving extreme hypercalcaemia — a case report and review of the literature [^113ArXLH]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

We report a case of extreme hypercalcaemia associated with a parathyroid adenoma in a young man. The patient presented with classical symptoms of a hypercalcaemic syndrome, and serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels were 6.92 mmol L(-1) and 70.2 pmol L(-1), respectively. After stabilizing the patient and reducing the calcium level, a parathyroidectomy was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful with rapidly resolving clinical symptoms.

Hypercalcaemic crisis is a rare but life-threatening complication of primary hyperparathyroidism. It should be suspected in acutely ill patients complaining of muscular weakness, gastrointestinal, and cerebral symptoms. To reduce mortality, it is essential to correctly diagnose the condition without delay and provide appropriate emergency management to correct hypercalcaemia and dehydration. Successful parathyroidectomy quickly relieves symptoms and prevents recurrence.

### Acute management of hypercalcemia of malignancy - A review of pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^115pY2Q7]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy is one of the most common metabolic disorders in patients with cancer and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This narrative review summarizes pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic strategies, and therapies available for the management of hypercalcemia of malignancy in acutely ill adult patients.

- **Recent findings**: We reviewed both classic and recent literature to provide practical recommendations for managing cancer-related hypercalcemia. Our findings are presented in the context of recently published societal guidelines. Timely identification and treatment of acute hypercalcemia of malignancy is vital. Understanding of the underlying disease processes and available therapies is needed to optimize patient care and healthcare resource utilization.

### Diagnosis and management of hypocalcemia [^1127XE1Y]. Endocrine (2020). High credibility.

Hypocalcemia can result from various causes, including:

- **Deficiency-related causes**: Vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1, vitamin D-dependent rickets type 2a
- **Endocrine and metabolic disorders**: Hypoparathyroidism, secondary hyperparathyroidism, autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1, pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a, pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1b
- **Renal conditions**: Acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, proximal renal tubular acidosis
- **Blood-related issues**: Hypoalbuminemia, complications of blood transfusion

### Natpara (parathyroid hormone) [^116x19Eg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In the overall pivotal trial, a greater proportion of patients on Natpara had albumin-corrected serum calcium above the normal range (8.4 to 10.6 mg/dL). During the entire trial duration, three patients on Natpara and one patient on placebo had a calcium level above 12 mg/dL. More patients randomized to Natpara exhibited hypercalcemia in both phases of the study. It is important to note that all trial participants underwent a 50% reduction in active vitamin D dose at randomization.

Table 3 displayed the number of subjects who had albumin-corrected serum calcium levels above the normal range (8.4 to 10.6 mg/dL) by study treatment period in the placebo-controlled study, based on routine monitoring at each trial visit.

Table 4 displayed the number of subjects who had albumin-corrected serum calcium levels below 8.4 mg/dL by treatment period in the placebo-controlled study, based on routine monitoring at each trial visit. More patients randomized to placebo had hypocalcemia of less than 7 mg/dL in the titration phase, whereas more patients randomized to Natpara had hypocalcemia of less than 7 mg/dL in the dose maintenance phase.

The risk of hypocalcemia increases when Natpara is withdrawn. At the end of the trial, Natpara and placebo were withdrawn, calcium and active vitamin D were returned to baseline doses, and subjects were followed for four weeks. During this withdrawal phase, more patients previously randomized to Natpara experienced an albumin-corrected serum calcium value of less than 7 mg/dL.

### Association between successful aging transitions and depressive symptoms among older Korean adults: Findings from the Korean longitudinal study of aging (2006–2018) [^117P9j7s]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). High credibility.

The importance of successful aging (SA) has been emphasized in recent years, with the focus shifting towards attaining healthier aging rather than merely longevity. However, the influence of SA and its changes on mental health, such as depression, remains a relatively unexplored area in gerontology. Therefore, we investigated the longitudinal association between changes in SA and depressive symptoms in Korean older adults.

- **Methods**: This study comprised a longitudinal sample of older adults aged ≥ 45 years, drawn from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (2006–2018). Changes in SA status were determined using the Rowe and Kahn model over two consecutive years. Using an adjusted generalized estimating equation model, we examined the association between changes in successful aging status, namely SA and non-successful aging (NSA), and depressive symptoms.

- **Results**: Compared to the SA→SA group, depressive symptom risk in the NSA→NSA and SA→NSA groups were higher in men [(OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.13–1.18), (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.08–1.13), respectively] and in women [(OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.13–1.18), (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.09–1.14), respectively]. Subgroup analysis of the dimensions of successful aging revealed that low or worsening criteria of successful aging status in men and women were associated with depressive symptoms.

- **Conclusions**: Korean older adults who continuously failed to attain or maintain successful aging status had the highest risk of depressive symptoms. These results could further assist in establishing policies and interventions that promote successful aging and subsequently reduce depressive symptoms among older adults.

### Sarcoidosis-related hypercalcaemia due to production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide [^111Y1dJu]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Hypercalcaemia is frequently observed in patients with sarcoidosis and is classically attributed to the ectopic production of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D by sarcoid granulomas. We present a case of sarcoidosis-related hypercalcaemia with normal vitamin D levels. In this patient, the production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrp) was the cause of sarcoidosis-induced hypercalcaemia. Plasma PTHrp levels were increased, and bone marrow granulomas stained positively for PTHrp expression. Medium-dose prednisolone treatment improved symptoms of sarcoidosis and normalized serum calcium and PTHrp concentrations. Thus, the production of PTHrp may cause hypercalcaemia in some patients with sarcoidosis.

### Hypercalcemic crisis in the era of targeted parathyroidectomy [^113xm85b]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2011). Low credibility.

Patients experiencing a hypercalcemic crisis are best treated through expeditious parathyroidectomy. Previous studies suggested that these patients might have lower operative success rates compared to non-crisis patients. This study reviews the outcomes for hypercalcemic crisis in the era of targeted parathyroid surgery.

- **Methods**: The records of 839 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who underwent parathyroidectomy at a single institution from 1993 to 2009 were reviewed. Among them, 34 patients were surgically treated for hypercalcemic crisis, defined by acute calcium intoxication signs and symptoms and serum calcium levels ≥ 14 mg/dL. All patients underwent parathyroidectomy guided by preoperative localization studies and intra-operative parathyroid hormone (PTH) monitoring (IPM). Pre- and postoperative symptoms, laboratory values, and rates of operative failure and recurrence were compared to 805 non-crisis patients.

- **Results**: Mean preoperative serum calcium (15.8 versus 11.6 mg/dL) and PTH (719 versus 175 pg/mL) levels were significantly higher among patients presenting with hypercalcemic crisis (P < 0.0001). Postoperatively, the mean calcium and PTH levels were similar (9.4 versus 9.4 mg/dL, P = 0.7) and (82 versus 51 pg/mL, P = 0.1), respectively. Alteration in mental status as a presenting symptom was significantly more prevalent among those in crisis (24% versus 3%, P < 0.0001), as was pancreatitis (6% versus 0.2%, P = 0.001).

### Association between successful aging transitions and depressive symptoms among older Korean adults: Findings from the Korean longitudinal study of aging (2006–2018) [^111rgLV4]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

The importance of successful aging (SA) has been emphasized in recent years, with a focus shifting towards attaining healthier aging rather than longevity. However, the influence of SA and its changes on mental health, such as depression, remains a relatively unexplored area in gerontology. Therefore, we investigated the longitudinal association between changes in SA and depressive symptoms in Korean older adults.

- **Methods**: This study comprised a longitudinal sample of older adults aged ≥ 45 years, drawn from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (2006–2018). Changes in SA status were determined using the Rowe and Kahn model over two consecutive years. Using an adjusted generalized estimating equation model, we examined the association between changes in successful aging status, namely SA and NSA (non-successful aging), and depressive symptoms.

- **Results**: Compared to the SA→SA group, depressive symptom risk in the NSA→NSA and SA→NSA groups were higher in men [(OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.13–1.18), (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.08–1.13), respectively] and in women [(OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.13–1.18), (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.09–1.14), respectively]. Subgroup analysis of the dimensions of successful aging revealed that low or worsening criteria of successful aging status in men and women were associated with depressive symptoms.

- **Conclusions**: Korean older adults who continuously failed to attain or maintain successful aging status had the highest risk of depressive symptoms. These results could further assist in establishing policies and interventions that promote successful aging.

### Parsabiv [^1176UeVN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

In the combined placebo-controlled studies, there was a notable difference in adverse reactions between the groups.

- **Hypocalcemia**: A higher proportion of patients on Parsabiv developed at least one corrected serum calcium value below critical thresholds. Specifically, 7.6% of Parsabiv patients had levels below 7.0 mg/dL compared to 3.1% in the placebo group. For levels below 7.5 mg/dL, 27% of Parsabiv patients were affected, compared to 5.5% for placebo. Additionally, 79% of Parsabiv patients had levels below 8.3 mg/dL, in contrast to 19% in the placebo group. Consequently, 1% of Parsabiv patients discontinued treatment due to hypocalcemia-related adverse reactions, whereas no placebo group patients did so.

- **Hypophosphatemia**: In these studies, 18% of patients treated with Parsabiv and 8.2% of those on placebo experienced phosphorus levels dropping below the lower normal limit (2.2 mg/dL).

- **QTc interval prolongation secondary to hypocalcemia**: Parsabiv-treated patients more frequently experienced a maximum increase from baseline exceeding 60 milliseconds in the QTcF interval compared to 0% in the placebo group, with 1.2% of Parsabiv patients affected. Post-baseline, predialysis QTcF intervals greater than 500 milliseconds were observed in 4.8% of Parsabiv patients versus 1.9% of placebo patients.

- **Hypersensitivity**: Adverse reactions possibly related to hypersensitivity were reported in 4.4% of Parsabiv patients, compared to 3.7% in the placebo group. Specific hypersensitivity reactions identified in the Parsabiv group included pruritic rash, urticaria, and facial edema.

### Steroid responsive idiopathic calcitriol induced hypercalcemia: a case report and review of the literature [^116kN33z]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

The patient described has a long history of symptomatic hypercalcemia and nephrolithiasis. A comprehensive work-up was conducted to eliminate common etiologies of hypercalcemia, beginning with primary hyperparathyroidism. Intact PTH levels were found to be suppressed, and a neck ultrasound was unremarkable, making this diagnosis unlikely. Vitamin D testing demonstrated elevated calcitriol levels, which is observed in conditions such as lymphoma and chronic granulomatous disease. These conditions were deemed unlikely in our patient due to the absence of constitutional and inflammatory systemic symptoms, an unremarkable bone scan, and follow-up chest CT and X-ray that ruled out the possibility of primary lung malignancy and active granulomatous diseases.

While hypercalcemia is observed in 10–20% of patients with sarcoidosis, this diagnosis is unlikely in the absence of any physical exam, laboratory, or radiologic evidence of sarcoidosis. Furthermore, low ACE levels make this diagnosis even less likely, considering that ACE levels are elevated in 60% of patients with sarcoidosis. Active tuberculosis infection is also associated with hypercalcemia and was explored given our patient's history of tuberculosis, but the workup was negative. The patient denied taking vitamin D or A, silicon, or paraffin oil, ruling out external causes of hypercalcemia.

One consideration is that, while this patient underwent a comprehensive work-up, an underlying pathology explaining the observed hypercalcemia may reveal itself with time. This remains a possibility, and the authors will remain vigilant moving forward.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113jFo4a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Our systematic review suggests that serum hypercalcemia will be detected in 6% of patients with sarcoidosis who undergo routine serum calcium testing; nearly half will develop renal failure. Our systematic review did not target treatment of sarcoidosis-related hypercalcemia and, therefore, better evidence about treatment may exist. However, according to the committee's clinical experience and our systematic review, hypercalcemia improves or resolves in more than 90% of patients who are treated with immune suppression. In contrast, once hypercalcemia-induced renal failure is established, chronic renal impairment is common despite immune suppression.

The committee concluded that, despite the low prevalence of hypercalcemia, the accessibility of a nonburdensome test, coupled with the opportunity to intervene before the development of irreversible consequences, warrants baseline testing and annual screening thereafter. In addition, the committee determined that a strong recommendation for initial screening was indicated, despite the very low quality of evidence, because the importance of the potential benefits of early detection of hypercalcemia (i.e. the prevention of irreversible kidney disease) substantially outweighs the harms, burdens, and costs of testing.

The committee noted that data to support 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D testing for abnormal calcium metabolism were neither extensively studied nor supported by the systematic review, although it was recognized that there may be other reasons for 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D testing in patients with sarcoidosis.

### Unusual recurrence of hypercalcemia due to concurrent parathyroid adenoma and parathyroid sarcoidosis with lymph node involvement [^116xEmQP]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

To describe a patient presenting with the rare findings of synchronous parathyroid adenoma and parathyroid sarcoidosis, we analyze the case of a 67-year-old man who developed severe hypercalcemia after successful parathyroidectomy.

- **Methods**: The study describes the clinical history, physical examination findings, laboratory values, imaging findings, and pathologic data of the patient.

- **Results**: Initial blood test results showed: calcium at 11.1 mg/dL (reference range, 8.5–10.6 mg/dL); albumin at 4.0 g/dL (reference range, 3.2–5.2 g/dL); intact parathyroid hormone at 166 pg/mL (reference range, 10–69 pg/mL); creatinine at 1.9 mg/dL; 25-hydroxyvitamin D at 15 ng/mL (reference range, 30–80 ng/mL); and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D at 44 pg/mL (reference range, 16–72 pg/mL). A chest x-ray was normal, but delayed images from a technetium Tc 99m sestamibi scan showed increased activity in the right lower pole of the thyroid. Two months post-parathyroidectomy, the patient was admitted to the hospital with a serum calcium concentration of 17 mg/dL. Pathological examination of the resected gland confirmed the diagnosis of parathyroid adenoma, and further review disclosed noncaseating granulomas within the adenoma.

- **Conclusions**: Sarcoidosis with parathyroid involvement causing severe hypercalcemia is unique to this case. Hypercalcemia after successful resection of a parathyroid adenoma may require consideration of potential causes other than the initial diagnosis.

### Hypercalcemic crisis: A clinical review [^115Pifru]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a common metabolic perturbation. However, hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency with little clinical scientific data to support therapeutic strategies. We conducted a review of relevant scientific English literature on this topic by searching PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar for articles published between 1930 and June 2014. The keywords used in our search included "hypercalcemic crisis", "hyperparathyroid crisis", "parathyroid storm", "severe primary hyperparathyroidism", "acute hyperparathyroidism", and "severe hypercalcemia". These articles pertained to the diagnosis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, and treatment strategies of hypercalcemic crisis.

Despite extensive clinical experience, large and well-designed clinical studies to direct appropriate clinical care are lacking. Nonetheless, morbidity and mortality rates have substantially decreased since early series reported almost universal fatality. Improved outcomes can be attributed to modern diagnostic capabilities, leading to earlier diagnosis, along with the recognition that primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common etiology for hypercalcemic crisis. Hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency that portends excellent outcomes if rapid diagnosis, medical treatment, and definitive surgical treatment are expedited.

### Calcitriol [^116sNWNi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Treatment of hypercalcemia and overdosage in predialysis patients**: If hypercalcemia ensues (greater than 1 mg/dL above the upper limit of the normal range), adjust the dosage to achieve normocalcemia by reducing calcitriol therapy from 0.5 mcg to 0.25 mcg daily. If the patient is receiving a therapy of 0.25 mcg daily, discontinue calcitriol until the patient becomes normocalcemic. Calcium supplements should also be reduced or discontinued. Serum calcium levels should be determined 1 week after the withdrawal of calcium supplements. If serum calcium levels have returned to normal, calcitriol therapy may be reinstituted at a dosage of 0.25 mcg/day if previous therapy was at a dosage of 0.5 mcg/day. If calcitriol therapy was previously administered at a dosage of 0.25 mcg/day, calcitriol therapy may be reinstituted at a dosage of 0.25 mcg every other day. If hypercalcemia is persistent at the reduced dosage, serum PTH should be measured. If serum PTH is normal, discontinue calcitriol therapy and monitor the patient in 3 months' time.

- **Treatment of hyperphosphatemia in predialysis patients**: If serum phosphorus levels exceed 5.0 mg/dL to 5.5 mg/dL, a calcium-containing phosphate-binding agent (i.e. calcium carbonate or calcium acetate) should be taken with meals. Serum phosphorus levels should be determined as described earlier (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests). Aluminum-containing gels should be used with caution as phosphate-binding agents because of the risk of slow aluminum accumulation.

In specific circumstances of hypercalcemia of malignancy, particularly concerning patients with parathyroid carcinoma, the ES 2023 guidelines recommend considering the administration of a calcimimetic in adult patients. This is advised for cases of hypercalcemia due to parathyroid carcinoma that are not adequately controlled with IV bisphosphonate or denosumab.

### 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D suppresses circulating levels of parathyroid hormone in a patient with primary hyperparathyroidism and coexistent sarcoidosis [^116udzgo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

PTH is excessively secreted to develop hypercalcemia and accelerate bone turnover in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. PTH stimulates the production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] that, in turn, suppresses the synthesis of PTH in parathyroid cells.

The objective of the study was to clarify whether 1,25(OH)2D indeed inhibits circulating levels of PTH and influences bone turnover, even in a patient with primary hyperparathyroidism. We evaluated PTH levels in a patient with primary hyperparathyroidism and coexistent sarcoidosis whose serum 1,25(OH)2D levels were independent of PTH. The present case was treated with prednisolone before and after surgical resection of parathyroid adenoma, and Ca-regulating hormones and bone markers were measured.

Serum Ca and PTH levels significantly decreased after parathyroid surgery, whereas serum 1,25(OH)2D levels remained high. Prednisolone administration promptly decreased serum 1,25(OH)2D levels and reciprocally increased PTH levels despite consistent serum Ca levels either before or after surgery. PTH levels were negatively correlated with serum 1,25(OH)2D levels before and after surgery. Urine N-telopeptides, serum osteocalcin, and bone-type alkaline phosphatase all decreased to physiological ranges after parathyroid surgery.

These results suggest that 1,25(OH)2D indeed inhibits the production of PTH not to exacerbate hypercalcemia in a patient with primary hyperparathyroidism. Furthermore, PTH but not 1.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112KNAU1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Patients who require calcium repletion are at risk for hypercalciuria and/or hypercalcemia and need to be monitored closely because the effects of calcium and vitamin D supplementation are complex. Studies have reported a small but significant increase in hypercalcemia with calcium and vitamin D supplementation, with another finding that withdrawal of calcium and vitamin D supplementation improved the hypercalcemia. Whereas hypercalcemia caused by vitamin D supplementation did not cause sustained renal damage, vitamin D supplementation was shown to be ineffective in terms of improved bone health or other benefits. The committee had no basis to recommend routine vitamin D screening, but did recommend that both types of vitamin D testing (1,25-[OH] 2 and 25-[OH] vitamin D) be undertaken in patients who are being evaluated for possible vitamin D replacement.

- **Recommendations**:

	1. For patients with sarcoidosis who do not have symptoms or signs of hypercalcemia, we recommend baseline serum calcium testing to screen for abnormal calcium metabolism (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

	2. If assessment of vitamin D metabolism is deemed necessary in a patient with sarcoidosis, such as to determine if vitamin D replacement is indicated, we suggest measuring both 25- and 1,25-OH vitamin D levels before vitamin D replacement (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

- **Research needs**: Although the cause of abnormal calcium metabolism, hypercalcemia, and hypercalciuria appears to be multifactorial, better delineation of the mechanisms, such as genetic variations, is needed.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypercalcemia of malignancy, particularly in patients with calcitriol-secreting tumors, the ES 2023 guidelines recommend considering the administration of an IV bisphosphonate or denosumab. This is advised for adult patients with HCM from tumors associated with high calcitriol levels, such as lymphomas, who are already receiving corticosteroid therapy but continue to experience severe or symptomatic hypercalcemia.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111nZyhY]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The identification of risk factors for ocular sarcoidosis, particularly the more devastating forms of the disease, could obviate the need for screening all patients with sarcoidosis with eye exams. A better understanding of the natural history of ocular sarcoidosis, the identification of predictors of which patients will develop new onset of eye involvement after baseline negative screening and among those with active disease at baseline who will experience persistent or recurrent disease, and new diagnostic modalities are all needed.

In those who initially have no evidence of eye involvement, the committee recommends ophthalmology evaluation based on the development of new symptoms. However, additional research is needed to determine if there is a clinical benefit, such as earlier detection and more effective treatment, to routine eye exams compared with exams based on the development of symptoms. Finally, treatment trials that enroll patients with ocular sarcoidosis are needed, because most treatment trials have enrolled patients with uveitis of many causes, including sarcoidosis.

- **Best practice recommendations**: Evaluate for delayed onset of extrapulmonary sarcoidosis manifestations after negative baseline screening.

- **Question 4**: Should patients with sarcoidosis who do not have renal symptoms undergo screening for renal sarcoidosis by routine serum creatinine testing?

	- **Rationale for question**: Sarcoidosis can cause compromised kidney function in a subgroup of patients through two mechanisms: 1) parenchymal granulomatous inflammation or 2) direct effects on the kidney. Additional research is needed to assess the potential benefits and implications of routine renal screening in asymptomatic patients.

### Steroid responsive idiopathic calcitriol induced hypercalcemia: a case report and review of the literature [^11313rwF]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

A 51-year-old man originally from East Asia with a past medical history significant for hypertension was referred to nephrology due to recurrent kidney stones and elevated creatinine. The patient reported having kidney stones in 1989 and 2006 that passed spontaneously. In 2017, he was found to have bilateral symptomatic calcium kidney stones requiring lithotripsy. His kidney function has fluctuated (Cr 0.9–3.1 mg/dL) over the preceding two years, with consistent hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria (637 mg/24 hours), and low PTH level.

On examination in July 2019, the initial workup for possible causes of hypercalcemia showed suppressed intact PTH (iPTH) at 5 pg/mL, elevated calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) at 80.4 pg/mL, low calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D) at 15.1 ng/mL, parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) normal (< 2.0 pmol/L), and an elevated serum calcium (11.9 mg/dL) and creatinine (1.8 mg/dL). Additional tests, including serum protein electrophoresis, ACE levels, complete blood count, a whole-body bone scan, and urinalysis, were normal. An ultrasound of the neck, although not necessary, was also performed and found to be normal.

A chest X-ray showed a calcified granuloma, and a CT scan revealed an upper lobe solid nodule concerning for possible primary lung malignancy. An independent workup through pulmonology was negative for tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and lung malignancy.

During subsequent visits, the patient had a persistently elevated serum calcium level (11.3 mg/dL) and ionized calcium level (6.0 mg/dL). Given the lack of al

### Pamidronate disodium [^112oZfub]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and potassium, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with pamidronate disodium. Cases of asymptomatic hypophosphatemia (12%), hypokalemia (7%), hypomagnesemia (11%), and hypocalcemia (5%-12%) were reported in pamidronate disodium-treated patients. Rare cases of symptomatic hypocalcemia, including tetany, have been reported in association with pamidronate disodium therapy. If hypocalcemia occurs, short-term calcium therapy may be necessary. In Paget's disease of bone, 17% of patients treated with 90 mg of pamidronate disodium showed serum calcium levels below 8 mg/dL.

Patients with a history of thyroid surgery may have relative hypoparathyroidism, which may predispose them to hypocalcemia when treated with pamidronate disodium.

- **Renal insufficiency**: Pamidronate disodium is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of renal adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Patients who receive pamidronate disodium should have serum creatinine assessed prior to each treatment. In patients receiving pamidronate disodium for bone metastases, who show evidence of deterioration in renal function, pamidronate disodium treatment should be withheld until renal function returns to baseline (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

In clinical trials, patients with renal impairment (serum creatinine > 3.0 mg/dL) have not been studied. Limited pharmacokinetic data exist in patients with creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min.

### Rayaldee [^114MpTx8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Hypercalcemia may occur during RAYALDEE treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Acute hypercalcemia may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the effect of digitalis on the heart [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Severe hypercalcemia may require emergency attention.

Hypercalcemia may be exacerbated by concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations, thiazide diuretics, or other vitamin D compounds. Additionally, a high intake of calcium and phosphate concomitantly with vitamin D compounds may lead to hypercalciuria and hyperphosphatemia. In these circumstances, frequent serum calcium monitoring and RAYALDEE dose adjustments may be required. Patients with a history of hypercalcemia prior to initiating therapy with RAYALDEE should be monitored more frequently for possible hypercalcemia during therapy.

Patients should be informed about the symptoms of elevated serum calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination, and weight loss.

- **Digitalis toxicity**: Hypercalcemia of any cause, including RAYALDEE [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], increases the risk of digitalis toxicity. In patients using RAYALDEE concomitantly with digitalis compounds, monitor both serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity and increase the frequency of monitoring when initiating therapy.

- **Hypercalcemia**: Use caution in patients with sarcoidosis. Additionally, exercise caution in patients with vitamin D toxicity or hyperparathyroidism and use extreme caution in patients with chronic renal failure.

- **Tissue necrosis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as calcium chloride causes a transient increase in local calcium concentration.

### Steroid responsive idiopathic calcitriol induced hypercalcemia: A case report and review of the literature [^115tdfTA]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

The first report discussing idiopathic calcitriol induced hypercalcemia emerged in 1994, where Kreisberg explored all the possible etiologies of hypercalcemia and appropriate workups through clinical problem-solving. He never found a definitive diagnosis, and his patient improved on low-dose prednisone that was continued long-term. Evron et al. subsequently coined the term idiopathic calcitriol induced hypercalcemia, suggesting it as a possible diagnosis for three patients they treated. Their patients presented with low iPTH, high calcitriol, and high ACE levels. After finding no evidence of sarcoidosis and normalization of calcium levels post-prednisone treatment, they suggested the term idiopathic calcitriol induced hypercalcemia as a separate disease entity.

Rijckborst et al. consolidated the diagnosis further, describing one patient with low iPTH, high calcitriol, and high ACE levels. Their patient also underwent a robust investigative workup, demonstrating no clear etiology that could explain the observed hypercalcemia. Their patient also responded to prednisone but required a low maintenance dose to prevent disease recurrence.

Our patient's presentation and treatment course differ from those previously reported in respect to ACE levels. Elevated ACE levels in previous case reports led them to postulate alterations in macrophage function as a possible underlying mechanism for idiopathic calcitriol induced hypercalcemia. Low ACE levels in our patient might emphasize the need to look for alternative causes that could explain elevated calcitriol and calcium levels.

### Intramuscular synthol injections cause hypercalcemia in long-term observation: a case report study [^115h4hU2]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is one of the most common ionic disorders. It is diagnosed when the serum calcium concentration is greater than 10.5 mg/dL. While it is mainly associated with primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy, it can also be caused by multiple derangements. Almost every part of the body can be affected by excess calcium, and hypercalcemia might be very dangerous and even lethal.

- **Case presentation**: We report a rare trigger of increased serum calcium level — synthol intramuscular injections. A 60-year-old man who suffered from general weakness, weight loss, and acute kidney injury associated with unidentified hypercalcemia was under review for proper diagnosis. We excluded endocrine disorders, malignancies, sarcoidosis, and iatrogenic causes, the latter defined as medication-related. Patient history, physical examination, blood chemistry, 24-hour urine collection, computed tomography, and endoscopy were performed. Finally, the biopsy of muscle explained the source of the increased serum calcium concentrations.

- **Conclusions**: Hypercalcemia is a common disorder that has a wide range of triggers, with synthol intramuscular injections being among the causes of elevated serum calcium levels. It is important to make quick and accurate diagnoses and begin therapy. Unfortunately, surgical resection of the synthol seems to be the only reasonable option for hypercalcemia treatment.

### Serum vitamin D levels may not reflect tissue-level vitamin D in sarcoidosis [^1174AKph]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis is due to three mechanistic reasons:

1. Systemic conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by the enzyme 1-α hydroxylase produced by the activated monocyte/macrophage system.

2. Production of parathormone-related peptide (PTHrP) by the sarcoid granuloma.

3. Tissue-level conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by 1-α hydroxylase produced by the local monocyte/macrophage system in the sarcoid granuloma.

We report two cases of one proposed mechanism of hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis (mechanism 3). Both individuals presented with sarcoidosis and 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and developed symptomatic hypercalcemia with vitamin D replacement. Given their low serum parathormone and parathormone-related peptide levels, low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and normal serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the systemic 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency may not have reflected an increased activity of vitamin D at the local granulomatous tissue level.
