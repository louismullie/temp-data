## Question

Insulin treatment guidelines

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about insulin treatment guidelines across type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principle that insulin is mandatory in type 1 diabetes. Then, I should verify the indications and thresholds for initiating insulin in type 2 diabetes. Next, I will review initial insulin regimens and dosing strategies, followed by intensification pathways. After that, I need to check combination therapy principles, especially with GLP-1 receptor agonists. I will then examine delivery systems and technology, including pumps, pens, and CGM. I should also confirm hypoglycemia mitigation strategies and inpatient considerations. Finally, I will consider special populations, monitoring cadence, and practical implementation details, ensuring each step aligns with ADA 2025, AACE 2022/2023, and other high-credibility sources.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle for type 1 diabetes: insulin is life-saving and mandatory from diagnosis because of absent or near-absent beta-cell function, so there is no acceptable alternative to exogenous insulin therapy in T1D, and this must be communicated clearly at diagnosis to prevent DKA and metabolic decompensation [^113Fuftq] [^113ZkRcn] [^115aTE5K].

> I need to ensure the initial regimen for T1D is physiologic and intensive. Most adults should start either multiple daily injections with basal and prandial insulin or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, and insulin analogs are preferred over human insulin to reduce hypoglycemia risk, with education on carbohydrate counting, correction dosing, sick-day rules, and activity adjustments provided up front [^112jAm3o] [^117Pbtp3] [^112KrFgn] [^115dH2RA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about targets. I should double-check that glycemic goals are individualized, but for most nonpregnant adults with T1D an A1C less than 7% is reasonable, with less stringent targets if there is severe hypoglycemia or comorbidity, and more ambitious targets if safely achievable, which aligns with DCCT-derived outcomes and contemporary guideline consensus [^116DyzQg].

> Next, I should review T2D indications for insulin. Insulin is indicated when dual or triple noninsulin therapy fails to reach individualized A1C targets, or when there is symptomatic hyperglycemia, very high A1C above 10%, or glucose above 300 mg/dL, and importantly, insulin should not be delayed in these settings because of the risk of glucotoxicity and beta-cell dysfunction [^111sf3fo] [^11246oyE] [^117KNptN].

> Wait, let me verify the initial regimen choice. For most adults with T2D starting insulin, basal insulin once daily is preferred, with starting doses commonly 10 units or 0.1–0.2 units/kg/day, titrated every few days to a fasting glucose target, and I should confirm that metformin and other beneficial agents are continued unless contraindicated to preserve cardiometabolic and renal benefits [^111n1nm5] [^114osk1i].

> I will now examine intensification after basal insulin. If A1C remains above goal despite optimized basal therapy, I should consider adding a single prandial injection at the largest meal (basal-plus), then expand to full basal–bolus if needed, or consider fixed-ratio basal insulin/GLP-1 RA combinations to address both fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia while mitigating weight gain and hypoglycemia, and I need to ensure we avoid overbasalization by reassessing when total basal dose approaches about 0.5 units/kg/day [^1128RZ2h] [^111vBSgY] [^116nihrb].

> Let me think about combination therapy. GLP-1 receptor agonists, including dual GIP/GLP-1 agents, are strongly recommended to be combined with insulin when appropriate because they improve A1C, reduce hypoglycemia, and promote weight loss, and I should remember to down-titrate insulin when adding or escalating GLP-1 therapy to reduce hypoglycemia risk [^111vBSgY] [^114osk1i].

> I should confirm delivery system choices. Insulin pens or injection aids improve accuracy and comfort, especially for patients with dexterity or vision limitations, and connected pens can support dose tracking and adherence, while in T1D, CGM is recommended for most patients and automated insulin delivery should be offered when available, with structured education and device support to ensure safe use [^114VJLFB] [^114LirnR] [^11197o3G] [^115dH2RA].

> But wait, what if hypoglycemia risk is high? I need to ensure structured education programs are in place, prescribe glucagon for all on intensive insulin or at high hypoglycemia risk with training of caregivers, and prefer rapid-acting analogs over regular insulin in those at high hypoglycemia risk to reduce hypoglycemia frequency and severity [^112sbFB5] [^112AgDdn] [^115E9U69].

> Next, I should review inpatient care. Basal–bolus insulin is preferred for most hospitalized patients with diabetes, with continuation of home pump therapy if feasible and safe, and I should double-check that DKA management protocols generally recommend starting basal insulin after initial resuscitation and electrolyte management, though emerging literature suggests potential benefits to earlier basal initiation in select contexts, which still warrants caution and protocol alignment [^111Lu2jG] [^1171A7j8].

> I will now consider special populations. In older adults with T1D, I should individualize targets and simplify regimens when appropriate, in youth with T2D, insulin is indicated if A1C is 10% or higher or if there is symptomatic hyperglycemia, and in pregnancy, insulin is first-line when pharmacotherapy is needed, with careful maternal–fetal glycemic targets and monitoring plans [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the monitoring cadence. Insulin regimens and overall diabetes plans should be reassessed every 3–6 months to adjust for changes in comorbidities, adherence, hypoglycemia, and glycemic trajectory, and I need to ensure we do not delay treatment modification when goals are not being met, as therapeutic inertia worsens outcomes [^114ApWJk] [^112UhBgF].

> Let me reconsider practical implementation. Shared decision-making is essential to align regimen complexity with patient capacity, and when regimens become too burdensome, simplification strategies such as fixed-ratio combinations or fewer daily injections can maintain control while reducing treatment burden and distress, which I should proactively discuss with patients facing adherence challenges [^116vp2g2] [^114UhzHN].

> Finally, I should confirm that my synthesis aligns with the highest-credibility sources. ADA 2025 Standards, AACE 2022/2023 algorithms, and the Endocrine Society technology guidance collectively support these recommendations on insulin as mandatory in T1D, timely initiation in T2D with basal-first strategies, structured intensification, combination therapy with GLP-1 RAs, and broad integration of CGM and pumps where appropriate, which anchors the clinical flow I have outlined [^111n1nm5] [^114ApWJk] [^115AEUmT].

Insulin therapy is **mandatory for type 1 diabetes** [^113Fuftq] and indicated for type 2 diabetes when A1c remains above goal despite dual/triple therapy or when there is symptomatic hyperglycemia (A1c ≥ 10% or glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL) [^111sf3fo] [^11246oyE]. Start with **basal insulin** [^115Aznhy] (10 units or 0.1–0.2 units/kg/day) and titrate every 2–3 days to fasting glucose 80–130 mg/dL; add prandial insulin if A1c remains above goal [^1128RZ2h]. Use insulin analogs to reduce hypoglycemia [^117Pbtp3] and combine with metformin or GLP-1 RAs when possible to improve glycemic control and limit weight gain [^114osk1i] [^111vBSgY]. Individualize targets, monitor for hypoglycemia, and provide education on dosing, sick days, and injection technique [^112KrFgn] [^115aTE5K].

## Indications for insulin therapy

### Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)

In T1DM, **insulin is essential** [^113Fuftq] because of absolute insulin deficiency; all patients require lifelong therapy [^notfound]. Physiologic regimens (basal–bolus or CSII) are recommended to mimic normal insulin secretion [^112jAm3o] [^1151QRQF].

---

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)

- **General indication**: Insulin is indicated when noninsulin therapy fails to achieve individualized A1c targets or when symptomatic hyperglycemia occurs [^11246oyE] [^111sf3fo].

- **A1c thresholds**: Consider insulin when A1c ≥ 7.5% despite dual/triple therapy; initiate when A1c ≥ 10% or glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL with symptoms [^111sf3fo] [^1144h4Fo].

- **Progressive nature**: Most patients with T2DM eventually require insulin as beta-cell function declines [^115Aznhy].

---

## Initial insulin regimens and dosing

### Basal insulin initiation

- **First-line**: Start basal insulin (glargine, detemir, degludec) at 10 units nightly or 0.1–0.2 units/kg/day [^115Aznhy] [^111n1nm5].

- **Titration**: Adjust every 2–3 days to fasting glucose 80–130 mg/dL; typical adjustments are 2–4 units.

- **A1c-based dosing**: If A1c > 8%, consider 0.2–0.3 units/kg/day [^113inzCN].

---

### Prandial insulin addition

Add prandial insulin (rapid-acting analogs) if A1c remains above goal despite optimized basal therapy and fasting control [^116UP1nn]. A **stepwise approach** — adding one injection at the largest meal and escalating as needed — is recommended [^1128RZ2h].

---

### Fixed-ratio combinations

Fixed-ratio basal insulin/GLP-1 RA combinations (e.g. insulin degludec/liraglutide) can simplify regimens, reduce hypoglycemia, and aid weight control [^111vBSgY] [^112uaVYK].

---

## Insulin analogs versus human insulin

Insulin analogs are preferred in T1DM and in T2DM at high hypoglycemia risk because they better mimic physiologic insulin and reduce hypoglycemia [^117Pbtp3] [^115E9U69]. Human insulin remains effective and may be used when cost or access limits analog use [^114nHTER].

---

## Individualization of insulin therapy

- **Patient factors**: Tailor to age, comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, lifestyle, and preferences [^116DyzQg].

- **Glycemic targets**: Individualize A1c goals; typical targets are A1c < 7% for most, < 8% for frail or high-risk patients, and < 6.5% if safely achievable [^116DyzQg].

- **Shared decision-making**: Engage patients in regimen choices to improve adherence and outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

- **Self-monitoring**: Use SMBG or CGM to guide titration and detect hypoglycemia [^115Aznhy].

- **CGM**: Strongly recommended for T1DM and for T2DM on intensive insulin to improve A1c and reduce hypoglycemia [^115dH2RA] [^11478i8u].

- **Regular follow-up**: Reassess every 3–6 months and adjust therapy to maintain targets [^115aTE5K].

---

## Hypoglycemia management

Provide structured education on recognition, prevention, and treatment of hypoglycemia [^112sbFB5]. Prescribe **glucagon** for patients on intensive insulin or at high hypoglycemia risk, and train caregivers [^112AgDdn].

---

## Special populations and clinical scenarios

| **Population/scenario** | **Recommendations** |
|-|-|
| Elderly | - Individualize targets <br/> - Prefer basal analogs <br/> - Simplify regimens to reduce hypoglycemia |
| Pregnancy (GDM/T2DM) | Insulin is first-line; use NPH, detemir, and rapid-acting analogs as appropriate |
| Renal impairment | - Reduce insulin doses as clearance declines <br/> - Monitor closely for hypoglycemia |
| Hospitalized patients | - Basal–bolus insulin preferred <br/> - Use insulin for hyperglycemia in critical care |

---

## Patient education and support

Education should cover injection technique, site rotation, sick-day management, and hypoglycemia handling [^112KrFgn]. Provide access to diabetes educators, nutritionists, and support groups to improve adherence and outcomes [^114ApWJk].

---

Insulin therapy is essential in **T1DM** and indicated in **T2DM** when other therapies fail or hyperglycemia is severe. Start with basal insulin, titrate to fasting targets, add prandial insulin as needed, and use analogs to reduce **hypoglycemia**. Individualize care, monitor closely, and provide education to optimize outcomes [^113Fuftq] [^11246oyE] [^111sf3fo] [^115WAW3q] [^1128RZ2h] [^117Pbtp3] [^112KrFgn].

### Expert opinion: patient selection for premixed insulin formulations in diabetes care [^114mtwZ2]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic management of diabetes have been formulated by the IDF, American Diabetes Association (ADA), and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and American College of Endocrinology (ACE). The approach to insulin therapy has been described in multiple guidelines for diabetes. The ADA has described an algorithm for the initiation of insulin therapy with basal insulin and the stepwise inclusion of rapid-acting and premixed insulins. The IDF and AACE/ACE have also described a comprehensive algorithm for adding or intensifying insulin in persons with type 2 diabetes. The AACE/ACE explores factors that should be considered when selecting a formulation for insulin initiation, including age, life expectancy, motivation, presence of complications, overall health status, and cost of formulations. In these guidelines, the key disease characteristics influencing the choice for initiation and continuation of therapy include the duration and severity of diabetes. Though these guidelines provide elaborate algorithms for insulin therapy, criteria for regimen and formulation selection are inadequately addressed. The guidelines, which largely focused on basal and rapid-acting insulins, do not include directions for use of all available formulations.

The East African Diabetes Study Group (EADSG) Guidelines recommend that insulin therapy in people with diabetes should not be delayed and patients should be educated about insulin regimens, choice of formulations for treatment, and regular monitoring of glycemic control. These guidelines together with those of the Research Society for the Study of Diabetes in India (RSSDI) and the Society for Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes of South Africa have explained practical aspects of insulin regimens in detail, providing a patient-centered approach to initiation and intensification of therapy.

There are some guidelines that provide directions for the initiation and intensification of insulin therapy with premixed insulin. However, these guidelines do not compare the premixed insulin preparations with other insulin preparations. In addition, these guidelines do not specifically describe the patient characteristics that prompt a preference for premixed insulins. In this article, we identify the gaps in current practices and build an objective, rational approach to patient selection for premixed insulins. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not involve any new studies of human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors.

Absence of Guidance on Treatment Simplification in Clinical Guidelines

Guidelines recommend achieving individual glycaemic goals through personalising care, using shared decision-making, which should include regular assessment of the person's individual circumstances. There is a need to find a balance between the relative risks of relaxing glucose targets by simplifying glucose-lowering therapy and keeping a complex regimen which could increase treatment burden. This is particularly relevant when considering age-related comorbidities, or those who struggle with adherence. It is also crucial that healthcare practitioners (HCPs) engage in open discussions with individuals when evaluating this personalised care, to ensure their preferences are respected and to increase the likelihood of treatment being adequately incorporated into the person's everyday life. Indeed, diabetes treatment should not only fit the point-of-care but also the individual's current personal situation.

The aim of this article is to provide HCPs with practical recommendations on simplifying complex insulin treatment regimens in people with T2D, based on the conclusions from a consensus group meeting and to highlight some of the issues with illustrative cases.

### International diabetes federation guideline for management of postmeal glucose: a review of recommendations [^113zhFVv]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Relevance of guideline and implications

The importance of managing PMG to improve overall glycaemic control in diabetes is now fairly widely recognized in guidelines from professional associations. As the research base continues to expand, the answers to other relevant questions are eagerly anticipated, such as whether there is a causal association between PMG and macrovascular complications and the role of SMBG in individuals who are not on insulin therapy. Until that time, logic and clinical judgment preside when interpreting the evidence presented in the guideline and deciding on an optimal management plan. Management strategies should depend on a practical evaluation of how best to integrate the recommendations into modern practice, with consideration to locally available therapies and resources.

Introduction

Given the chronic and progressive nature of type 2 diabetes (T2D), most people with T2D undergo treatment intensification with the aim of ensuring adequate glycaemic control and preventing or delaying long-term complications. As per American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines, lifestyle modifications should be implemented first, followed by oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). Insulin therapies are often added in a stepwise manner when glycaemic control has failed with other agents, starting with basal insulin in combination with OADs, with or without a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). If glycaemic targets are still not achieved, treatment is further intensified through the use of a premixed insulin injection, fixed-ratio combinations (FRCs) of basal insulin and a GLP-1 RA or a basal-prandial or basal-bolus insulin regimen. In some countries, the last of these is often considered the final treatment option. In this article, the use of 'fixed-ratio combination' or 'FRC' refers only to a combined formulation of basal insulin and a GLP-1 RA.

T2D is highly heterogenous in nature, with a number of subgroups with predominance of insulin deficiency having been identified, accounting for 20–25% of newly diagnosed cases in adults. This highlights that, alongside forming a part of multimodal glucose-lowering treatment regimens, insulin continues to be relevant as a primary therapy. Measuring insulin secretory capacity also represents a potential tool for tailoring treatment strategies, particularly in older individuals (65 years of age or more).

Achieving and maintaining glycaemic targets is associated with a reduction in the risk of developing long-term micro- and macrovascular complications of T2D. However, many individuals fail to achieve adequate lowering of glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c), even when using complex insulin regimens. Real-world data show that approximately 25% of people do not achieve their target glycaemic goals when treated with basal-bolus insulin.

### Expert opinion on current trends in the use of insulin in the management of people with type 2 diabetes from the south-Eastern European region and Israel [^117KNptN]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

During the expert meeting, participants reviewed the routine clinical practice, current diabetes management guidelines and recommendations followed in the South-Eastern European region and Israel, which particularly focused on patient characteristics and other factors to be considered for selecting a diabetes treatment regimen. During the meeting, the experts univocally agreed that glycaemic control in PwT2D is far from target and that treatment inertia plays a major role in suboptimal glycaemic control. Furthermore, considering the real-world scenarios, the experts sought to provide recommendations for diabetes management based on available clinical evidence and their real-time experience in clinical settings.

Right Time for Insulin Initiation

Timely initiation of insulin in PwT2D has been associated with multi-faceted benefits, such as decreasing glucotoxic effects of hyperglycaemia, preserving β-cell mass/function, improving insulin sensitivity and long-term protection from chronic complications. In clinical practice, the timing of insulin treatment initiation is mostly based on diabetes duration and if glycaemic targets are not attained with the use of OADs (single/multiple) or other injectables (Table 1).

Table 1
Indication for insulin initiation or intensification in people with type 2 diabetes

Severe or symptomatic hyperglycaemia — unexpected weight loss, polyuria, polydyspia, HbA1c > 10%, blood glucose > 16.7 mmol/l

BI basal insulin, i.v. pump continuous intravenous insulin pump therapy, MDI multiple daily insulin injection, sc. pump continuous subcutaneous insulin pump therapy

Newly Diagnosed T2D

Multiple studies have shown that early short-term intensive insulin therapy in newly diagnosed individuals with T2D can improve β-cell function and insulin resistance by eliminating glucotoxicity and lead to drug-free glycaemic remission for up to 2 years. Furthermore, insulin as a treatment option is used in cases of severe hyperglycaemia (blood glucose [BG] levels > 300 mg/dl [16.7 mmol/l], HbA 1c > 10%).

However, the experts agreed that de-escalation to OADs/SGLT-2i/GLP-1 RA after early insulin treatment is possible to preserve long-lasting glycaemic control, considering the disease pathophysiology and recommendations from current guidelines.

### Insulin therapy in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus: a narrative review [^116DyzQg]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Glycemic Targets

The large-scale prospective Diabetes Control and Complications Trial conclusively showed that intensive glycemic control with a basal-bolus insulin treatment regimen (reaching glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] levels of approx. 7%) is associated with reduced microvascular risk with respect to retinopathy, neuropathy, and diabetic kidney disease and reduced long-term cardiovascular risk compared with conventional glycemic control with fixed dosing insulin regimens (reaching HbA1c levels of approx. 9%). These results form the basis of current guideline recommendations. In general, evidence-based glycemic target recommendations by the ADA, Diabetes Canada, and NICE for adults with T1DM are all in agreement (Table 2). All recommend an HbA1c goal of < 7% (53 mmol/mol; level A) for most nonpregnant adults, < 8% (64 mmol/mol) for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia or severe comorbidities (level B), and < 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) if this goal is achievable without the risk of significant hypoglycemia or other adverse events (level C). Similarly, Diabetes Canada recommends a target HbA1c of ≤ 7% (53 mmol/mol) for most patients with T1DM. NICE recommends a target HbA1c of ≤ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) for most patients with T1DM but suggests considering a person's daily activities, aspirations, likelihood of complications, comorbidities, occupation, and history of hypoglycemia when setting individualized targets.

### Optimum management of type 2 diabetes – timely introduction, optimization and intensification of basal insulin [^116v9XYS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

The natural progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) requires continuing medical care, early insulin intensification and patient self-management education to reduce the risk of long-term complications, including microvascular and macrovascular complications. However, too few people are on insulin, and all too commonly have poor glycaemic control. This paradigm significantly increases the risk for long-term complications. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the early introduction of basal insulin, such as insulin glargine, is essential to provide clinically important improvements in glycaemic control. In this review, we discuss the rationale for the earlier insulinization in T2DM in order to reach and maintain treatment targets and to provide further support for the recent American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes consensus statement.

### Insulin matters: a practical approach to basal insulin management in type 2 diabetes [^112XiN6n]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Several factors underlie the importance of the initiative put forth by this expert panel: there is a rising prevalence of diabetes; half of the T2D population is not at target, among which 61% were receiving insulin therapy, suggesting delayed insulin initiation and intensification; there are multiple titration algorithms to choose from which adds to the confusion and complexity for patients and providers; and the arrival of new long-acting basal insulins and other pharmacological and technological advances that require consideration. This document was developed by a multidisciplinary panel to address frequently asked questions on insulin initiation and titration, and it establishes simple and practical guidelines for diabetes HCPs for effective initiation and titration of basal insulin, with the intent that it may translate to effective glycemic outcomes in clinical practice.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^112nAFox]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The epidemic of type 2 diabetes and the recognition that achieving specific glycemic goals can substantially reduce morbidity have made the effective treatment of hyperglycemia a top priority. While the management of hyperglycemia, the hallmark metabolic abnormality associated with type 2 diabetes, has historically taken center stage in the treatment of diabetes, therapies directed at other coincident features, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, hypercoagulability, obesity, and insulin resistance, have also been a major focus of research and therapy. Maintaining glycemic levels as close to the nondiabetic range as possible has been demonstrated to have a powerful beneficial effect on diabetes-specific microvascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, in the setting of type 1 diabetes; in type 2 diabetes, more intensive treatment strategies have likewise been demonstrated to reduce microvascular complications. Intensive glycemic management resulting in lower A1C levels has also been shown to have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications in type 1 diabetes; however, current studies have failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of intensive diabetes therapy on CVD in type 2 diabetes.

The development of new classes of blood glucose–lowering medications to supplement the older therapies, such as lifestyle-directed interventions, insulin, sulfonylureas, and metformin, has increased the number of treatment options available for type 2 diabetes. Whether used alone or in combination with other blood glucose–lowering interventions, the increased number of choices available to practitioners and patients has heightened uncertainty regarding the most appropriate means of treating this widespread disease. Although numerous reviews on the management of type 2 diabetes have been published in recent years, practitioners are often left without a clear pathway of therapy to follow. We developed the following consensus approach to the management of hyperglycemia in the nonpregnant adult to help guide health care providers in choosing the most appropriate interventions for their patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Evidence-based recommendations for insulin intensification strategies after basal insulin in type 2 diabetes [^115sgDCs]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Over the time due to progressive nature of diabetes, proactive intensification of the existing insulin therapy becomes imminent as it minimizes patients' exposure to chronic hypo/hyperglycaemia and reduces weight gain while achieving individualized glycaemic targets. This review focuses on the strength of evidence behind various options for intensification, primarily the insulins as also the GLP-1 analogues. The recommendations presented here are meant to serve as a guide for the physician managing type 2 diabetes patients requiring insulin intensification upon failing of basal insulin therapy.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to insulin therapy, indications, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to provide education on how to match mealtime insulin doses to carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake to improve glycemic outcomes and QoL and minimize hypoglycemia risk. Provide also education on how to modify the insulin dose (correction dose) based on concurrent glycemia, glycemic trends (if available), sick-day management, and anticipated physical activity.

Type 2 diabetes — antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy principles and initial therapy: The goal of antihyperglycemic treatment is to achieve clinical and laboratory targets with minimal adverse effects and reduce diabetes-related complications, and minimizing the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain and maximizing cardiovascular and renal benefits should be priorities. As monotherapy, most noninsulin agents reduce A1C by 0.5% to 2.0%. Metformin is often the preferred initial therapy for most persons with new-onset type 2 diabetes and, once initiated, should be continued as long as it is tolerated and not contraindicated; it can be used in combination with virtually all other antihyperglycemic agents, including insulin, when monotherapy does not reach the glycemic target.

Description

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) updates the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes annually to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, payers, and other interested parties with evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of diabetes.

Methods

To develop the 2020 Standards, the ADA Professional Practice Committee, comprising physicians, adult and pediatric endocrinologists, diabetes educators, registered dietitians, epidemiologists, pharmacists, and public health experts, continuously searched MEDLINE (English language only) from 15 October 2018 through August-September 2019 for pertinent studies, including high-quality trials that addressed pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes. The committee selected and reviewed the studies, developed the recommendations, and solicited feedback from the larger clinical community.

Recommendations

This synopsis focuses on guidance relating to the pharmacologic treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. Recommendations address oral and noninsulin injectable therapies, insulin treatment, and combination injectable therapies. Results of recent large trials with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are emphasized.

### Where are we now? A clinicians' guide to the use of follow-on insulin for patients with diabetes [^114oinAR]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Insulin has been used as a standard treatment for patients with diabetes for almost 100 years. Over time, advances in insulin development have improved its pharmacologic properties. (Online access: http://courses.elseviercme.com/t2dm/666). Most recently, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a novel, follow-on basal insulin agent, with more expected to be commercially available in the near future. With the imminent availability of follow-on basal insulin agents, clinicians need to be aware of the potential benefits and concerns in order to facilitate informed decision making and to provide the best possible advice and guidance to their patients with diabetes. This program will review how follow-on insulin products are developed, manufactured, and receive regulatory approval; evaluate clinical trial data for new and emerging follow-on basal insulin agents; and provide practical information and guidance on how they may be incorporated into clinical practice. While it is unknown how follow-on basal insulins will affect patient outcomes, they have the potential to increase access to treatment among patients with diabetes and reduce healthcare costs.

### Expert opinion on current trends in the use of insulin in the management of people with type 2 diabetes from the south-Eastern European region and Israel [^112BmTwc]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the availability of various antihyperglycaemic therapies and comprehensive guidelines, glycaemic control in diabetes management has not improved significantly during the last decade in the real-world clinical setting. Treatment inertia arising from a complex interplay among patient-, clinician- and healthcare-system-related factors is the prime reason for this suboptimal glycaemic control. Also, the key factor leading to inadequate glycaemic levels remains limited communication between healthcare professionals (HCPs) and people with type 2 diabetes (PwT2D). Early insulin administration has several advantages including reduced glucotoxicity, high efficacy and preserved β-cell mass/function, leading to lowering the risk of diabetes complications. The current publication is based on consensus of experts from the South-Eastern European region and Israel who reviewed the existing evidence and guidelines for the treatment of PwT2D. Herein, the experts emphasised the timely use of insulin, preferably second-generation basal insulin (BI) analogues and intensification using basal-plus therapy, as the most-potent glucose-lowering treatment choice in the real-world clinical setting. Despite an increase in the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), the experts urged timely insulin initiation for inadequate glycaemic control in PwT2D. Furthermore, the combination of BI and GLP-1 RA addressing both fasting plasma glucose and post-prandial excursions as a free- or fixed-ratio combination was identified to reduce treatment complexity and burden. To minimise discontinuation and improve adherence, the experts reiterated quality, regular interactions and discussions between HCPs and PwT2D/carers for their involvement in the diabetes management decision-making process. Clinicians and HCPs should consider the opinions of the experts in accordance with the most recent recommendations for diabetes management.

The lack of reliable data on insulin use in the region necessitates the need for high-quality studies to be carried out in East Africa; they will help in making treatment decisions in diabetes management.

We hope that the current guidelines will be a useful reference tool to all health care professionals in East Africa and will lead to an improvement in the optimal care of diabetes in the region. These guidelines will be updated with respect to newer evidence and newer insulin formulations that will be available on the East African market in the near future and based on further observational research, involving large numbers of physicians and in the setting of routine outpatient care of diabetes in the Eastern Africa region.

The recommendations for lifestyle modification, target values for glucose control, glycemic hexads targets, stepwise approach such as insulin initiation, titration, and intensification in diabetes patients, SMBG, hypoglycemia, weight gain, and psychosocial aspects, and recommendations in special populations and special situations in Eastern Africa regions were presented, debated, and appraised by the EADSG Guidelines Development Task Force at two meetings held in November 2017 and January 2018 and based on the current global guidelines.

Indications for the initiation of insulin therapy and the type of insulin to be used (human vs analogues) along with advantages and disadvantages of each insulin regimen were extensively discussed. Where there was insufficient evidence, the EADSG Guidelines Development Task Force resorted to an evidence-based consensus to arrive at the guideline. The guidelines were drafted and circulated for further review by the group members and other external reviewers within and outside Africa. The EADSG Guidelines: Insulin Therapy in Diabetes document was finalized as a simple, unbiased, and relevant guideline for the Eastern African settings to ensure patient values as a base for all clinical decisions.

The hierarchical system of classifying the evidence is used in these guidelines where applicable, including the levels of evidence (LoE) (Table 1) and grade practice recommendations (Table 2).

### Expert panel guidance and narrative review of treatment simplification of complex insulin regimens to improve outcomes in type 2 diabetes [^114UhzHN]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Given the progressive nature of type 2 diabetes (T2D), most individuals with the disease will ultimately undergo treatment intensification. This usually involves the stepwise addition of a new glucose-lowering agent or switching to a more complex insulin regimen. However, complex treatment regimens can result in an increased risk of hypoglycaemia and high treatment burden, which may impact negatively on both therapeutic adherence and overall quality of life. Individuals with good glycaemic control may also be overtreated with unnecessarily complex regimens. Treatment simplification aims to reduce individual treatment burden, without compromising therapeutic effectiveness or safety. Despite data showing that simplifying therapy can achieve good glycaemic control without negatively impacting on treatment efficacy or safety, it is not always implemented in clinical practice. Current clinical guidelines focus on treatment intensification, rather than simplification. Where simplification is recommended, clear guidance is lacking and mostly focused on treatment of the elderly. An expert, multidisciplinary panel evaluated the current treatment landscape with respect to guidance, published evidence, recommendations and approaches regarding simplification of complex insulin regimens. This article outlines the benefits of treatment simplification and provides practical recommendations on simplifying complex insulin treatment strategies in people with T2D using illustrative cases.

Personalisation of Care and Psychosocial Aspects Are the Key Drivers

Individualised treatment targets are often not met in a large proportion of people with T2D, despite the emphasis in clinical guidelines on the importance of personalisation of care. When creating management plans, guidelines recommend actively involving the individual with the use of shared decision-making and highlight the need for regular assessment of the individual's personal circumstances and their adherence to treatment. Personalised care should consider the impact on the individual's QoL, which is frequently compromised by complex treatment regimens, especially when insulin regimens with MDI or premixed formulations are introduced. It is also important to consider the psychological impact of complex therapy. Individuals can experience diabetes distress as a consequence of their fear of hypoglycaemia and other complications or the potential negative impact of therapy on work or relationships, and anxiety around daily activities being restricted by their treatment regimen. However, current guidelines do not offer explicit guidance or tools on how to give individuals a better understanding of their condition and its management. Subsequently, HCPs often fail to address individual preferences because of a lack of time and resources (tools to aid shared decision-making, etc.) and uncertainties with respect to the impact of agreed treatment decisions.

### Identification of barriers to insulin therapy and approaches to overcoming them [^116NYtWv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Poor glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global problem despite the availability of numerous glucose-lowering therapies and clear guidelines for T2D management. Tackling clinical or therapeutic inertia, where the person with diabetes and/or their healthcare providers do not intensify treatment regimens despite this being appropriate, is key to improving patients' long-term outcomes. This gap between best practice and current level of care is most pronounced when considering insulin regimens, with studies showing that insulin initiation/intensification is frequently and inappropriately delayed for several years. Patient- and physician-related factors both contribute to this resistance at the stages of insulin initiation, titration and intensification, impeding achievement of optimal glycaemic control. The present review evaluates the evidence and reasons for this delay, together with available methods for facilitation of insulin initiation or intensification.

### Personalizing guidelines for diabetes management: twilight or dawn of the expert? [^111PKqb5]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This opinion article on the management of type 2 diabetes considers the old and new format of guidelines and critical changes in the character of such guidelines. We highlight limitations of the guidelines and make recommendations for how treatment can be more personalised.

Discussion

Published guidelines for the management of adult-onset non-insulin requiring diabetes have adopted a formulaic approach to patient management that can be overseen centrally and delivered by personnel with limited training. Recently, guidelines have taken a patient-centered, multiple risk-factor approach. Importantly, local funding issues are considered, but drive the final action and not the decision-making process. The nature of the disease can be determined by laboratory tests, including screening for diabetes-associated autoantibodies. The strategy remains step-up, with intensification of drug or insulin dose. As with past guidelines, there is an assumption that in each patient with type 2 diabetes, metformin is used initially, but targets and therapies then veer in different directions to create a matrix of options based on the features and responses of each individual. Factors to consider include: (A)ge, (B)ody weight, (C)omplications and co-morbidities, Diabetes (D)uration and (E)xpense, but also patient preference and patient response.

Summary

Guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes have important limitations and a patient-centered, multiple target, multiple therapy approach is proposed.

### EADSG guidelines: insulin therapy in diabetes [^1144h4Fo]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Executive Summary and Recommendations

A diagnosis of diabetes or hyperglycemia should be confirmed prior to ordering, dispensing, or administering insulin (A).
Insulin is the primary treatment in all patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) (A).
Typically, patients with T1DM will require initiation with multiple daily injections at the time of diagnosis. This is usually short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogue given 0 to 15 min before meals together with one or more daily separate injections of intermediate or long-acting insulin. Two or three premixed insulin injections per day may be used (A).
The target glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for all children with T1DM, including preschool children, is recommended to be < 7.5% (< 58 mmol/mol). The target is chosen aiming at minimizing hyperglycemia, severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemic unawareness, and reducing the likelihood of development of long-term complications (B).
For patients prone to glycemic variability, glycemic control is best evaluated by a combination of results with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (B).
Indications for exogenous insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) include acute illness or surgery, pregnancy, glucose toxicity, contraindications to or failure to achieve goals with oral antidiabetic medications, and a need for flexible therapy (B).
In T2DM patients, with regards to achieving glycemic goals, insulin is considered alone or in combination with oral agents when HbA1c is ≥ 7.5% (≥ 58 mmol/mol); and is essential for treatment in those with HbA1c ≥ 10% (≥ 86 mmol/mol), when diet, physical activity, and other antihyperglycemic agents have been optimally used (B).
The preferred method of insulin initiation in T2DM is to begin by adding a long-acting (basal) insulin or once-daily premixed/co-formulation insulin or twice-daily premixed insulin, alone or in combination with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) or in combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) (B).
If the desired glucose targets are not met, rapid-acting or short-acting (bolus or prandial) insulin can be added at mealtime to control the expected postprandial raise in glucose. An insulin regimen should be adopted and individualized but should, to the extent possible, closely resemble a natural physiologic state and avoid, to the extent possible, wide fluctuating glucose levels (C).
Blood glucose monitoring is an integral part of effective insulin therapy and should not be omitted in the patient's care plan. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values should be used to titrate basal insulin, whereas both FPG and postprandial glucose (PPG) values should be used to titrate mealtime insulin (B).
Metformin combined with insulin is associated with decreased weight gain, lower insulin dose, and less hypoglycemia when compared with insulin alone (C).
Oral medications should not be abruptly discontinued when starting insulin therapy because of the risk of rebound hyperglycemia (D).
Analogue insulin is as effective as human insulin but is associated with less postprandial hyperglycemia and delayed hypoglycemia (B).
The shortest needles (currently the 4-mm pen and 6-mm syringe needles) are safe, effective, and less painful and should be the first-line choice in all patient categories; intramuscular (IM) injections should be avoided, especially with long-acting insulins, because severe hypoglycemia may result; lipohypertrophy is a frequent complication of therapy that distorts insulin absorption, and therefore, injections and infusions should not be given into these lesions and correct site rotation will help prevent them (A).
Many patients in East Africa reuse syringes for various reasons, including financial. This is not recommended by the manufacturer and there is an association between needle reuse and lipohypertrophy. However, patients who reuse needles should not be subjected to alarming claims of excessive morbidity from this practice (A).
Health care authorities and planners should be alerted to the risks associated with syringe or pen needles 6 mm or longer in children (A).

Choosing specific diabetes interventions and their roles in treating type 2 diabetes

Numerous reviews have focused on the characteristics of the specific diabetes interventions listed below. In addition, meta-analyses and reviews have summarized and compared the glucose-lowering effectiveness and other characteristics of the medications. The aim here is to provide enough information to justify the choices of medications, the order in which they are recommended, and the use of combinations of therapies. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of high-quality studies that provide head-to-head comparisons of the ability of the medications to achieve the currently recommended glycemic levels. The authors highly recommend that such studies be conducted. However, even in the absence of rigorous, comprehensive studies that directly compare the efficacy of all available glucose-lowering treatments and their combinations, we feel that there are enough data regarding the characteristics of the individual interventions to provide the guidelines below.

An important intervention that is likely to improve the probability that a patient will have better long-term control of diabetes is to make the diagnosis early, when the metabolic abnormalities of diabetes are usually less severe. Lower levels of glycemia at the time of initial therapy are associated with lower A1C levels over time and decreased long-term complications.

### Do we need updated guidelines on the use of insulin pump therapy in type 2 diabetes? A review of national and international practice guidelines [^116DaRr4]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) is used less for type 2 than for type 1 diabetes because of inconsistencies in evidence of effectiveness. We reviewed published guidelines on intensive insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes to assess whether updating of guidance is needed with respect to evidence used and recommendations for CSII in diabetes management.

Methods

A literature review was performed to identify published national and international guidelines on type 2 diabetes management. Searches were performed using PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases, and websites of national health care agencies, reimbursement agencies, and professional associations. Searches were limited to articles published in English between 2004 and 2014 and 1666 unique hits were identified, of which 22 were reviewed following screening.

Results

Only 6 of the 22 guidelines identified from North and South America, Western Europe, Greece, and Israel provided specific recommendations on intensive insulin therapy and the role of CSII, and only 1 provided information on the grade of evidence supporting recommendations. Quality appraisal based on the AGREE II tool suggested that published guidelines may have limitations in terms of search methodology and evidence grading, and findings were of mixed rigor and clarity. Only 3 guidelines described the population for whom CSII may be appropriate.

Conclusions

Guidelines need to improve the evidence base, rigor, clarity, and grading of evidence associated with recommendations on intensive insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes. Future updates may benefit from considering recent evidence on the efficacy of CSII in poorly controlled patients on MDI.

International Guideline Recommendations for the Initiation and Titration of Basal Insulin

Recommendations on the initiation and titration of basal insulin can be found in several international clinical practice guidelines. The 2017 American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE) comprehensive diabetes management algorithm specifies that basal insulin can be initiated in patients with T2DM with an entry HbA 1c level < 7.5% when either monotherapy with metformin or other OADs, or dual therapy with metformin and other agents, fails to achieve the glycemic target (HbA 1c < 7%). The guidelines also indicate that basal insulin can be initiated as a part of dual therapy with metformin in patients with entry HbA 1c ≥ 7.5%, or when a patient presents with a HbA 1c level > 9.0% (dual or triple therapy with metformin) and symptomatic hyperglycemia at entry. The 2015 diabetes clinical practice guidelines from the AACE/ACE acknowledged that the traditional postponement of insulin therapy after prolonged failure of lifestyle management and OADs to achieve glycemic control has been revised in the past decade, and recommended that basal insulin therapy should be initiated much sooner, and often in combination with OADs. The ADA's updated Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 2017 states the importance of dose titration of any insulin regimen once initiated, and that dose adjustments should be based on prevailing BG levels, together with knowledge of the pharmacodynamic profile of the insulin used. The ADA recommends that if the HbA 1c target (< 7%) is not achieved after 3 months of monotherapy with metformin, combination therapy of basal insulin with metformin, amongst other options, should be considered. The 2015 position statement from the ADA/EASD emphasizes that insulin has the advantage of being effective where other agents may not be, and should be considered a part of any combination regimen when hyperglycemia is severe, particularly if the patient is symptomatic. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) recommends the initiation of basal insulin after the failure of combination therapy with metformin and other OADs, and the titration of insulin using a self-titration regimen, or with at least biweekly contact with a HCP. Table 1 highlights key recommendations regarding the initiation and titration of basal insulin from several international guidelines.

### Management of type 2 diabetes using non-insulin glucose-lowering therapies: a critical appraisal of clinical practice guidelines with the AGREE II instrument [^111NQhhZ]. Diabetic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

Type 2 diabetes is a major global epidemic affecting over 400 million people worldwide. The objective of this systematic review was to provide an overview of recommendations from clinical practice guidelines (guidelines) addressing non-insulin based pharmacological management of among non-pregnant adults in an outpatient setting, and critically appraise their methodological development.

Methods

We systematically searched MEDLINE and Embase databases, for relevant guidelines using the Ovid interface. We scanned the bibliographies of all eligible guidelines for additional relevant citations. Teams of two reviewers, independently and in duplicate, screened titles and abstracts and potentially eligible full text reports to determine eligibility and appraised the reporting quality of guidelines using the Advancing Guideline Development, Reporting and Evaluation in Health Care instrument II (AGREE II) instrument.

Results

Our search yielded 11264 unique citations, of which 124 were retrieved for full-text review; 17 guidelines proved eligible. The highest scoring AGREE domain was 'clarity of presentation' (66%; range 7–92%), followed by 'scope and purpose' (58%; range 25–92%), 'editorial independence' (55%; range 0–91%), 'stakeholder involvement' (45%; range 11–90%) and 'rigour of development' (43%; range 4–92%). The poorest domain was 'applicability' (37%; range 6–84%). The guidelines authored by the World Health Organization group achieved the highest AGREE overall score.

Conclusions

Most of the guidelines provided recommendations with a local jurisdictional focus and showed significant variation in the quality. Nevertheless, only a small number of those scored well overall.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^113jySzk]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Process

The guidelines and algorithm that follow are derived from two sources. One source is the clinical trials that address the effectiveness and safety of the different modalities of therapy. Here, the writing group reviewed a wide variety of studies related to the use of drugs as monotherapy or in combination to lower glycemia. Unfortunately, the paucity of high-quality evidence in the form of well-controlled clinical trials that directly compare different diabetes treatment regimens remains a major impediment to recommending one class of drugs, or a particular combination of therapies, over another.

The second source of material that informed our recommendations was clinical judgement, that is, our collective knowledge and clinical experience, which takes into account benefits, risks, and costs in the treatment of diabetes. As in all clinical decision making, an evidence-based review of the literature must also be supplemented by value judgements, where the benefits of treatment are weighed against risks and costs in a subjective fashion. While we realize that others may have different judgements, we believe that the recommendations made in this new iteration of our treatment algorithm will guide therapy and result in improved glycemic control and health status over time.

### What are we waiting for? A review of early basal insulin therapy in diabetic ketoacidosis management [^1171A7j8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) remains a significant challenge for healthcare systems due to prolonged lengths of stay and rising costs. The current American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend starting basal insulin after resolution of DKA. However, these guidelines have not been updated since 2009, which can potentially limit optimal care. Meanwhile, the Joint British Society guidelines on DKA management, which were more recently updated in March 2023, do advocate for early administration of basal insulin in their treatment algorithm. This article assesses the rationale and literature associated with the recommendation for early basal insulin administration in the management of DKA. Benefits of early basal insulin in this cohort appears to be associated with less rebound hyperglycemia, reduction in time to DKA resolution, reduced intravenous insulin requirements, and reduced length of stay without associated increases in hypoglycemic or hypokalemic events.

5 INDICATION AND USE OF BASAL INSULIN IN PEOPLE WITH

The human body requires insulin to function and no number of non‐insulin medications can address absolute insulin deficiency, as in type 1 diabetes, or a relative insulin deficiency, as in some cases of T2D, when the magnitude of that deficiency exceeds endogenous insulin's ability to overcome concurrent insulin resistance.

The need for insulin therapy is an assessment that must be done throughout the course of T2D; indeed, most patients will eventually require insulin therapy. However, this is typically later in the course of therapy following progressive loss of beta‐cell function (Figure 1). In T2D, insulin therapy should be considered regardless of current antihyperglycemic therapy when glycemic markers are very high (i.e. HbA1c more than 10% or blood glucose more than 300 mg/dL) or with symptomatic hyperglycemia (e.g. catabolic symptoms including weight loss, ketonuria and ketosis). This early stabilisation of glycemia requires basal insulin with or without bolus insulin. Following stabilisation, non‐insulin antihyperglycemic medications (including GLP‐1 RAs) should be considered, particularly in cases of new‐onset T2D.

The more typical circumstance is the addition of basal insulin following loss of glycemic control with multiple non‐insulin agents. These non‐insulin medications should include a GLP‐1 RA first given the advantages to weight loss and low hypoglycaemia risk vs. starting injectable antihyperglycemic therapy with basal insulin. True once daily basal insulins are preferred over intermediate‐acting insulin, which requires twice‐daily administration and has a higher risk for hypoglycaemia, particularly nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Additionally, once insulin is started, sulfonylureas should be discontinued. As it pertains to dosing, three options exist for an initial basal insulin dose,: (1) a flat 10 units daily, 0.1–0.2 units/kg/day, and for patients with a baseline HbA1c greater than 8%, 0.2–0.3 units/kg/day. In a 100 kg patient, these options differ by 10 units/day. A typical basal insulin titration schedule increases the dose by 2 units every 2–3 days in which fasting plasma glucose (FPG) remains above target. Notably, this is extended to 3–5 days for insulin degludec given its longer half‐life. Overall though, dose adjustments become smaller and with greater intervals between adjustments as FPG is nearing the goal.

Given the continued interest in defining the optimal management of individuals with type 2 diabetes, the Editor of Diabetes Care convened a working party of diabetes specialists to examine this topic in the context of insulin therapy. This was prompted by recent new evidence on the use of insulin in such people. The group was aware of evidence that the benefits of insulin therapy are still usually offered late, and thus the aim of the discussion was how to define the optimal timing and basis for decisions regarding insulin and to apply these concepts in practice. It was noted that recent evidence had built upon that of the previous decades, together confirming the benefits and safety of insulin therapy, albeit with concerns about the potential for hypoglycemia and gain in body weight. Insulin offers a unique ability to control hyperglycemia, being used from the time of diagnosis in some circumstances, when metabolic control is disturbed by medical illness, procedures, or therapy, as well as in the longer term in ambulatory care. For those previously starting insulin, various other forms of therapy can be added later, which offer complementary effects appropriate to individual needs. Here we review current evidence and circumstances in which insulin can be used, consider individualized choices of alternatives and combination regimens, and offer some guidance on personalized targets and tactics for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes.

### Current treatment guidelines and glycated haemoglobin goals for type 2 diabetes: which patients are most likely to benefit from fixed-ratio basal insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist combinations? [^112uaVYK]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Beta‐cells in the human pancreas are responsible for the production of insulin and about half of their function is lost at the time of type 2 diabetes (T2D) diagnosis. While specific antihyperglycemic therapies help preserve beta‐cell function, T2D remains a progressive disease often requiring combination therapy and eventually insulin.

Diabetes distress can accompany the diagnosis of T2D and is impacted by its many complexities. Simplifying insulin regimens is one method of reducing diabetes distress while attempting to maintain glycemic control. An increasing number of non‐insulin pharmacotherapy options for T2D has correlated with a decrease in the prescribing of bolus insulin and mixed insulin formulations. Among others, a key option for simplifying insulin regimens includes using fixed‐ratio combinations (FRCs) of basal insulin with an injectable glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1 RA). Herein, we will review guidelines for the management of adults with T2D and the data that underpin their recommendations to highlight the role of GLP‐1 RAs, basal insulin and their FRCs to achieve glycemic goals. We will close with practical guidance on the implementation of FRCs in clinical practice.

### New developments in insulin therapy for type 2 diabetes [^112irnUG]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Insulin has classically been considered a treatment of last resort for individuals with type 2 diabetes, delayed until all other efforts by the patient and healthcare provider have failed. Recent treatment guidelines recommend the use of insulin, in particular basal insulin, as part of a treatment regimen earlier in the disease process. Many patients are reticent about initiating insulin, so therapies that allow insulin treatment to be more tailored to individual needs are likely to result in greater acceptance and patient adherence with therapy. To meet this need, a range of insulin products are in development that aim to increase absorption rate or prolong the duration of action, reduce peak variability and weight gain associated with insulin treatment, and offer alternative delivery methods. This review describes insulin products in clinical development, new combination therapies, and new devices for insulin delivery.

Current recommendations and insulin therapy options

The current ADA/EASD guidelines recommend that individuals with Type 2 diabetes are initially treated using lifestyle modifications; once this fails to maintain HbA 1c levels < 7%, they should be progressed to metformin monotherapy (Fig. 1). If up to 3 months of metformin monotherapy does not enable the individual to reach the HbA 1c target, they should be progressed to a two-drug combination of metformin with a sulphonylurea, thiazolidinedione, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, glucagon-like peptide-1–receptor agonist or basal insulin. If after 3 months the HbA 1c remains above the glycaemic target set for the individual, therapy should then be progressed as represented in Fig. 1.

When a three-drug combination therapy with basal insulin does not achieve HbA 1c targets, then a more complex insulin strategy is recommended. The two possible strategies are (1) to continue with the basal insulin and add rapid-acting insulin in a stepwise manner or (2) to transfer to twice-daily premixed insulin (Fig. 2). The more flexible stepwise addition of prandial insulin to basal insulin is the preferred strategy from the guidelines. Eventually, it may be necessary to progress to a full basal–bolus regimen to achieve the desired glycaemic target.

The stepwise addition of prandial insulin has been investigated in several clinical trials. The addition of a single prandial insulin injection to the existing basal regimen before breakfast or the main meal, or before the meal consistently with the highest postprandial glucose, is referred to as a 'basal-plus' strategy. This basal-plus strategy has been identified as effective when intensifying insulin therapy, before a full basal–bolus regimen is considered.

### EADSG guidelines: insulin therapy in diabetes [^115G9Vba]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of diabetes or hyperglycemia should be confirmed prior to ordering, dispensing, or administering insulin (A). Insulin is the primary treatment in all patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) (A). Typically, patients with T1DM will require initiation with multiple daily injections at the time of diagnosis. This is usually short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogue given 0 to 15 min before meals together with one or more daily separate injections of intermediate or long-acting insulin. Two or three premixed insulin injections per day may be used (A). The target glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for all children with T1DM, including preschool children, is recommended to be < 7.5% (< 58 mmol/mol). The target is chosen aiming at minimizing hyperglycemia, severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemic unawareness, and reducing the likelihood of development of long-term complications (B). For patients prone to glycemic variability, glycemic control is best evaluated by a combination of results with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (B). Indications for exogenous insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) include acute illness or surgery, pregnancy, glucose toxicity, contraindications to or failure to achieve goals with oral antidiabetic medications, and a need for flexible therapy (B). In T2DM patients, with regards to achieving glycemic goals, insulin is considered alone or in combination with oral agents when HbA1c is ≥ 7.5% (≥ 58 mmol/mol); and is essential for treatment in those with HbA1c ≥ 10% (≥ 86 mmol/mol), when diet, physical activity, and other antihyperglycemic agents have been optimally used (B). The preferred method of insulin initiation in T2DM is to begin by adding a long-acting (basal) insulin or once-daily premixed/co-formulation insulin or twice-daily premixed insulin, alone or in combination with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) or in combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) (B). If the desired glucose targets are not met, rapid-acting or short-acting (bolus or prandial) insulin can be added at mealtime to control the expected postprandial raise in glucose. An insulin regimen should be adopted and individualized but should, to the extent possible, closely resemble a natural physiologic state and avoid, to the extent possible, wide fluctuating glucose levels (C). Blood glucose monitoring is an integral part of effective insulin therapy and should not be omitted in the patient's care plan. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values should be used to titrate basal insulin, whereas both FPG and postprandial glucose (PPG) values should be used to titrate mealtime insulin (B). Metformin combined with insulin is associated with decreased weight gain, lower insulin dose, and less hypoglycemia when compared with insulin alone (C). Oral medications should not be abruptly discontinued when starting insulin therapy because of the risk of rebound hyperglycemia (D). Analogue insulin is as effective as human insulin but is associated with less postprandial hyperglycemia and delayed hypoglycemia (B). The shortest needles (currently the 4-mm pen and 6-mm syringe needles) are safe, effective, and less painful and should be the first-line choice in all patient categories; intramuscular (IM) injections should be avoided, especially with long-acting insulins, because severe hypoglycemia may result; lipohypertrophy is a frequent complication of therapy that distorts insulin absorption, and therefore, injections and infusions should not be given into these lesions and correct site rotation will help prevent them (A). Many patients in East Africa reuse syringes for various reasons, including financial. This is not recommended by the manufacturer and there is an association between needle reuse and lipohypertrophy. However, patients who reuse needles should not be subjected to alarming claims of excessive morbidity from this practice (A). Health care authorities and planners should be alerted to the risks associated with syringe or pen needles 6 mm or longer in children (A).

Conclusions

Type 2 diabetes is epidemic. Its long-term consequences translate into enormous human suffering and economic costs; however, much of the morbidity associated with long-term microvascular and neuropathic complications can be substantially reduced by interventions that achieve glucose levels close to the nondiabetic range. Although new classes of medications and numerous combinations have been demonstrated to lower glycemia, current-day management has failed to achieve and maintain the glycemic levels most likely to provide optimal healthcare status for people with diabetes.

### The 2021–2022 position of Brazilian diabetes society on insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes: an evidence-based guideline to clinical practice [^115zyshF]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Insulin therapy regimens for people with type 1 diabetes (PWT1D) should mimic the physiological insulin secretion that occurs in individuals without diabetes. Intensive insulin therapy, whether by multiple daily injections (MDI) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), constitutes the fundamental therapy from the initial stages of type 1 diabetes (T1D), at all ages. This review is an authorized literal translation of part of the Brazilian Diabetes Society (SBD) Guidelines 2021–2022. This evidence-based guideline supplies guidance on insulin therapy in T1D.

Methods

The methods were published elsewhere in earlier SBD guidelines and was approved by the Internal Institutional Steering Committee for publication. Briefly, the Brazilian Diabetes Society indicated fourteen experts to constitute the Central Committee, designed to regulate the method review of the manuscripts, and judge the degrees of recommendations and levels of evidence. SBD Type 1 Diabetes Department drafted the manuscript selecting key clinical questions to do a narrative review using MEDLINE via PubMed, with the best evidence available, including high-quality clinical trials, metanalysis, and large observational studies related to insulin therapy in T1D, by using the Mesh terms [type 1 diabetes] and [insulin].

Results

Based on extensive literature review the Central Committee defined ten recommendations. Three levels of evidence were considered: A. Data from more than one randomised clinical trial (RCT) or one metanalysis of RCTs with low heterogeneity (I² < 40%). B. Data from metanalysis, including large observational studies, a single RCT, or a pre-specified subgroup analysis. C: Data from small or non-randomised studies, exploratory analysis, or consensus of expert opinion. The degree of recommendation was obtained based on a poll sent to the panellists, using the following criteria: Grade I: when more than 90% of agreement; Grade IIa if 75–89% of agreement; IIb if 50–74% of agreement, and III, when most of the panellist recommends against a defined treatment.

Conclusions

In PWT1D, it is recommended to start insulin treatment immediately after clinical diagnosis, to prevent metabolic decompensation and diabetic ketoacidosis. Insulin therapy regimens should mimic insulin secretion with the aim to achieve glycemic control goals established for the age group. Intensive treatment with basal-bolus insulin therapy through MDI or CSII is recommended, and insulin analogues offers some advantages in PWT1D, when compared to human insulin. Periodic reassessment of insulin doses should be performed to avoid clinical inertia in treatment.

### Current treatment guidelines and glycated haemoglobin goals for type 2 diabetes: which patients are most likely to benefit from fixed-ratio basal insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist combinations? [^116Fw9dd]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

3 PATIENT FACTORS IMPACTING GLYCEMIC GOALS AND THERAPY SELECTION

Most patients with T2D will require basal insulin. Patients with T2D requiring insulin therapy have, in most circumstances, a longer duration of diabetes, whether this time period is with diagnosed or undiagnosed T2D. In the context of FRCs, while the GLP‐1 RA component may mitigate the weight gain associated with basal insulin, insulin therapy is still associated with a net increase in body weight and hypoglycaemia risk vs. not using insulin. Thus, patients being treated with FRCs are more similar to subjects in older trials of glycemic control (e.g. ACCORD, ADVANCE and VDAT) vs. newer trials of incretins and SGLT2 inhibitors where lower or even HbA1c levels below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes may be beneficial.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) prefers an HbA1c of < 6.5% as the primary glycemic goal for people with T2D. However, the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ADA/EASD) prefer a HbA1c goal of < 7% as the primary glycemic goal for most adults with T2D. While these goals seem to contrast, they begin to mirror each other when patient‐specific adjustments to these goals are brought into focus.

Pharmacologic therapy for adults with type 1 diabetes — recommendations as printed: Treat most adults with type 1 diabetes with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or multiple daily doses of prandial (injected or inhaled) and basal insulin. A For most adults with type 1 diabetes, insulin analogs (or inhaled insulin) are preferred over injectable human insulins to minimize hypoglycemia risk. A Early use of continuous glucose monitoring is recommended for adults with type 1 diabetes to improve glycemic outcomes and quality of life and to minimize hypoglycemia. B Automated insulin delivery systems should be offered to all adults with type 1 diabetes. A To improve glycemic outcomes and quality of life and to minimize hypoglycemia risk, most adults with type 1 diabetes should receive education on how to match mealtime insulin doses to carbohydrate intake and fat and protein intake. They should also be taught how to modify the insulin dose (correction dose) based on concurrent glycemia, glycemic trends (if available), sick-day management, and anticipated physical activity. B Insulin treatment plan and insulin-taking behavior should be reevaluated at regular intervals (e.g., every 3–6 months) and adjusted to incorporate specific factors that impact choice of treatment and ensure achievement of individualized glycemic goals.

### Management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized adults… [^111Lu2jG]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Although insulin has the best evidence for maintaining glycemic control in hospitalized patients, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors may be equivalent for patients with type 2 diabetes.
- Corrective insulin alone only slightly increases average blood glucose levels vs. basal-bolus insulin and may reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Medications to Control Hyperglycemia Insulin is recommended to maintain glycemic control during hospitalizations, although some oral medications may offer similar control for patients with type 2 diabetes. Three randomized controlled trials suggest that daily dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitors can maintain glycemic control similar to that of insulin and may reduce hypoglycemic events. Although glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists also slightly reduce hypoglycemia compared with insulin, they increase the risk of nausea and vomiting.

Metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors have not been studied during hospitalization. When insulin is used during hospitalization, regimens containing neutral protamine Hagedorn and basal-bolus insulin appear equivalent in preventing hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Glycemic Control Regimens Based on very low-quality evidence of benefit, the guideline recommends that corrective insulin be used to lower blood glucose levels of 140 mg per dL or greater in patients with hyperglyce-mia but not diabetes. In patients with diabetes not treated with insulin, corrective insulin or basal-bolus insulin can be initiated. Basal-bolus insulin is defined as a basal rate of long-acting insulin with boluses for mealtime and correction, whereas corrective insulin is only provided in response to hyperglycemia. In these patients, corrective insulin alone only slightly increases the average blood glucose level vs.

basal-bolus insulin and may reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. For patients already treated with insulin, basal-bolus regimens are recommended. For patients using insulin pump therapy before admission, continuing that therapy reduces hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia compared with shifting to an insulin regimen. Insulin pump therapy requires that patients have a sufficient level of consciousness to maintain their insulin pump settings, and it is not appropriate for patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic states. Hospitals must have sufficient expertise in managing insulin pump therapy.

Results

Current Guidelines

Previously, guidelines on the management of T2D prescribed fixed glycemic targets for all patients. More recent guidance from bodies such as the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) have formalized the concept of 'patient-centered care', which includes setting targets in line with individual patients' needs, preferences, and tolerances. This concept is now increasingly accepted. Glycemic targets that will be appropriate for most patients are still suggested, as shown in Table 1, but with the understanding that individualization of targets is imperative.

Table 1
Glycemic targets applicable to most patients according to existing guidelines

Targets should always be set individually according to patient factors

a Percentage values have been calculated and added

Choosing an appropriate insulin type and regimen should also be based on specific patient attributes, rather than taking a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, and many guidelines now recognize both basal and premix insulin as options for initiating/intensifying insulin therapy in T2D (Table 1). Indeed, the loss of the first-phase insulin release is one of the earliest detectable defects of beta-cell function in individuals destined to develop T2D. The resultant postprandial hyperglycemia has been associated with an increased risk of harmful outcomes such as macrovascular disease, retinopathy, and cancer. Unlike basal insulin, premix insulin targets both FPG and PPG, which is essential for addressing this glycemic defect and achieving optimal glycemic control. With this in mind, it is important to determine the glycemic defect through blood glucose monitoring before choosing an insulin initiation regimen.

It is important to note that the ADA/EASD statement emphasizes the progressive nature of T2D and the likelihood that intensification of therapy will be needed as beta-cell function deteriorates.

### Individualizing insulin therapy in the management of type 2 diabetes [^115Cko8u]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

It is recognized that reducing hyperglycemia early on in disease progression has long-term benefits for patients with diabetes. Insulin therapy has greater potential to reduce hyperglycemia than other therapies; however, there is often a significant delay in insulin initiation and intensification. Insulin replacement therapy in type 2 diabetes should no longer be viewed as the treatment of last resort. With the development of modern insulin analogs, the field has evolved. Large clinical trials have improved our understanding of the potential benefits and risks associated with intensive glycemic control in different patient populations and highlighted the need for individualization of glycemic targets and treatment strategies. Current treatment guidelines recognize the important role of insulin therapy both early on and throughout the progression of type 2 diabetes.

Guidelines on Insulin Therapy

General Objectives

To provide guidelines for clinical practice on the use of insulin in diabetes based on the best available evidence to health care workers; and for the rational use of resources in the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of diabetes in the East African population with diabetes.

Specific Objectives

To improve the rational use of insulin therapy in persons presenting with diabetes who require insulin treatment.

To indicate the appropriate pharmacological interventions in the context of multifactorial treatment plan, emphasizing cost-effectiveness, individualized goals, and safety.

Key areas in insulin therapy discussed in the guidelines include insulin regimen in patients with T1DM, a stepwise approach to insulin initiation, titration, and intensification in patients with T2DM, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), awareness and management of hypoglycemia, weight gain with intensive insulin therapy, and the role of psychosocial aspects associated with insulin therapy in diabetes care.

Areas beyond insulin therapy, but within the context of improving diabetes care, that have been included in the guidelines are lifestyle modifications and target values for glucose control based on the glycemic hexads (HbA1c, FPG, PPG, hypoglycemia, nocturnal hypoglycemia, and glycemic variability). The guidelines have gone further to include a strategic treatment approach to special populations such as diabetes in pregnancy; diabetes and lactation; diabetes and renal, cardiac, and hepatic impairment; and monogenic diabetes. A discussion on the management of diabetes in special situations like Ramadan and other faith-based fasting has been included. Furthermore, diabetes management during acute and chronic infections has been included since infections may be associated with adverse outcomes in diabetes management.

Insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes — Many adults with type 2 diabetes eventually require and benefit from insulin therapy, and clinicians should frame this as part of the disease's progression while avoiding stigmatizing messages. Instruction on self-titration of insulin doses based on glucose monitoring improves glycemic management. Basal insulin alone is the most convenient initial insulin treatment and can be added to noninsulin agents; starting doses can be estimated by body weight at 0.1–0.2 units/kg/day with individualized titration.

Grading of scientific evidence.

There has been considerable evolution in the evaluation of scientific evidence and in the development of evidence-based guidelines since the ADA first began publishing practice guidelines. Accordingly, we developed a classification system to grade the quality of scientific evidence supporting ADA recommendations for all new and revised ADA position statements.

Recommendations are assigned ratings of A, B, or C, depending on the quality of evidence (Table 1). Expert opinion (E) is a separate category for recommendations in which there is as yet no evidence from clinical trials, in which clinical trials may be impractical, or in which there is conflicting evidence. Recommendations with an "A" rating are based on large well-designed clinical trials or well-done meta-analyses. Generally, these recommendations have the best chance of improving outcomes when applied to the population to which they are appropriate. Recommendations with lower levels of evidence may be equally important but are not as well supported. The level of evidence supporting a given recommendation is noted either as a heading for a group of recommendations or in parentheses after a given recommendation.

Of course, evidence is only one component of clinical decision-making. Clinicians care for patients, not populations; guidelines must always be interpreted with the needs of the individual patient in mind. Individual circumstances, such as comorbid and coexisting diseases, age, education, disability, and, above all, patients' values and preferences, must also be considered and may lead to different treatment targets and strategies. Also, conventional evidence hierarchies, such as the one adapted by the ADA, may miss some nuances that are important in diabetes care. For example, while there is excellent evidence from clinical trials supporting the importance of achieving glycemic control, the optimal way to achieve this result is less clear. It is difficult to assess each component of such a complex intervention.

ADA will continue to improve and update the Clinical Practice Recommendations to ensure that clinicians, health plans, and policymakers can continue to rely on them as the most authoritative and current guidelines for diabetes care. Our Clinical Practice Recommendations are also available on the Association's website at.

As a result of the progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, many patients will eventually become insulin-dependent. Neither the latest guidelines for anti-hyperglycaemic treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes nor recent other literature exactly defines the threshold to initiate insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes. In contrast, in all available guidelines and recommendations, the necessity for insulin therapy is defined by the inability to reach an individualised HbA 1c goal. Real-world data show that individual HbA 1c targets are not achieved in the majority of cases, especially when insulin treatment is delayed. Moreover, according to real-world studies, insulin-treated patients also do not reach individual glycaemic targets in many cases. Thus, the potential of a start with insulin therapy in a timely manner should be rethought strategically.

### Current treatment guidelines and glycated haemoglobin goals for type 2 diabetes: which patients are most likely to benefit from fixed-ratio basal insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist combinations? [^116nihrb]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Choosing a more aggressive starting dose may save approximately 15 days of titration based on a 10‐unit difference and the typical rate at which insulin can be titrated. As prompt glycemic control is typically considered 6 months, the 15 days saved during titration may be more or less meaningful. Potential, though perhaps not established, benefits of starting with a more conservative basal insulin dose include minimising the risk for hypoglycaemia and increased tolerability, as rapid correction of hyperglycemia may precipitate feelings of hypoglycaemia even with blood glucose concentration greater than 70 mg/dL. Regardless, most initial doses are likely to be under what the patient needs; therefore, avoiding clinical inertia is paramount. Basal insulin titration is typically continued until the FPG goal is reached or a total dose of 0.5 units/kg/day is reached, at which time a holistic review of antidiabetic therapy should be made and prandial targeted therapy considered to avoid overbasalisation. Basal insulin doses are typically decreased following hypoglycaemic events, typically by 10%–20% for an FPG of < 70 mg/dL and by 20%–40% for an FPG of < 40 mg/dL. The competing concern with titration schedules is attempting to keep insulin regimens simple to prevent hypoglycaemia and maintain quality of life. One approach to maintaining simple insulin regimens is using GLP‐1 RAs to address prandial control before bolus insulin.

### A practical approach to the clinical challenges in initiation of basal insulin therapy in people with type 2 diabetes [^115Q2RgR]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Initiating insulin therapy with a basal insulin analogue has become a standard of care in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Despite increasing choices in pharmacological approaches, intensified glucose monitoring and improvements in quality of care, many patients do not achieve the desired level of glycaemic control. Although insulin therapy, when optimized, can help patients reach their glycaemic goals, there are barriers to treatment initiation on both the side of the patient and provider. Providers experience barriers based on their perceptions of patients' capabilities and concerns. They may lack the confidence to solve the practical problems of insulin therapy and avoid decisions they perceive as risky for their patients. In this study, we review recommendations for basal insulin initiation, focussing on glycaemic targets, titration, monitoring, and combination therapy with non-insulin anti-hyperglycaemic medications. We provide practical advice on how to address some of the key problems encountered in everyday clinical practice and give recommendations where there are gaps in knowledge or guidelines. We also discuss common challenges faced by people with T2DM, such as weight gain and hypoglycaemia, and how providers can address and overcome them.

### Basal insulin intensification in patients with type 2 diabetes: a review [^114zNrvZ]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

As the number of people living with type 2 diabetes (T2D) continues to rise, managing their complex needs presents an increasing challenge to physicians. While treatment guidelines provide evidence-based guidance, they are not prescriptive-rather they emphasize individualization of management based on a patient's clinical needs and preferences. Physicians, therefore, need to be fully aware of the advantages and disadvantages of the multiple and increasing treatment options available to them at each stage of the disease. The progressive nature of T2D means that treatment with basal insulin will become inevitable for many patients, while for some patients basal insulin alone will eventually be insufficient for maintaining glycemic targets. Recent guidelines recommend two basic approaches for intensifying basal insulin: the use of rapid-acting insulin, either as additional prandial injections or as part of premix (biphasic) insulin; and the addition of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) to the insulin therapy, which can be administered via subcutaneous injection once or twice daily, or weekly depending on formulation. More recently, two fixed-ratio combinations of basal insulin and a GLP-1 RA that allow for once-daily dosing have been approved. Each of these approaches has potential benefits and drawbacks, particularly in terms of risk for hypoglycemia, weight change, convenience, and side effects. Understanding these differences is central to guiding patient and physician choice. This article discusses the rationale, advantages, disadvantages, and implementation of currently available strategies for basal insulin treatment intensification in patients with T2D.

### Medicines for treatment intensification in type 2 diabetes and type of insulin in type 1 and type 2 diabetes in low-resource settings: synopsis of the World Health Organization guidelines on second-and third-line medicines and type of insulin for the control of blood glucose levels in nonpregnant adults with diabetes mellitus [^114nHTER]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Description

The World Health Organization developed these guidelines to provide guidance on selection of medicines for treatment intensification in type 2 diabetes and on use of insulin (human or analogue) in type 1 and 2 diabetes. The target audience includes clinicians, policymakers, national diabetes program managers, and medicine procurement officers. The target population is adults with type 1 or 2 diabetes in low-resource settings in low- or high-income countries. The guidelines also apply to disadvantaged populations in high-income countries.

Methods

The recommendations were formulated by a 12-member guideline development group and are based on high-quality systematic reviews identified via a search of several bibliographic databases from 1 January 2007 to 1 March 2017. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system was used to assess the quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations. The guideline was peer-reviewed by 6 external reviewers.

Recommendation 1

Give a sulfonylurea to patients with type 2 diabetes who do not achieve glycemic control with metformin alone or who have contraindications to metformin (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

Introduce human insulin treatment to patients with type 2 diabetes who do not achieve glycemic control with metformin and/or a sulfonylurea (strong recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).

Recommendation 3

If insulin is unsuitable, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, or a thiazolidinedione (TZD) may be added (weak recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).

Recommendation 4

Use human insulin to manage blood glucose in adults with type 1 diabetes and in adults with type 2 diabetes for whom insulin is indicated (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).

Recommendation 5

Consider long-acting insulin analogues to manage blood glucose in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who have frequent severe hypoglycemia with human insulin (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence for severe hypoglycemia).

### Insulin matters: a practical approach to basal insulin management in type 2 diabetes [^115mAJhR]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

It is currently estimated that 11 million Canadians are living with diabetes or prediabetes. Although hyperglycemia is associated with serious complications, it is well established that improved glycemic control reduces the risk of microvascular complications and can also reduce cardiovascular (CV) complications over the long term. The UKPDS and ADVANCE landmark trials have resulted in diabetes guidelines recommending an A1C target of ≤ 7.0% for most patients or a target of ≤ 6.5% to further reduce the risk of nephropathy and retinopathy in those with type 2 diabetes (T2D), if it can be achieved safely. However, half of the people with T2D in Canada are not achieving these glycemic targets, despite advances in diabetes pharmacological management. There are many contributing factors to account for this poor outcome; however, one of the major factors is the delay in treatment advancement, particularly a resistance to insulin initiation and intensification. To simplify the process of initiating and titrating insulin in T2D patients, a group of Canadian experts reviewed the evidence and best clinical practices with the goal of providing guidance and practical recommendations to the diabetes healthcare community at large. This expert panel included general practitioners (GPs), nurses, nurse practitioners, endocrinologists, dieticians, pharmacists, and a psychologist. This article summarizes the panel recommendations.

Discussion

The development of insulin analogs and GLP-1 receptor agonists, and the increase in the number of available OGLDs have increased the number of glucose-lowering therapy options for people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, while management of other conditions (elevated lipids and blood pressure, or complications) has also evolved. Some clinicians find authoritative guidelines useful in giving direction to the appropriate management pathways, while others use them to endorse and review their own practice in the diverse areas of diabetes care. While national and international guidelines, algorithms, and position statements on the management of diabetes, and more specifically on glucose-lowering medication, published by ADA, IDF, EASD, and ALAD, together with some high-quality national guidelines, seek to address the clear medical need for guidance in the management of diabetes, these may not meet the needs of local populations at the national or provincial level in non-western countries.

Not surprisingly, the national guidelines identified in this review relied heavily on pre-existing international guidelines. In most countries, the latest version of national guidelines was published before 2012 and consequently could not contain reference to the latest position statement from ADA/EASD. This may be problematic as there was significant change between 2009 and 2013 in glucose-lowering treatment options. Also endorsed in the new statement from ADA/EASD was the approach to individualization of medical decision-making. Ideas on individualizing management, and an approach to variation in provision of care according to available resources, were espoused by the 2005 IDF type 2 diabetes guideline, but changes were needed for the 2012 revision in light of new therapy options. Also, the ADA standards in medical care is updated annually to include the latest available information on managing diabetes while national guidelines are updated less frequently and may not reflect all new therapy options as they become available.
