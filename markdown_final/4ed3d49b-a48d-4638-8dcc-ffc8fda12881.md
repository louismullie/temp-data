## Question

Write quick reviewed risks of benzo for patient note

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking me for a concise summary of benzodiazepine risks suitable for a patient note. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about source credibility and what should anchor the risk statements. Then, I should verify life-threatening risks, especially opioid co-prescribing. Next, I will assess cognitive and neuropsychiatric harms, geriatric-specific concerns, and dependence/withdrawal management including taper strategy. After that, I should consolidate key risk modifiers, special populations, and harm reduction guidance. Finally, I will ensure monitoring, PDMP use, and psychotherapy adjuncts are integrated and that all claims are properly cited to the strongest available references.

> Let me first confirm the source hierarchy I will rely on so I don't overstate or understate risks. I need to anchor life-threatening and dependence risks to FDA labeling across representative benzodiazepines and align clinical management with the 2025 multi-society tapering guideline; I can supplement with CDC opioid guidance and high-quality primary care and geriatrics guidelines for populations and monitoring. Lower-credibility observational data can contextualize magnitudes but shouldn't drive recommendations, and I should flag when I'm using them as supportive rather than definitive.

> Now, life-threatening risk: I should verify the boxed warning and quantify overdose risk when benzodiazepines are combined with opioids or other CNS depressants. FDA labeling across alprazolam, lorazepam, clobazam, and oxazepam consistently warns about profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death with concomitant opioid use, mandating lowest effective doses, minimal duration, and close monitoring; the CDC also urges avoiding concurrent prescribing when possible. Wait, let me verify the magnitude; I initially thought concomitant benzodiazepine–opioid use raised overdose risk by 60%, but hold on — that 60% increase was for triple exposure (opioid + benzodiazepine + nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic), whereas opioid + benzodiazepine alone showed about a 20% increase in overdose compared to opioids alone in a large cohort study, so I should present those numbers precisely and note the study's observational nature [^1147JQWp] [^113nGoez] [^114qbesg] [^112e5zzC] [^114QmWu7] [^111Y5Ugr].

> Next, I should review cognitive and neuropsychiatric harms. Let me consider acute versus chronic effects: acutely, benzodiazepines impair memory, attention, and can precipitate delirium, which increases fall risk; chronically, meta-analytic and guideline summaries report persistent deficits in visuospatial ability, processing speed, and verbal learning, with potential — but still debated — increases in dementia risk and incomplete reversibility after discontinuation. I need to ensure I don't over-interpret causality for dementia; the signal is concerning but not definitive, so I will present it as a potential risk supported by longitudinal and meta-analytic data rather than a proven outcome [^113WVci5] [^115hfR3T] [^114pBocy].

> I will now examine geriatric-specific risks because age modifies both benefit and harm. Older adults demonstrate increased sensitivity with higher rates of falls, fractures, hospitalizations, and mortality, and multiple high-credibility guidelines recommend deprescribing/tapering in most older adults unless compelling indications exist; Canadian geriatric guidance further emphasizes structured assessment of indication, dose, duration, and misuse features, with readiness-to-change evaluation and specialty referral when needed. Let me double-check taper guidance in the elderly: deprescribing should be slow and individualized, and feasibility of discontinuation is supported when paired with education and behavioral strategies [^115buRfZ] [^112zMUcT] [^1174GMVd] [^112c59ZZ].

> Dependence and withdrawal management must be precise. I should confirm that abrupt discontinuation is contraindicated due to life-threatening withdrawal (including seizures), and that the recommended initial pace is 5–10% dose reduction with a typical ceiling of 25% every two weeks, adjusting based on symptoms; outpatient taper is usual, but I need to remember inpatient care when imminent harm, severe/complicated withdrawal, or complex comorbidity is anticipated. Wait, I should also check substitution strategies and reversal agents: transitioning to a longer-acting benzodiazepine can be considered in some cases, but rapid reversal with flumazenil is discouraged for tapering due to seizure and dysrhythmia risk; phenobarbital protocols are reserved for inpatient use by experienced clinicians [^1146boUA] [^114vBk5y] [^1133Y84v] [^1156exZb] [^115DsdRh] [^116uJPUe].

> I need to ensure I cover protracted withdrawal and misuse. FDA labeling notes protracted withdrawal can last weeks to over a year and that abrupt dose reduction can precipitate life-threatening reactions, including seizures; this strengthens the case for gradual, patient-specific taper plans. Misuse remains substantial in community samples, with approximately 17% of adult benzodiazepine use reported as misuse; I'll include that to contextualize risk but clarify it as supportive data given variable credibility across surveys [^112kcRnQ] [^1147euuw] [^117UkHzB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without integrating patient-level risk modifiers. High daily dose (for example, greater than 5 mg diazepam equivalents), long-term use beyond three months, polypharmacy, co-occurring substance use disorders, and respiratory diseases such as COPD or sleep apnea all escalate harm, with higher-dose recipients showing markedly greater association with substance misuse and adverse outcomes in primary care cohorts. I should also remember that benzodiazepine prescribing tends to cluster in patients already at higher baseline risk, so careful risk stratification is essential before initiation and during continuation [^115q8mp9] [^113WVci5] [^113Mzw9s].

> For patients with concomitant substance use disorders, I need to ensure harm does not escalate by disrupting effective treatments. I should confirm that buprenorphine or methadone for OUD should not be withheld solely due to benzodiazepine use; instead, counsel on risks, coordinate dosing/monitoring, and seek the lowest effective benzodiazepine dose or taper when appropriate. Additionally, I should offer naloxone when benzodiazepines are prescribed with opioids, and incorporate broader harm reduction services, including education and linkage to community resources, as recommended by the 2025 multi-society guideline and FDA labeling for MOUD [^116EbHWj] [^1131U9gH] [^114qbesg] [^112VeioB] [^111ti6YH].

> Let me verify monitoring cadence and clinical process so the note is actionable. The multi-society guidance advises ongoing risk–benefit assessments at least every three months with PDMP review, and I should evaluate symptoms and function at each dose reduction during a taper. If significant withdrawal or destabilization emerges, the pace should be paused or slowed and adjunctive medications considered; behavioral therapies, especially CBT, improve deprescribing success, and patient education interventions increase discontinuation rates in systematic reviews [^113Qw717] [^112LRzWe] [^112yvyC9] [^116RaCMi] [^1158X5VC] [^112pbwXp].

> Special populations require added caution. In pregnancy, I need to weigh maternal–fetal risks and benefits carefully and individualize decisions to continue or taper. In PTSD and other psychiatric comorbidities, consider tapering benzodiazepines where feasible, and during taper of patients with mood or psychotic disorders, I should closely monitor sleep and pause reductions if sleep disturbance risks destabilization, such as triggering mania [^113WVci5] [^112bsJS7] [^111GT4ZK] [^114qCBPa] [^111RzCPe].

> But wait, what if other CNS depressants are introduced, like pregabalin? I should confirm that co-use patterns are common and may increase overall sedative burden; observational trajectory data suggest pregabalin initiation often coincides with persistent opioid and benzodiazepine exposure, and opioid doses may rise post-initiation in some groups, reinforcing the CDC's caution around combining CNS depressants and the need for vigilant reassessment with any added sedative agent [^111GT7vS] [^114QmWu7].

> To close the loop, I should reinforce core prescribing principles for the patient note: use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, avoid concurrent opioids and benzodiazepines whenever possible, and if co-prescribed, document rationale, monitoring, and naloxone provision; ensure driving and machinery cautions are communicated; and schedule timely follow-up for reassessment and taper opportunities. Let me double-check that these align with FDA labeling and primary care guidance on insomnia/anxiety management and deprescribing, which they do, including explicit boxed warnings and cautions around duration and misuse potential [^1147JQWp] [^113nGoez] [^115HoaBp] [^115GcPxM] [^113Qw717].

---

Benzodiazepines carry **significant risks** that must be documented and discussed with patients. Key risks include **respiratory depression and overdose** when combined with opioids or other CNS depressants [^1147JQWp], **dependence and withdrawal** with prolonged use [^114njksx], and **cognitive impairment and falls**, especially in older adults [^112c59ZZ]. Additional concerns include sedation, motor impairment, and an increased risk of motor vehicle accidents; avoid use in patients with substance use disorders, and use caution in pregnancy because of potential fetal risks [^111GT4ZK]. Use the **lowest effective dose** for the shortest duration [^113WVci5]; avoid abrupt discontinuation [^1146boUA] and taper gradually to minimize withdrawal [^114vBk5y].

---

## Respiratory depression and overdose risk

Concomitant use with **opioids or other CNS depressants** [^114QmWu7] can cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death [^1147JQWp]; avoid co-prescribing unless no alternatives exist [^113nGoez] [^112e5zzC]. Increased mortality is associated with **benzodiazepine–opioid co-use** [^111Y5Ugr] compared with opioids alone [^1147JQWp].

---

## Dependence, withdrawal, and misuse

Dependence and withdrawal can develop with prolonged use [^113WVci5]; abrupt cessation may trigger **severe withdrawal**, including **seizures** [^112kcRnQ] and **protracted symptoms** [^114njksx]. Misuse and addiction are concerns given benzodiazepines' **abuse potential** [^115HoaBp], especially when combined with other substances [^1147JQWp]; monitor for **misuse and addiction** [^113nGoez].

---

## Cognitive impairment and falls

Cognitive impairment is linked to long-term use [^115hfR3T], including **memory loss, confusion** [^112c59ZZ], and possible dementia [^114pBocy], particularly in older adults [^113WVci5]. Falls and fractures are more likely, particularly in **older adults** [^112c59ZZ] [^113WVci5].

---

## Sedation, motor impairment, and accidents

Sedation and motor impairment are common [^1147JQWp] and can **impair driving and machinery operation** [^1147euuw], increasing **accident risk** [^113WVci5]. Motor vehicle accidents occur more frequently due to **sedation** and **impaired coordination** [^112c59ZZ] [^113WVci5].

---

## Special populations and considerations

In patients with **substance use disorders**, avoid benzodiazepines because of high misuse and overdose risk. In **pregnancy**, use caution [^111GT4ZK]; potential fetal risks require careful risk–benefit assessment.

---

## Clinical recommendations

- **Lowest effective dose and shortest duration**: Use minimal effective dosing and duration [^113WVci5] to limit adverse effects.

- **Gradual tapering**: Avoid abrupt discontinuation [^1146boUA]; taper slowly [^114vBk5y] to reduce withdrawal risk.

- **Regular monitoring**: Reassess risks and benefits at least every three months [^113Qw717] or at each prescription renewal [^112zfEWP].

---

Benzodiazepines pose **substantial risks**, including respiratory depression [^114QmWu7], dependence [^114njksx], cognitive impairment, and falls [^113WVci5]. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration; avoid abrupt discontinuation [^114vBk5y] and monitor regularly to mitigate harms [^113Qw717].

### Benzodiazepine misuse in the elderly: Risk factors, consequences, and management [^112c59ZZ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) inappropriate use, which includes misuse and overuse, is a worldwide public health problem. Despite knowledge about increased sensitivity to side effects in the elderly, which should lead to more caution, only a third of BZD prescriptions in this age group are considered appropriate. The most frequent inadequate situations involve excessive duration and/or dosage of a medical prescription or self-medication, particularly in contexts where it would be contraindicated, such as long-acting BZD use in the elderly. Polypharmacy and comorbidities are major risk factors for misuse.

Consequences of BZD inappropriate use include falls, delirium and other cognitive dysfunctions, acute respiratory failure, car accidents, dependence, and withdrawal symptoms. An emerging concern is the potentially increased risk of dementia. Contrary to most clinicians' beliefs, discontinuation of chronic BZD use in elderly patients is feasible with adequate psychotherapeutic or pharmacological strategies and can lead to long-term abstinence. Brief cognitive therapy, which relies on psychoeducation and motivational enhancement, is particularly useful in this context.

Further research is needed in three main areas:

- **Assessing the impact of public health programs**: Focus on preventing BZD inappropriate use in the elderly.
- **Developing alternative strategies**: Aim to treat anxiety and insomnia in elderly patients.
- **Exploring the association**: Investigate the link between chronic BZD use and dementia.

### Xanax [^1147JQWp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Risks from concomitant use with opioids**: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including Xanax, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, concomitant prescribing of these drugs should be reserved for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to the use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe Xanax concomitantly with opioids, it is essential to prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and to follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, a lower initial dose of Xanax than indicated in the absence of an opioid should be prescribed, with titration based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking Xanax, a lower initial dose of the opioid should be prescribed, with titration based upon clinical response. Patients and caregivers should be advised about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Xanax is used with opioids. Patients should also be advised not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Abuse, misuse, and addiction**: The use of benzodiazepines, including Xanax, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of these drugs in a manner other than prescribed.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: Considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^114vBk5y]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

In the context of medical management for benzodiazepine use disorder, and specifically concerning benzodiazepine withdrawal, the 2025 guidelines from AAFP, AAN, AANP, AAPA, AAPP, ACMT, ACOG, AGS, APA, and ASAM recommend considering dose reductions of 5–10% when determining the initial pace of the benzodiazepine taper. The pace of the taper should typically not exceed 25% every two weeks.

### Oxazepam [^112e5zzC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Warnings**:
	- **Risks from concomitant use with opioids**: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including oxazepam, and opioids may lead to profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Due to these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients where alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have shown that using opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines together increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to using opioids alone. If oxazepam is to be prescribed alongside opioids, prescribe the lowest effective doses and minimize the duration of concomitant use. Closely monitor patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of oxazepam than typical and adjust based on clinical response. Conversely, if an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking oxazepam, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based on clinical response.

	- Advise patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when oxazepam is used with opioids. Patients should be advised not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of the concomitant use are established [see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions].

	- **Abuse, misuse, and addiction**: The use of benzodiazepines, including oxazepam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, potentially leading to overdose or death.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: Considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115DsdRh]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The 2025 guidelines from the AAFP, AAN, AANP, AAPA, AAPP, ACMT, ACOG, AGS, APA, and ASAM recommend avoiding the use of rapid benzodiazepine reversal agents, such as flumazenil, for benzodiazepine tapering due to the risks of refractory seizures, cardiac dysrhythmias, and other adverse effects. This guidance is particularly relevant for the management of benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in patients with benzodiazepine use disorder.

### Balancing safety, comfort, and fall risk: An intervention to limit opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions for geriatric patients [^115jq1W8]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Low credibility.

The clinician's decision to provide opioids or benzodiazepines to elderly patients following a fall is multifaceted, and our study aims to use a large and representative dataset to help characterize this population, highlight prescribing patterns, and identify high-risk use patterns. Approximately 10% of patients receiving an opioid for an outpatient visit have at least one pre-defined risk factor, and this finding offers a reason for providers to pause before writing a prescription. Balancing safety and comfort is challenging, particularly in this high-risk population who experience an injury potentially associated with significant pain. Awareness of risk factors is an important first step; more work is needed to address potentially hazardous prescriptions in the older adult population.

### The effects of benzodiazepines on cognition [^115hfR3T]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Initially thought to be virtually free of negative effects, benzodiazepines are now known to carry risks of dependence, withdrawal, and adverse side effects. Among the most controversial of these side effects are the cognitive effects. Long-term treatment with benzodiazepines has been associated with impairment in several cognitive domains, such as visuospatial ability, speed of processing, and verbal learning. Conversely, long-term benzodiazepine use has also been reported as causing no chronic cognitive impairment, with any cognitive dysfunction in patients attributed to sedation or inattention or considered temporary and associated with peak plasma levels.

Complicating the issue are questions of whether anxiety disorders themselves are associated with cognitive deficits and the extent to which patients are aware of their own cognitive problems. In an attempt to settle this debate, meta-analyses of peer-reviewed studies were conducted and found that cognitive dysfunction did, in fact, occur in patients treated long-term with benzodiazepines. Although cognitive dysfunction improved after benzodiazepines were withdrawn, patients did not return to levels of functioning that matched benzodiazepine-free controls. Neuroimaging studies have identified transient changes in the brain following benzodiazepine administration but no brain abnormalities in patients treated long-term with benzodiazepines. Such findings suggest that patients should be advised of potential cognitive effects when treated long-term with benzodiazepines, and they should be informed that the impact of such effects may not be entirely reversible.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: Considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1156exZb]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The 2025 guidelines from AAFP, AAN, AANP, AAPA, AAPP, ACMT, ACOG, AGS, APA, and ASAM recommend that, in the management of benzodiazepine use disorder, particularly during withdrawal, patients without contraindications should be transitioned to a comparable dose of a longer-acting benzodiazepine medication for tapering.

---

### Buprenorphine [^116EbHWj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants increases the risk of adverse reactions, including overdose and death. However, medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder should not be categorically denied to patients taking these drugs. Prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder alone.

As a routine part of orientation to buprenorphine treatment, patients should be educated about the risks of concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, and alcohol. Developing strategies to manage the use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at the initiation of buprenorphine treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment, is crucial. Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required.

There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of buprenorphine as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in buprenorphine-treated patients. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of buprenorphine dosing, delaying or omitting the buprenorphine dose may be appropriate.

Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use. In some instances, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, or decreasing to the lowest effective dose, may be appropriate.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: Considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^112yvyC9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for benzodiazepine use disorder, more specifically with respect to adjunctive therapy, AAFP/AAN/AANP/AAPA/AAPP/ACMT/ACOG/AGS/APA/ASAM 2025 guidelines recommend considering pausing or slowing the pace of the benzodiazepine taper when patients experience symptoms that significantly interfere with the taper, such as sleep difficulty or anxiety. Additionally, they suggest considering the use of adjunctive medications.

### What can predict and prevent the long-term use of benzodiazepines [^115q8mp9]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

Although benzodiazepines (BZDs) are commonly prescribed for insomnia or anxiety, long-term use of BZDs causes serious adverse effects such as daytime drowsiness and cognitive decline. In the study, we evaluated the predictors and preventers of long-term usage of BZDs from a retrospective survey by utilizing the 12-year prescription record of a university hospital. From the prescription data of 92,005 people, users of BZDs (n = 3,470, male = 39.2%, mean age = 60 ± 17.5) were analyzed. During this period, both the number of prescriptions (2,722 in 2004 to 1,019 in 2016) and the number of BZDs (1.73 in 2004 to 1.36 in 2016) gradually decreased, although more than half of the patients continued to take BZDs for over three years. High-risk factors for long-term use of BZDs include elderly patients (> 65 years old), high dosage (> 5 mg diazepam per day), psychiatrist-prescribers, and users with polytherapy. Discontinuation is significantly found in users of hypnotic BZDs and alternative psychotropic medical drugs (including antipsychotics, serotonergic drugs, or newer types of sleep medicine). Future studies should focus on elucidating interventions that are more effective against long-term usage of BZDs.

### Risk of overdose with exposure to prescription opioids, benzodiazepines, and non-benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics in adults: A retrospective cohort study [^111Y5Ugr]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Use of benzodiazepines in opioid users has been linked to a higher risk of emergency room visits or inpatient admissions for opioid overdose and death from drug overdose. Further research is needed to confirm the findings and analyze contributing risk factors for opioid overdoses in a large commercially insured population.

- **Objectives**: To estimate the risk of opioid overdose associated with opioid users exposed to various combinations of opioid, benzodiazepine, and non-benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic therapy. To identify other factors that are associated with increased risk for opioid overdose.

- **Design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Patients**: New start adult users of opioids, defined as naïve to opioids for 6 months, in Kaiser Permanente California regions from January 2013 through September 2017.

- **Main measures**: Inpatient or emergency department admissions due to opioid-related overdose.

- **Key results**: A total of 2,241,530 patients were included in this study. Patients exposed to opioids, benzodiazepines, and non-benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics at any point during their follow-up were 60% more likely to overdose than those who were only exposed to opioids (p < 0.0001). Those exposed to opioids and benzodiazepines were 20% more likely to have an opioid-related overdose than those exposed to opioids only (p < 0.0001). Significant risk factors for opioid overdose included exposure to all three medication classes, higher opioid dosage strengths, elderly age (age ≥ 65 years), history of previous overdose, and substance use disorder.

### BAP updated guidelines: Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological management of substance abuse, harmful use, addiction and comorbidity: Recommendations from BAP [^111QdHXd]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for benzodiazepine use disorder, particularly concerning the withdrawal of benzodiazepines, the BAP 2012 guidelines recommend offering minimal interventions. These may include advisory letters, providing additional information, or general practitioner advice for patients with early or mild dependence using benzodiazepines at therapeutic doses.

### "Should patients with substance use disorders be prescribed benzodiazepines?" No [^112bsJS7]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) should not use benzodiazepines to treat anxiety, insomnia, or any other condition, for the same reasons they should avoid alcohol or other drugs, irrespective of their primary drug usage. Once the addiction "switch" is activated, it remains permanently. This issue gained additional significance in 2016 when the US Food and Drug Administration issued black box warnings for all benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics, highlighting serious risks associated with their simultaneous use. Anxiety is not a benzodiazepine-deficiency disease. It is possible to manage anxiety and insomnia without medication, and alternative treatments can be equally effective without jeopardizing the patient's recovery. Despite many SUD patients seeking benzodiazepines, using alternatives often yields positive outcomes and maintains recovery efforts. The standard proposed here is based on the experiences of numerous individuals with SUDs who attempted and failed to use benzodiazepines for anxiety.

### Anticholinergic and benzodiazepine medication use and risk of incident dementia: a UK cohort study [^114pBocy]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Dementia prevention is a public health priority. No disease-modifying treatment for dementia exists, but dementia risk and progression can be modified by altering exposure to risk factors affecting any aspect of long-term brain health. Identifying such risk factors is crucial for dementia prevention and cognitive health.

Long-term use of several classes of medications has been suggested to increase future dementia risk. Medications with anticholinergic activity (henceforth referred to as anticholinergics), benzodiazepines, and related non-benzodiazepine derivatives have come under particular scrutiny due to their well-known short-term cognitive effects and the high prevalence of their long-term use among middle-aged and older individuals.

Anticholinergics are effectively used in the treatment of various conditions such as urinary incontinence, Parkinson's disease, depression, and epilepsy. However, anticholinergics can adversely affect cognition; therefore, guidelines suggest they should be avoided among frail older individuals or those with dementia. Over the past decade, prolonged exposure to anticholinergics has been linked to long-term cognitive decline or dementia. Many medicines beyond those typically regarded as anticholinergics may have mild anticholinergic effects, and it has been suggested that the cumulative long-term use of many such medications may increase dementia risk. Depending on their definition, anticholinergic medications are used by 10–50% of the middle-aged and older population at any time.

Benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine derivatives are primarily used to treat anxiety or panic disorders.

### Benzodiazepine use disorder: Common questions and answers [^117UkHzB]. American Family Physician (2023). Low credibility.

In the United States, more than 30 million adults have reported taking a benzodiazepine within the past year. Misuse — use of a drug in a way that a doctor did not direct — accounts for 17.2% of all benzodiazepine use. Family physicians face challenges when balancing the patient's perceived benefits of benzodiazepines with known risks and lack of evidence supporting their use. Benzodiazepines cause significant central nervous system-related adverse effects, including sedation, confusion, memory loss, depression, falls, fractures, and motor vehicle crashes.

- **Risk factors**: Factors that increase the risk of adverse effects and misuse are other substance use disorders, using concomitant central nervous system medications, and central nervous system or pulmonary diseases. Compared with intermittent use, chronic daily use in older adults is associated with a higher risk of falls, fractures, hospitalizations, and death.

- **Withdrawal symptoms and management**: Withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, sleep disturbances, and agitation are common and often prolonged. Adjunctive treatment with antiepileptics, antidepressants, and pregabalin has been shown to lessen withdrawal symptoms.

- **Deprescribing strategies**: Deprescribing benzodiazepines for patients who use them chronically should be individualized with slow tapering over weeks to months, or longer, to minimize the intensity of withdrawal symptoms. Incorporating behavioral interventions, such as cognitive behavior therapy, improves deprescribing outcomes.

### Canadian guidelines on benzodiazepine receptor agonist use disorder among older adults [^112zMUcT]. Canadian Geriatrics Journal (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for benzodiazepine use disorder, particularly in elderly patients, the CGS 2020 guidelines recommend assessing the indication, dose, duration, and features indicative of BZRA use disorder. Furthermore, medical practitioners should evaluate the patient's readiness to change and the presence of both medical and psychiatric comorbidities, including any past or present substance use or misuse, in older adult patients with suspected BZRA use disorder.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: Considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115buRfZ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The 2025 guidelines from AAFP, AAN, AANP, AAPA, AAPP, ACMT, ACOG, AGS, APA, and ASAM recommend tapering benzodiazepine medication in older adults unless there are compelling reasons for continuation, particularly concerning circumstances of benzodiazepine use disorder in elderly patients.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: Considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1133Y84v]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for benzodiazepine use disorder, more specifically with respect to the withdrawal of benzodiazepines, the AAFP/AAN/AANP/AAPA/AAPP/ACMT/ACOG/AGS/APA/ASAM 2025 guidelines recommend managing benzodiazepine tapering typically in outpatient settings. However, consider inpatient care for benzodiazepine tapering when:

- **Patient presentation indicates**: An imminent risk of significant harm related to continued use of the benzodiazepine medication that is unlikely to be rapidly mitigated by the initial dose reduction of the benzodiazepine taper.

- **Patient symptoms and/or co-occurring physical or mental health conditions are anticipated**: To complicate benzodiazepine tapering in a way that cannot be safely managed in an outpatient setting.

- **The patient is experiencing or imminently anticipated to experience**: Severe or complicated benzodiazepine withdrawal.

### Onfi [^115HoaBp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Risks from concomitant use with opioids**: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including ONFI, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of benzodiazepines and opioids for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to the use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe ONFI concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when ONFI is used with opioids [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Abuse, misuse, and addiction**: The use of benzodiazepines, including ONFI, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].

Before prescribing ONFI and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: Considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111RzCPe]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The 2025 guidelines by AAFP/AAN/AANP/AAPA/AAPP/ACMT/ACOG/AGS/APA/ASAM recommend specific considerations for benzodiazepine tapering in patients with concurrent psychiatric disorders, emphasizing the importance of monitoring sleep. For those with mood or psychotic disorders, such as bipolar disorder, it is crucial to pay attention to sleep patterns since disturbances can trigger manic episodes. It is advised to pause the taper if patients exhibit significant sleep disturbances until the symptoms resolve, to avoid destabilization risks.

### The growing problem of co-treatment with opioids and benzodiazepines [^113iw4LZ]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Concern about the concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines led two US government agencies to act in 2016. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines on opioid prescribing urge clinicians to avoid the concurrent prescribing of benzodiazepines and opioids. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) now requires black box warnings, the highest level of alert, on product labels and patient-focused medication guides for opioids and benzodiazepines, recognizing the adverse outcomes associated with their concurrent use.

Warnings and guidelines, while important in defining problematic practices, are not likely to change clinical behavior — at least not quickly. Performance metrics used by payers could prove to be a key lever for change. In the US and the UK, payers hold clinicians and facilities accountable for basic quality. However, we found no example of performance metrics targeting hazardous drug combinations. Optimal use of safety alerts in electronic health records could prove effective, but only if they appropriately notify prescribers of hazardous combinations and only if prescribers are held accountable for overriding warnings. Guidelines provide explicit definitions of best practice, but, as with all else in healthcare, the challenge is in effective implementation and incentives sufficient to motivate changes in the system.

Although the implementation of expanded quality metrics, incentives, and systems that facilitate safer prescribing practices around drug combinations will take time, Sun and colleagues provide evidence that can be of immediate use. For example, the r

### Benzodiazepine deprescription strategies in chronic users: a systematic review [^1158X5VC]. Family Practice (2021). Low credibility.

As long-term use of benzodiazepines increases, adverse effects also become more frequent, especially in elderly adults. Due to the potential of causing dependence, poor patient adherence, and a lack of awareness of side effects, deprescription is challenging. This study aimed to identify effective approaches to motivate and promote the deprescription of benzodiazepines.

- **Methods**: We used MeSH terms to search in five databases: MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, LILACS, SCIELO, and Science Direct. Articles were selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Risk of bias assessment for randomized controlled trials and prospective interventional studies was conducted using RoB 2.0 and ROBINS-I tools, respectively. For cohort studies, we used the Clarity Group by McMaster University tool.

- **Results**: The database search retrieved 412 results, and 11 studies were selected for analysis. Interventions focusing on patient education to improve community awareness about deprescription presented better discontinuation rates and had more potential to motivate discussions about deprescribing with physicians. Interventions based on counseling by different health professionals were not well evaluated, with four of six studies presenting a high, serious, or critical risk of bias.

- **Conclusions**: Although the comparison of different strategies was impaired by the high risk of bias in some studies, patient education-focused interventions presented good results. Future studies should consider a follow-up of six months or longer with an evaluation of withdrawal.

### The role of extended-release benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety: A risk-benefit evaluation with a focus on extended-release alprazolam [^114y6iso]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Immediate-release (IR) benzodiazepines have a short duration of therapeutic effect and are generally less effective for anxiety than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in reducing concomitant depressive symptomatology. Common criticisms of benzodiazepines also include the patient's tendency to develop a tolerance to the anxiolytic effect and a dependence on the drug itself. The newer extended-release (XR) benzodiazepine formulation was designed to increase efficacy, duration of therapeutic effect, tolerance, compliance, and ease of discontinuation.

The XR benzodiazepine alprazolam has shown efficacy in panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder comparable to the older benzodiazepine formulations. Pharmacokinetic data show that the XR formulation has a longer therapeutic effect compared with IR formulations, which reduces the potential for breakthrough anxiety symptoms. Data also indicate that the XR formulation has less abuse liability than the IR formulation.

This article reviews the efficacy, safety, and discontinuation data from clinical trials of IR and XR benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety disorders and provides guidelines to minimize the risk of withdrawal syndrome during benzodiazepine discontinuation.

### Benzodiazepine-opioid co-prescribing in a national probability sample of ED encounters [^115jxAYs]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepine-opioid combination therapy is potentially harmful due to the risk of synergistic respiratory depression, and the rate of death due to benzodiazepine-opioid overdose is increasing. Little is known about the prevalence and characteristics of benzodiazepine-opioid co-prescribing from the ED setting.

- **Methods**: Secondary analysis of data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, using sample weights to generate population estimates. The primary objective was to describe the annual prevalence of benzodiazepine-opioid co-prescribing from 2006 to 2012, using 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) to compare adjacent years. The secondary objective was to compare characteristics of ED encounters receiving a benzodiazepine-opioid co-prescription versus those receiving an opioid prescription alone, using a multivariable logistic regression.

- **Results**: The prevalence of benzodiazepine-opioid co-prescribing did not significantly change from 2006 to 2012. During this period, 2.7% (95% CI: 2.5–2.8%) of ED encounters prescribed an opioid were also prescribed a benzodiazepine. Relative to encounters receiving an opioid prescription alone, encounters receiving a co-prescription were more likely to represent a follow-up rather than an initial visit (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.52), receive more medications (OR 1.41) and fewer procedures (OR 0.48) while in the ED, and more likely to have a diagnosis related to a mental disorder (OR 20.60) or musculoskeletal problem (OR 3.71).

- **Conclusions**: From 2006 to 2012, almost 3% of all ED encounters receiving an opioid prescription were also issued a benzodiazepine co-prescription.

### Balancing safety, comfort, and fall risk: An intervention to limit opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions for geriatric patients [^113b7QdU]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Low credibility.

This study reports on the impact of a clinical decision support tool embedded in the electronic medical record and characterizes the demographics, prescribing patterns, and risk factors associated with opioid and benzodiazepine misuse in the older adult population.

- **Significance**: This study reports on prescribing patterns for patients aged 65 years and older who presented to Emergency Departments (ED) or Urgent Care (UC) facilities across a large healthcare system following a fall (n = 34,334 encounters; n = 25,469 patients). This system implemented a clinical decision support intervention that provides an alert when the patient has an evidence-based risk factor for prescription drug misuse; prescribers can continue, amend, or cancel the prescription.

- **Results**: Of older adults presenting with a fall, 31.4% (N = 7986) received an opioid or benzodiazepine prescription. Women and younger patients (65–74) had a higher likelihood of receiving a prescription (P < .0001). Eleven percent had at least one risk factor. Women were more likely to receive an early refill (P = 0.0002), and younger (65–74) men were more likely to have a past positive toxicology (P < .0001). A prescription was initiated in 8,591 encounters, and 946 (9.0%) triggered an alert. In 58 cases, the alert resulted in a prescription modification, and in 80 cases, the prescription was canceled.

- **Conclusions**: Documented risk for opioid misuse in the elderly was 10% among patients presenting to the ED/UC following a fall. The dangers associated with opioid/benzodiazepine use increase with age, as does fall risk. Awareness of risk factors is important.

### Balancing safety, comfort, and fall risk: An intervention to limit opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions for geriatric patients [^114mF8zS]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Low credibility.

Concern for increasing opioid prescription use among older adults is rising; in 2016, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services data estimated that one-third of Medicare Part D participants received a prescription opioid. This population faces a specific set of potential complications from psychoactive agents like opioids, including but not limited to falls, respiratory impairment, and delirium. The opioid crisis has been described as the largest human-made epidemic in public health history. Although much of the discussion concerns the younger population suffering from an overdose, this epidemic does not exclude those over the age of 65. In fact, older adults have higher use of prescription opioids, evidence of increasing misuse, and greater risks associated with increasing dosage and the combination of multiple types of central nervous system (CNS) altering agents, such as opioids in combination with benzodiazepines. Emergency department visits by older adults with identified opioid misuse increased by nearly 220% from 2006 to 2014.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: Considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^116V8uvF]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) has partnered with nine other medical societies and professional associations, representing a wide range of clinical settings and patient populations, to provide guidance on evidence-based strategies for tapering benzodiazepine (BZD) medication across a variety of settings.

The guideline was developed following modified GRADE methodology and a clinical consensus process. This process included a systematic literature review as well as several targeted supplemental searches. The clinical practice guideline was revised based on external stakeholder review.

- **Recommendations**: Key takeaways included the following: Clinicians should engage in ongoing risk-benefit assessment of BZD use/tapering. Clinicians should utilize shared decision-making strategies in collaboration with patients. Clinicians should not discontinue BZDs abruptly in patients who are likely to be physically dependent and at risk of withdrawal. Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each patient and adjust tapering based on patient response. Clinicians should offer patients adjunctive psychosocial interventions to support successful tapering.

### An examination of concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine prescribing in 9 states, 2015 [^115HnEF6]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Concurrent prescribing of opioids and benzodiazepines is discouraged by evidence-based clinical guidelines due to the known risks of taking these medications in combination.

- **Methods**: This study analyzed concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine prescribing in 9 states using the 2015 Prescription Behavior Surveillance System, a multistate database of de-identified prescription drug monitoring program data. Concurrent prescribing rates were examined among individuals with both an opioid and a benzodiazepine prescription. Among patients with concurrent prescribing, total days of opioid supply, daily dosage of opioids, and total days of concurrent prescriptions were examined. Analyses were stratified by whether concurrent prescribing was from a single prescriber or multiple prescribers. Opioid prescribing and concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine prescribing rates were examined by age and sex. Analyses were conducted in 2018.

- **Results**: Among 19,977,642 patients who were prescribed an opioid, 21.6% (4,324,092) were also prescribed a benzodiazepine, of which 54.9% (2,375,219) had concurrent prescriptions. More than half of the patients with concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions received them from two or more distinct prescribers. Mean total opioid days, daily opioid dosage, and days of concurrent prescribing were higher among patients when multiple prescribers were involved compared with prescriptions from the same prescriber. Concurrent prescribing was more common among adults aged ≥ 50 years and female patients.

- **Conclusions**: Public health interventions are needed to reduce the risks associated with concurrent prescribing of these medications.

### Ativan [^113nGoez]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Risks from concomitant use with opioids**: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including Ativan, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to the use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe Ativan concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of Ativan than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking Ativan, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response.

	- Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Ativan is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined.

- **Abuse, misuse, and addiction**: The use of benzodiazepines, including Ativan, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve…

### Prescribing and deprescribing guidance for benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine receptor agonist use in adults with depression, anxiety, and insomnia: an international scoping review [^114QvgL6]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

The switch to a long-acting agent, diazepam in particular, was commonly acknowledged as an option with variation in the 'when' and 'how' of the BZD substitution approach. Some guidelines did not make this recommendation due to a scarcity of evidence. Furthermore, accurate benzodiazepine conversion (i.e. diazepam milligram equivalence) for individual patients remains a challenge that may be improved upon by further research.

Another area of contention in the prescriptive management of BZD withdrawal is the use of alternative pharmacotherapies as either adjuncts or to substitute the BZD entirely. Previous reviews have identified some agents, such as carbamazepine and melatonin, for their use in this setting — though results are mixed and not entirely devoid of risk itself. The documents reviewed were quite divided in either their recommendations or even acknowledgment of these pharmacologic options as viable strategies. This is likely explained by the limited number of randomized controlled trials and lower-quality heterogeneous evidence variably supporting their use, as reviewed in further detail elsewhere. Furthermore, the fact that there were many such agents without clear guidance on 'when' (what stage of withdrawal), 'how' (dosing and duration), and 'where' (i.e. institutional or outpatient setting) to use them does not yet offer clinicians much confidence in their routine adoption as a strategy for BZD discontinuation.

A final area of interest relevant to deprescribing is the barely investigated, often patient-driven, approach toward BZD formulation altering.

### Pharmacological interventions for benzodiazepine discontinuation in chronic benzodiazepine users [^114njksx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines is common practice despite clinical recommendations for short-term use. They are used by approximately 4% of the general population, with increased prevalence in psychiatric populations and the elderly. After long-term use, it is often difficult to discontinue benzodiazepines due to psychological and physiological dependence. This review investigated whether pharmacological interventions can facilitate benzodiazepine tapering.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions to facilitate the discontinuation of chronic benzodiazepine use.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases up to October 2017: Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group's Specialised Register of Trials, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and ISI Web of Science. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO ICTRP, and ISRCTN registry, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomized controlled trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials comparing pharmacological treatment versus placebo or no intervention, or versus another pharmacological intervention in adults who had been treated with benzodiazepines for at least two months and/or fulfilled criteria for benzodiazepine dependence (any criteria).

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included 38 trials (involving 2,543 participants), but we could only extract data from 35 trials with 2,295 participants. Many different interventions were studied, but there is a general lack of robust data.

Despite the increasing focus on using antidepressants and other agents for treating anxiety, benzodiazepines have remained a mainstay of anxiolytic pharmacotherapy due to their robust efficacy, rapid onset of therapeutic effect, and generally favorable side effect profile. In this article, we examine issues related to the long-term use of benzodiazepines, including concerns about the development of therapeutic tolerance, dose escalation, and adverse cognitive effects. We also consider currently available alternatives to benzodiazepines and novel mechanisms of action that may prove fruitful in the development of future generations of anxiolytics.

### Balancing safety, comfort, and fall risk: An intervention to limit opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions for geriatric patients [^112KDE8w]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Low credibility.

Use of opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions is an example of an intervenable cause of balance issues and falling in the elderly population. About one-third of our patient population received an opioid prescription, aligning with national data. Over 31% of patients received an opioid and/or benzodiazepine prescription for the encounter: 7,913 received an opioid, 36 received a benzodiazepine prescription, and 37 received both. Women and younger patients (aged 65–74) had a higher likelihood of receiving a prescription (P < 0.0001). Hydrocodone-acetaminophen was most often prescribed (60.83%). Eleven percent had one or more risk factors for opioid misuse (N = 872); women were more likely to receive an early refill (P = 0.0002) and younger men more likely to have a past positive toxicology (P < 0.0001).

A prescription was initiated in 8,591 encounters, and 946 (11%) triggered an alert. The alert resulted in modification of the opioid or benzodiazepine prescription in 58 (6.1%) and cancellation of the prescription in 80 (8.4%). Progress has been made in mandating a review of prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) prior to prescribing opioids, as well as integrating PDMP review into electronic medical records. However, accessibility via the electronic medical record varies widely by EHR vendors and mandates vary by state.

The PRIMUM clinical decision support intervention provides the prescriber with critical information related to risk, such as positive toxicology screens or prior overdose, as well as benzodiazepines that are not included in PDMPs.

### Balancing safety, comfort, and fall risk: An intervention to limit opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions for geriatric patients [^112sVZxJ]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Low credibility.

The association between patient demographic characteristics and whether an opioid or benzodiazepine was prescribed is presented in Table 1. Of the patient cohort, 40.1% were aged 65–74 years, 34.8% were aged 75–84 years, and 25.1% were aged 85 years or older. Younger patients were more likely to receive an opioid or benzodiazepine prescription (39.52% of those aged 65–74; 29.84% of those aged 75–84; and 20.39% of those aged 85+; P < .0001). The cohort was predominantly White (83.77%) with 68.1% being female. Prescriptions were dispensed in 31.53% of White patients, 29.03% of Black patients, and 38.17% of patients of other ethnicities. Women were more likely to receive a prescription compared to men (32.93% vs. 27.98%, respectively; P < .0001).

Of the 25,469 patients, 31.4% (N = 7986) received a prescription. Among them, 7913 received an opioid only, 36 received benzodiazepines only, and 37 received both.

- **Patient demographics and prescription patterns**: Among patients who received a prescription, the association of patient demographic factors such as age, race, gender, and income, and the average number of risk factors per encounter for opioid misuse are presented in Table 2 and Table 3. Of those who received a prescription, 813 patients triggered at least one alert for potential misuse. Specifically, 313 (11.75%) patients triggered an alert for an early refill, 133 (4.71%) had two or more instances of onsite administration of pain medication in the previous 30 days, and 45 (1.77%) patients had more than three prescriptions for opioids or benzodiazepines in the prior 30 days. Additionally, 35 (1.09%) patients had a recorded prior opioid overdose.

### Benzodiazepines for treatment of patients with delirium excluding those who are cared for in an intensive care unit [^111AUFTw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Delirium is a very common condition associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and costs. Critical care guidelines recommend, first and foremost, the use of nonpharmacological strategies in both the prevention and treatment of delirium. Pharmacological interventions may augment these approaches, and they are currently used widely in clinical practice to manage the symptoms of delirium. Benzodiazepines are currently used in clinical practice to treat behavioral disturbances associated with delirium, but guidelines do not recommend their use for this indication. The use of these medicines is controversial because there is uncertainty about whether they are effective for patients or have the potential to harm them.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines in the treatment of delirium (excluding delirium related to withdrawal from alcohol or benzodiazepines) in any healthcare settings other than intensive care units (ICU).

- **Search methods**: We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register up to 10 April 2019. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases (including MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), numerous trial registries (including national, international, and pharmaceutical registries), and grey literature sources.

Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined.

- **Abuse, misuse, and addiction**: Inform patients that the use of estazolam, even at recommended dosages, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose and death, especially when used in combination with other medications (e.g. opioid analgesics), alcohol, and/or illicit substances. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse, misuse, and addiction; to seek medical help if they develop these signs and/or symptoms; and on the proper disposal of unused drug.

- **Withdrawal reactions**: Inform patients that the continued use of estazolam may lead to clinically significant physical dependence and that abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of estazolam may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening.

### Debate: Are benzodiazepines appropriate treatments for patients with substance use disorders? Yes [^1131ASMs]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines are a controversial treatment for anxiety in patients with substance use disorders. Concerns include risk of addiction, overdose, and diversion. However, benzodiazepines are among the most effective and well-tolerated treatments for anxiety and are safe for the majority of patients who take them. Though not appropriate for all cases, particularly in those with an active opioid use disorder, benzodiazepines should be considered as a treatment for patients with substance use disorders after careful weighing of benefits and harms.

### Agonist substitution — a treatment alternative for high-dose benzodiazepine-dependent patients [^113QjBDp]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

There is vast evidence for the superiority of agonist treatments, such as methadone and buprenorphine, over a withdrawal approach in opioid-dependent populations. However, little research has been conducted on the same approach for the treatment of high-dose benzodiazepine (BZD) dependence. Even large-scale reviews and meta-analyses discussing treatment strategies for benzodiazepine-dependent patients focus solely on approaches that aim to achieve abstinence, particularly complete BZD withdrawal. While the types of interventions differ, such as:

- **Gradual benzodiazepine taper**: Using a long or a short half-life benzodiazepine.
- **Switching to non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics**
- **Prescribing adjunctive medications**: Such as antidepressants or anticonvulsants on an in-patient or outpatient basis.

The common aim of treatment still remains total abstinence from benzodiazepines. However, the majority of patients suffering from high-dose BZD dependence do not succeed with long-term abstinence, regardless of the procedure, and clinicians have been using BZD 'substitution' treatment in such cases for decades. Therefore, we suggest the evaluation of a substitution approach in this group, consisting of maintenance treatment with a slow-onset, long-acting BZD. The advantages of such a procedure may include improved health, less craving, fewer withdrawal complications, reduced anxiety, increased treatment retention, improvements in social functioning, and less illegal activity. Cognitive impairments, the most problematic side effects of substitution treatment with benzodiazepines, could possibly be minimized by using an optimal approach.

### Benzodiazepines and risk of all cause mortality in adults: cohort study [^111QtgbM]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

The study population included patients aged 18 years and older who began using benzodiazepines between July 1, 2004, and December 31, 2013, and had six months of continuous health plan enrollment before drug initiation (the index date for benzodiazepine starters). Benzodiazepine initiators were defined as those with no benzodiazepine use in the previous six months. Patients could not enter the study cohort more than once.

- **Medication use and outcome definition**: A primary non-active comparator group was used due to the association of the entire benzodiazepine class with an increased mortality risk, rendering a within-class comparator unsuitable. Additionally, benzodiazepines have diverse indications, complicating the selection of an out-of-class comparator group. Non-users may differ significantly from benzodiazepine initiators, either having a lower comorbidity burden and mortality risk or facing higher barriers to treatment and surveillance, potentially leading to higher mortality risk. These differences necessitate proper study design or analysis to account for them.

For comparison, non-benzodiazepine users were selected to ensure they had similar opportunities for evaluation and treatment within a corresponding time frame to those who started benzodiazepines.

### A 5-year prospective assessment of the risk associated with individual benzodiazepines and doses in new elderly users [^114ByMgw]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2005). Low credibility.

The study aimed to determine the risk of injury associated with the new use of individual benzodiazepines and dosage regimens in the elderly. It was a prospective database cohort study with 5 years of follow-up conducted in Quebec, Canada. The participants were 253,244 persons aged 65 and older who were nonusers of benzodiazepines in the year before follow-up.

Population-based hospitalization, prescription, and medical services claims databases were used to compare the risk of injury during periods of benzodiazepine use with those of nonuse. Periods of use were measured for 10 insured benzodiazepines by drug and dose as time-dependent covariates. Injury was defined as the first occurrence of a nonvertebral fracture, soft-tissue injury, or accident-related hospital admission. Patient age, sex, previous injury history, concomitant medication use, and comorbidity were measured as fixed and time-dependent confounders. Cox proportional hazards models were employed to estimate the risk of injury with benzodiazepine use and to determine the extent to which patient characteristics, differences in dosage, or the effect of increasing dosage for individual drugs explained differences between drugs.

The results indicated that more than one-quarter (27.6%) of the 253,244 elderly were dispensed at least one prescription for a benzodiazepine, and 17.7% of these individuals were treated for at least one injury during the follow-up, with fractures being the most common injury. Patient characteristics and systematic differences in the risk of injury among the elderly prescribed different benzodiazepines were analyzed to understand the disparities in risk profiles.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: Considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113Qw717]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for benzodiazepine use disorder, particularly with respect to withdrawal, the AAFP/AAN/AANP/AAPA/AAPP/ACMT/ACOG/AGS/APA/ASAM 2025 guidelines recommend assessing the risks and benefits of ongoing benzodiazepine prescribing at least every three months for each patient taking benzodiazepine medications.

- **Risk-benefit assessment**: At a minimum, assess the risks and benefits with each new benzodiazepine prescription or benzodiazepine prescription renewal. Review the information in the relevant prescription drug monitoring programs as part of the risk-benefit assessment.

### Benzodiazepines: Risks and benefits. A reconsideration [^115m6BNC]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

Over the last decade, there have been further developments in our knowledge of the risks and benefits of benzodiazepines, as well as alternatives to benzodiazepines. Representatives drawn from the Psychopharmacology Special Interest Group of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the British Association for Psychopharmacology examined these developments and provided this joint statement with recommendations for clinical practice.

The working group was mindful of widespread concerns about benzodiazepines and related anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs. The group believes that whenever benzodiazepines are prescribed, the potential for dependence or other harmful effects must be considered. However, the group also believes that the risks of dependence associated with long-term use should be balanced against the benefits that, in many cases, follow from the short or intermittent use of benzodiazepines, along with the risk of the underlying conditions for which treatment is being provided.

### Trajectories of pregabalin use and their association with longitudinal changes in opioid and benzodiazepine use [^111GT7vS]. Pain (2022). High credibility.

Concomitant use of pregabalin with opioids and/or benzodiazepines is common, despite the increased risks. However, clinical trials suggest pregabalin can have an opioid-sparing effect when treating acute postoperative pain. We explored how opioid and benzodiazepine use changed over time in people initiating pregabalin, using dispensing claims data for a 10% sample of Australians from 2013 to 2019.

Among 142,776 people initiating pregabalin (median age = 61 years, 57% female), we used group-based trajectory modelling to identify six pregabalin dose trajectories in the first year post-initiation.

- **Discontinuation**: Two trajectories involved discontinuation: after one dispensing (49%), and after six months of treatment (14%).

- **Persistent use**: Four trajectories involved persistent use with variable estimated median daily doses of 39 mg (16%), 127 mg (14%), 276 mg (5%), and 541 mg (2%).

We quantified opioid and benzodiazepine use in the year before and after pregabalin initiation using generalized linear models. Over the study period, 71% were dispensed opioids and 34% benzodiazepines, with people on the highest pregabalin dose having the highest rates of use. Opioid use increased post-pregabalin initiation.

- **Opioid and pregabalin use**: Among people using both opioids and pregabalin, the geometric mean daily dose in oral morphine equivalents increased after pregabalin initiation in all trajectories, ranging from +5.9% (99% confidence interval 4.8%-7.0%) to +39.8% (99% confidence interval 38.3%-41.5%) for those on the highest daily pregabalin dose.

- **Pregabalin and benzodiazepines use**: Among people using both pregabalin and benzodiazepines, the dose remained constant over time.

### Psychosocial interventions for benzodiazepine harmful use, abuse or dependence [^112pbwXp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Benzodiazepines (BZDs) have a sedative and hypnotic effect on people. While short-term use can be beneficial, long-term BZD use is common and associated with several risks, including potential dependence in both opiate and non-opiate dependent patients.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for treating BZD harmful use, abuse, or dependence compared to pharmacological interventions, no intervention, placebo, or a different psychosocial intervention in reducing the use of BZDs in opiate dependent and non-opiate dependent groups.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL - The Cochrane Library, Issue 12, 2014), which includes the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialized Register; PubMed (from 1966 to December 2014); EMBASE (from 1988 to December 2014); CINAHL Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (1982 to September 2013); PsycINFO (1872 to December 2014); ERIC (Education Resources Information Centre, January 1966 to September 2013); All EBM Reviews (1991 to September 2013, Ovid Interface); AMED (Allied & Alternative Medicine, 1985 to September 2013); ASSIA (Applied Social Sciences Index & Abstracts, 1960 to September 2013); LILACS (January 1982 to September 2013); Web of Science (1900 to December 2014); Electronic Grey Literature Databases: Dissertation Abstracts; Index to Theses.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials examining the use of a psychosocial intervention to treat BZDs versus pharmacological interventions, no intervention, placebo, or a different psychosocial intervention.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: Considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^112VeioB]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for benzodiazepine use disorder, particularly in patients with a concomitant substance use disorder, the AAFP/AAN/AANP/AAPA/AAPP/ACMT/ACOG/AGS/APA/ASAM 2025 guidelines recommend:

- **Harm reduction services**: Offer patients harm reduction services or provide them with referrals to access these services.

- **Opioid overdose reversal medication**: Offer to provide or prescribe opioid overdose reversal medication, such as naloxone, and provide or refer patients for related education.

- **Community services for safe use supplies**: Consider providing or referring patients to community services for drug checking or other safe use supplies, such as fentanyl test strips, xylazine test strips, sterile syringes, and related education.

### Lorazepam [^113cHUyd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Risks from concomitant use with opioids - **Concomitant use of benzodiazepines**: including lorazepam injection and opioids, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. If a decision is made to use lorazepam injection concomitantly with opioids, monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Abuse, misuse, and addiction - **The use of benzodiazepines**: including lorazepam injection, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances. This is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE, Abuse).

Before prescribing lorazepam injection and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. The use of lorazepam injection, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of lorazepam injection along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Do not exceed the recommended dosing frequency. Avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g. opioid analgesics, stimulants). Advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drugs.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: Considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^116uJPUe]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for benzodiazepine use disorder, particularly concerning the management of benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, the AAFP/AAN/AANP/AAPA/AAPP/ACMT/ACOG/AGS/APA/ASAM 2025 guidelines recommend considering tapering with very long-acting agents, such as phenobarbital, for benzodiazepine withdrawal management in inpatient settings. Tapering with very long-acting agents should be performed only by clinicians experienced in their use for benzodiazepine withdrawal management, or in consultation with such experts.

### Tackling benzodiazepine misuse [^114o6urF]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines remain important treatments for certain short-term indications, but the risk of dependence and growing evidence of other harms demand careful consideration as part of shared decisions with patients. Patients must be fully informed of all risks, and prescribers should follow guidelines on short treatment duration. Mechanisms for early review are essential, and clear documentation of intended treatment duration is particularly important at interfaces of care, such as between secondary and primary care. Primary care professionals should conduct active case finding for patients taking benzodiazepines and follow guidelines on de-prescribing. Prescribers and pharmacists should also have strict protocols regarding the management of lost prescriptions and requests for repeat prescriptions to avoid fueling misuse; they should also be alert to the possibility of exploitation of vulnerable patients in the diversion of prescribed benzodiazepines. Given the workload pressures on primary care, however, it is essential that this is supported by sufficient resources, with time and funding for de-prescribing interventions, and access to specialist support.

In January 2018, the Department of Health commissioned an evidence review of dependence on prescribed drugs, which is expected to report early in 2019. It is hoped this will provide further clarity on prescribed benzodiazepine use and misuse in the UK. However, the availability of benzodiazepines through unregulated online sources indicates a need for urgent government intervention to tackle the misuse of these drugs.

### Benzodiazepines are prescribed more frequently to patients already at risk for benzodiazepine-related adverse events in primary care [^113Mzw9s]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepine use is associated with adverse drug events and higher mortality. Known risk factors for benzodiazepine-related adverse events include lung disease, substance use, and vulnerability to fracture.

- **Objective**: To determine whether benzodiazepine prescribing is associated with risk factors for adverse outcomes.

- **Design**: Longitudinal cohort study conducted between July 1, 2011, and June 30, 2012.

- **Participants**: Patients who visited hospital- and community-based practices in a primary care practice-based research network.

- **Main measures**: Odds ratio of having a target medical diagnosis for patients who received standard and high-dose benzodiazepine prescriptions; rates per 100 patients for outpatient and emergency department visits and hospitalizations.

- **Key results**: Among 65,912 patients, clinicians prescribed at least one benzodiazepine to 15% (9,821). Of benzodiazepine recipients, 5% received high doses. Compared to non-recipients, benzodiazepine recipients were more likely to have diagnoses of depression (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.6–2.9), substance abuse (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.9–2.5), tobacco use (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.5–1.8), osteoporosis (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.5–1.7), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.5–1.7), alcohol abuse (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3–1.7), sleep apnea (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3–1.6), and asthma (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.4–1.5). Compared to low-dose benzodiazepine recipients, high-dose benzodiazepine recipients were even more likely to have certain medical diagnoses: substance abuse (OR, 7.5; 95% CI, 5.5–10.1) and alcohol abuse (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, not provided due to truncation).

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^1131U9gH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Managing risks from concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants**: Concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants increases the risk of adverse reactions, including overdose and death. Medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder should not be categorically denied to patients taking these drugs. Prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder alone.

	- As a routine part of orientation to buprenorphine treatment, educate patients about the risks of concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, and alcohol. Develop strategies to manage the use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at the initiation of buprenorphine treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment. Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required.

	- There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of buprenorphine as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in buprenorphine-treated patients. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of buprenorphine dosing, delay or omit the buprenorphine dose if appropriate. Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use. In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: Considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113i8bve]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for benzodiazepine use disorder, specifically with respect to the withdrawal of benzodiazepines, the AAFP/AAN/AANP/AAPA/AAPP/ACMT/ACOG/AGS/APA/ASAM 2025 guidelines recommend developing the benzodiazepine tapering strategy in coordination with patients and their care partners. This should be done through a shared decision-making process whenever possible.

### Quazepam [^112kcRnQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The risk of withdrawal reactions can be mitigated by a gradual taper to discontinue Quazepam Tablets or reduce the dosage. A patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Patients with an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages and those who have had longer durations of use.

- **Acute withdrawal reactions**: The continued use of benzodiazepines, including Quazepam Tablets, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of Quazepam Tablets after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist), may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening (e.g. seizures) [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

- **Protracted withdrawal syndrome**: In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome experiencing withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].
