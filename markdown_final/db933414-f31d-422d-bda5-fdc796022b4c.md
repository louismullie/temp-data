## Question

Patient is a 73 y/o male with .6cm non-calcified pulmonary nodule as well as a positive quantiferon TB gold plus. What is my next step

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a 73-year-old man with a 6 mm solid, noncalcified pulmonary nodule and a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the malignancy risk of a 6 mm solid nodule and how age modifies that risk. Then, I should verify what the Fleischner Society recommends for 6–8 mm solid nodules in a high-risk patient. Next, I will examine what a positive IGRA means and does not mean in this context, and whether it changes nodule management. After that, I need to check for active TB with a chest radiograph and symptom review. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant plan and confirm the timing of CT follow-up and when to escalate to PET-CT or biopsy if the nodule grows or new features appear.

> Let me first confirm the baseline malignancy risk for a 6 mm solid nodule. Wait, let me verify the size threshold where routine follow-up is generally avoided. The Fleischner Society notes that solid nodules smaller than 6 mm generally do not require routine follow-up because their average cancer risk is less than 1 percent, but at 6 mm the risk sits in the 0.5–2 percent range, which warrants surveillance in high-risk patients, especially older adults and smokers [^114e5MSo] [^117FPbao]. Given the patient's age of 73, I should consider him high risk even if he is a never-smoker, so surveillance is appropriate rather than immediate PET-CT or biopsy [^114e5MSo] [^112fLWzu].

> Next, I should review the Fleischner recommendations for solitary solid 6–8 mm nodules in high-risk patients. I need to ensure I get the interval right. The Fleischner Society recommends an initial follow-up CT at 6–12 months and a second at 18–24 months if unchanged, with modification based on morphology and patient factors; importantly, they advise against earlier follow-up unless the baseline study is suboptimal or the patient needs reassurance, so I should not shorten the interval prematurely [^11661hdn]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to a solitary nodule; yes, these intervals are for solitary solid nodules in high-risk patients, which fits this case [^11661hdn].

> Now, I will examine the positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus result. I need to ensure I do not conflate latent TB infection with active disease. A positive IGRA indicates infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis but cannot distinguish latent from active TB, so I must exclude active disease before considering treatment for LTBI [^11183sTw]. Let me think about the next diagnostic step: a chest radiograph is the first-line test to screen for active TB, and if the radiograph is abnormal or the patient has symptoms, sputum studies and further evaluation are indicated; if the chest radiograph is normal and there are no symptoms, LTBI is more likely and treatment can be considered after shared decision-making [^11183sTw]. I should double-check that the nodule itself is not a typical TB lesion; a 6 mm solid nodule is not a classic granuloma or cavity, so the positive IGRA is likely unrelated to the nodule's etiology in this scenario [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the nodule represents active TB rather than malignancy or a granuloma. I should confirm that active TB is unlikely here. The absence of TB symptoms and a normal chest radiograph would make active TB improbable; if either is concerning, I would pursue sputum smear/culture or NAAT per ATS/IDSA/CDC diagnostic guidance before any LTBI therapy or invasive lung cancer workup [^11183sTw]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even with a positive IGRA, the pretest probability of active TB in an asymptomatic older adult with a 6 mm solid nodule is low, but I still need the chest radiograph to be certain [^11183sTw].

> Next, I should review how the IGRA result affects nodule management. I need to ensure I do not overreact. The positive IGRA does not increase the likelihood that a 6 mm solid nodule is malignant, nor does it justify expedited PET-CT or biopsy in the absence of concerning growth or new features; therefore, TB evaluation proceeds in parallel, but the nodule should still be managed per Fleischner for its size and risk profile [^114e5MSo]. Let me reconsider whether any guideline suggests altering small-nodule follow-up due to IGRA positivity; I find no such recommendation, reinforcing that surveillance remains appropriate [^notfound].

> I will now synthesize the immediate next steps. First, obtain a chest radiograph now to screen for active TB and to document baseline cardiopulmonary status; if the chest radiograph is abnormal or the patient has TB symptoms, proceed with sputum studies and infectious diseases consultation before LTBI treatment or invasive oncologic testing [^11183sTw]. Second, schedule surveillance chest CT for the nodule at 6–12 months from the baseline study, with a second CT at 18–24 months if unchanged; use low-dose, noncontrast thin-section technique for comparability and radiation minimization [^11661hdn]. Third, if the patient is high risk for progression from LTBI based on age and comorbidities, discuss LTBI treatment options such as once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine for 3 months, daily rifampin for 4 months, or isoniazid plus rifampin daily for 3 months, aligning with CDC/NTCA preferred regimens and patient preferences [^114FQHQk] [^116JF88t].

> I should confirm escalation triggers and thresholds. If the nodule grows by more than 20–25 percent in diameter or develops new suspicious features such as spiculation, or if it exceeds 8 mm, I should reassess pretest probability and consider PET-CT and/or tissue diagnosis per ACCP and ACR guidance. For nodules 8 mm or larger with moderate probability, PET-CT is reasonable, whereas very high pretest probability may favor direct surgical consultation [^112FkzMV] [^112Sigqt]. Hold on, I should verify that this escalation pathway is consistent with Fleischner; yes, Fleischner supports functional imaging and tissue sampling for larger or growing solid nodules, which aligns with this plan [^114JqRBL].

> Finally, I need to ensure shared decision-making and documentation. I should explain to the patient that the 6 mm nodule has a low but nonzero malignancy risk, that surveillance is the guideline-concordant approach, and that the positive IGRA requires screening for active TB but does not change nodule follow-up. I will document the estimated malignancy risk, the surveillance intervals, and the rationale for deferring PET-CT or biopsy at this time, consistent with ACCP emphasis on patient preferences and risk communication [^114y7KCx] [^112fLWzu].

The next step is to **exclude active TB** with a chest X-ray and symptom review [^11183sTw], then **manage the nodule per Fleischner** [^114e5MSo] with CT surveillance at 6–12 months and again at 18–24 months if unchanged. Do not start LTBI therapy until active TB is excluded; if the chest X-ray is normal and there are no symptoms, treat LTBI per CDC [^114FQHQk] after discussing risks and benefits. Reserve PET-CT or biopsy for nodules that grow or develop suspicious features [^112aTRQd].

---

## Step 1: exclude active tuberculosis

- **Chest radiograph**: Obtain a chest X-ray to assess for active TB or other abnormalities [^11183sTw].

- **Clinical assessment**: Screen for cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and hemoptysis [^notfound].

- **Sputum testing**: If symptoms or chest X-ray suggest active TB, obtain sputum smear, culture, and NAAT [^notfound].

- **Interpretation**: A positive IGRA indicates infection but does not distinguish latent from active TB; active TB must be excluded before LTBI treatment [^11183sTw].

---

## Step 2: evaluate the pulmonary nodule

- **Nodule size and risk**: A 6 mm solid, noncalcified nodule has a low malignancy risk (< 1%) [^notfound].

- **Fleischner guidelines**: For a solitary 6 mm solid nodule in a high-risk patient, obtain follow-up CT at 6–12 months and again at 18–24 months if unchanged [^11661hdn].

- **Surveillance rationale**: Serial CT balances early detection with avoidance of unnecessary invasive procedures [^116zCqwH].

---

## Step 3: manage latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI)

After active TB is excluded, **LTBI treatment** should be offered per CDC [^114FQHQk] using one of the preferred regimens (3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine, 4 months of daily rifampin, or 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin) [^114FQHQk]. Discuss **risks and benefits**, including hepatotoxicity and drug interactions, with the patient before initiating therapy [^notfound].

---

## Step 4: indications for further diagnostic testing

Reserve **PET-CT or biopsy** for nodules that show growth (> 20% increase in diameter) or develop suspicious features (spiculation, irregular margins) [^112aTRQd]. Multidisciplinary care should involve **pulmonology, radiology, infectious diseases, and thoracic surgery** if malignancy risk increases or if TB remains a concern [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

1. **Chest X-ray and symptom review**: Exclude active TB [^11183sTw]
2. **CT surveillance at 6–12 and 18–24 months**: Manage low-risk nodule per Fleischner [^113jqiPu]
3. **LTBI treatment after excluding active TB**: Prevent progression to active TB [^notfound]
4. **PET-CT or biopsy if nodule grows or becomes suspicious**: Evaluate for malignancy [^114JqRBL]

---

The priority is to **exclude active TB** [^11183sTw], then manage the nodule with surveillance [^114JqRBL] and treat LTBI if active disease is excluded [^114FQHQk].

### Physician agreement with recommendations contained in a national guideline for the management of incidental pulmonary nodules: a case study [^112VGu8t]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Our work has several limitations. First, the study surveyed only 9 physicians in a single large academic institution. However, the study was designed to be exploratory and to highlight and test the hypothesis that guideline non-adherence may be partly affected by lack of physician agreement with guideline component recommedations. Despite this important limitation, the survey participants represented a wide variety of specialties that would manage patients with pulmonary nodules, and many of them had extensive experience with the content of the 2017 Fleischner Society Guidelines.

Guidelines are composed of multiple unique recommendations and the strength of the underlying evidence supporting each recommendation can vary considerably. The factors that underlie rates of adherence to guidelines are multiple and include the strength of the underlying evidence, the risks and benefits associated with the disease, and as we discussed in this paper, physician agreement with the underlying clinical recommendations embedded within those guidelines. The issue of local experts disagreeing with 'national' guidelines, especially those based primarily on professional society consensus rather than high quality scientific evidence, may be a widespread issue that would benefit from further research.

Solid, indeterminate nodules > 8 mm — CT surveillance indications and schedule: In an individual with a solid, indeterminate nodule > 8 mm in diameter, perform surveillance with serial low-dose CT scans when the clinical probability of malignancy is deemed low (< 5%), when biopsy is non-diagnostic and the lesion is not hypermetabolic as assessed by PET, or when a fully informed patient prefers this nonaggressive management approach, despite the potential risk of disease progression. For those who undergo surveillance, serial CT scans using thin sections and non-contrast, low-dose techniques should be performed at 3 to 6 months, 9 to 12 months, 18 to 24 months, and, depending on clinical judgement and patient preference, annually thereafter.

### Pulmonary nodules: common questions and answers [^111RnwGJ]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary nodules are often incidentally discovered on chest imaging or from dedicated lung cancer screening. Screening adults 50 to 80 years of age who have a 20-pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit smoking within the past 15 years with low-dose computed tomography is associated with a decrease in cancer-associated mortality. Once a nodule is detected, specific radiographic and clinical features can be used in validated risk stratification models to assess the probability of malignancy and guide management. Solid pulmonary nodules less than 6 mm warrant surveillance imaging in patients at high risk, and nodules between 6 and 8 mm should be reassessed within 12 months, with the recommended interval varying by the risk of malignancy and an allowance for patient-physician decision-making. A functional assessment with positron emission tomography/computed tomography, nonsurgical biopsy, and resection should be considered for solid nodules 8 mm or greater and a high risk of malignancy. Subsolid nodules have a higher risk of cancer and should be followed with surveillance imaging for longer. Direct physician-patient communication, clinical decision support within electronic health records, and guideline-based management algorithms included in radiology reports are associated with increased compliance with existing guidelines.

### Updated Fleischner society guidelines for managing incidental pulmonary nodules: common questions and challenging scenarios [^114BvZkB]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

The new guidelines for managing incidental pulmonary nodules published by the Fleischner Society in 2017 reflect an improved understanding of the risk factors and biologic features of lung cancer. Specific topics emphasized in the updated guidelines include a new threshold size for follow-up, the importance of the morphologic features of nodules, accurate nodule measurements, recognition of subsolid components, understanding interval growth or change in nodule morphology, and knowledge of patient risk factors. The updated guidelines enable greater personal flexibility in the decision-making process and encourage individualized management of pulmonary nodules. These factors may introduce new challenges for radiologists, who previously used solely nodule size to make management recommendations. The authors describe eight scenarios that illustrate the challenges potentially encountered when applying the new guidelines to pulmonary nodule management. © RSNA, 2018.

### Official American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America / centers for disease control and prevention clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children [^11183sTw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) diagnostic testing — IGRA vs TST and age thresholds: Guidelines recommend that persons at low risk for Mtb infection and disease progression NOT be tested for Mtb infection. We concur with this recommendation. If diagnostic testing is nevertheless performed in such individuals, We suggest performing an IGRA instead of a TST in individuals 5 years or older (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest a second diagnostic test if the initial test is positive in individuals 5 years or older (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). When such testing is performed, the person is considered infected only if both tests are positive. We suggest performing a TST rather than an IGRA in healthy children < 5 years of age for whom it has been decided that diagnostic testing for LTBI is warranted (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). In situations in which an IGRA is deemed the preferred diagnostic test, some experts are willing to use IGRAs in children over 3 years of age. While both IGRA and TST testing provide evidence for infection with Mtb, they cannot distinguish active from latent TB. Therefore, the diagnosis of active TB must be excluded prior to starting on treatment for LTBI. This is typically done by determining whether or not symptoms suggestive of TB disease are present, performing a chest radiograph and, if radiographic signs of active TB are seen, then sampling is performed and the patient managed accordingly.

Bronchoscopy for pulmonary nodules — fluoroscopy-guided transbronchial biopsy (TBB) and endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided TBB diagnostic performance is as follows: In older studies of fluoroscopy-guided bronchoscopy with TBB for malignant nodules measuring < 2 cm in diameter, sensitivity ranged from 5% to 76% (median, 31%). A systematic review of EBUS-TBB in 1,090 patients reported pooled sensitivity for lesions of any size of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.70–0.76), with similar sensitivity when pooled across seven studies enrolling 580 patients with nodules measuring < 25 mm in diameter (0.71; 95% CI, 0.66–0.75). Randomized trials comparing EBUS-TBB with conventional TBB found in one study that sensitivity for nodules measuring ≤ 20 mm was 71% vs 23%, whereas a subsequent study reported 11% for EBUS-TBB vs 31% for conventional TBB; a pooled analysis of complication rates from both trials yielded a risk ratio of 0.49 (95% CI, 0.02–14.7).

The U. S. Food and Drug Administration has approved these two TB blood tests that are commercially available in the United States:

- QuantiFERON®-TB Gold Plus
- T-SPOT®. TB test Only one visit is required to draw blood for the test. TB blood tests are the preferred method of TB testing for people 5 years of age and older who have received the bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine. Interpreting test results Interpreting TB blood test results Interpretation of TB blood test results depends on the test being used.
- QFT-Plus results are based on the amount of IFN-γ that is released in response to the antigens and to the control substances after the blood has been incubated these substances.
- T-Spot results are based on comparing the number of IFN-γ producing cells produced after the blood has been incubated with these substances. Laboratories should provide both the qualitative and quantitative results.
- For qualitative results
- QFT-Plus results are reported as positive, negative, or indeterminate.
- T-Spot results are reported as positive, borderline, negative, or invalid.
- QFT-Plus results are reported as positive, negative, or indeterminate.
- Quantitative results are reported as numerical values that include responses to the TB antigen and two controls, nil and mitogen.
- Specific guidance is not available for interpreting quantitative IGRA results.
- These results may be helpful for understanding qualitative results in individual cases, in combination with risk factors.
- Specific guidance is not available for interpreting quantitative IGRA results. Next steps Several treatment regimens for patients with latent TB infection or TB disease are available.

Health care providers can choose the appropriate regimen based on:

- Drug-susceptibility results or drug-susceptibility results of the presumed source patient, if known,
- Coexisting medical conditions, and
- Potential for drug-drug interactions. For patients who need an alternative regimen because drug resistance is suspected or because of drug allergies or drug-drug interactions, consultation with a TB expert is recommended. Keep Reading: Clinical Treatment of Tuberculosis.

### Management of incidental lung nodules: current strategy and rationale [^1125AAPF]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Incidentally detected lung nodules are increasingly common in routine diagnostic computed tomography (CT) imaging. Formal management recommendations for incidental nodules, such as those outlined by the Fleischner Society, must therefore reflect a balance of malignancy risk and the clinical context in which nodules are discovered. Nodule size, attenuation, morphology, and location all influence the likelihood of malignancy and, thus, the necessity and timing of follow-up according to current Fleischner recommendations. As technological advancements in CT imaging continue, there may be greater reliance on advanced computerized analysis of lung nodule features to help determine the risk of clinically significant disease.

Pulmonary nodules > 8 mm — surveillance indications state that in an individual with a solid, indeterminate nodule that measures > 8 mm in diameter, we suggest surveillance with serial computed tomography (CT) scans (Grade 2C) when the clinical probability of malignancy is very low (< 5%); when clinical probability is low (< 30% to 40%) and a functional imaging test is negative (ie, the lesion is not hypermetabolic by positron emission tomography [PET] or does not enhance > 15 HUs on dynamic contrast CT), resulting in a very-low posttest probability of malignancy; when needle biopsy is nondiagnostic and the lesion is not hypermetabolic by PET; or when a fully informed patient prefers this nonaggressive management approach. CT surveillance of solid nodules > 8 mm should use low-dose, noncontrast techniques with thin sections through the nodule of interest.

### Fourth-generation quantiFERON-TB gold plus: what is the evidence? [^116ecCDv]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) is the latest generation of interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) to receive approval from the U.S. FDA, replacing its predecessor, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT). The novelty of QFT-Plus is that it elicits a response from CD8 T cells, in addition to CD4 T cells, thus collecting a broader response from T-cell subsets than QFT-GIT. It was developed with the aim to improve the detection of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), especially among recently exposed contacts, immunocompromised hosts, and young children. In this minireview, we summarize the performance of QFT-Plus compared with that of QFT-GIT among active tuberculosis (TB) patients (a surrogate for LTBI patients), high-risk populations, and low-risk individuals based on recent publications. Studies comparing QFT-Plus to QFT-GIT currently do not support the superior performance of QFT-Plus in individuals with active TB and LTBI. The difference in sensitivity between QFT-Plus and QFT-GIT in active TB patients was not significant in nearly all studies and ranged from -4.0 to 2.0%. Among high-risk groups, the agreement between QFT-Plus and QFT-GIT was 89.9 to 96.0% (kappa coefficient range, 0.80 to 0.91). The specificity in the low-risk population was slightly lower for QFT-Plus than for QFT-GIT, with the difference ranging from -7.4 to 0%. Further studies are needed to accurately evaluate the sensitivity of QFT-Plus in immunocompromised hosts and children. In addition, further evidence is required to validate a modified interpretation of QFT-Plus for the identification of false-positive results in low-risk health care workers.

### An official American Thoracic Society research statement: a research framework for pulmonary nodule evaluation and management [^113ruGQr]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary nodule diagnostic innovations — evaluation principles and study design — are described as having evidence that novel imaging and invasive procedures, biomarkers, and predictive models can improve diagnostic accuracy, but most evaluations have been limited to uncontrolled diagnostic accuracy studies with limited data on outcomes important to patients, clinicians, and healthcare systems; therefore, novel diagnostic procedures should be proven to provide incremental value above and beyond currently available information before adoption. Examples include computer-aided detection, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), volumetry and nodule growth analysis, and PET imaging. The document notes that, at least over the short term, it might be more impactful to demonstrate that existing diagnostic technologies improve patient-centered outcomes, and that use of defined phases of research should guide how tests are evaluated because few to no prospective trials of diagnosis or the clinical impact of novel tests have been performed. For clinical decision-making, the negative predictive value of a novel test will likely need to be very high to reduce follow-up imaging, whereas a novel test would need very high positive predictive value to recommend surgical resection when imaging suggests a benign nodule; proposals are strengthened by explicit information on test risks, feasibility, and potential use, and the PRoBE design requires a priori consideration of how a novel test will change diagnostic accuracy and standardized sample collection.

### Management of pulmonary nodules by community pulmonologists: a multicenter observational study [^113FmujB]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, one in four patients referred with a nodule to a community pulmonologist has cancer, making management decisions critical to patient outcomes. To spare patients unnecessary testing, use of a higher pCA to define a nodule as low risk seems reasonable. There is a wide variation in how nodules are managed and the choice of management may be influenced by a variety of factors in addition to pretest probability. Future research should focus on what influences decision-making in PN management so that interventions may be developed to promote proper guideline adherence and avoidance of unnecessary invasive procedures.

### Which new diagnostics for tuberculosis, and when? [^116D4qaZ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Recently, new diagnostic tools for tuberculosis detection and resistance testing have become available. The World Health Organization endorses new tuberculosis diagnostics by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process. This endorsement process takes place when limited evidence beyond test accuracy is available. There is a need to provide guidance to tuberculosis programs about which new diagnostics to scale up and how best to position them in diagnostic algorithms. To speed adoption of new diagnostics for tuberculosis, the policy recommendation process should be revised to consist of 2 steps: technical recommendation and programmatic recommendation. Technical recommendation would follow the GRADE process and be based on accuracy with limited cost and feasibility data, while programmatic recommendation would include patient-important outcomes, cost-effectiveness when implemented under routine conditions, and factors critical to successful scale-up. The evidence for both steps should be systematically collected, but each requires different study designs.

Solid pulmonary nodules ≤ 8 mm without lung cancer risk factors — CT surveillance: In the individual with a solid nodule that measures ≤ 8 mm in diameter and no risk factors for lung cancer, we suggest that the frequency and duration of CT surveillance be chosen according to the size of the nodule (Grade 2C). Nodules measuring ≤ 4 mm in diameter need not be followed, but the patient should be informed about the potential benefits and harms of this approach. Nodules measuring > 4 mm to 6 mm should be reevaluated at 12 months without the need for additional follow-up if unchanged. Nodules measuring > 6 mm to 8 mm should be followed sometime between 6 and 12 months and then again at between 18 and 24 months if unchanged.

### Management of the solitary pulmonary nodule [^116zCqwH]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Context

- Optimal management of the patient with a solitary pulmonary nodule entails early diagnosis and appropriate treatment for patients with malignant tumors, and minimization of unnecessary interventions and procedures for those with ultimately benign nodules. With the growing number of high-resolution imaging modalities and studies available, incidentally found solitary pulmonary nodules are an increasingly common occurrence.

Objective

- To provide guidance to clinicians involved in the management of patients with a solitary pulmonary nodule, including aspects of risk stratification, workup, diagnosis, and management.

Data Sources

- Data for this review were gathered from an extensive literature review on the topic.

Conclusions

- Logical evaluation and management pathways for a patient with a solitary pulmonary nodule will allow providers to diagnose and treat individuals with early stage lung cancer and minimize morbidity from invasive procedures for patients with benign lesions.

### Guidelines for management of incidental pulmonary nodules detected on CT images: from the Fleischner society 2017 [^114e5MSo]. Radiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Fleischner Society 2017 — Recommendation 1 for single solid noncalcified nodules states that solid nodules smaller than 6 mm (those 5 mm or smaller) do not require routine follow-up in patients at low risk (grade 1C; strong recommendation, low- or very-low-quality evidence), consistent with excluding nodules with a less than 1% risk of cancer from routine CT follow-up. Solid nodules smaller than 6 mm do not require routine follow-up in all patients with high clinical risk; however, some nodules smaller than 6 mm with suspicious morphology, upper lobe location, or both may warrant follow-up at 12 months (grade 2A; weak recommendation, high-quality evidence). Supporting context notes that the average risk of cancer in solid nodules smaller than 6 mm in patients at high risk is less than 1%, and that never smokers and younger patients have a relative risk on the order of 0.15 compared with heavy smokers.

### Evaluation of patients with pulmonary nodules: when is it lung cancer? ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^115hCbef]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary nodules are spherical radiographic opacities that measure up to 30 mm in diameter. Nodules are extremely common in clinical practice and challenging to manage, especially small, "subcentimeter" nodules. Identification of malignant nodules is important because they represent a potentially curable form of lung cancer.

Methods

We developed evidence-based clinical practice guidelines based on a systematic literature review and discussion with a large, multidisciplinary group of clinical experts and other stakeholders.

Results

We generated a list of 29 recommendations for managing the solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) that measures at least 8 to 10 mm in diameter; small, subcentimeter nodules that measure < 8 mm to 10 mm in diameter; and multiple nodules when they are detected incidentally during evaluation of the SPN. Recommendations stress the value of risk factor assessment, the utility of imaging tests (especially old films), the need to weigh the risks and benefits of various management strategies (biopsy, surgery, and observation with serial imaging tests), and the importance of eliciting patient preferences.

Conclusion

Patients with pulmonary nodules should be evaluated by estimation of the probability of malignancy, performance of imaging tests to characterize the lesion(s) better, evaluation of the risks associated with various management alternatives, and elicitation of patient preferences for treatment.

QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube (QFT-GIT) — interpretation criteria state that the assay "is considered positive if the difference between the IFN-γ concentration in response to the Mtb antigens and the IFN-γ response to the nil control is ≥ 0.35 IU", and, "to control for high background in the nil control, the IFN-γ response to antigen must be 25% greater than the IFN-γ concentration in the nil control". An "indeterminate response" is "defined as either a lack of response in the PHA control well (IFN-γ concentration ≤ 0.5 IU) or a nil control that has a very high background (IFN-γ concentration ≥ 8 IU)".

IL-12/IL-23 inhibitors — ongoing monitoring parameters list periodic history and physical examination (including screening for nonmelanoma skin cancer) and screening for adverse effects. Yearly testing for latent TB (PPD, T-Spot, or Quantiferon Gold) "should be done in patients at high risk", whereas for patients who are not at high risk screening should be done at the discretion of the dermatologist; results of the Quantiferon Gold test can remain positive after treatment of latent TB and caution should be exercised when using it. An annual chest radiograph may be considered at the treating dermatologist's discretion. Routine CBC with differential and CMP are not supported by evidence and are to be assessed at physician discretion, except with infliximab where "liver function tests be repeated every 3 mo after initiation, and if the result is normal, every 6–12 mo thereafter".

### Evaluating the patient with a pulmonary nodule: a review [^112fLWzu]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Pulmonary nodules are identified in approximately 1.6 million patients per year in the US and are detected on approximately 30% of computed tomographic (CT) images of the chest. Optimal treatment of an individual with a pulmonary nodule can lead to early detection of cancer while minimizing testing for a benign nodule.

Observations

At least 95% of all pulmonary nodules identified are benign, most often granulomas or intrapulmonary lymph nodes. Smaller nodules are more likely to be benign. Pulmonary nodules are categorized as small solid (< 8 mm), larger solid (≥ 8 mm), and subsolid. Subsolid nodules are divided into ground-glass nodules (no solid component) and part-solid (both ground-glass and solid components). The probability of malignancy is less than 1% for all nodules smaller than 6 mm and 1% to 2% for nodules 6 mm to 8 mm. Nodules that are 6 mm to 8 mm can be followed with a repeat chest CT in 6 to 12 months, depending on the presence of patient risk factors and imaging characteristics associated with lung malignancy, clinical judgment about the probability of malignancy, and patient preferences. The treatment of an individual with a solid pulmonary nodule 8 mm or larger is based on the estimated probability of malignancy; the presence of patient comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease; and patient preferences. Management options include surveillance imaging, defined as monitoring for nodule growth with chest CT imaging, positron emission tomography-CT imaging, nonsurgical biopsy with bronchoscopy or transthoracic needle biopsy, and surgical resection. Part-solid pulmonary nodules are managed according to the size of the solid component. Larger solid components are associated with a higher risk of malignancy. Ground-glass pulmonary nodules have a probability of malignancy of 10% to 50% when they persist beyond 3 months and are larger than 10 mm in diameter. A malignant nodule that is entirely ground glass in appearance is typically slow growing. Current bronchoscopy and transthoracic needle biopsy methods yield a sensitivity of 70% to 90% for a diagnosis of lung cancer.

Conclusions and Relevance

Pulmonary nodules are identified in approximately 1.6 million people per year in the US and approximately 30% of chest CT images. The treatment of an individual with a pulmonary nodule should be guided by the probability that the nodule is malignant, safety of testing, the likelihood that additional testing will be informative, and patient preferences.

Solid nodules ≤ 8 mm without risk factors — CT surveillance intervals by size: In the individual with a solid nodule that measures ≤ 8 mm in diameter and no risk factors for lung cancer, we suggest that the frequency and duration of CT surveillance be chosen according to the size of the nodule (Grade 2C): nodules measuring ≤ 4 mm in diameter need not be followed, but the patient should be informed about the potential benefits and harms of this approach; nodules measuring > 4 mm to 6 mm should be reevaluated at 12 months without the need for additional follow-up if unchanged; and nodules measuring > 6 mm to 8 mm should be followed sometime between 6 and 12 months, and then again at between 18 and 24 months if unchanged. For the individual with multiple small, solid nodules, the frequency and duration of follow-up should be based on the size of the largest nodule, and CT surveillance of solid nodules ≤ 8 mm should use low-dose, noncontrast techniques.
