## Question

Septic arthritis initial therapy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about initial therapy for septic arthritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate recognition and risk stratification. Then, I should confirm the diagnostic sequence and what must be obtained before antibiotics. Next, I will review synovial fluid analysis and adjunctive molecular testing. After that, I need to consider imaging choices. Then, I will select and time empiric antibiotics for adults and children. Next, I should outline surgical source control and its timing. Finally, I will address supportive care, monitoring, duration and IV-to-oral transition, and special scenarios, with a plan for reassessment if the response is suboptimal [^116ZQNFw] [^111SbycT].

> Let me first confirm the emergency nature and the clinical triggers to suspect septic arthritis; any patient with an acutely painful, swollen, atraumatic joint — especially with fever, pain on motion, and restricted range — requires urgent evaluation given the risk of rapid cartilage destruction and sepsis, and I should also note risk factors such as older age, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, skin infection, prosthetic joints, recent surgery, and immunosuppression to raise pretest probability without overcommitting before data are in [^116ZQNFw] [^111SbycT] [^117Mq2Fh].

> Wait, let me verify the initial clinical assessment steps; a careful history and examination are mandatory to anchor pretest probability and guide the site and urgency of procedures, and in children with suspected hip involvement I should apply Kocher criteria thoughtfully (fever, non–weight-bearing, ESR ≥ 40 mm/hr, WBC > 12,000/mm³) to estimate risk while remembering these rules augment but do not replace clinical judgment [^1141qWAj] [^1168Ktpj].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic sequence preserves microbiologic yield; obtain at least two sets of blood cultures before antibiotics whenever possible since bacteremia can be present and guides therapy, and I should not forget that higher confirmation rates occur when cultures precede antibiotics in both blood and joint fluid [^1146TZsy] [^116jwRca] [^1139j63i].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions based on serum labs alone; baseline CRP, ESR, and CBC are helpful for triage and subsequent response monitoring, but they are nonspecific for diagnosis, with CRP particularly useful to trend treatment response over the first week [^116ZQNFw] [^1174rGVU].

> I should double-check the procedural priority; urgent arthrocentesis is required as soon as septic arthritis is suspected and ideally before antibiotics, using strict aseptic technique and avoiding a puncture path through overlying cellulitis or subcutaneous abscess, and for deep or less accessible joints such as the hip or shoulder, image-guided aspiration improves safety and yield [^1148WYR1] [^112J9fGc] [^112Jmhvw] [^111YmGwo].

> Let me verify the synovial fluid tests and interpretive thresholds; I will send ≥ 1 mL for culture in sterile tubes and inoculate residual fluid into blood culture bottles to enhance recovery, obtain WBC count with differential (with > 50,000/mcL suggesting septic arthritis but recognizing lower counts can occur and do not exclude infection), perform Gram stain to guide initial therapy, analyze for crystals to exclude crystalline arthropathy, and remember prosthetic joints have much lower baseline WBC thresholds and that neutrophil percent alone is insufficiently specific [^116jwRca] [^1123kkjg] [^116qTutk] [^113vvdJV] [^111g4bQo].

> But wait, what if cultures are negative or the patient received prior antibiotics; I should consider 16S rRNA PCR or other molecular testing because it can substantially increase pathogen detection overall and is especially useful after antibiotic pretreatment or when fastidious organisms such as Kingella are suspected [^113vhtra] [^1139j63i].

> Next, I should review imaging without delaying critical source control; plain radiographs are an appropriate initial modality to identify alternative or concurrent pathology, point-of-care ultrasound helps detect effusions in deep joints when the exam is equivocal, and MRI or CT should be obtained when complications, adjacent osteomyelitis, or hardware are suspected, particularly in arthroplasty where cross-sectional imaging or image-guided aspiration is often necessary [^11742Q7M] [^114pVYfF] [^112LKpyg] [^114o2uo4].

> I need to confirm antibiotic timing relative to hemodynamic status; in sepsis or septic shock I should start empiric therapy immediately after obtaining blood cultures per sepsis protocols, whereas in hemodynamically stable patients I should aspirate the joint and draw blood cultures first and then initiate antibiotics within hours, with the caveat that in ill-appearing children it is reasonable to begin antibiotics promptly after blood cultures even if arthrocentesis will follow shortly [^11424Nt5] [^114MtVKU] [^115M1n1m].

> Now, let me think about empiric therapy for adults; Staphylococcus aureus is most common and local MRSA prevalence should drive initial choices, so vancomycin is a standard backbone when MRSA risk exists with alternatives such as daptomycin or linezolid when appropriate, and in settings without MRSA risk, cefazolin or an antistaphylococcal penicillin is reasonable with consideration of ceftriaxone to broaden for Gram-negative organisms when indicated by host risk or Gram stain findings [^1123tr2A] [^116tTn5q].

> I should verify pediatric empiric regimens carefully; cover S. aureus routinely with vancomycin or clindamycin when local clindamycin resistance is low, and in children 6–48 months I must remember Kingella kingae and add ampicillin or a second/third-generation cephalosporin to ensure coverage, tailoring once culture or PCR clarifies the pathogen [^11172zU9] [^112cjJba] [^116PJxL1] [^111yTBfU].

> Hold on, source control cannot be overlooked; all suspected septic joints require prompt evacuation to reduce bacterial burden and intra-articular pressure, with arthroscopic debridement favored in earlier intra-articular stages and open debridement indicated in advanced disease or when arthroscopy is not feasible, and if the patient is stable with preliminary aspiration and antibiotics initiated, a short delay of up to 24 hours to secure experienced surgical care is acceptable [^115RUybp] [^112njoDa].

> Let me reconsider the need for repeat procedures; repeat arthroscopic irrigation and debridement should be performed if clinical or laboratory response is inadequate or cultures remain positive, recognizing that some postoperative scenarios (for example after ACL reconstruction) may need serial washouts until cultures are consistently negative while attempting graft or implant retention when feasible [^111aNZ4y] [^112Ubw7s].

> Next, I should review supportive care and monitoring; provide adequate analgesia, track serial CRP with the expectation of a progressive decline by about day 7 if treatment is effective, begin mobilization once infection control is evident and drains are out, and in children who are clinically improving, avoid routine follow-up imaging unless there is a new concern [^116DwcMM] [^1118Syp1] [^114pJiLV].

> I will now examine antibiotic duration and the IV-to-oral transition; for adults with native joint infection, many experts use approximately 3–4 weeks total while extending to 6 weeks if osteomyelitis is present, and I should de-escalate to targeted therapy, typically continue IV for 1–2 weeks and then transition to high-bioavailability oral agents once clinical signs and biomarkers improve, remembering that oral therapy is often noninferior and in pediatrics selected cases may complete as short as 10–14 total days if response is rapid and CRP declines reliably, with early switch to oral preferred when active agents are available and outpatient parenteral therapy reserved when oral options are not feasible [^111SbycT] [^114zss3y] [^116ZQNFw] [^116DwcMM] [^112ehes8] [^116RBLPi] [^114hmAux].

> Wait, I should confirm special pathogen scenarios; if Candida is identified, surgical drainage is required and antifungal therapy with a lipid amphotericin B induction followed by fluconazole is reasonable, for Aspergillus arthritis surgical intervention plus voriconazole is recommended, and for tuberculous arthritis standard four-drug therapy is indicated with potential medical management alone in early cases as per specialized guidance [^116BYdpN] [^115MNeu5] [^111XV84J] [^1169Da7o] [^112NwVkE].

> I should double-check how to proceed if the patient is not improving by 48–96 hours; reassess the adequacy of the antimicrobial regimen including spectrum, dosing, penetration, and adherence, re-evaluate source control and consider additional debridement, and obtain MRI if not previously done to identify adjacent osteomyelitis or deep foci that could explain a persistently elevated CRP, ongoing fever, or bacteremia [^115RRwP2] [^114FLztt] [^113yecsg].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined sequence: suspect early, aspirate urgently with blood cultures, begin timely empiric antibiotics aligned to illness severity and local epidemiology, secure surgical source control, monitor with CRP and clinical status, step down to targeted and oral therapy when appropriate, and adjust promptly if the response lags, because delays at any of these steps risk irreversible joint damage and systemic complications [^114MtVKU] [^1123tr2A] [^115RUybp] [^116DwcMM].

---

Initial therapy for septic arthritis requires **immediate joint aspiration** for synovial fluid analysis and culture, with **empiric IV antibiotics** started promptly once cultures are obtained [^111g4bQo] [^114MtVKU]. Empiric regimens should cover Staphylococcus aureus (**including MRSA** if risk factors are present) and common **Gram-negative organisms**, tailored to local resistance patterns and individual risk factors [^1123tr2A]. Early **joint drainage** (arthrocentesis, arthroscopic, or open) is essential to reduce bacterial load and intra-articular pressure [^115RUybp]. Antibiotics should be adjusted to culture results: provide IV therapy for 1–2 weeks, then transition to oral therapy once clinical and laboratory improvement is evident, for a total of 2–4 weeks in uncomplicated cases [^114zss3y]. Early mobilization is recommended after infection control and drain removal [^1118Syp1].

---

## Initial diagnostic steps

### Clinical evaluation

During clinical evaluation, perform a thorough **history and physical examination** to identify risk factors, comorbidities, and signs of septic arthritis (joint pain, swelling, redness, warmth, limited range of motion) [^1141qWAj]. Maintain a high **clinical suspicion**, as clinical parameters alone cannot confirm or exclude septic arthritis [^117Mq2Fh].

---

### Laboratory investigations

- **Synovial fluid analysis**: Perform immediate arthrocentesis to obtain synovial fluid for Gram stain, culture, white blood cell (WBC) count with differential, and crystal analysis [^111g4bQo].

- **Synovial WBC count**: A synovial WBC count > 50,000/mcL is suggestive of septic arthritis, while counts < 25,000/mcL decrease the likelihood but do not exclude the diagnosis [^1123kkjg].

- **Blood cultures**: Obtain blood cultures before initiating antibiotics [^114MtVKU].

- **Serum inflammatory markers**: Measure C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) to monitor treatment response [^114zss3y].

---

### Imaging studies

Obtain plain radiographs initially to identify preexisting conditions and establish a baseline for future monitoring [^111YJSv5]. Use **ultrasound** to detect joint effusion, particularly in deep joints, such as the hip or shoulder [^114pVYfF]. Consider MRI to assess the extent of infection, including adjacent osteomyelitis or soft-tissue involvement [^1164cqXm].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be **initiated promptly** after synovial fluid and blood cultures are obtained. The antibiotic choice depends on patient age, clinical presentation, local epidemiology, and risk factors for resistant organisms.

---

### Adult patients

- **Gram-positive coverage**: Vancomycin or daptomycin for MRSA coverage.

- **Gram-negative coverage**: Third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone or ceftazidime) or piperacillin-tazobactam.

- **Alternative regimens**: Linezolid or clindamycin for MRSA; fluoroquinolones or carbapenems for resistant Gram-negative organisms.

---

### Pediatric patients

- **Empiric coverage**: First-generation cephalosporin, anti-staphylococcal penicillin, or clindamycin for S. aureus coverage [^115kYTJi].

- **MRSA coverage**: Vancomycin or clindamycin if MRSA is suspected [^111CExig].

- **Kingella kingae coverage**: Consider coverage in infants and preschool-aged children (6–48 months) [^112cjJba].

---

## Joint drainage and surgical intervention

Prompt joint drainage is **essential** to reduce bacterial load and intra-articular pressure and prevent cartilage destruction. The method is individualized based on the joint involved, infection severity, and patient factors. Perform arthrocentesis as soon as possible for initial aspiration [^1148WYR1]. Use arthroscopic debridement for larger joints and early-stage infections (Gächter stage I-III) [^115RUybp], reserving open debridement for advanced infections (Gächter stage IV) or when arthroscopy is not feasible [^115RUybp].

---

## Adjustment of antibiotic therapy

Antibiotic therapy should be **adjusted based on culture and sensitivity results**. De-escalate according to pathogen susceptibility; maintain IV administration for 1–2 weeks, then switch to oral therapy once clinical improvement and normalization of inflammatory markers are observed [^114zss3y].

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

Uncomplicated cases typically require a total of **2–4 weeks** (IV followed by oral therapy) [^114zss3y], whereas complicated cases warrant a longer course (**4–6 weeks**) when adjacent osteomyelitis or persistent infection is present.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor with regular assessment of joint function, pain, and signs of infection. Track treatment response with **serial CRP and ESR measurements**, and repeat imaging if clinical improvement is not observed within 48–96 hours [^113yecsg]. Initiate early mobilization once infection is controlled and drains are removed [^1118Syp1].

---

## Complications of delayed or inadequate initial therapy

Delayed or inadequate initial therapy can lead to **irreversible joint destruction** with loss of function, osteomyelitis from spread to adjacent bone, and sepsis with high morbidity and mortality. Chronic arthritis with persistent inflammation and disability may develop; mortality risk also increases, particularly in immunocompromised patients.

---

Initial therapy for septic arthritis involves **immediate joint aspiration**, prompt joint drainage, and empiric antibiotics. Antibiotic therapy should be adjusted to culture results; the duration depends on disease severity and response to treatment. Early mobilization and regular monitoring are essential to prevent complications and ensure optimal outcomes.

Regarding surgical interventions for septic arthritis, specifically the indications for surgery, the EBJIS 2023 guidelines recommend offering invasive treatment (open surgery, arthroscopy, or arthrocentesis) to wash out toxins and reduce both the bacterial load and intra-articular pressure:

- **Surgical debridement**: Perform surgical debridement for septic arthritis of a native joint, especially in larger joints.

- **Arthroscopic debridement**: Consider performing arthroscopic debridement as initial surgical management in patients with Gächter stage I, II, and probably also III septic arthritis, if logistically and surgically possible.

- **Open debridement**: Consider performing open debridement in patients with Gächter stage III and definitely in stage IV.

### Post-operative septic arthritis after arthroscopy: Modern diagnostic and therapeutic concepts [^116qTutk]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

If an acute infection is suspected, cell count, macroscopic assessment, and microscopy after gram staining help to make a quick diagnosis (within hours) and support a quick decision-making process for further treatment.

- **Priority protocol for suspected joint infections**: Depending on the amount of joint fluid, the user should start with priority 1 and then follow the list. This specific protocol allows for easy handling with information about the amount, purpose, tube, and target institute for analysis.

The interpretation of the joint fluid sample can be done according to Trampuz et al. and Stutz et al. They proposed that the main distinctive feature between reactive and septic arthritis is the number of cells. If this is greater than 20,000/µl, there is a high probability of an infectious event. However, there are some limitations to these criteria. The cell count must be interpreted with regard to the individual patient. For example, a leukocyte count of 15,000/µl can already be considered critical if an intraarticular implant is present (such as anchor or suture material). The cut-off value due to the presence of joint replacements is even stricter, with physiological levels being less than 2800 leukocytes/µl. Additionally, in patients with immunosuppression, the leukocyte count may not be elevated, thereby masking a joint infection.

This interpretation is also supported by the systematic review of Margaretten et al, who showed that a progressively higher synovial white blood cell (WBC) count increased the likelihood of septic arthritis.

### Septic arthritis: Diagnosis and treatment [^116ZQNFw]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis must be considered and promptly diagnosed in any patient presenting with acute atraumatic joint pain, swelling, and fever. Risk factors for septic arthritis include age older than 80 years, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, recent joint surgery, hip or knee prosthesis, skin infection, and immunosuppressive medication use. A delay in diagnosis and treatment can result in permanent morbidity and mortality. Physical examination findings and serum markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, are helpful in the diagnosis but are nonspecific. Synovial fluid studies are required to confirm the diagnosis. History and Gram stain aid in determining initial antibiotic selection. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen isolated in septic arthritis; however, other bacteria, viruses, fungi, and mycobacterium can cause the disease. After synovial fluid has been obtained, empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated if there is clinical concern for septic arthritis. Oral antibiotics can be given in most cases because they are not inferior to intravenous therapy. The total duration of therapy ranges from two to six weeks; however, certain infections require longer courses. Consideration for microorganisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Borrelia burgdorferi, and fungal infections should be based on history findings and laboratory results.

### Septic arthritis: current diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm [^116kYzWB]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

To propose and discuss an evidence-based algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial septic arthritis, this review examines recent literature on emerging management strategies and their potential impact on clinical practice.

- **Recent findings**: Evidence-based guidelines have recently been published to aid in diagnosing and managing suspected and confirmed septic arthritis. All suspected septic joints should be aspirated, and the synovial fluid should be examined by microscopy for the presence of crystals and microorganisms. There is controversy surrounding the diagnostic utility of quantifying the synovial fluid white cell count, with two recent systematic reviews reaching opposite conclusions. The emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens has prompted a search for alternative antimicrobial agents such as linezolid. Studies in animals and children suggest that corticosteroid therapy may be a useful adjunct to conventional antibiotic therapy. Research using experimental murine models of septic arthritis is also generating novel immunotherapeutic targets as potential adjuncts to antibiotic regimens.

- **Summary**: There is a striking paucity of high-quality evidence upon which to base guidelines for managing the hot-swollen joint. Ultimately, diagnosing septic arthritis relies on the opinion of a clinician experienced in assessing musculoskeletal disease. Future research may provide alternative investigative and treatment strategies to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

### Septic arthritis in immunosuppressed patients: Do laboratory values help [^1168o1Qy]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global research & reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Diagnosing septic arthritis often relies on clinical acumen and a careful review of laboratory data. Although it is important for the clinician to proceed in an expedited fashion, overly aggressive diagnosis may result in patients undergoing unnecessary procedures; therefore, accurate diagnosis is paramount. The benchmark for diagnosis remains a positive culture from the affected joint, but this is often impractical because culture results may take several days, increasing patient morbidity.

Previous literature has established a synovial fluid cell count threshold of 50,000 cells/mm³ as suggestive of a diagnosis of septic arthritis in a native joint in lieu of positive culture results, with lower values suggesting crystalline or inflammatory arthropathy. However, not only is the literature to support this cutoff limited, but there is also little data to support this threshold in the immunosuppressed patient population. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively review our immunosuppressed patients with culture-positive septic arthritis to determine if 50,000 cells/mm³ is a valid threshold in this population.

Previous studies have used varying definitions for septic arthritis. In 1976, Newman defined septic arthritis based on the following criteria:

- **Criteria for septic arthritis**:
	1. Isolating an organism from the affected joint
	2. Isolating an organism from elsewhere in a patient with a clinically swollen, painful joint
	3. Histologic or radiologic evidence of infection
	4. Turbid fluid aspirated from the joint

This definition remains popular.

### Current concepts in pediatric septic arthritis [^111J6Vcr]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis continues to present challenges regarding clinical diagnosis, workup, and definitive management. Urgent management is essential; thus, treating surgeons must efficiently work through differential diagnoses, identify concomitant infections, and promptly perform irrigation and débridement. The incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is increasing, typically resulting in a more rapid progression of symptoms with more severe clinical presentation.

The diagnostic utility of MRI has improved the detection of concomitant septic arthritis and osteomyelitis, although MRI must not substantially delay definitive management. Early diagnosis followed by urgent irrigation, débridement, and antibiotic therapy is essential for satisfactory long-term outcomes. Antibiotics should not be administered until blood cultures and arthrocentesis fluid are obtained, except in rare cases of a septic or toxic patient. Once cultures are obtained, empiric antibiotic therapy should commence and provide coverage for the most likely pathogens, considering the patient's age.

Laboratory markers, especially C-reactive protein, should be monitored until normalization and should correlate with the resolution of clinical symptoms. Definitive antibiotic selection should be shared with a pediatric infectious disease specialist, who can help guide the duration of treatment.

### Guideline for management of septic arthritis in native joints (SANJO) [^113vvdJV]. Journal of Bone and Joint Infection (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for septic arthritis, particularly with synovial fluid analysis (differential cell count and microscopy), the EBJIS 2023 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to support a specific percentage of synovial polymorphonuclear cells to conclusively diagnose or rule out septic arthritis in a native joint. However, the guidelines do recognize that higher percentages increase the probability of diagnosing septic arthritis in a native joint.

### Primary septic arthritis in children demonstrates presumed and confirmed varieties which require age-specific evaluation and treatment strategies [^1139j63i]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2022). High credibility.

There is uncertainty involved in the evaluation and treatment of children suspected to have septic arthritis, particularly when no causative pathogen is confirmed. This study evaluates children with primary septic arthritis to refine the processes of evaluation and treatment and improve the rate of pathogen confirmation.

- **Methods**: Children suspected to have septic arthritis from 2009 to 2019 were retrospectively studied. Diagnosis of primary septic arthritis, defined as hematogenous joint infection without associated osteomyelitis, was established by clinical evaluation, radiology, and laboratory results, including joint fluid analysis. Excluded cases were categorized by etiology. Children with primary septic arthritis were divided into confirmed and presumed cohorts for statistical comparison.

- **Results**: A total of 355 children (average age 4.4 years, range 0.05 to 18 years) were initially treated as having septic arthritis. Eighty-seven (24.5%) were excluded due to other conditions, including 34 (9.6%) with noninfectious conditions. Among 268 children with primary septic arthritis, 134 were confirmed and 134 were presumed. A higher rate of 16S polymerase chain reaction (PCR) acquisition (71.6% vs. 45.5%) occurred in the confirmed cohort. Overall yield for various methods of pathogen identification was 27 of 239 (11.3%) by blood culture, 83 of 268 (31.0%) by joint fluid culture, and 85 of 157 (54.1%) by PCR. PCR identified a pathogen in 87.5% of children with confirmed septic arthritis. Antibiotic pretreatment was associated with a lower rate of joint fluid culture positivity.

Diagnosis and treatment of postoperative septic arthritis

The diagnostic algorithm and treatment regimen applied for suspected cases of septic arthritis have previously been published by this group. In summary, the diagnosis of septic arthritis after ACL reconstruction was obtained based on clinical manifestations (e.g. pain, joint swelling, local erythema, hyperthermia, and purulent secretion), laboratory results (e.g. C-reactive protein > 0.5 mg/dL, white blood cell count > 10,000/µL), and microbiologic findings from a joint aspirate or tissue gathered during arthroscopy. Grading was based on arthroscopic findings according to the Gaechter classification.

The standard of care for the treatment of septic arthritis following ACL reconstruction includes a combination of systemic antibiotics in addition to surgical irrigation and debridement. A calculated antibiotic treatment regimen is initiated and adapted based on pathogen sensitivity testing and the patient's prior history of antibiotic resistance. Usually, an initial intravenous therapy for 10–14 days is followed by a period of at least four weeks of oral antibiotics, which was the approach used in this study. Arthroscopic irrigation and debridement (I&D) was performed in every suspected or confirmed case of septic arthritis and was repeated, if necessary, until the negativity of microbiological cultures was sustained after 48 hours. Conversion to an open revision was reserved for severe cases of septic arthritis (Gaechter IV) or in cases of unsuccessful arthroscopic I&D. Grafts were salvaged unless they showed signs of insufficiency in arthroscopic evaluation.

Septic arthritis has increased in incidence in the United States over the past two decades, increasingly affecting an older population with a greater burden of chronic illness and a higher risk for drug-resistant organisms. Successful management depends on maintaining a high diagnostic suspicion, implementing empiric antibiotic treatment, and performing joint drainage. A bacteriologic diagnosis is more likely to be achieved with inoculation into blood culture bottles than by plating on solid media. As MRSA prevalence increases in the community, empiric antibiotic regimens increasingly need to be active against MRSA.

### Management of septic arthritis following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A review of current practices and recommendations [^117KddGE]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is a rare and potentially devastating complication that often leads to articular destruction and adverse clinical outcomes. Because of its rare occurrence, best practices for diagnosis and management have yet to be established. However, graft retention and favorable outcomes are possible with early diagnosis, surgical intervention, and appropriate antibiotic management. Clinicians must be familiar with the diagnostic criteria and management options for septic arthritis. Most patients require multiple procedures to effectively eradicate infection. When the original reconstructed graft cannot be salvaged, a staged anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction revision is required.

### Review for the generalist: Evaluation of pediatric hip pain [^1168Ktpj]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

A variety of clinical, laboratory, and radiographic criteria are used to help differentiate septic arthritis from transient synovitis; however, due to the substantial overlap between the two groups, there are no absolute criteria for a definitive diagnosis of either condition. Kocher and colleagues described an evidence-based clinical prediction algorithm to determine the probability of septic arthritis and subsequently validated the algorithm in a prospective study. The four independent multivariate clinical predictors to differentiate between septic arthritis and transient synovitis are: history of fever, non-weight-bearing, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of at least 40 millimeters per hour, and serum white blood cell count of more than 12,000 cells per mm³ (12.0 × 10⁹ cells per liter). The predicted probability of septic arthritis was determined for all sixteen combinations of these four predictors and is summarized as follows (original cohort/prospective cohort): less than 0.2 percent for zero predictors, 3.0/9.5 percent for one predictor, 40.0/35.0 percent for two predictors, 93.1/72.8 percent for three predictors, and 99.6/93.0 percent for four predictors.

In another preliminary retrospective study, Jung and colleagues found the probability of diagnosing acute septic arthritis was 98.8% according to multivariate regression analysis and the presence of all of the following five features: body temperature > 37°C, ESR > 20 mm/h, CRP > 1 mg/dL, WBC > 11,000/mL, and an increased medial hip joint space of > 2 mm on A/P radiographs.

Clinical prediction rules serve as guidelines but require clinical judgment for application.

### Septic arthritis in a patient with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis [^112UEfXq]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

The acute flare of joint inflammation in a child with known juvenile rheumatoid arthritis raises concern regarding the need for additional or modified medical treatment. Acute joint inflammation in an otherwise healthy child creates concern about the presence of a joint infection. In the early phase of the disease, the clinical findings and symptoms of an inflamed joint attributable to juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or infection may be similar and difficult to differentiate from one another. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is usually well controlled by medical interventions; however, the initiation of specific treatment is more urgent in children with joint sepsis. This case report is presented to emphasize the difficulty in evaluating patients with known juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and coexistent septic arthritis, and to discuss the methods used to differentiate between the two conditions.

### Primary septic arthritis among children 6 to 48 months of age: Implications for PCR acquisition and empiric antimicrobial selection [^111yTBfU]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2021). Low credibility.

Primary septic arthritis requires unique evaluation and treatment considerations for children in the 6- to 48-month age range due to the spectrum of identified pathogens and high rate of negative cultures. This study aims to evaluate primary septic arthritis in this age group to differentiate children with infections caused by Kingella kingae from those with other confirmed pathogens and those with no identified pathogen.

- **Methods**: Preschool children who underwent multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment for septic arthritis between 2009 and 2019 were retrospectively studied. Three cohorts were established to compare clinical and laboratory features of primary septic arthritis: (1) confirmed K. kingae, (2) confirmed other pathogen, and (3) presumed (without identified pathogen).

- **Results**: Among 139 children with septic arthritis, 40 (29%) were confirmed K. kingae, 29 (21%) other pathogen, and 70 (50%) presumed. Children with Kingella and those with presumed septic arthritis had significantly lower initial C-reactive protein levels (4.8 and 4.5 vs. 9.3 mg/dL) and fewer febrile hospital days (0.2 and 0.4 vs. 1.3 days) than children with other confirmed pathogens. Children with other pathogens had higher rates of bacteremia (38% vs. 0%) and positive joint fluid cultures (86% vs. 15%) compared to children with Kingella. The rate of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) acquisition was 38 of 40 (95.0%) for Kingella cases, 18 of 29 (62.1%) for other pathogen cases, and 33 of 70 (47.1%) for presumed cases.

- **Conclusions**: K. kingae was the most commonly identified pathogen in this study.

### Current variation in joint aspiration practice for the evaluation of pediatric septic arthritis [^115yZ1SM]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global research & reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis (SA) in childhood is a rare condition, but it has the potential for serious sequelae if not identified early and treated appropriately. Because earlier diagnosis and treatment have been shown to increase the rate of satisfactory outcomes, numerous attempts have been made to standardize the evaluation of children with concerns for SA. However, without universally accepted management guidelines for pediatric SA, significant variability remains in the proposed algorithms for the clinical evaluation and management of musculoskeletal infections. Differences can range from units of measure for predictive markers to joint aspiration protocols for diagnostic imaging.

Although institutional variation has been inferred from previous publications, no study has objectively evaluated these variations in the evaluation of pediatric SA. Details about the areas of concordance and discordance in the assessment of pediatric SA will help guide protocol development efforts and drive future prospective studies.

The purpose of this study was to assess practice variations between pediatric tertiary care institutions during the evaluation and treatment of pediatric SA.

### Pneumococcal septic arthritis among adults, France, 2010–2018 [^1172nmaW]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Given the potential severity of septic arthritis, patients should be hospitalized for early diagnosis and prompt treatment. In our study, the median time from hospital admission to pneumococcal septic arthritis (PSA) diagnosis was 1 day, which is consistent with the standard of care. However, the interval was often longer for patients with prosthetic joint infection (PJI) (median 2 days) or spondylodiscitis (6 days), which might result at least in part from the low specificity of the signs and symptoms.

In our study, we found that amoxicillin and third-generation cephalosporins (alone or in combination) are most commonly used to treat PSA. To the best of our knowledge, no high-quality, randomized controlled studies of the optimal treatment duration for septic arthritis have been performed. Thus, the treatment guidelines are based on expert opinions. Although the optimal treatment duration for PJI is still subject to debate, 4 weeks of therapy are considered sufficient for uncomplicated PSA. It has also been suggested that 2 weeks of therapy may be adequate for uncomplicated septic arthritis of the small joints, including PSA.

In our study, native joint infections (NJIs) always occurred in large joints, except for in 1 patient who had acromioclavicular arthritis, and the mean treatment duration was approximately 6 weeks. One can speculate that the course of antimicrobial treatment could be safely shortened for some patients. However, that speculation remains to be confirmed because a lack of data and the small number of patients prevented us from establishing a correlation between the occurrence of complications and treatment duration. Antimicrobial therapy may be successful in shortened durations for specific cases; however, this requires more evidence.

Regarding specific circumstances for septic arthritis, particularly concerning pediatric patients and the management of resistant disease, the IDSA/PIDS 2024 guidelines recommend assessing the following in pediatric patients with presumed or confirmed acute bacterial arthritis either experiencing primary treatment failure or early or late recurrence:

- **Adequacy of the antimicrobial regimen**: Evaluate the spectrum of activity, dosage, antibiotic exposure at the site of infection, and adherence. Assess joint debridement and irrigation before deciding on the need to broaden the spectrum or restart antimicrobials.

- **Need for additional diagnostic evaluation**: Consider possible adjacent osteomyelitis and assess the need for surgical intervention for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes.

### Bacterial arthritis [^1137bwQr]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

The septic arthritis literature of 2000 revisited several topics previously examined in some detail. These include septic arthritis in rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic manifestations of bacterial endocarditis, and infectious complications of prosthetic joints. The trend in antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent late infections in total joint replacement is to narrow the targeted hosts to those most at risk, define the procedures associated with the greatest risk of bacteremia, and simplify the antibiotic regimen. The diagnoses of septic arthritis of the lumbar facet joint and septic arthritis caused by direct inoculation of bacteria by a foreign object penetrating the joint are facilitated by noninvasive imaging technologies. Septic arthritis caused by uncommon microorganisms and septic arthritis in immunocompromised hosts are other noteworthy topics in this year's literature.

### Septic arthritis of native joints [^111SbycT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis is a rheumatologic emergency that may lead to disability or death. Prompt evacuation of the joint, either by arthrocentesis at the bedside, open or arthroscopic drainage in the operating room, or imaging-guided drainage in the radiology suite, is mandatory. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a major cause of septic arthritis in the United States, and MRSA joint infection seems to be associated with worse outcomes. Antibiotic courses of 3 to 4 weeks in duration are usually adequate for uncomplicated bacterial arthritis. Treatment duration should be extended to 6 weeks if there is imaging evidence of accompanying osteomyelitis.

### Current approach to the evaluation and management of septic arthritis [^11498V1v]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis is an emergent condition caused by bacterial infection of a joint space. The most common etiology is hematogenous spread from bacteremia, but it can also occur from direct inoculation from bites, injection injuries, cellulitis, abscesses, or local trauma. Septic arthritis occurs most frequently in the lower extremities, with the hips and knees serving as the most common locations. The most sensitive findings include pain with motion of the joint, limited range of motion, tenderness of the joint, new joint swelling, and new effusion. Laboratory testing and imaging can support the diagnosis, but the criterion standard is diagnostic arthrocentesis. Treatment involves intravenous antibiotics and joint decompression.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for septic arthritis, particularly concerning pediatric patients and antibiotic therapy, the IDSA/PIDS 2024 guidelines recommend administering a definitive antimicrobial regimen. This should be based on selecting an effective agent suited to the most likely causative organisms. It is important to ensure the antimicrobial spectrum is comparable to the empiric therapy to which the patient initially responded, while also considering the lowest adverse effect profile and most favorable patient tolerability. This approach is recommended for pediatric patients with presumed acute bacterial arthritis where no pathogen is identified.

### Treatment of acute septic arthritis [^112XunEM]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Acute septic arthritis is a rare but potentially devastating disease. Treatment is initiated intravenously but can be safely switched to oral administration after 2–4 days, provided that large doses of a well-absorbing antibiotic are used. For time-dependent antibiotics, a four-times-a-day administration regimen is recommended. Empiric treatment should always cover Staphylococcus aureus and common respiratory pathogens, whereas Kingella kingae and Salmonella are important regionally. Studies conducted by our group have shown that a total course of 10 days may suffice for previously healthy children in a Western setting. Treatment of neonates, patients with immunodeficiency, or cases caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus may require a different approach.

### Patients return to sports and to work after successful treatment of septic arthritis following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction [^115QCS6G]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Low credibility.

In recent years, understanding of correctly diagnosing and treating septic arthritis (SA) of the knee following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) has steadily increased. Particularly, graft-retaining protocols, which emphasize the combination of antibiotic regimens and surgical management, have led to favorable postoperative objective results and satisfying patient-reported outcomes. While many conventional patient-reported outcome scores and laxity measurements have demonstrated their importance, especially in a scientific setting, such assessments are often abstract at the individual level.

Meanwhile, important personal aspects for patients, such as successful athletic and occupational rehabilitation after this severe complication, have gained little attention in previous literature. Patients affected by septic arthritis following ACLR tend to be young and active; therefore, comprehensive information about prognoses of postoperative activity levels and impacts on professional lives is crucial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the return to sports (RTS) and return to work (RTW) rates after septic arthritis following ACLR at a medium- to long-term follow-up. It also aimed to assess factors associated with diminished postoperative RTS and RTW rates after successful eradication of septic arthritis. Our primary hypothesis was that patients with a graft-sufficient knee at follow-up would be able to return to sports and work at higher rates compared to those who do not achieve this outcome.

### Clinical features and outcomes of children with culture-negative septic arthritis [^111jH2gg]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2019). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis is a serious infection, but the results of blood and joint fluid cultures are often negative in children. We describe here the clinical features and management of culture-negative septic arthritis in children at our hospital and their outcomes.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective review of a cohort of children with septic arthritis who were hospitalized at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between January 2002 and December 2014. Culture-negative septic arthritis was defined as a joint white blood cell count of > 50,000/μL with associated symptoms, a clinical diagnosis of septic arthritis, and a negative culture result. Children with pretreatment, an intensive care unit admission, Lyme arthritis, immunodeficiency, or surgical hardware were excluded. Treatment failure included a change in antibiotics, surgery, and/or reevaluation because of a lack of improvement or worsening.

- **Results**: We identified 157 children with septic arthritis. Patients with concomitant osteomyelitis (n = 28) had higher inflammatory marker levels at presentation, had a longer duration of symptoms (median, 4.5 vs. 3 days, respectively; P < .001), and more often had bacteremia (46.4% vs. 6.2%, respectively; P < .001). Among children with septic arthritis without associated osteomyelitis, 69% (89 of 129) had negative culture results. These children had lower C-reactive protein levels (median, 4.0 vs. 7.3 mg/dL, respectively; p = 0.001) and erythrocyte sedimentation rates (median, 39 vs. 51 mm/hour, respectively; p = 0.01) at admission and less often had foot/ankle involvement.

### Improved diagnosis and treatment of bone and joint infections using an evidence-based treatment guideline [^112zEdTK]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2018). Low credibility.

Our institution created a multidisciplinary guideline for the treatment of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) and septic arthritis (SA) in response to updates in evidence-based literature and existing provider variability in treatment. This guideline aims to improve the care of these patients by standardizing diagnosis and treatment and incorporating up-to-date evidence-based research into practice. The primary objective of this study is to compare cases before versus after the implementation of the guideline to determine the concrete effects the guideline has had on the care of patients with AHO and SA.

- **Methods**: This is an Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective study of pediatric patients aged 6 months to 18 years who were hospitalized between January 2009 and July 2016 with a diagnosis of AHO or SA qualifying for the guideline. Cohorts were categorized as preguideline and postguideline. Exclusion criteria consisted of symptoms lasting more than 14 days, multifocal involvement, hemodynamic instability, sepsis, or a history of immune deficiency or chronic systemic disease. The cohorts were compared for outcomes that described the clinical course.

- **Results**: Data were included for 117 cases that qualified for the guideline: 54 preguideline and 63 postguideline. Following the successful implementation of the guideline, we found a significant decrease in the length of intravenous antibiotic treatment (P < 0.001), a decrease in peripherally inserted central catheter use (P < 0.001), and an increase in bacterial identification (P = 0.040). Bacterial identification allowed for targeted antibiotic therapy.

### Advances in the management of septic arthritis [^1158xdZw]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis continues to be a common and serious problem at major urban medical centers and is among the most rapidly destructive forms of acute arthritis. The yearly incidence of bacterial arthritis ranges from 2 to 10 per 100,000 in the general population to 30 to 70 per 100,000 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and those with joint prostheses. Irreversible loss of joint function may develop in up to 50% of patients. Despite advances in antimicrobial agents and improved hospital care, the fatality rate for this condition has remained largely unchanged over the past 30 years. Understanding the risk factors and pathogenesis of nongonococcal bacterial arthritis and other forms of infectious arthritis is crucial, especially in the context of differential diagnosis and treatment. This knowledge is vital for avoiding delays in accurate diagnosis and improving patient prognosis.

There are approximately 20,000 cases of septic arthritis diagnosed annually in the United States. It is a diagnosis that can be associated with notable morbidity, including joint destruction, sepsis, and even increased mortality, exacerbated by a delay in treatment. Prompt diagnosis, therefore, becomes critical for reducing complications. Accurate diagnosis, however, may be challenging because several pathologies, such as crystalline arthropathies or inflammatory arthropathies, may present with a similar clinical picture.

Septic arthritis has historically been diagnosed by combining clinical examination with laboratory data, with a positive culture remaining the benchmark for diagnosis. Waiting for culture results, however, may require several days, which can lead to increased morbidity. Clinicians must therefore rely on testing that is obtained more rapidly but may not be specific for septic arthritis. Historically, these tests have included a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), synovial fluid cell count, and the percentage of synovial fluid neutrophils.

Previous studies have suggested the use of a synovial fluid cell count of > 50,000 cells/mm³ from a native joint aspiration as the threshold for the diagnosis of septic arthritis. The addition of serum white blood cells (WBC) > 11.0 × 10⁹/L and ESR > 30 mm/hr with this synovial fluid cell count threshold has been reported to have a sensitivity approaching 100%.

Despite the near-dogmatic approach to the 50,000 cell cutoff, the evidence to support this value is limited.

### Current variation in joint aspiration practice for the evaluation of pediatric septic arthritis [^1113Qfkp]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Timing of treatment has been recognized as an important prognostic factor for final outcomes. However, a paucity of literature exists to guide when an aspiration and debridement should take place. This survey found varied responses in the ideal time of joint aspiration after presentation for clinically indicated patients. All but one institution reported that joint aspirations were performed after hours, yet 78% of institutions indicated that hemodynamically stable patients with septic arthritis would await surgical debridement until the day after presentation. Previous studies have shown that articular infection produces progressive chondral destruction over time; however, other studies have shown that a surgical delay of up to 48 hours in adult patients does not negatively affect outcomes.

Periarticular infection may be present in the setting of septic arthritis, especially in joints with metaphyseal intra-articular extension, such as the shoulder, elbow, hip, and ankle. MRI has emerged as the ideal imaging modality to evaluate for adjacent infection; however, there remains some debate about the indications for, or timing of, MRI in the setting of suspected septic arthritis. Several studies have proposed guidelines for MRI acquisition, whereas other studies recommend that all children with suspected septic arthritis undergo imaging due to the relative frequency of confirmed contiguous infection. Of the institutions queried, 50% indicated routine ordering of MRI for the evaluation of suspected infections before aspiration or surgical intervention. Furthermore, 72.2% of institutions indicated a lack of protected scheduling time for MRI.

### Guideline for management of septic arthritis in native joints (SANJO) [^114zss3y]. Journal of Bone and Joint Infection (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of septic arthritis, specifically in relation to antibiotic therapy, the EBJIS 2023 guidelines recommend considering the de-escalation of antibiotic treatment according to the susceptibility pattern of the isolated pathogen. It is advised to maintain IV administration for 1–2 weeks and transition to oral treatment as soon as clinical signs and symptoms of infection, such as fever, redness, warmth, swelling, and pain, along with blood biomarkers like WBC and CRP, indicate satisfactory progress. The decision on oral antibiotics should be based on in vitro activity, oral bioavailability, and diffusion to the synovial fluid.

### Management of septic arthritis: A systematic review [^117GQGL8]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

To evaluate the existing evidence on the diagnosis and management of septic arthritis in native joints, a systematic review was conducted.

- **Data sources**: Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, National Electronic Library for Health, reference lists, and input from national experts.

- **Review methods**: A systematic review of the literature was performed with an evaluation of the methodological quality of the selected papers using defined criteria set out by the Clinical Effectiveness and Evaluation Unit of the Royal College of Physicians.

- **Results**: A total of 3291 citations were initially identified. Among these, 189 full-text articles were considered for potential selection. After reviewing these articles, 80 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis.

- **Conclusions**: Conclusions were drawn concerning the diagnosis, investigation, and management of septic arthritis.

- **Discussion**: There exists little high-quality evidence to guide the diagnosis and management of septic arthritis. Overall, no investigation proves more reliable in diagnosing septic arthritis than the opinion of an experienced doctor. Although aspiration and culture of synovial fluid are crucial to diagnosis, measuring cell count is not helpful. Antibiotics are clearly needed for a prolonged period; however, no data specify the optimal route or duration of administration. Key unanswered questions remain regarding the medical and surgical management of the infected joint.

### Recommendations for the management of septic arthritis after ACL reconstruction [^112Ubw7s]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

To evaluate the evidence for the management of septic arthritis after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, the factors that affect the outcome after treatment, and the retention of graft and implants were examined.

A systematic literature search of the PubMed database was performed on septic arthritis after ACL reconstruction. A total of 301 publications were initially identified, and 17 papers were found to fulfill the criteria for inclusion in the review. There were 196 cases of septic arthritis after ACL reconstruction in over 30,000 ACL reconstructions, making the proportion of infection 0.6%.

Most patients (114/123, 92.6%) had an acute or subacute infection, on average, 16.8 ± 10.5 days after ACL reconstruction. Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) was the most common organism (67/147, 45.6%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (SA) (35/147, 23.8%). A total of 86.9% underwent surgical treatment, of which 92.8% had an average of 1.54 (up to 4) arthroscopic debridements. The group with SA infection had a higher graft removal rate (33.3%, p = 0.019), a longer antibiotic duration (35.4 days, p = 0.047), and a worse range of flexion (111.5°, p = 0.036) than the CNS group.

CNS was the most common organism in septic arthritis after ACL reconstruction, followed by SA. For most authors, arthroscopic debridement combined with intravenous antibiotic therapy was the initial treatment of choice. Antibiotic therapy with or without multiple irrigations of the joint is not recommended based on the high failure rates.

### Guideline for management of septic arthritis in native joints (SANJO) [^1123tr2A]. Journal of Bone and Joint Infection (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of septic arthritis, particularly concerning antibiotic therapy, EBJIS 2023 guidelines recommend selecting empirical treatment choices based on local epidemiology and resistance patterns, taking into account the following factors:

- **Results of Gram staining**: Consider whether bacteria are Gram-positive or Gram-negative, and note their morphology (cocci or bacilli).

- **Presence of risk factors**: Evaluate the potential for MRSA or multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, such as P. aeruginosa and cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales.

- **Treatment without resistant risk factors**: Administer a combination of semisynthetic penicillin (such as cloxacillin or cefazoline) with ceftriaxone, or use monotherapy with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid if there are no risk factors for resistant microorganisms and the Gram stain is negative.

### Bacterial septic arthritis in adults [^111bFfrC]. Lancet (2010). Low credibility.

Symptoms and signs of septic arthritis are an important medical emergency, with high morbidity and mortality. We review the changing epidemiology of septic arthritis of native joints in adults, encompassing the increasing frequency of the disorder and its evolving antibiotic resistance. We discuss various risk factors for the development of septic arthritis and examine host factors, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukins 1 and 10, as well as bacterial proteins, toxins, and enzymes that are reported to be important determinants of pathogenesis in mouse models.

Diagnosis of the disease is largely clinical, guided by investigations and the opinion of skilled clinicians. We emphasize the need for timely medical and surgical intervention. Most importantly, through diagnostic aspiration of relevant joints, the choice of a suitable antibiotic, and appropriate supportive measures. Management is growing in complexity with the advent of novel and antibiotic-resistant causative microorganisms, as well as within the climate of increased immunosuppression. Findings from animal models and patients are shedding light on disease pathogenesis and the possibility of novel adjunctive treatments, including systemic corticosteroids, cytokines and anticytokines, and bisphosphonates.

### Streptococcus pneumoniae septic arthritis in adults [^117DJAYZ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae septic arthritis is an uncommon infection. The classic clinical picture involves concomitant pulmonary and/or meningeal and joint infections in the presence of predisposing local and systemic factors. Initial laboratory tests are usually inconclusive, necessitating joint aspiration for a definitive diagnosis. Treatment options include antibiotic therapy, usually with penicillin, combined with closed or open joint drainage. Increasing reports of infections involving penicillin-resistant strains are a concern. The prognosis is usually favorable, but early recognition and aggressive management are essential to reduce the likelihood of significant joint injury.
