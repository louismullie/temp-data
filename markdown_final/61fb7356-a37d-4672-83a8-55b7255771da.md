## Question

Rifaximin for autoimmune hepatitis remission

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether rifaximin has any role in inducing or maintaining remission in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and what the appropriate, evidence-based remission strategies for AIH should be instead. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about rifaximin's approved uses, dosing, and mechanism. Then, I should review standard-of-care regimens for AIH induction and maintenance from major guidelines. Next, I will check whether any documents directly link rifaximin to AIH remission. After that, I need to consider mechanistic plausibility for rifaximin in AIH. Finally, I will synthesize a clear clinical recommendation, including when rifaximin might still be appropriate in AIH patients for other indications such as hepatic encephalopathy, and what to use for AIH remission instead.

> Let me first confirm rifaximin's established role and dosing because I need to ensure we're not missing a labeled or evidence-based AIH indication. Rifaximin is a gut-selective oral antibiotic approved for prevention of recurrent overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) at 550 mg PO twice daily and has supportive long-term safety data in cirrhosis; dosing does not require adjustment in renal impairment and is acceptable in Child-Pugh A/B, with caution in Child-Pugh C [^112G2F4g] [^1149H8T5] [^111W6ngN] [^115nwkp9] [^112sUsVg] [^111dVFNg] [^111CCTPK].

> Next, I should review standard AIH therapy to anchor what "remission" means in this disease and how it is achieved. Induction and maintenance of AIH remission are steroid-based with steroid-sparing immunosuppressants: prednisone/prednisolone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day with early addition and optimization of azathioprine (1–2 mg/kg/day), or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF 1.5–2 g/day) in selected cases; budesonide 9 mg/day may be considered in non-cirrhotic patients for steroid toxicity, but should not be used in cirrhosis; longer-term maintenance is typically with azathioprine or MMF, aiming for complete biochemical remission and often long-term immunosuppression due to relapse risk [^1147GJRg] [^113zFXB9] [^117MTouT] [^112yHvtT] [^116avs6C] [^113zFXB9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does any guideline or study in the provided set actually endorse rifaximin for AIH remission or maintenance. I will now examine the major guidelines and position statements, and I see no mention of rifaximin as an induction, maintenance, or rescue therapy for AIH in EASL 2025, AASLD 2020, or BSG 2025 frameworks, nor in second/third-line AIH algorithms, which instead focus on azathioprine, MMF, calcineurin inhibitors, and biologics for refractory disease [^1147GJRg] [^116avs6C] [^113zFXB9] [^116ozrt6] [^1122KQWh].

> Let me think about mechanistic plausibility because even if guidelines are silent, mechanism could suggest or refute a role. Rifaximin modulates gut microbiota and ammonia production and is not an immunosuppressant, whereas AIH is an immune-mediated hepatitis requiring immunomodulation to suppress interface hepatitis and normalize IgG and aminotransferases; the therapeutic aim is complete biochemical, clinical, and histologic remission using corticosteroids and steroid-sparing agents, not antibiotics [^111eugRz] [^1124135N] [^117TeezR] [^112G2F4g].

> Wait, let me verify whether broader liver-disease data could indirectly support rifaximin for AIH via microbiome effects. The GALA-RIF randomized trial in alcohol-related liver disease did not meet its primary endpoint for fibrosis regression, although it reduced fibrosis progression on a secondary outcome; separate HE trials show reduced HE recurrence and possibly lower cirrhosis complications, but these contexts do not translate into AIH immunologic remission or maintenance strategies that require immunosuppression, so extrapolation to AIH is unwarranted [^111VNU55] [^112HhZsj] [^116drm5C].

> I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Based on the available documents and mechanistic considerations, rifaximin has no role in inducing or maintaining remission in autoimmune hepatitis; its use in AIH should be limited to approved indications such as prevention of overt hepatic encephalopathy in those with cirrhosis, using the standard 550 mg PO BID regimen when clinically indicated [^1147GJRg] [^116avs6C] [^112G2F4g] [^1149H8T5].

> Let me now outline what to use for AIH remission, so the treatment pathway is explicit. Induction should be with prednisone/prednisolone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day, adding azathioprine once bilirubin permits and titrating to 1–2 mg/kg/day; MMF 1.5–2 g/day is a reasonable alternative first-line in selected settings or second-line in intolerance/insufficient response; consider budesonide 9 mg/day only in non-cirrhotic, steroid-intolerant patients; refractory disease may require tacrolimus, cyclosporine, or biologic rescue (e.g., infliximab, rituximab, belimumab) in expert centers, with decisions individualized and safety closely monitored [^1147GJRg] [^116avs6C] [^114pDXPF] [^117MTouT] [^116ozrt6].

> Hold on, I should verify maintenance and cessation principles to minimize relapse. Maintenance is typically azathioprine or MMF monotherapy once remission is achieved; steroid monotherapy at low dose is a fallback only for mild disease with intolerance to azathioprine and MMF; immunosuppression is often long-term, sometimes lifelong; if considering cessation, ensure sustained complete biochemical remission, often confirm histologic quiescence, taper slowly, and monitor closely because relapse rates after withdrawal are high and can occur years later [^112yHvtT] [^114pDXPF] [^1174bj7G] [^114t8Q89] [^113QcCEH] [^114cxuvx] [^112qcL2F] [^113Cw2kw].

> But wait, what if an AIH patient develops HE due to cirrhosis — should rifaximin be used then. Yes, for HE prevention, use rifaximin 550 mg PO BID, with no renal dose adjustment, acceptable in Child-Pugh A/B, and caution in Child-Pugh C; long-term safety data are supportive in the HE population, and rifaximin is typically used with lactulose as standard of care [^112G2F4g] [^111dVFNg] [^111CCTPK] [^1149H8T5] [^111W6ngN] [^112sUsVg].

---

Rifaximin is **not recommended** for inducing or maintaining remission in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) [^1147GJRg]. There is **no clinical evidence** supporting its use in AIH, and it is not included in any major guidelines (EASL, AASLD, BSG) for AIH management [^116avs6C]. Rifaximin is a non-absorbable antibiotic approved for hepatic encephalopathy and IBS-D, **not for AIH** [^112G2F4g] [^1174q2Ea]. Standard AIH care remains immunosuppression with corticosteroids plus azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil; rifaximin should not be used for AIH remission outside of clinical trials [^113zFXB9].

---

## Mechanism of action and pharmacological profile of rifaximin

Rifaximin is a minimally absorbed antibiotic that inhibits bacterial RNA synthesis, alters the gut microbiota, and reduces bacterial metabolites such as ammonia. It is approved for hepatic encephalopathy, IBS-D, and travelers' diarrhea, but **not for AIH**.

---

## Current clinical evidence regarding rifaximin in AIH

There is **no clinical evidence** from RCTs, cohort studies, or case series evaluating rifaximin for AIH remission. Existing data pertain to hepatic encephalopathy and complications of cirrhosis, not AIH.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Major guidelines (EASL 2025, AASLD 2020, BSG 2025) **do not mention or recommend rifaximin** for AIH; accordingly, it is **not included** in AIH treatment algorithms [^113BJ31M].

- **First-line therapy**: Prednisone or prednisolone (0.5–1 mg/kg/day) plus azathioprine (1–2 mg/kg/day) [^1147GJRg].
- **Second-line therapy**: Mycophenolate mofetil (1.5–2 g/day) for azathioprine intolerance or inadequate response [^1133K5YK] [^113zFXB9].
- **Third-line therapy**: Tacrolimus, infliximab, rituximab, or belimumab in expert centers for refractory disease [^116ozrt6].

---

## Safety and tolerability considerations

Rifaximin is generally well tolerated in hepatic encephalopathy, with low systemic absorption and minimal adverse effects. However, its safety in AIH is **unknown** due to a lack of data; potential risks include antibiotic resistance and microbiome disruption [^1149H8T5].

---

## Potential theoretical rationale for rifaximin use in AIH

A theoretical rationale is based on the gut–liver axis, in which microbiota alterations may influence hepatic inflammation. However, there is **no clinical evidence** that rifaximin modulates immune pathways or achieves remission in AIH.

---

## Ongoing or planned clinical trials

There are **no registered trials** evaluating rifaximin for AIH remission. Current research focuses on established immunosuppressants and novel biologics.

---

## Comparison with standard immunosuppressive therapies

Standard immunosuppressive therapies have robust evidence for inducing and maintaining remission, reducing relapse, and improving survival. Rifaximin lacks evidence of efficacy in AIH and is therefore **inferior to standard care** [^116avs6C].

---

## Clinical scenarios where rifaximin might be considered

Rifaximin may be considered for patients with AIH and concurrent hepatic encephalopathy, but **not for AIH remission**. Its use should be limited to approved indications [^112G2F4g].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Rifaximin is **not recommended** for inducing or maintaining remission in AIH because of a lack of evidence and guideline support. Standard immunosuppressive therapy remains the cornerstone of AIH management. Rifaximin should be used only for approved indications; in AIH, its use should be limited to clinical trials.

Corticosteroids remain the first-line therapy for AIH. Of potential alternative drugs, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) monotherapy achieved remission (normal serum ALT) in 71% of a Japanese cohort with mild AIH. However, UDCA did not improve liver histology in patients with prior suboptimal response to prednisolone, and information is lacking on its longer-term efficacy. In small randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults and children, cyclosporine achieved similar rates of biochemical remission to prednisolone. However, pending further information, induction therapy should remain steroid-based for both adults and children.

Among the regimens in the initial randomised trials, prednisolone monotherapy at 60 mg/day was associated with more steroid-related adverse effects compared to prednisolone 30 mg/day plus azathioprine 50 mg/day. A cohort study showed independent associations between the non-use of a steroid-sparing agent (SSA) in steroid-treated AIH and higher death/transplant rates. The added benefits of SSA use were confirmed in a meta-analysis of these two studies. Thus, this combination regimen of a steroid (usually prednisolone, but see part 4 below) and a steroid-sparing agent (usually azathioprine, but see part 8 below) remains the standard initial treatment for AIH in adults and children.

- **What is the best first-use steroid**: Prednisolone has been the first-use steroid in most patients with AIH. Prednisone is identical to prednisolone and is used in North America. Budesonide is an alternative corticosteroid with 90% first-pass liver metabolism.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on the management of autoimmune hepatitis [^1147GJRg]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for autoimmune hepatitis, specifically concerning induction therapy, the EASL 2025 guidelines recommend initiating prednisone or prednisolone at a dosage of at least 0.5 mg/kg/day. In cases of more severe and advanced disease, the dosage may increase to 1 mg/kg/day. This treatment should be combined with azathioprine, provided that bilirubin levels are ≤ 6 mg/dL. Azathioprine should ideally be administered 2 weeks apart from corticosteroid initiation, starting at an initial dose of 50 mg/day and potentially increasing to a final dose of 1–2 mg/kg/day, or alternatively, mycophenolate mofetil can be used at a dosage of 1.5–2 g/day as first-line treatment in patients with AIH.

A partial response means that there is some improvement in clinical, biochemical, and histological parameters, but without reaching complete remission despite treatment adherence. These patients have abnormal transaminases (usually below 2–3× ULN) or necroinflammatory activity on histology.

- **Recommendations 39–40**: Vaccination against hepatitis A, HBV, pneumococcus (particularly in cirrhotics) along with yearly influenza vaccination should be administered to all AIH patients (III). Bone density determination is recommended at treatment initiation, along with vitamin D supplementation and adequate calcium intake in all patients receiving corticosteroids (II-2).

In partial responders under conventional treatment, an option is to increase azathioprine to 2 mg/kg/day in combination with prednisolone (5–10 mg/kg/day), followed by a repeat liver biopsy after 12–24 months. In patients with a partial response after adequate treatment with budesonide-based schedules, a change to prednisolone (> 20 mg/day initially) could be considered. If complete biochemical and histological remission is not achieved, the aim should be either the lowest achievable biochemical activity in parallel with minimum side effects or the administration of alternative second-line therapeutic agents.

Regarding the specific circumstances of autoimmune hepatitis, particularly concerning patients with drug-induced autoimmune-like hepatitis, the EASL 2025 guidelines recommend administering a short course of prednisolone or prednisone to patients with severe hepatitis, impaired liver function, or those showing no improvement in liver tests within 30 days of discontinuing the implicated agent.

### Relapse is almost universal after withdrawal of immunosuppressive medication in patients with autoimmune hepatitis in remission [^112qcL2F]. Journal of Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment strategies in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) include long-term treatment with corticosteroids and/or azathioprine. This study determined the risk of relapse after drug withdrawal in patients in long-term remission and identified factors associated with such a relapse.

A total of 131 patients, out of a cohort including 844 patients from 7 academic and 14 regional centers in the Netherlands, were identified where treatment was tapered after at least 2 years of clinical and biochemical remission. Relapse was defined as alanine-aminotransferase levels (ALT) three times above the upper limit of normal. Loss of remission was characterized by rising ALT levels necessitating the reinstitution of drug treatment.

During follow-up, 61 (47%) patients relapsed, and 56 (42%) experienced a loss of remission. Among these 117 patients, 60 had fully discontinued medication, while 57 patients were still on a withdrawal scheme. One year after drug withdrawal, 59% of the patients required retreatment, increasing to 73% and 81% after 2 and 3 years, respectively. Previous combination therapy of corticosteroids and azathioprine, a concomitant autoimmune disease, and younger age at the time of drug withdrawal were associated with an increased risk of relapse. Subsequent attempts for discontinuation after initial failure in 32 patients inevitably resulted in a new relapse.

This retrospective analysis indicates that loss of remission or relapse occurs in virtually all patients with AIH in long-term remission when immunosuppressive therapy is discontinued.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic liver disease of unknown aetiology that may affect patients irrespective of age, sex, and ethnicity. At baseline, the clinical spectrum of the disease varies broadly, from asymptomatic cases to acute liver failure with massive hepatocyte necrosis. The aim of these EASL guidelines is to provide updated guidance on the diagnosis and management of AIH in both adults and children. Updated guidance is also provided for the management of patients with variants and specific forms of AIH. Detailed guidance is included on the management of AIH-associated cirrhosis, including surveillance for portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as liver transplantation in cases of decompensated cirrhosis.

### Hellenic Association for the Study of the Liver clinical practice guidelines: Autoimmune hepatitis [^116qmXai]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The primary treatment endpoints and discontinuation of therapy aim for a complete clinical, biochemical, and histological response, with prolonged off-treatment remission. However, in real-life settings, these endpoints are achieved in a minority of patients who discontinue therapy based on prednisolone alone or in combination with azathioprine, while data on budesonide-treated patients are still lacking. In contrast, real-world studies have shown high rates of maintained off-treatment remission, accompanied by histological improvement in patients treated with prednisolone in combination with MMF as first-line therapy.

- **Recommendations 33–36**:
	- Patients with AIH should remain under close long-term monitoring after treatment discontinuation, as relapses may occur most commonly in the first 6–12 months, but even many years later (II-2).
	- IgG elevation usually precedes transaminase increase in patients with AIH relapse, but liver biopsy is not recommended (II-2).
	- Treatment of relapses should be similar to the initial treatment schedule; it is also effective in re-inducing full remission (II-2).
	- Long-term, probably permanent, maintenance treatment should be recommended in AIH patients who have been treated adequately (≥ 4 years of immunosuppression) but relapse during drug withdrawal or maintenance treatment (II-2).

Treatment withdrawal can be suggested only in those patients who have achieved continuous complete biochemical remission for at least the last two years of treatment, and especially in those with ALT below half the ULN along with IgG < 1200 mg/dL.

### Hellenic Association for the Study of the Liver clinical practice guidelines: Autoimmune hepatitis [^115furjG]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Definition of the acute/severe form of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an urgent unmet need.

- **Recommendations**:
	- In partial responders under a conventional regimen, an increase of the azathioprine dose to 2 mg/kg/day in combination with 5–10 mg/kg/day prednisolone is recommended (II-3).
	- In partial responders under a budesonide-based regimen, a change to prednisolone (> 20 mg/day) could be considered (III).
	- In partial responders not able to achieve complete remission despite the above options, the goal should be the lowest achievable biochemical activity with a minimum of side-effects, or administration of alternative second-line therapeutic agents after consultation at a specialized center (II-3).
	- Failure of primary complete biochemical remission after adequate treatment should raise strong suspicion of misdiagnosis or non-compliance with therapy (II-2).
	- All AIH patients presenting with the acute/severe form of the disease should be considered for a high-dose corticosteroid trial (> 1 mg/kg/day) at the earliest opportunity, and preferably intravenously. Failure to improve within 7 days should lead to emergency listing for liver transplantation (II-3).
	- In non-responders without intense severity, prednisolone and azathioprine at the maximum dosage (1 mg/kg/day and 2 mg/kg/day, respectively) could be tried, followed by management at expert centers in the case of non-response (II-2).
	- Determination of thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) levels could help the redesign of treatment strategy, as undetectable TGN may indicate altered azathioprine metabolism or non-compliance, while high TGN levels may suggest… (sentence truncated)

- **Second-line and third-line treatments**: We recommend budesonide as an option in non-cirrhotic adult patients with significant prednisolone-associated adverse effects (AEs). The grade of evidence is moderate, and the strength of recommendation is weak. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is recommended for those intolerant of azathioprine and who are taking active steps not to conceive. The grade of evidence is moderate, and the strength of recommendation is weak. For patients responding inadequately to azathioprine despite treatment optimization, tacrolimus might be more effective as a rescue therapy; however, MMF can also be considered due to its better side-effect profile. The grade of evidence is low, and the strength of recommendation is weak. Second/third-line therapies, other than MMF and tacrolimus, require specific expertise, and specialist input should be sought before their use. The grade of evidence is low, while the strength of recommendation is strong.

- **Long-term management**: Long-term follow-up is recommended, as autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is usually a lifelong condition. The grade of evidence is moderate, and the strength of recommendation is strong. Non-invasive imaging assessment of fibrosis should be considered at 2–3 year intervals. The grade of evidence is weak, and the strength of recommendation is low. In adults achieving complete biochemical response (CBR) after 6 months, and following repeated testing 2–4 weeks later, steroids should be withdrawn slowly, over 3 months. In children, low-dose steroids should be continued and stopped only after discussion with a specialist centre.

- **Recommendations Section P**: We recommend that patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) who have cirrhosis or those receiving immunosuppressive treatment and develop COVID-19 infection be considered for appropriate antiviral therapy. The grade of evidence is high, and the strength of recommendation is strong.

	- We also recommend that steroid therapy usually be continued during COVID-19 infection. The decision to withhold steroid-sparing agents should be individualized, based on infection severity. The grade of evidence is low, and the strength of recommendation is weak.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on the management of autoimmune hepatitis [^117MTouT]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for autoimmune hepatitis, more specifically with respect to induction therapy, EASL 2025 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of budesonide as part of first-line treatment for AIH. Consider switching to budesonide due to corticosteroid side effects in patients without cirrhosis who are dependent on prednisolone. However, do not use budesonide in patients with cirrhosis.

### Hellenic association for the study of the liver clinical practice guidelines: Autoimmune hepatitis [^111cwJpu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with mild necroinflammatory activity at initial biopsy, who are intolerant to azathioprine and have achieved complete biochemical response, can receive prednisolone monotherapy at the lowest dose that can maintain remission. In all other patients, the aim should be to eliminate prednisolone monotherapy with individualized adjusted azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day) or alternatively mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) doses (1.5–2 g/day). The total duration of immunosuppression should be at least three years, with at least the last two years having persistent complete biochemical response (normalization of transaminases and IgG). In patients who have received adequate induction and maintenance immunosuppression but have not achieved biochemical or histological remission, immunosuppression should not be stopped, as relapse will occur almost universally.

- **Statements 8–9**: The long-term efficacy of the conventional treatment is uncertain, as 15–25% of patients develop intolerance or side-effects (II-2). Long-term biochemical and histological data on budesonide safety and efficacy are lacking (I).

- **Recommendations 23–27**: Induction treatment for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) should be individualized and response-guided (II-2). Prednisolone at one oral dose of 0.5–1 mg/kg/day in the morning, combined with azathioprine at an initial morning dose of 50 mg/dl usually after two weeks, if bilirubin is < 6 mg/dl, should be the first-line therapy for AIH (I). Azathioprine should then be increased up to 1–2 mg/kg/day (maintenance dose) (II-2). In specialized AIH centers, prednisolone (0.5–1 mg/kg/day) can be combined with MMF (2 g/day) from the beginning.

Developing guidelines for DI-ALH management involves addressing the lack of reliable diagnostic biomarkers and an evidence-based treatment paradigm, which have resulted in limited guidance on managing this aspect of DILI. DI-ALH was defined in the EASL Clinical Practice Guideline as "acute DILI with serological and/or histological markers of idiopathic AIH".

### Current and novel immunosuppressive therapy for autoimmune hepatitis [^1145VmbH]. Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids, alone or in conjunction with azathioprine, are the treatment of choice for patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and result in remission induction in over 80% of patients. A sustained response to therapy may lead to significant regression of fibrosis, even in advanced cases. Rapid withdrawal of immunosuppression often results in disease relapse for many patients. Consequently, the use of 2 mg/kg/d of azathioprine as a sole agent to maintain remission has been widely accepted in clinical practice.

Persistent severe laboratory abnormalities or histologic abnormalities such as bridging necrosis or multilobular necrosis are absolute indications for treatment based on controlled clinical trials. However, there is debate about whether all patients with AIH need treatment as examination of liver tissue remains the best method of evaluating both treatment response and the need for treatment in patients with minimal biochemical activity.

- **Alternative strategies**:
	- Patients who fail to achieve remission on standard therapy of corticosteroids, with or without azathioprine, or those experiencing drug toxicity may consider using cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or mycophenolate mofetil.
	- Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice in managing decompensated disease.

In this review, we examine management strategies of AIH and evaluate available data pertaining to the use of novel immunosuppressive agents in this condition.

Which patients do not need treatment?

In three of four early randomized trials, prednisolone (with or without azathioprine) reduced mortality compared with placebo or azathioprine alone. Most patients had severe AIH, with cirrhosis in 50–60% and one third developing liver failure.

Most adult cohort studies include patients with a broader range of severity, and 5–15% did not receive steroids. Reasons included mild changes on biopsy, near-normal serum transaminases, variant syndromes, urgent need for liver transplant, patient refusal, and 'burnt-out' cirrhosis. Non-treatment is unusual in children.

Outcomes in untreated patients are rarely reported separately, but in two cohort studies, 8% and 55% of patients, respectively, did not receive steroids, and these patients had (compared with treated patients) a higher death/transplantation rate. In a meta-analysis of the four randomized trials plus these cohort studies, prednisolone ± azathioprine (vs. no treatment or azathioprine alone) was associated with a more than twofold reduction in all-cause death/transplantation. This underlines the need for IST in most patients with AIH.

In some subgroups, such as those without symptoms or without cirrhosis, the need for treatment might be questioned. However, in asymptomatic patients and in patients without cirrhosis, and with decompensated cirrhosis, meta-analysis showed associations between steroid-based treatment and two- to threefold reduction in death/liver transplantation rate.

Treatment has not been statistically associated with lower medium-term mortality in patients with 'mild' AIH.

Use of second-line agents in patients with AS-AIH not responding to steroids is not routinely recommended, although there are reports of benefits from tacrolimus and ciclosporin. Some patients initially presenting with AS-AIH then develop encephalopathy, effectively progressing to AIH with ALF. The progression rate is correlated across studies with the median initial MELD score and INR. Additionally, sepsis develops in about 20% of patients with AS-AIH or AF-AIH. The risk is not obviously increased following steroid treatment but is associated with a higher initial MELD score.

Based on these studies, we suggest that in patients with AS-AIH, an INR greater than 2.5 at presentation represents a good cut-off value, above which steroid therapy is unlikely to result in the avoidance of transplant. A trial of steroids (usually prednisolone 40 mg/day) can be considered in AS-AIH if there is:

- **Full involvement and agreement**: Of the local transplant centre.
- **Exclusion of, or successful treatment of, sepsis**.
- **INR < 2.5**.
- **Facilities for close monitoring**: Ideally in a high-dependency ward.

### AIH with ALF

Some cohorts consist mainly of patients presenting with AIH-ALF (including encephalopathy). In these instances, recovery with steroid treatment is seen in only 9–42% of patients, and no survival benefit was observed with steroids in ALF-AIH in one multicentre cohort. A trial of steroids can be considered in patients presenting with grade 1–2 encephalopathy, especially with lower MELD scores, but all these patients should be managed in a transplant centre.

Despite advances in the understanding and treatment of autoimmune hepatitis, important unmet clinical needs remain in both adult and pediatric patient populations. The evolving research landscape and the assembly of large patient cohorts are creating unique opportunities to translate science into new therapies and care pathways, with the potential to substantially improve the lives of patients with autoimmune hepatitis. However, these areas of unmet need represent real challenges that must be addressed if this vision is to be realized.

- **Challenges in adult autoimmune hepatitis**: Particular difficulties arise in relation to disease-modifying therapy and trial design and delivery.

- **Recommendations section H**:
	1. We recommend budesonide as an option in non-cirrhotic adult patients with significant prednisolone-associated adverse effects. Grade of evidence: moderate. Strength of recommendation: weak.

	2. We recommend mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as an option in those who are intolerant of azathioprine and are taking active steps not to conceive. Grade of evidence: moderate. Strength of recommendation: weak.

	3. We recommend that in patients responding inadequately to azathioprine despite treatment optimization, tacrolimus might be more effective as a rescue therapy, but MMF can also be considered owing to its better side-effect profile. Grade of evidence: low. Strength of recommendation: weak.

	4. We recommend that second/third-line therapies, other than MMF and tacrolimus, require specific expertise: specialist input should be sought prior to their use. Grade of evidence: low. Strength of recommendation: strong.

- **Section I: Longer-term management**:
	- Autoimmune hepatitis is usually a lifelong disease, which, in the absence of a clear precipitant, rarely disappears, and with which many patients will live for several decades. Although occasional patients have been labeled as having 'burnt-out' autoimmune hepatitis, the rate of long-term spontaneous disease remission seems low. Thus, follow-up should be lifelong, with the aims of limiting the progression of liver injury by minimizing relapse rate and fibrosis progression. Additionally, it is important to maximize patient well-being by minimizing adverse treatment effects and optimizing quality of life as outlined in Section L.

### Diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^111eugRz]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis is an inflammatory disease of the liver of unknown cause that may progress to liver cirrhosis and end-stage liver failure if diagnosis is overlooked and treatment delayed. The clinical presentation is often that of acute hepatitis, sometimes very severe; less frequently, it can be insidious or completely asymptomatic. The disease can affect people of any age and is more common in women; its incidence and prevalence seem to be on the rise worldwide. An abnormal immune response targeting liver autoantigens and inducing persistent and self-perpetuating liver inflammation is the pathogenic mechanism of the disease.

- **Diagnostic hallmarks include**: A specific set of autoantibodies, increased IgG concentrations, and histological demonstration of interface hepatitis and periportal necrosis. Prompt response to treatment with corticosteroids and other immunomodulatory drugs is almost universal and supports the diagnosis.

- **Aims of treatment**: To induce and maintain long-term remission of liver inflammation. Treatment can often reverse liver fibrosis, thus preventing progression to advanced cirrhosis and its complications.

Most patients need lifelong maintenance therapy, and repeated follow-up in experienced hands improves the quality of care and quality of life for affected patients.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^111W6ngN]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Historically, the NNT measure was designed to quantify treatment benefit directly in terms of the number of patients who would need to be treated before benefit is observed, thereby providing a means of expressing absolute, as opposed to relative, risk in a clinically meaningful way. Although the number of studies eligible for inclusion in the NNT analyses was limited, the results showed that, in terms of long-term secondary prophylaxis for the prevention of OHE recurrence, approximately four patients would need to be treated with lactulose before clinical benefit is observed, compared with no treatment or placebo. This must be considered within the clinical context showing a very high rate of OHE recurrence with no prophylaxis or with poor adherence to lactulose therapy. Importantly, to show the add-on benefit of rifaximin to lactulose, the NNT is approximately four patients to prevent the recurrence of OHE. The relatively low NNT value for adding rifaximin to lactulose therapy provides further support for the clinical benefit of these treatments for the prevention of OHE recurrence over the long term.

Only one study compared rifaximin monotherapy versus rifaximin+lactulose, and NNT analysis showed that approximately seven patients would need to be treated with rifaximin monotherapy before clinical benefit is observed compared with rifaximin+lactulose. However, the results of this single study should be viewed with caution, not only because the 95% CI was very wide but also because the study design was such that patients who received rifaximin monotherapy may have had different baseline characteristics.

### Current status of therapy in autoimmune liver disease [^112eF6Pv]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Therapeutic strategies for autoimmune liver diseases are increasingly established. Although proportionately uncommon, specialist centers have, over time, refined the best approaches for each disease based on an improved understanding of the spectrum of presentation. The major treatment aims are to prevent end-stage liver disease and its associated complications. As a result of drugs such as ursodeoxycholic acid, prednisolone, and azathioprine, both primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune hepatitis are now less commonly indications for liver transplantation.

Unfortunately, the same inroads in treatment efficacy have not been made for primary sclerosing cholangitis, although the recognition that a subset of patients may have a treatable secondary sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4 related) is helping a proportion. With better biological understanding, more specific interventions are expected that will benefit all those with autoimmune liver diseases.

- **Statements 6–7**: Definition of biochemical remission involves the normalization of IgG, AST, and ALT values (II-2). Histological remission is defined as the absence of or minimal hepatitis (HAI ≤ 4) (II-2).

- **Recommendations 20–22**: AIH therapy should aim to achieve complete biochemical and histological remission to prevent potential disease progression (II-2). All patients with active disease, even those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, should be treated (I). Treatment can be withheld in patients with spontaneous remission, although a close long-term follow-up is advised to not miss an AIH exacerbation (III).

The primary aim should be the achievement of complete clinical and biochemical remission at the lowest corticosteroid dose, or even complete withdrawal, using a rapid manner of corticosteroid tapering to avoid corticosteroid-dependent disease and the development of several significant side-effects. Azathioprine should be used with caution during pregnancy, in cases of malignancies, cytopenias, and established thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) deficiency.

Many patients (15–25%) develop side-effects or are intolerant to corticosteroid therapy alone or in combination with azathioprine. Additionally, measurement of TPMT activity or genotyping, along with determination of azathioprine metabolites, are time-consuming processes and not widely available nor do they provide convincing proof of avoidance of toxicity or predict the treatment response.

### Rifaximin is safe and well tolerated for long-term maintenance of remission from overt hepatic encephalopathy [^1149H8T5]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). High credibility.

Rifaximin is a gut-selective, oral antimicrobial agent shown to reduce the recurrence of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and HE-related hospitalizations in a 6-month, randomized, controlled trial (RCT). We performed a phase 3, open-label maintenance study to assess the safety and rate of hospitalization with long-term rifaximin use.

- **Methods**: We conducted a 24-month, open-label maintenance study of rifaximin (550 mg, twice daily) in patients with HE who participated in the previous RCT of rifaximin or new patients enrolled from March 2007 to December 2010. Safety was assessed through adverse events and clinical laboratory parameters for the integrated population of all patients, who were given rifaximin 550 mg twice daily (all-rifaximin population, N = 392). Safety and hospitalization data were compared between the group given placebo in the original RCT (n = 159) and those given rifaximin (n = 140).

- **Results**: In the all-rifaximin population, the median exposure to rifaximin was 427.0 days (range, 2–1427 days), with 510.5 person-years of exposure. The profile and rate of adverse events with long-term rifaximin treatment were similar to those of the original RCT. There was no increase in the rate of infections, including with Clostridium difficile, or development of bacterial antibiotic resistance. Rates of hospitalizations with long-term rifaximin administration remained low; the HE-related hospitalization rate, normalized for exposure (0.21; all-rifaximin population), was similar to that of the rifaximin group in the original RCT (0.30).

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as a first-line agent

Observational studies suggested that MMF (1.5–2.0 g/day), with prednisolone, was well-tolerated and achieved remission (normal serum transaminases and γ-globulins), usually within 3 months. Follow-up studies and a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 70 patients indicated that MMF, compared with azathioprine, achieved a higher complete biochemical response (CBR) rate after 6 months and caused fewer adverse events (AEs) requiring a change of drug. A meta-analysis of these two studies favored MMF over azathioprine; however, further data are needed for definitive conclusions. Mycophenolate mofetil is not currently used as a first-line therapy in children.

- **Monitoring of patients during treatment**: Monitoring can be done in secondary or primary care if results can be assessed and actioned reliably. Assessments should be more frequent if serum transaminases are not settling or there are treatment-related AEs. Stopping treatment is discussed in Section I.

- **Initial management of acute severe AIH (AS-AIH), AIH with acute liver failure (AIH-ALF), and AIH with acute on chronic liver failure (AIH with ACLF)**: These severe presentations of AIH are described in sections C–E.

Systematic literature searches to inform the AIH guideline were undertaken in February 2020, with an updated search in July 2022. The strategy was developed by the GDG and information specialists at the School of Medicine and Population Health, University of Sheffield, UK. Thesaurus terms and free-text terms relating to patients with AIH were used. Methodological search filters helped identify the study types of interest. Searches focused exclusively on human studies and were conducted on Ovid Medline, EMBASE via Ovid, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Databases were searched from inception. The search results were imported into Endnote reference management software, and duplicates were removed.

The searches generated 16,893 unduplicated references. As some search terms were not AIH-specific, many references not relevant to AIH were included. The group members added 1,741 further references to include studies published since July 2022 and studies in areas such as side effects of medications in other conditions.

The guideline is structured as evidence summaries, providing answers to specific clinical questions agreed upon by the GDG members. These questions were grouped into 16 sections (A–O). Each section was assigned to two group members, responsible for performing evidence searches and writing the summaries. The recommendations at the end of each section aim to answer the questions.

### Second-line and third-line therapy for autoimmune hepatitis: A position statement from the European Reference Network on Hepatological Diseases and the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group [^1122KQWh]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

Most patients with autoimmune hepatitis respond well to standard immunosuppressive therapy with steroids and azathioprine. While untreated disease is usually fatal, patients who respond well to therapy have an excellent prognosis. However, insufficient response to standard therapy or intolerable side effects requiring dose adaptations or treatment changes occur in 10–20% of patients.

- **Second-line treatment options**: There is fairly good agreement on options, although the specifics are not detailed here.

- **Third-line therapies**: There is a wide variation in the indication and use of possible third-line treatments.

The European Reference Network on Hepatological Diseases (ERN RARE-LIVER) and the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (IAIHG) outline a treatment algorithm for both children and adults. This should help to standardize treatment approaches, improve patient care, and enable the comparison of treatment results between scientific publications.

### Rifaximin has the potential to prevent complications of cirrhosis [^116drm5C]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). High credibility.

The details of the patient population, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and study design have been published elsewhere. Briefly, adults with cirrhosis, a history of two or more episodes of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) with a Conn score of two or more within six months of screening, but currently in remission from HE (i.e. Conn score of one or less), with a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of 25 or less at study entry, were eligible for inclusion in the study.

Exclusion criteria included active spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or the need for daily prophylactic therapy for SBP, renal insufficiency (serum creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dl), anemia (hemoglobin less than 8 g/dl), and hypovolemia or any electrolyte abnormality with the potential to affect mental function. The trial design was a randomized, phase III, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial of rifaximin 550 mg (Xifaxan®, Salix Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) or placebo administered twice daily (BID) for six months. Concomitant use of lactulose was permitted during the study.

As previously reported, the study protocol received approval by the institutional review board or ethics committee at each center, and the study was conducted in adherence to guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonisation. All patients provided written informed consent.

The study GALA-RIF was published by Mads Israelsen and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology. This study is related to alcohol-related liver disease. In the GALA-RIF study, the trial question was: What is the role of rifaximin-alpha in patients with ALD? The study design was single center, double-blinded, RCT. The population consisted of 136 patients (22 female, 114 male). Inclusion criteria were adult patients aged 18–75 years with biopsy-proven ALD and no previous hepatic decompensation.

The key exclusion criteria included known allergy to rifaximin, antibiotic treatment in the previous 4 weeks, contraindications for liver biopsy, and cancer or other debilitating disease with a life expectancy of less than 1 year.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Rifaximin-alpha**: n = 68 (an oral dose of 550 mg BID for 18 months).
	- **Placebo**: n = 68 (matching placebo for 18 months).

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in regression of liver fibrosis in the per-protocol analysis (26% vs. 28%; OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.68).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant decrease in progression of liver fibrosis in the per-protocol analysis (24% vs. 43%; OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.98).
	- No significant difference in regression of hepatic lobular inflammation (50% vs. 33%; OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.11).
	- No significant difference in progression of hepatic steatosis (26% vs. 35%; OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.47).

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of second-line immunosuppressants for autoimmune hepatitis treatment [^111eLpJF]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

The gold-standard treatment for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a prednisone/azathioprine combination. However, subgroups of patients may be unresponsive to this treatment. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of second-line immunosuppressive therapies for AIH through a systematic review and meta-analysis in adult patients.

- **Patients and methods**: The systematic review was registered at the PROSPERO platform under number 42015019831. Databases MEDLINE (PubMed), LILACS, Cochrane, and SciELO were searched. The keywords used were 'Hepatitis, Autoimmune' and descriptor terms (MeSH and DeCS). These terms were linked with each immunosuppressant of interest.

- **Results**: A total of 1532 studies were identified. Of these, 1492 were excluded on the basis of title and abstract reading. Among the 40 studies retrieved for detailed full-text analysis, a total of 15 fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the analysis. The most studied second-line immunosuppressive was mycophenolate mofetil (MM). The mean reduction of aminotransferases was observed in 94.3% with tacrolimus/prednisone, 91.3% for cyclosporine/prednisone, 85.5% for budesonide, and 78.7% for MM/prednisone. For MM/prednisone, the mean rate of histological remission was 88.6%, liver transplantation was indicated in 11.4%, and the mortality rate was 7.2%. Limitations included the lack of randomized-controlled trials and prospective studies, the small number of patients, and the heterogeneity between remission criteria.

This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to compare AIH treatments comprehensively.

### Repeat treatment with rifaximin improves irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life: a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1174q2Ea]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

For patients with an open-label response to rifaximin who relapsed during the observation phase and were randomly assigned to double-blind rifaximin or placebo, a statistically significantly greater percentage of patients receiving rifaximin achieved an MCID in IBS-QOL overall score from the double-blind baseline to the end of the first retreatment 4-week follow-up compared with placebo, providing further evidence of the sustained beneficial and clinically meaningful impact of rifaximin on QOL in patients with IBS-D. These favorable findings regarding QOL appear to align with the significant improvement in efficacy outcomes observed with rifaximin compared with placebo during the first double-blind retreatment phase of the study, suggesting that improvement in IBS-QOL may, in part, be driven by relief of IBS symptoms following repeat treatment with rifaximin versus placebo. Interestingly, when patients had recurrent IBS symptoms after responding to open-label rifaximin, the baseline QOL immediately preceding double-blind repeat treatment was improved compared with that reported at the open-label baseline. This is consistent with data previously reported for this trial for IBS symptom scores (e.g. 20% improvement in abdominal pain at the double-blind baseline relative to symptom severity prior to open-label rifaximin), which were also lower (improved) compared with open-label baseline data. The improvement in QOL at the baseline of the double-blind repeat treatment phase reduces the statistical power to detect measurable improvement related to a potential carryover effect.

### Mycophenolate for the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis: Prospective assessment of its efficacy and safety for induction and maintenance of remission in a large cohort of treatment-naïve patients [^117NGnKi]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

The standard therapy for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is corticosteroids, with or without azathioprine. However, 20% of patients do not respond or are intolerant to conventional treatment. Therefore, this study evaluated prospectively the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in inducing and/or maintaining remission in treatment-naïve AIH patients.

Methods included treating fifty-nine treatment-naïve patients with well-defined AIH using prednisolone plus 1.5–2 g/d of MMF. Patients were candidates for MMF withdrawal after at least 4 years. Treatment outcomes were defined according to the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group report.

- **Results**: Treatment duration with MMF averaged 26 months (range 3–92 months). Eighty-eight percent (52/59) of patients responded initially both clinically and biochemically (normalization of transaminases and γ-globulins), with most achieving this within 3 months. The remaining 12% (7 patients) had a partial response. In total, 59.3% (35/59) of patients achieved complete response (CR), with 37% (22/59) of them achieving CR off prednisolone. Meanwhile, 28.8% (17/59) had an initial CR with subsequent relapses. No patient was a non-responder. Prednisolone withdrawal occurred in 57.6% (34/59) of patients within 8 months. The only independent predictor of treatment outcome was γ-GT, both at baseline (p = 0.008) and on month 24 (p < 0.05). Severe side effects leading to MMF discontinuation occurred in only 3.4% (2/59) of patients. Six patients (2 according to protocol and 4 for personal reasons) stopped treatment with MMF, resulting in 3 relapsing.

In conclusion, MMF appears safe and effective as a first-line therapy in inducing and maintaining remission in treatment-naïve AIH patients.

In AIH patients who show an insufficient response under combination treatment with predniso(lo)ne and AZA, 6-TGN levels should be determined first. Patients with 6-TGN levels less than 220 pmol/8 × 10⁸ red blood cells should be assessed for non-adherence. After non-adherence is ruled out, optimization of 6-TGN levels, either by increasing the dose of AZA up to 2 mg/kg/day or by adding allopurinol, which blocks the 6-methylmercaptopurine pathway, and reducing the dose of AZA to about 25% of the previous dose, should be tried. In patients with insufficient response and 6-TGN levels above 220 pmol/8 × 10⁸ red blood cells, it is prudent to first exclude an alternative or co-diagnosis. Viral infections by Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus, MASLD and/or MASH because of corticosteroid use, and DILI because of supplements and/or herbals should be appropriately excluded before an index patient is defined as an insufficient responder.

The suggested cutoff for 6-TGN levels has been chosen from previous experience in transplantation and IBD, as well as from two retrospective studies in AIH patients, even though another recent retrospective study from the UK showed that lower cutoff levels could also be of clinical significance. Repeated relapses during maintenance therapy should also be considered an insufficient response. MMF can be used after unsuccessful intensification of AZA-related first-line therapies, as recent systematic reviews and real-world studies have shown response rates ranging from 32–57% in insufficient responders.

- **Recommendations section F**:
	1. We recommend immunosuppressive treatment (IST) in most patients with AIH, regardless of symptoms. Grade of evidence: high. Strength of recommendation: strong.

	2. We recommend that in patients with mild AIH (all of: serum ALT < 50 U/L, Ishak necro-inflammatory score < 6, and fibrosis stage < 2), the decision to offer treatment should be based on a balance of benefits and risks. Grade of evidence: low. Strength of recommendation: strong.

	3. We recommend that patients starting treatment for AIH should:

		- **Ensure immunisation is up-to-date against**: COVID-19, pneumococcus, influenza, shingles, hepatitis A, hepatitis B (if HBV markers absent), and if under 25 or if gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men (GBMSM) and under 45, human papillomavirus.

		- Receive prophylactic nucleotide therapy if HBV surface antigen positive or if core antibody positive and starting rituximab.

		- Be monitored for HBV reactivation if HBV core antibody positive and receiving other treatments. Grade of evidence: low. Strength of recommendation: strong.

	4. We recommend that first-line initial therapy should usually comprise a corticosteroid plus azathioprine. Grade of evidence: high. Strength of recommendation: strong.

	5. Although not routinely recommended over prednisolone, we recommend that budesonide (initially 9 mg/day) be considered in adults without cirrhosis if there is major concern regarding steroid cosmetic adverse effects.

### Infliximab as a rescue treatment in difficult-to-treat autoimmune hepatitis [^114krp9v]. Journal of Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic inflammatory liver disease that leads to liver cirrhosis and corresponding complications if left untreated. Standard treatment with azathioprine and prednisolone induces remission in the vast majority of patients. However, for those patients not responding to standard treatment or not tolerating these drugs, few alternatives can be used, and their effectiveness might be limited. We sought to analyze the safety and efficacy of off-label treatment with infliximab in a cohort of eleven patients with difficult-to-treat autoimmune hepatitis.

- **Methods**: Patients with difficult-to-treat autoimmune hepatitis who could not be brought into remission with standard treatment, either due to drug intolerance or insufficient drug impact, were treated off-label with infliximab for a minimum of six months. Patient files were reviewed retrospectively.

- **Results**: Treatment with infliximab led to the reduction of inflammation, evidenced by a decrease in transaminases (mean AST prior to treatment 475 U/L ± 466, mean AST during treatment 43 U/L ± 32) as well as in immunoglobulins (pretreatment mean IgG 24.8 mg/dl ± 10.1, mean IgG during treatment 17.38 mg/dl ± 6). Infectious complications occurred in seven out of eleven patients, and close monitoring was necessary.

- **Conclusions**: Infliximab may be considered as rescue therapy in patients with difficult-to-treat autoimmune hepatitis, albeit treatment may be associated with infectious complications.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^112mLqnL]. Gut (2025). Low credibility.

While corticosteroids plus azathioprine is the usually recommended first-line treatment for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), steroid monotherapy should be considered in specific situations.

- **Decompensated cirrhosis**: Although not evidence-based, many centers are reticent about adding a steroid-sparing agent. The AASLD guidelines advise against this approach.

- **Uncertain diagnosis of AIH**: When there is uncertainty in the AIH diagnosis, a substantial improvement in serum transaminases with steroids increases the likelihood of AIH and might enable the subsequent introduction of a steroid-sparing agent with more confidence.

- **Expected short treatment duration**: Consider steroid monotherapy in non-cirrhotic patients when a suspected drug precipitant has been withdrawn.

- **Homozygosity for the TPMT deficiency allele or concurrent need for allopurinol therapy**: In these cases, recalling that allopurinol might sometimes be beneficial, there might also be reluctance to use mycophenolate (e.g. in a woman contemplating pregnancy).

- **Recent cancer diagnosis**: In such cases, there is often reluctance to use azathioprine or mycophenolate.

In these situations, prednisolone is usually preferred. It is important to note that steroid monotherapy is not recommended in children.

### Sustained remission after corticosteroid therapy for type 1 autoimmune hepatitis: a retrospective analysis [^1169QZ8t]. Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis commonly relapses after corticosteroid therapy, and long-term management strategies have been proposed based on the premise that repeated relapses after drug withdrawal are inevitable. Our goal was to determine the frequency that remission can be sustained after its induction and termination of therapy. A total of 107 patients who had entered remission on conventional regimens were assessed for sustained remission after initial treatment and after relapse and re-treatment.

- **Re-treatment strategies**: Included conventional regimens and long-term maintenance schedules. Twenty-two patients (21%) achieved a sustained remission after initial treatment, and 24 of 85 patients who relapsed and were re-treated (28%) had a similar outcome. The probability of a sustained remission was 47% after 10 years of follow-up. Patients who sustained remission after initial therapy were distinguished only by a lower serum gamma-globulin level at entry.

- **Comparison of treatment schedules**: Conventional re-treatment schedules after relapse were able to induce a sustained remission more commonly than long-term maintenance schedules (59% vs. 12%, P = 0.00002).

In conclusion, patients who respond to initial corticosteroid therapy can achieve a sustained remission after treatment withdrawal or after relapse and re-treatment. All patients are candidates for this outcome, and withdrawal of medication, even during maintenance schedules, is necessary to assess its likelihood.

- **Further validation of complete biochemical remission (CBR)**: As the best early predictor of longer-term outcome.

- **Validation of serial non-invasive tests**: As predictors of longer-term outcome and their incorporation into clinical trials.

- **Further evaluation of patient-reported outcome measures**: Including development of an AIH-specific measure, and their incorporation into trials of AIH treatment.

- **Clarification of the role of mycophenolate mofetil**: As a first-line steroid-sparing agent.

- **Evaluation of initial therapy with existing agents**: Such as rituximab and novel biological agents in prospective trials against steroid-based therapy.

- **Evaluation of novel agents compared with tacrolimus or mycophenolate**: As second-/third-line drugs in patients.

- **Evaluation of budesonide**: As a longer-term maintenance treatment.

- **Evaluation of second-/third-line treatments**: Such as tacrolimus, in avoiding the need for transplant in patients with acute severe AIH without early response to prednisolone.

This guideline has been written on behalf of the British Society of Gastroenterology by a group of experts in the diagnosis and management of AIH, plus two patients with AIH. It is intended for healthcare professionals involved in the management of patients with AIH and also for patients themselves to understand their condition and the care they receive. It incorporates the advances in the understanding of AIH since the previous guideline was published in 2011. However, it is not intended simply as a set of instructions — every patient is unique, and treatment of AIH should be personalized.

These BSG guidelines represent a consensus of best practice based on the available evidence at the time of preparation. They might not apply in all situations and should be interpreted in light of specific clinical circumstances and resource availability. Further controlled clinical studies might be needed to clarify aspects of these statements, and revisions might be necessary as new data appear. Clinical considerations might justify a course of action at variance with these recommendations, but we suggest that the reasons for this be documented in the medical record. BSG guidelines are intended to be an educational device to provide information that might assist in providing care to patients. They are not rules and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care or as encouraging, advocating, requiring, or discouraging any particular treatment.

### Rifaximin has the potential to prevent complications of cirrhosis [^111G1zpS]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The post hoc nature of the analysis is a limitation, as the trial was powered for prevention of complications of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and was not powered to examine the efficacy of rifaximin for prevention of all complications or other individual complications of cirrhosis (e.g. spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [SBP]). In addition, only patients with a baseline Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of ≤ 25 were included in this study, thus excluding patients with more severe disease. The study was designed to assess rifaximin as secondary prophylaxis for overt HE and included patients who experienced at least two episodes of HE in the previous six months. Whether the number of baseline episodes of HE impacted the development of future episodes or other complications of cirrhosis remains unclear.

However, a post hoc analysis of a 24-month, open-label study examining rifaximin efficacy in the prevention of recurrence of overt HE, which included both patients from the study and newly enrolled patients, indicated that there was an association between the number of previous episodes of HE reported at baseline and an increased risk of additional episodes, particularly for patients with baseline MELD scores ≤ 10. In addition, non-HE complications of cirrhosis events were collected as part of the adverse events (AE) reporting in this analysis by the investigating physician, based on standard guidelines for diagnosing these events. Lastly, the analysis was restricted to six months of treatment, and thus the potential long-term impact of rifaximin on preventing the complications of cirrhosis remains to be elucidated.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^113hkunA]. Gut (2025). High credibility.

In these guidelines, we have described what we believe are the best strategies for managing patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), based on current knowledge. In Box 3, we propose diagnostic and management standards against which services could be audited. The organization of services for AIH in the UK and elsewhere could potentially be improved and, in Box 4, we make proposals for this. Finally, our understanding of AIH and its management remains incomplete; thus, in Box 5, we propose some priorities for clinical research.

- **Proposed standards for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis**:
	1. Most patients with AIH can be managed in their local hospital if their consultant has appropriate knowledge and experience.
	2. In each center, no more than three consultants (hepatologists, or gastroenterologists with a maintained interest in liver disease) should provide continuing care for patients with AIH.
	3. The roles of specialist nurses and associated care practitioners in caring for patients with AIH should be developed.
	4. Liver biopsies from patients with suspected AIH should be reported by a histopathologist with liver expertise and discussed at a clinical-pathological meeting.
	5. Departments should maintain a database of patients attending with AIH to facilitate audit and collaborative research.
	6. Regional AIH networks should be developed, similar to those in England for hepatitis C and primary biliary cholangitis. These should involve consultants, specialist nurses, and histopathologists with an interest in AIH.

Regarding the medical management of autoimmune hepatitis, particularly in managing treatment-related adverse events, the AASLD 2020 guidelines recommend initiating supplementation with elemental calcium (1,000–1,200 mg daily) and vitamin D (at least 400–800 IU daily) while on corticosteroid therapy. This is also advised as clinically indicated in patients with vitamin D insufficiency.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis, the AASLD 2020 guidelines recommend diagnosing AIH based on compatible histological findings. The diagnosis should be further supported by the following features:

- **Elevated serum aminotransferase levels**: Patients commonly present with increased levels of these enzymes, indicative of liver inflammation.

- **Elevated serum IgG level and/or positive serological markers**: Testing for elevated IgG levels and specific autoantibodies is crucial for confirming the diagnosis.

- **Exclusion of other diseases**: It is important to exclude viral, hereditary, metabolic, cholestatic, and drug-induced diseases that may resemble AIH to ensure an accurate diagnosis.

### Second-line agents in pediatric patients with autoimmune hepatitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1154Z1TX]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Ten percent to 20% of children with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) require second-line therapy to achieve remission. Although guidelines exist on first-line management, evidence for second-line therapy in treatment-refractory patients is lacking. Our aim was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of second-line treatments used in this population.

- **Methods**: Electronic and manual searches were used to identify potential studies for inclusion. Studies were selected based on reported response rates to second-line therapies in children who failed to respond to prednisone and azathioprine. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. Meta-analysis using a weighted estimate of response rates at 6 months was performed for each treatment option. Heterogeneity was assessed.

- **Results**: Fifteen studies involving 76 pediatric patients with AIH were included in the review. Overall response rates at 6 months were estimated as 36% for mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (N = 34, 95% confidence interval [CI] (16%-57%)), 50% for tacrolimus (N = 4, 95% CI (0%-100%)), and 83% for cyclosporine (N = 15, 95% CI (66%-100%)). Adverse effects were most frequent with cyclosporine (64% experiencing at least one adverse effect), followed by tacrolimus (54%), and MMF (48%). Pooled estimates of adverse events were 78% for cyclosporine (95% CI (54%-100%)), 42% for tacrolimus (95% CI (0%-85%)), and 45% for MMF (95% CI (25%-68%)). Sensitivity analyses were not performed due to small sample size.

- **Conclusions**: Cyclosporine had the highest response rate among the treatments studied. However, the high rate of adverse effects indicates the need for careful monitoring when using this medication in pediatric AIH patients. Further studies with larger sample sizes are required to validate these findings.

Intolerance to and side-effects of treatment

Corticosteroid side-effects are numerous and develop in up to 80% of patients receiving steroid monotherapy for more than 2 years, mainly at doses > 15 mg/day. However, corticosteroid discontinuation because of severe adverse events is observed in 15%. Combination with azathioprine is associated with a much lower rate of side-effects. In non-cirrhotic prednisolone responders who nevertheless develop side-effects, even though azathioprine has been increased to the highest dose, a switch to budesonide could be suggested.

Azathioprine side-effects occur in about 25% of AIH patients, accompanied by drug withdrawal in approximately 10–15%. In patients intolerant to or with side-effects from azathioprine (bone marrow suppression, nausea, vomiting, pancreatitis, etc), a switch to MMF (2 g/day) with subsequent prednisolone tapering appears to be an excellent alternative. Other alternatives are steroid monotherapy in patients with mild disease, budesonide, mercaptopurine or thioguanine, tacrolimus, ciclosporin, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, allopurinol, and biologic regimens, including tumor necrosis factor α (TNFa) blockade agents and rituximab.

- **Recommendations 51–54**:
	- In patients intolerant to azathioprine, MMF should be the second-line treatment (II-2).
	- Mercaptopurine or thioguanine could also be an alternative option (III).
	- If adequate conventional treatment with azathioprine cannot maintain remission in corticosteroid responders who nevertheless have severe steroid side-effects, switching to budesonide may be considered (II).

### Noninvasive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^111oCSAz]. Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a rare disease of unclear etiology characterized by the loss of self-tolerance that can lead to liver injury, cirrhosis, and acute liver failure. First-line treatment consists of systemic corticosteroids, budesonide, and azathioprine, to which most patients are initially responsive, although predictors of response are lacking. Relapses are very common, correlate with histological activity despite normal serum transaminases, and increase hepatic fibrosis. Furthermore, treatment regimens lead to adverse effects and reduced quality of life, while medication titration remains imprecise.

Biomarkers that can predict the clinical course of the disease, identify patients at elevated risk for relapse, and improve monitoring and medication dosing beyond current practice would have significant clinical value. Herein, we review novel candidate biomarkers in adult and pediatric AIH based on prespecified criteria, including gene expression profiles, proteins, metabolites, and immune cell phenotypes in different stages of AIH. We also discuss biomarkers relevant to AIH from other immune diseases. We conclude with proposed future directions in which biomarker implementation into clinical practice could lead to advances in personalized therapeutic management of AIH.

### Hellenic Association for the Study of the Liver clinical practice guidelines: Autoimmune hepatitis [^1135ziLa]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Relapse of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is defined as the reappearance of clinical or laboratory markers of active disease (ALT ≥ 2–3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or an increase in IgG, usually preceded by ALT elevation) after the achievement of complete remission during induction therapy, during maintenance therapy, or after complete discontinuation of treatment. In this context, liver biopsy is usually not recommended. Relapses are particularly frequent with conventional treatment schedules and typically occur 6–12 months after therapy cessation, although a relapse episode may even present many years later. Remission maintenance is generally associated with a rapid response to previous immunosuppression, steadily normal transaminases and/or IgG, higher baseline transaminases, no residual necroinflammatory activity on liver histology before treatment withdrawal, and longer treatment duration (≥ 4 years).

- **Recommendations 28–32**:
	- The optimal maintenance treatment should be corticosteroid-free monotherapy with azathioprine or, alternatively, MMF (II-2).
	- Low-dose long-term prednisolone monotherapy may be used to maintain remission only in patients with mild disease and azathioprine intolerance who have achieved complete response after induction therapy (II-2).
	- Maintenance therapy should be adjusted to a dosage that can maintain persistent biochemical response (normalization of AST, ALT, and IgG) (II-2).
	- Immunosuppression should be given for a total of at least 3 years, and for at least 2 years after the achievement of complete biochemical response (II-2).
	- Maintenance therapy should not be discontinued abruptly.

The approach detailed above is critical for the effective management of AIH, ensuring continued patient health and minimizing the risk of relapse.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^111426bB]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

In the 6-month phase III trial that compared rifaximin-α 550 mg with placebo for the prevention of OHE recurrence in patients in HE remission, more than 90% of whom were additionally treated with lactulose, the overall incidence of AEs was the same in both groups, and there were no significant between-group differences in the incidence of the most commonly reported AEs and serious AEs. In the 24-month open-label maintenance study that followed this trial, the incidences of total AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation were lower than those observed in the rifaximin and placebo arms of the original 6-month trial. In addition, long-term retrospective studies have shown a low incidence of AEs when rifaximin is added to lactulose therapy in clinical practice. As with nearly all antibacterial agents, C. difficile-associated diarrhea has been reported with rifaximin treatment. However, this has not emerged as a major safety concern following long-term treatment in clinical trials and in clinical practice studies.

HE is associated with a substantial economic burden, primarily because of the direct costs of hospitalization and rehospitalization following recurrence, and secondarily because of the indirect costs associated with outpatient care, disability, lost productivity, and the wider negative effect on the lives of patients' caregivers. As previously discussed, evidence for the long-term treatment of HE with rifaximin as an add-on to lactulose therapy demonstrates that it not only significantly decreases OHE recurrence in comparison with lactulose therapy alone but also may help in reducing the economic burden associated with the condition.

### Autoimmune hepatitis [^117TeezR]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis was one of the first liver diseases for which an effective treatment was developed, and the benefit was proven by randomized controlled trials. Nonetheless, both the diagnosis and the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis remain full of challenges. The clinical spectrum is very wide, ranging from subclinical non-progressive disease to fulminant hepatic failure. Diagnostic criteria based on the elevation of IgG, demonstration of characteristic autoantibodies, and histological features of hepatitis in the absence of viral disease are very helpful. However, in some patients, diagnosis remains a clinical challenge. Adequately dosed steroids are the mainstay of remission induction treatment, while remission maintenance is best achieved by azathioprine. Therapeutic alternatives are required in a small group of patients who respond insufficiently to these drugs or are intolerant to their side effects.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on the management of autoimmune hepatitis [^112mXut2]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of autoimmune hepatitis, specifically in the context of acute severe AIH, the EASL 2025 guidelines recommend the initiation of an early treatment trial with corticosteroids. Options include prednisolone or prednisolone at a dosage of 0.5–1 mg/kg/day, or intravenous methylprednisolone at an equivalent dose, for patients with acute severe AIH without acute liver failure (ALF) or acute-on-chronic liver failure. Patients who do not show improvement after 3–7 days of treatment should be referred to a liver transplant center.
