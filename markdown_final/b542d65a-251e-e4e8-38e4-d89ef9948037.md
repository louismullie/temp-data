## Question

Chronic hypoosmolar hyponatremia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about chronic hypoosmolar hyponatremia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining chronic hypoosmolar hyponatremia and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the clinical significance and risks, including neurologic complications and mortality. Next, I will review diagnostic classification by volume status and etiology. After that, I need to outline management principles, including when to treat and when not to treat, and the safe correction limits. Finally, I will examine specific therapies, monitoring, and special populations, and close with a practical algorithm and key takeaways, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Chronic hypoosmolar hyponatremia is typically defined as serum sodium less than 135 mEq/L with low measured plasma osmolality and duration longer than 48 hours, allowing time for cerebral adaptation via electrolyte and organic osmolyte loss, which explains why symptoms are often mild despite low sodium and why overly rapid correction risks osmotic demyelination syndrome [^114hmeK4] [^113E6Kdx].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical significance before assuming it is benign. Even mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait instability, falls, fractures, and increased mortality, and observational data suggest that improvement in sodium correlates with reduced mortality, although causality remains unproven and confounding is possible [^114hmeK4] [^115XadcF] [^116WdLtD].

> I need to check the diagnostic framework next. The first step is to confirm hypotonicity and exclude pseudohyponatremia and hypertonic states, then classify by volume status into hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic categories using clinical assessment and urine studies, with urine osmolality and urine sodium helping distinguish SIADH, hypovolemia, and edematous states, and with additional markers like fractional uric acid excretion or copeptin considered in select cases [^114hmeK4] [^116F8M1C] [^112q1gbT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment thresholds. I should confirm when to treat and when to observe. For asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic chronic hyponatremia, many guidelines advise treating the underlying cause and avoiding therapies aimed solely at raising sodium, reserving active correction for moderate to profound hyponatremia, symptomatic patients, or those at high risk such as those awaiting surgery or chemotherapy, while always balancing risks of overcorrection [^112tWFJx] [^112n6Umk] [^114x8Haf].

> I should double-check the safe correction limits because these are easy to misstate. For chronic hyponatremia, the general target is to limit the rise to about 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours, with more conservative targets of 6–8 mmol/L in 24 hours for high-risk patients such as those with liver disease, alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, or hypokalemia, and if overcorrection occurs, prompt relowering with desmopressin and/or D5W is recommended to mitigate osmotic demyelination risk [^11621z9d] [^116JUkNn] [^115CxKiL].

> Let me consider first-line therapy for chronic euvolemic hyponatremia, especially SIADH. Fluid restriction to about 1,000 mL/day is standard, but I need to ensure I note its limitations: adherence is often poor, thirst is common, and predictors of failure include urine osmolality greater than 500 mOsm/kg and a high sum of urine sodium plus potassium relative to serum sodium, prompting early consideration of second-line options if sodium fails to rise adequately [^114MVSuY] [^114FHDD2].

> Next, I should review second-line therapies and their trade-offs. Oral urea at 0.25–0.5 g/kg/day increases free water excretion with low risk of overcorrection but has palatability and GI tolerance issues, vasopressin receptor antagonists like tolvaptan are effective but carry a risk of overly rapid correction and require close monitoring, and loop diuretics combined with salt tablets can be useful in selected cases, with emerging interest in SGLT2 inhibitors though high-quality RCT data are pending [^114hmeK4] [^113jQ15H] [^1136umZP].

> I will now examine hypovolemic and hypervolemic chronic hyponatremia. For hypovolemia, isotonic saline is appropriate to restore effective arterial blood volume and suppress vasopressin, whereas for hypervolemic states such as heart failure or cirrhosis, fluid restriction and disease-directed therapy are key, with hypertonic saline reserved for severe symptoms or special contexts like imminent transplantation, and correction targets in cirrhosis are particularly conservative to avoid ODS [^114hmeK4] [^112UXSyW] [^1164gdyE].

> But wait, what if the patient is profoundly hyponatremic and symptomatic at presentation. I should confirm that even in chronic cases, severe neurologic symptoms warrant emergent hypertonic saline boluses to raise sodium by about 4–6 mmol/L rapidly to mitigate cerebral edema, then transition to slow, guideline-concordant correction once initial improvement occurs, with frequent sodium checks and readiness to relower if overcorrection is detected [^114hmeK4] [^111yoz7p] [^115CxKiL].

> I need to ensure monitoring is explicit. During active correction, sodium should be measured frequently, often every 6 hours initially, with hourly urine output monitoring to anticipate aquaresis, and in severe cases, after each hypertonic bolus, with a low threshold to use desmopressin proactively if the rise is too fast or unpredictable [^111czwib] [^116z6Voi] [^115CxKiL].

> Let me reconsider special populations and nuances. In liver disease, keep correction limits especially low and avoid vaptans in hypovolemia or impaired thirst, in older adults the risks of falls and fractures strengthen the case for cautious correction, and in pregnancy, physiologic changes complicate interpretation, so individualized decisions and specialist input are prudent [^1164gdyE] [^114hmeK4] [^115DeVRg].

> Next, I should review a practical algorithm to tie this together. Confirm hypotonicity and classify by volume status, assess symptoms and chronicity, treat the underlying cause and stop offending drugs, choose observation versus active correction based on severity and risk, if treating use fluid restriction first with early escalation if failing, apply safe correction limits with proactive monitoring and a plan to relower if needed, and reassess frequently for response and adverse effects [^114hmeK4] [^116JUkNn] [^115CxKiL].

> In summary, I need to emphasize that chronic hypoosmolar hyponatremia is not benign and carries neurologic and mortality risks, yet its management hinges on slow, controlled correction anchored to etiology and patient risk, with fluid restriction as foundational therapy for SIADH and second-line options like urea or vaptans when restriction fails or is not tolerated, all while vigilantly avoiding overcorrection and being prepared to relower sodium if limits are exceeded [^114hmeK4] [^116WdLtD] [^116JUkNn].

Chronic hypoosmolar hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium < 135 mmol/L with low plasma osmolality persisting > 48 hours [^116SLGfd]. It is most often due to SIADH, heart failure, cirrhosis, or thiazides, and is associated with **increased falls, fractures, and cognitive impairment** even when mild [^114hmeK4] [^116WdLtD]. Management centers on **treating the cause**, fluid restriction, and cautious correction to avoid osmotic demyelination; limit rise to ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 h in high-risk patients, and ≤ 10–12 mmol/L in 24 h otherwise [^116JUkNn] [^11621z9d]. Use hypertonic saline only for severe symptoms, and monitor sodium every 6 hours during active correction [^114hmeK4] [^114Mqs3L].

---

## Pathophysiology

Chronic hypoosmolar hyponatremia reflects **excess water relative to solute**, driven by impaired free water excretion from persistent vasopressin activity or reduced effective arterial blood volume [^114RpkPA]. The brain adapts by exporting inorganic ions and organic osmolytes, which restores brain volume but increases vulnerability to rapid correction [^113E6Kdx].

---

## Etiology

Common causes include:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Euvolemic | - SIADH (malignancy, CNS disease, drugs) [^11183jyJ] <br/> - Hypothyroidism <br/> - Adrenal insufficiency [^114hmeK4] |
| Hypervolemic | - Heart failure <br/> - Cirrhosis <br/> - Nephrotic syndrome [^114hmeK4] |
| Hypovolemic | - Gastrointestinal losses <br/> - Diuretics (especially thiazides) <br/> - Salt-wasting nephropathies [^114hmeK4] |

---

## Clinical manifestations

Symptoms are often subtle and include:

- **Neurologic**: cognitive impairment, gait instability, falls, dysarthria, lethargy [^114hmeK4] [^116WdLtD].
- **Musculoskeletal**: osteoporosis, fractures [^114hmeK4] [^1173dQKV].
- **Severe complications**: osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) if corrected too rapidly [^114hmeK4] [^113E6Kdx].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Confirm hypotonicity**: measure serum osmolality, exclude pseudohyponatremia and hypertonic states [^116F8M1C].
- **Classify volume status**: clinical exam and urine sodium/osmolality guide etiology [^116F8M1C].
- **Identify cause**: review medications, endocrine testing, imaging as indicated [^114hmeK4].

---

## Management principles

- **Treat underlying cause**: remove offending drugs, correct endocrine deficits, manage heart failure/cirrhosis [^112n6Umk] [^114hmeK4].
- **Fluid restriction**: first-line for SIADH and hypervolemic states; typically 800–1,000 mL/day [^114MVSuY] [^114FHDD2].
- **Increase solute intake**: oral urea (30–60 g/day) or salt tablets with loop diuretics if restriction fails [^113jQ15H] [^114FHDD2].
- **Vasopressin antagonists (vaptans)**: consider for SIADH or hypervolemic hyponatremia; monitor closely for overcorrection [^114hmeK4] [^1114uqkz].
- **Hypertonic saline**: reserve for severe symptoms (seizures, coma); small boluses (100 mL 3%) with frequent monitoring [^114hmeK4] [^111yoz7p].

---

## Correction limits and monitoring

- **General limit**: ≤ 10–12 mmol/L in 24 h [^116JUkNn].
- **High-risk patients**: ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 h (alcoholism, malnutrition, liver disease, hypokalemia) [^116JUkNn] [^116z6Voi].
- **Monitoring**: check sodium every 6 hours during active correction; monitor urine output for aquaresis [^114Mqs3L] [^116z6Voi].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the cause, severity, and correction strategy. Chronic hyponatremia is linked to **increased mortality, falls, and cognitive decline**, and overly rapid correction risks **permanent neurologic injury from ODS** [^114hmeK4] [^113E6Kdx].

---

Chronic hypoosmolar hyponatremia is a common, often subtle disorder with significant morbidity. Careful etiologic diagnosis, **slow correction within safe limits**, and targeted therapy are essential to improve outcomes and avoid iatrogenic harm [^114hmeK4] [^116JUkNn].

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^115evmgn]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains. The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^114CwAdv]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

Guidelines of hyponatraemia treatment

Hypotonic hyponatraemia is a clinical state where there is a relative excess of water to sodium content in the extracellular fluid. Acute hyponatraemia is clinically important as it can cause significant morbidity and mortality associated with rapid development of symptomatic cerebral oedema. Prompt treatment to raise the serum sodium concentration in this setting is life-saving. Chronic hyponatraemia, even if asymptomatic, is associated with many adverse outcomes including prolonged hospitalisation, gait instability, falls, fractures, and increased bone loss. Diverse strategies to correct chronic hyponatraemia have been recommended and success of such treatment is dependent on the underlying aetiology for hyponatraemia. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatraemia may trigger an osmotic demyelination syndrome resulting in serious neurological deficits and death.

The methodological quality of guideline development and consensus statements can be assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) process. This tool is used to systematically evaluate six guideline domains including scope, stakeholder involvement, editorial independence, rigour of development, clarity, and applicability. Nagler et al. identified five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements after a comprehensive search of English and non-English publications, guideline databases, and professional society websites. Their recommendations differed with respect to classification of hyponatraemia, diagnostic tests, doses of saline to use for correction, limits for the rise in serum sodium concentration, and the most appropriate second line therapies for management. The overall quality of these publications (measured by the AGREE tool) was mixed.

Should we be surprised that individual hyponatraemia guidelines "failed" this test of quality? Arguably, the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia cannot be subjected to this sort of rigorous analysis because of the low level of evidence available to help various expert panels and guideline groups write internationally consistent advice. For example, hyponatraemia occurring within 48 hours is an arbitrary cut-off for determining the presence of acute hyponatraemia, the desired rate of correction for hyponatraemia in most settings is not universally agreed, availability of certain recommended therapies is country dependent and impacted by differing regulatory indications for drugs, and even the biochemical threshold for defining hyponatraemia varies widely in the literature. Furthermore, many of the clinical algorithms require initial assessment of the extracellular fluid volume to determine if a hyponatraemic patient is hypovolaemic, euvolaemic, or hypervolaemic. In practice, this physical examination of fluid balance can be subject to misinterpretation if the clinical signs are subtle.

### Mild chronic hyponatremia in the ambulatory setting: significance and management [^115rvcWm]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Mild chronic hyponatremia, as defined by a persistent (> 72 hours) plasma sodium concentration between 125 and 135 mEq/L without apparent symptoms, is common in ambulatory patients and generally perceived as being inconsequential. The association between increased mortality and hyponatremia in hospitalized patients in various settings and etiologies is widely recognized. This review analyzes the significance of mild chronic hyponatremia in ambulatory subjects and its effects on mortality and morbidity. It addresses whether this disorder should even be treated and if so, which patients are likely to benefit from treatment. The available approaches to correct hyponatremia in such patients in the context of recently published panel-generated recommendations and guidelines are described.

### Management of chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting [^117F2NEf]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation and management of chronic hyponatremia in outpatients can be challenging for several reasons. First, chronic hyponatremia is often mild, leading to uncertainty about whether it is clinically significant and warrants further diagnostic evaluation and treatment. Second, if the initial diagnostic workup does not identify a clear cause, it becomes uncertain how much further investigation is required. Third, when no clear cause is found or the underlying condition cannot be treated, physicians may struggle to choose the most appropriate treatment approach. This review offers practical guidance to navigate these challenges in managing chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116Dh6zX]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^11183jyJ]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of Chronic Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis

There is little high-level evidence to guide chronic SIAD treatment because of the difficulty of conducting randomized trials due to the heterogeneity of patients with this condition, severity of illness that makes placebo therapy ethically difficult, and the potential for resolution of conditions perpetuating the nonosmotic release of AVP, which can confound trials of SIAD treatments. However, this tendency for "autocorrection" of hyponatremia due to SIAD, if caused by a reversible underlying condition, makes rigorous RCTs even more important to confirm any apparent benefits in observational studies. A 2017 systematic review of chronic hyponatremia treatments did not identify RCTs of any treatments other than vaptans, but since then new RCTs have emerged. Published RCTs of therapies for chronic hypotonic hyponatremia to date are summarized in Table 6.

### Recent developments in the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia [^1114uqkz]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of the study is to review recent studies on the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia.

Recent Findings

In acute symptomatic hyponatremia, bolus infusion of hypertonic saline improves hyponatremia and neurological status more quickly than continuous infusion. In chronic hyponatremia, newly identified predictors of nonresponse to fluid restriction include a high urine osmolality (> 500mOsm/kg) and high urine sodium (> 133mmol/l). Vasopressin-receptor antagonists effectively raise the serum sodium concentration in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia but have a risk of overcorrection, even at low doses. Several observational studies now support the use of urea for a more gradual correction of hyponatremia without a risk of overcorrection. Recently identified risk factors for overcorrection include lower serum sodium at presentation, polydipsia, hypovolemia, and early urine output during treatment. Specific treatments with potential efficacy are the use of intravenous albumin for hyponatremia because of liver cirrhosis, and fludrocortisone for hyponatremia in tuberculous meningitis.

Summary

The recent data will help to further optimize and personalize the management of patients with acute and chronic hyponatremia. However, most data are still observational and retrospective. Therefore, the field is in need of prospective studies comparing interventions for chronic hyponatremia and focusing on patient-relevant outcomes.

### The management of acute and chronic hyponatraemia [^117T26KB]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte abnormality encountered in clinical practice; despite this, the work-up and management of hyponatraemia remain suboptimal and varies among different specialist groups. The majority of data comparing hyponatraemia treatments have been observational, up until recently. The past two years have seen the publication of several randomised control trials investigating hyponatraemia treatments, both for chronic and acute hyponatraemia. In this article, we aim to provide a background to the physiology, cause and impact of hyponatraemia and summarise the most recent data on treatments for acute and chronic hyponatraemia, highlighting their efficacy, tolerability and adverse effects.

Chronic Hyponatremia

In chronic hyponatremia of duration greater than 48 hours, the brain adapts to a lower pNa, with a corresponding reduction in brain tissue osmolality, because of an influx of water and export of osmolytes (see Fig. 3). Chronic hyponatremia was previously considered to be "asymptomatic", but it is now recognized that while severe symptoms may be absent, it can be associated with cognitive impairment, falls, fractures, plus vulnerability to acute exacerbations of hyponatremia. Clinical features associated with chronic hyponatremia may include nausea, vertigo, confusion, muscle cramps, weakness, headache, restlessness, dysarthria, and hyporeflexia. There is preclinical evidence to suggest that cellular function, for example, enzymatic activity, is compromised when intracellular osmolality is reduced. Furthermore, the intracellular organic osmolytes that become depleted in chronic hyponatremia can play a vital role in neurotransmission and protein synthesis, factors that may explain clinical sequelae of chronic hyponatremia.

The evidence linking clinical symptoms to chronic hyponatremia is largely observational, and there is no prospective interventional study to demonstrate conclusively that correction of chronic hyponatremia, which is commonly biochemically mild, can improve such features. The literature is potentially further confounded by the fact that clinical features attributable to hyponatremia are nonspecific and have a relatively high background prevalence in the normonatremic population. Observational studies can never fully adjust for confounders, and reverse causality remains a possibility, meaning that hyponatremia may be a marker of poor health, rather than a pathogenic mediator. Likewise, there is a recognized association between chronic hyponatremia and increased mortality, though causation, or the direction thereof, is not yet established. For some of these chronic hyponatremia-associated clinical features, there is mechanistic evidence from preclinical studies supporting biologic plausibility, as discussed later.

### Hyponatremia demystified: integrating physiology to shape clinical practice [^112q1gbT]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is one of the most common problems encountered in clinical practice and one of the least-understood because accurate diagnosis and management require some familiarity with water homeostasis physiology, making the topic seemingly complex. The prevalence of hyponatremia depends on the nature of the population studied and the criteria used to define it. Hyponatremia is associated with poor outcomes including increased mortality and morbidity. The pathogenesis of hypotonic hyponatremia involves the accumulation of electrolyte-free water caused by either increased intake and/or decrease in kidney excretion. Plasma osmolality, urine osmolality, and urine sodium can help to differentiate among the different etiologies. Brain adaptation to plasma hypotonicity consisting of solute extrusion to mitigate further water influx into brain cells best explains the clinical manifestations of hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia has an onset within 48 hours, commonly resulting in severe symptoms, while chronic hyponatremia develops over 48 hours and usually is pauci-symptomatic. However, the latter increases the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome if hyponatremia is corrected rapidly; therefore, extreme caution must be exercised when correcting plasma sodium. Management strategies depend on the presence of symptoms and the cause of hyponatremia and are discussed in this review.

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P < .01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P < .004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

Randomized controlled trials in management of chronic hypotonic hyponatremia

Current guideline-directed management of hyponatremia is largely based on expert opinion and is expected to evolve with new evidence over the coming years. Trials are currently in progress comparing protocolized low-dose tolvaptan vs FR in SIAD, and evaluating empagliflozin in inpatients and outpatients with euvolemic and hypervolemic chronic hyponatremia (NCT04447911). Despite controversies in approach, there is retrospective evidence that active management of inpatients with hyponatremia by specialist physicians (endocrinologists or nephrologists, depending on local practice) may improve mortality and reduce length of hospital stay. This was reported in an audit of a single Irish center over a 5-year period from 2005 to 2010, that found increasing rates of specialist referral (32%-68%) and use of active hyponatremia management strategies for pNa less than 120 mmol/L (63%-88%) was associated with a 91% reduction in mortality risk (P < .001). A UK single-center study compared 18 individuals with hyponatremia less than 127 mmol/L (mean pNa 120.7 mmol/L) who received prompt endocrine specialist input with 23 historical controls (mean Na 124.1 mmol/L), observing faster time to achieving a sodium increase of 5 mmol/L or greater (3.5 days vs 7.1 days; P = 0.005), and reduced length of stay in the intervention group (10.9 vs 14.5 days; P = 0.004). A large Swiss multicenter international RCT, currently recruiting, has been designed to definitively evaluate the hypothesis that correction of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients reduces the risk of death or rehospitalization (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03557957).

It is worth noting that chronic mild-moderate hyponatremia due to a reset osmostat may not be amenable to correction when compared to other causes of SIAD — as due to increased thirst above the new osmotic set point, FR, and other therapies are unlikely to be effective.

Potential treatments for hyponatremia in SIAD are discussed and evaluated next, and a proposed management algorithm based on best available current evidence is summarized in Fig. 10.

### Approach to the patient: hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^115bV1Sk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance seen in clinical practice, affecting up to 30% of acute hospital admissions, and is associated with significant adverse clinical outcomes. Acute or severe symptomatic hyponatremia carries a high risk of neurological morbidity and mortality. In contrast, chronic hyponatremia is associated with significant morbidity including increased risk of falls, osteoporosis, fractures, gait instability, and cognitive decline; prolonged hospital admissions; and etiology-specific increase in mortality. In this Approach to the Patient, we review and compare the current recommendations, guidelines, and literature for diagnosis and treatment options for both acute and chronic hyponatremia, illustrated by 2 case studies. Particular focus is concentrated on the diagnosis and management of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. An understanding of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia, along with a synthesis of the duration of hyponatremia, biochemical severity, symptomatology, and blood volume status, forms the structure to guide the appropriate and timely management of hyponatremia. We present 2 illustrative cases that represent common presentations with hyponatremia and discuss the approach to management of these and other causes of hyponatremia.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of severely symptomatic patients, initial management, AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend to limit sodium correction to 8 mEq/L over 24 hours in patients with chronic hyponatremia at increased risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. Limit sodium correction to 12 mEq/L over 24 hours and 18 mEq/L over 48 hours in patients without risk factors to minimize the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^116F8M1C]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

Severity

Hyponatremia is considered as severe if [Na] is < 115 or 110 mmol/L. In addition, all cases of hyponatremia treated with hypertonic or isotonic saline infusion, including hypovolemia with hyponatremia and absence of overt neurological manifestations, should be considered as severe because of the risks from saline infusion. Saline infusion for hypovolemic hyponatremia carries arguably the highest risk of inadvertently rapid rise in[Na].

Target Serum Sodium Concentration

The targeted rise in [Na] depends on the perceived urgency of treatment. In patients with pronounced hyponatremic symptoms, regardless of chronicity, a rapid rise of 4 to 6 mEq/L is recommended. Further rises may be required if symptoms persist after the initial rise in [Na]. For chronic hyponatremia, previous recommendations set a maximal rate of rise in [Na] at 12 mEq/L in the first 24 hours and a maximal final [Na] of 125 to 130 mEq/L. Because osmotic myelinolysis was observed in patients achieving the desired rate of rise in [Na], the current target rise in [Na] is set at 6 to 8 mEq/L in 24 hours, 12 to 14 mEq/L in 48 hours, and 14 to 16 mEq/L in 72 hours. Prevention of hypernatremia during treatment of hyponatremia is imperative.

Pathogenetic Mechanism, Chronicity

Establishing the pathogenetic mechanism of hyponatremia requires a detailed history that includes medications and drinking habits, physical examination with emphasis on neurological and respiratory signs and on volume status, and serum plus urine laboratory testing. The first step in the differential diagnosis consists of eliminating hypertonic hyponatremia and pseudohyponatremia.,

True (hypotonic) hyponatremia results from inability to excrete water loads, usual or excessive. Serum vasopressin is higher than is appropriate for the [Na] in most instances. Hyponatremia with inappropriately high serum vasopressin levels can be hypovolemic (ie, body water losses relatively lower than sodium losses), euvolemic (ie, body water excess often with some sodium loss), or hypervolemic (ie, water gain in excess of sodium gain).

Hypovolemic hyponatremia presents special challenges. Previous diagnosis of a hypervolemic state, such as congestive heart failure, complicates the diagnosis. The pattern of urinary chemistries (low sodium concentration and high osmolality) is indistinguishable between hypovolemic hyponatremia from extrarenal causes and hypervolemic hyponatremia. Both conditions lead to vasopressin secretion. The differential diagnosis is based on careful history and clinical examination. Cautious volume replacement may help when the diagnosis of hypovolemia is doubtful. Thirst from hypovolemia may increase the water load, and alterations in renal circulation may contribute to the decreased renal ability to excrete water.

From a pathophysiological perspective, the loss of brain organic osmolytes occurs with greater chronicity of hyponatremia. – Unfortunately, this cannot be determined using existing clinical tools, but a recognition of this fact is essential in understanding potential deleterious aspects of treatment. History, prior measurements of [Na], and the neurological picture at presentation are the only available clinical criteria for determining chronicity. Acute hyponatremia exhibits pronounced brain cell swelling and more severe symptoms but lower risk of osmotic myelinolysis after rapid correction of the [Na], compared with chronic hyponatremia with a similar [Na] value. It is believed that the risk of myelinolysis is greatest where organic osmolyte recovery lags, and in humans, this area is usually the pons. However, chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurological manifestations. When doubt exists, it is safer to consider hyponatremia as chronic.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte abnormality affecting hospitalized patients. 1 It is an independent predictor for mortality and is associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher costs. The most serious potential complication is hyponatremic encephalopathy, a medical emergency that can result in death or irreversible brain injury if inadequately treated. 2 Hypertonic saline is a safe and effective means of correcting hyponatremia. 2–4 A rare yet serious complication from excessive correction of chronic hyponatremia is the development of cerebral demyelination.

### Management of hyponatremia [^111duo5q]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is an important electrolyte abnormality with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Common causes include medications and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Hyponatremia can be classified according to the volume status of the patient as hypovolemic, hypervolemic, or euvolemic. Hypervolemic hyponatremia may be caused by congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. Differentiating between euvolemia and hypovolemia can be clinically difficult, but a useful investigative aid is measurement of plasma osmolality. Hyponatremia with a high plasma osmolality is caused by hyperglycemia, while a normal plasma osmolality indicates pseudohyponatremia or the post-transurethral prostatic resection syndrome. The urinary sodium concentration helps in diagnosing patients with low plasma osmolality. High urinary sodium concentration in the presence of low plasma osmolality can be caused by renal disorders, endocrine deficiencies, reset osmostat syndrome, SIADH, and medications. Low urinary sodium concentration is caused by severe burns, gastrointestinal losses, and acute water overload. Management includes instituting immediate treatment in patients with acute severe hyponatremia because of the risk of cerebral edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment, with demeclocycline therapy reserved for use in persistent cases. Rapid correction should be avoided to reduce the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. Loop diuretics are useful in managing edematous hyponatremic states and chronic SIADH. In all instances, identifying the cause of hyponatremia remains an integral part of the treatment plan.

Conclusion

Accurate diagnosis of the cause, pathogenesis and chronicity, and monitoring during treatment are the critical parts of the management of severe hyponatremias.

Approaches to treatment for hyponatremia

Table 3 shows the recommendations for the medical management of hyponatremia. Guidance documents distinguished treatment scenarios based on whether patients had severe symptoms or whether the hyponatremia was acute (48 h) or chronic. All but one discussed treatment in the setting of severe symptoms and recommended infusion of hypertonic saline, usually specified as having a concentration of 3%. One suggested using a formula to guide the infusion speed of a continuous infusion, five others recommended giving a fixed dose, or a dose adjusted to body weight with repeated serum sodium concentration measurements to check progression.

Patients without symptoms of hyponatremia were assumed to have chronic onset hyponatremia, and treatment suggestions were mostly dependent on the classification hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Only three guidance documents specifically advised treating the underlying condition. Seven suggested 0.9% saline in hypovolemia, with infusion speeds calculated with Adrogué-Madias, until restoration of blood pressure or until nasogastric rehydration could start.

For euvolemic asymptomatic hyponatremia, the majority recommended fluid restriction as the first-line treatment. Five guidance documents proposed a number of other interventions as second-line treatments including loop diuretics, demeclocycline, urea, vasopressin receptor antagonists, or lithium. One guideline specifically recommended against vasopressin receptor antagonists in case of a serum sodium concentration < 125 mmol/L.

### Consequences of inadequate management of hyponatremia [^1126XXxi]. American Journal of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Dilutional hyponatremia is a commonly observed disorder in hospitalized patients. It represents an excess of water in relation to prevailing sodium stores and is most often associated with a high plasma level of arginine vasopressin, including that found in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Hyponatremia may be classified as either acute or chronic depending on the rate of decline of serum sodium concentration, and can lead to a wide range of deleterious changes involving almost all body systems. Serious complications of dilutional hyponatremia most frequently involve the central nervous system. In fact, acute severe hyponatremia is potentially life-threatening and must be treated promptly and aggressively. Chronic hyponatremia often develops in patients with nonrenal diseases and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In patients hospitalized for congestive heart failure, hyponatremia is linked to a poor prognosis and increased length of hospital stay. Prompt recognition and optimal management of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients may reduce in-hospital mortality and symptom severity, allow for less intensive hospital care, decrease the duration of hospitalization and associated costs, and improve the treatment of underlying comorbid conditions and patients' quality of life. The proper treatment of dilutional hyponatremia, especially when chronic, must avoid increasing serum sodium too rapidly, which can lead to permanent or fatal neurologic sequelae. The treatment of hyponatremia may be facilitated by emerging therapies that block the actions of arginine vasopressin at V2 and V1a receptors to promote aquaresis, the electrolyte-sparing elimination of free water, and elevate serum sodium concentrations.

Management Protocol

Table 5 summarizes the management of hyponatremia with saline infusion. Closed system formulas (formulas 2 to 7) provide estimates of the required saline volume and allow comparison between desired and observed changes in [Na] and, therefore, provide the frame for identifying the source of their deviations and the guide for appropriate treatment changes. The first aim of treatment is to avoid undercorrection of hyponatremia. Prescription of the volume of saline infused by formula 4 or 6 is suitable for this purpose. Monitoring is critical when saline is infused, particularly in hypovolemic hyponatremia in which water diuresis, overestimation of initial body water, and initial focusing on volume rather than tonicity issues complicate the treatment. Monitoring, with reduced frequency of [Na] measurement (usually once daily), is essential during treatment of hyponatremia without saline infusion.

Table 5.
Steps of the Management of Severe Hyponatremia

Many tests, especially urine chemistries and osmolality, cannot be obtained rapidly from all hospital laboratories. For this and other reasons, administration, along with saline, of loop diuretics (eg, furosemide) to make urine free water excretion more predictable may be helpful in managing hypovolemic hyponatremia. Although furosemide will initially increase urinary sodium and potassium excretion, it is reasonable to assume that the sum of urine sodium plus potassium concentration is equal to ≈75 mEq/L when a furosemide effect is present, at least until direct laboratory measurements are available. Because patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia have reduced total body sodium and probably water, care must be taken to replace more than the predicted urinary electrolyte and water losses with infused saline.

Vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists may ultimately be extremely useful for treating complicated chronic hyponatremias. However, it is unclear how to best use these new agents at present. It is fair to say that the vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists appear to be very effective in the settings of heart failure, cirrhosis, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and safe when administered as monotherapy. – Unfortunately, these agents are currently extremely expensive. Moreover, we would stress that these agents should be avoided during saline infusion to prevent the hazards of excessive water diuresis.

### Diagnosis and management of disorders of body tonicity-hyponatremia and hypernatremia: core curriculum 2020 [^114RpkPA]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Overall body fluid concentration is regulated within a narrow range by the concerted action of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to influence water intake through thirst and water excretion via the effect of vasopressin, or antidiuretic hormone, on renal collecting duct water permeability. Sodium is the principal extracellular cation; abnormalities in overall effective body fluid concentration, or tonicity, manifest as disturbances in serum sodium concentration. Depending on its severity and chronicity, hyponatremia can lead to significant symptoms, primarily related to central nervous system function. Failure to correct hyponatremia can lead to permanent neurologic damage, as can over rapid correction. It is thus essential to stay within specific limits for correction, particularly for chronic hyponatremia. Hypernatremia also leads to central nervous system dysfunction, although goals for its correction rate are less well established. This Core Curriculum article discusses the normal regulation of tonicity and serum sodium concentration and the diagnosis and management of hypo- and hypernatremia.

### The management of acute and chronic hyponatraemia [^114x8Haf]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Acute symptomatic hyponatraemia is a medical emergency, and current practice guidelines have adapted to recommend the use of bolus hypertonic saline in this setting; however recent trial data have emphasised that caution must be taken to prevent overcorrection when the duration of hyponatraemia is unclear. Chronic asymptomatic hyponatraemia is traditionally thought of as clinically benign and is thus often underinvestigated and undertreated. Traditional treatments for SIAD have been limited to date by poor efficacy, side-effects, cost or lack of supportive randomised control trial data. The past two years have seen the publication of several much-needed prospective randomised controlled trials that have demonstrated modest effects of fluid restriction in patients with chronic SIAD, albeit with good tolerability and safety, thereby emphasising the need for second-line therapies. Cost-reduction, more widespread reimbursement and use of a lower starting dose may allow expansion of the use of tolvaptan in treatment of SIAD. Recent studies have also given cause for optimism for potential future treatments such as empagliflozin; an RCT examining use of the drug in chronic euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatraemia is underway.

Treatment of hyponatraemia must be individualised to the patient, taking into account the acuity and cause of hyponatraemia, the indications for treatment, and treatment goals. For example, it is reasonable to consider an initial trial of fluid restriction in an asymptomatic patient with incidentally noted chronic SIAD. On the other hand, correction of hyponatraemia may be more urgent in patients awaiting chemotherapy for example, and in this scenario early consideration of a low dose of dose of tolvaptan (7.5 mg) is appropriate.

It is becoming increasingly clear that treatment of chronic hyponatraemia is associated with reduction in length of hospital stay, improvements in gait and mentation, and a reduction in mortality. Mortality rates associated with hyponatraemia have been shown to differ according to volume status, and this should be considered when designing and interpreting future outcome studies. Prospective studies, employing effective treatments that will increase plasma sodium concentration by a clinically significant amount, in a large enough cohort to classify patients by volume status, are required to confirm the long-term clinical benefits of chronic hyponatraemia treatment.

Figure 7.
Principles of management of acute vs chronic hyponatremia, and potential risks. Intensity of shading is a visual representation of osmolality. In acute hyponatremia, cerebral osmolar adaptation has not yet occurred so it is acceptable to allow (or induce) rapid correction of serum sodium, with low risk of ODS. We advocate a cutoff of hyponatremia duration less than 24 hours rather than 48 hours to maximize the safety of this approach. In hyponatremia with severe symptoms of any (or unknown) duration, emergency management with bolus hypertonic saline is indicated to prevent progression of potentially life-threatening cerebral edema (see "Emergency Management of Severe Hyponatremia"). Once the target initial increment of serum sodium rise is achieved (eg, 4–6 mmol/L) and/or if symptoms improve, ongoing correction is determined by duration of hyponatremia. If duration is unknown, it is safest to assume it to be chronic and aim for gradual correction. In chronic hyponatremia, gradual correction of serum sodium allows for restoration of brain tissue osmolality toward the normal range with the import or synthesis of osmolytes (sodium, potassium, organic osmolytes as discussed in Fig. 3), and slow exit of excess intracellular water. The typical target rate of correction is 5 to 8 mmol/L per 24 hours, or lower for those with risk factors for ODS. If rapid correction of serum sodium above the target rate occurs (overcorrection, eg, > 10 mmol/L within 24 hours), it is advised to relower serum sodium (eg, with IV dextrose 5%, and/or desmopressin (DDAVP), see "In Case of Overcorrection: Relowering of Plasma Sodium" below) to prevent the rare complication of ODS. ODS can occur as a consequence of rapid exit of intracellular water damaging the myelin sheath, particularly in the pons, and can cause devastating neurological outcomes or death. Onset of symptoms of ODS is often delayed. Subsequent correction after relowering should be gradual.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^112GCSuE]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia (HN), defined as a serum sodium concentration ([Na +]) below the lower limit of normal, is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospitalized patients, with a prevalence as high as 30–42%. HN is independently associated with mortality in congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, and hospitalized patients in general, and with increased hospital costs and readmission rates. Chronic HN has been linked to impaired gait and balance, increased falls and fracture rates, and osteoporosis. However, a causal role of HN for these associations is largely unproven.

Correction of severe HN of sudden onset can be genuinely lifesaving, and treatment of chronic HN associated with neurological symptoms is undeniably beneficial. Despite the widespread clinical impression that correction of less severe chronic HN is also worthwhile, evidence-based data demonstrating clinical benefit are limited.,

Hypovolemic HN responds readily to volume repletion. Until recently, treatment of hypervolemic HN has been limited to fluid restriction (FR) and correction of the underlying disorder. Treatment modalities for euvolemic HN have included FR, hypertonic saline (HS), loop diuretics, demeclocycline, and urea. With the approval of the vasopressin-receptor antagonists conivaptan and tolvaptan, more targeted treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic HN became available. It remains uncertain how treatment options are employed, and how correction magnitude and incidence of adverse outcomes are affected by the type of therapy. With this background, the multinational HN Registry was initiated to assess the current state of treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic HN in diverse, real-world hospital settings. Its specific purpose was to determine which diagnostic and treatment modalities are currently employed, how effective they are, and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in [Na +]. An additional goal was to determine which treatments posed the greatest risk of overly rapid correction and osmotic demyelination.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^117RCyx2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyponatremia represents a serious health hazard. Hospitalized patients, nursing home residents, women, – and childrenexhibit high frequency and/or severity of hyponatremia. Hyponatremia developing during the course of other morbid conditions increases their severity. – Estimates of direct costs for treating hyponatremia in the United States ranged between $1.61 and $3.6 billion.

Clinical manifestations of hyponatremia are universal – and range from subtle (disturbances of balance, problems in cognition detected only during specific testing) to life‐threatening manifestations of increased intracranial pressure with life‐threatening hypoxia – and noncardiac pulmonary edema. Although the treating physicians must make an accurate diagnosis based on well‐established and described clinical criteria, treatment is also guided by the severity of these manifestations. The magnitude and rate of increase in serum sodium concentration ([Na]) during treatment are critical. Overcorrection of chronic hyponatremia may lead to osmotic myelinolysis, – whereas undercorrection may fail to prevent life‐threatening manifestations.

The mainstays of treatment are restricted free water intake and saline infusion, with or without furosemide. There are 2 indications for saline infusion in hyponatremia. Overt manifestations of hyponatremia are treated with hypertonic saline, whereas symptomatic hypovolemia associated with hyponatremia without overt symptoms is usually treated with isotonic saline. – In both situations, the infusion of saline results in rising [Na]. This rise can be slower or faster than desired, with potentially dire clinical consequences.

To achieve the desired rise in [Na], several formulas, most often the Adrogue–Madias formula, are used to calculate volume, rate, and strength of saline infusion. The predictive accuracy of the Adrogue–Madias formula is, in general, good. However, the rise in [Na] exceeds the value predicted by this formula in some instances, particularly in patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia. –

This report presents the principles of management of hyponatremia with saline infusion. We analyzed factors that cause deviations in the change of [Na] from the predicted values. We present a clinical protocol for managing hyponatremia with saline infusion based on this analysis.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review… [^1169CfKA]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality. Observations Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific to severe and life-threatening. Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7. 4 years. Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status. For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Severely symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4. 5% to 28% of people.

Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with liver disease, AASLD 2021 guidelines recommend to set the goal rate of increase of serum sodium of 4–6 mEq/L per 24-hour period (not exceeding 8 mEq/L per 24-hour period) to ameliorate the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome when correction of chronic hyponatremia is indicated in patients with cirrhosis.

### Symptoms and characteristics of individuals with profound hyponatremia: a prospective multicenter observational study [^111eBTiG]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess symptoms and characteristics of hyponatremia, the most common electrolyte disturbance in hospitalized individuals and a condition that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality.

Design

Prospective observational multicenter study.

Setting

Two Swiss academic centers.

Participants

Individuals with profound hypoosmolar hyponatremia (sodium < 125 mmol/L) (N = 298).

Measurements

All symptoms and complete medical history including current medications, therapy management, and in-hospital outcomes were recorded.

Results

The median age of all participants was 71 (interquartile range (IQR) 60–80), 195 (65%) were female, and mean serum sodium value on admission was 120 mmol/L (IQR 116–123 mmol/L). Frequent clinical symptoms were nausea (n = 130, 44%), acute vomiting (n = 91, 30%), generalized weakness (n = 205, 69%), fatigue (n = 175, 59%), gait disturbance (n = 92, 31%), recurrent falls (n = 47, 16%), and acute falls (n = 60, 20%). Fractures were reported in 11 participants (4%). More-severe symptoms such as acute epileptic seizures and focal neurological deficits were identified in 16 (5%) and 17 (5%) participants, respectively. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (n = 199, 67%), congestive heart failure (n = 44, 15%), chronic renal failure (n = 64, 21%), pulmonary disease (82, 28%), and central nervous system disease (n = 114, 38%). During hospitalization, 12 (4%) participants died, and 103 (35%) needed treatment in the intensive care unit.

Conclusion

A wide spectrum of symptoms accompanies profound hyponatremia. Most participants had moderate symptoms mirroring chronic hyponatremia with brain cell adaptation. Participants with profound hyponatremia had several comorbidities.

Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome

A critically important consideration in hyponatremia of chronic or unknown duration is managing the risk of ODS by avoiding excessively rapid correction of serum sodium concentration, which can damage the protective neural myelin sheath as a consequence of osmotic stress — with severe, potentially fatal, consequences. ODS was first reported in 1959, in a series of individuals presenting with rapidly evolving flaccid quadriplegia, pseudobulbar palsy, and then death within weeks, who were found to have distinctive pontine lesions at autopsy, on a background of alcohol abuse and malnutrition. It was only in the 1980s after preclinical studies in animals demonstrated demyelination after rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia that causation was established, supported by concordant patient observations.

When hyponatremia is chronic, brain cells adapt to the reduced serum tonicity by decreasing intracellular osmolytes (eg, electrolytes [sodium, potassium, chloride] and nonelectrolyte organic osmolytes). This lowers the tonicity gradient between brain tissue and serum, reducing water influx and lessening the risk of cerebral edema (Fig. 7). This adaptation to hyponatremia occurs in 2 phases — the initial phase involves rapid exit of electrolytes through volume-sensing channels occurring over minutes to hours, to avert life-threatening sequelae of cerebral edema such as seizure or brain herniation (though a degree of edema may still occur, and can still have severe clinical consequences). The second phase of adaptation that occurs over hours to days involves extrusion of intracellular organic osmolytes (eg, myoinositol, betaine, glutamine, taurine, γ-aminobutyric acid) via organic osmolyte transporters. The extent of cerebral adaptation is the basis for a distinction between "acute" and "chronic" hyponatremia, frequently defined below or above 48 hours' duration, as chronic hyponatremia is assumed to have been present for long enough for depletion both of electrolytes and organic osmolytes to occur — though in reality, this occurs as a gradual continuum. When hyponatremia is corrected, brain electrolyte concentrations recover much faster than organic osmolytes, which can take up to 5 days to return to baseline levels, often being resynthesized. Gradual correction of chronic hyponatremia allows sufficient time for safe reversal of the adaptation process.

### The management of acute and chronic hyponatraemia [^116z6Voi]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Close monitoring of pNa is recommended during the active correction phase. Hourly urine output monitoring is very helpful, as often treatment of the underlying cause of hyponatraemia (e.g. volume replacement in hypovolaemic hyponatraemia) can lead to suppression of AVP, and a rapid aquaresis, resulting in rapid rise in pNa. Both European and American consensus guidelines recommend that plasma sodium rise in chronic hyponatraemia generally should not exceed 10 mmol/l per 24 hours, with the US guidelines specifying that the rise should ideally be restricted to < 8 mmol/l. The US guidelines also include revised targets for patients deemed to be at greater risk of osmotic demyelination, such as those with liver disease, alcohol misuse, hypokalaemia or malnutrition. In these scenarios, targets are revised downwards to a maximum recommended elevation in plasma sodium of < 6 mmol/l and should not exceed 8 mmol/L in 24 hours (Table 3).

Table 3.
Targets for elevation in plasma sodium concentration recommended to avoid osmotic demyelination in chronic hyponatraemia.

In patients with acute hyponatraemia, when the acuity of onset is certain, the rise in pNa need not be restricted. Both guidelines now recommend 3% hypertonic saline bolus in the treatment for acute and symptomatic hyponatraemia, the goal being an initial brisk rise in pNa to reduce cerebral oedema. In chronic symptomatic hyponatraemia, the goal then quickly shifts to maintaining 24- and 48-hour correction within the safe thresholds for chronic hyponatraemia.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^111V9Y4A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Hyponatremia: mechanisms and newer treatments [^115XRMHU]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the neural and renal mechanisms of osmotic homeostasis, provide a rationale for the sensitivity of the central nervous system to hyponatremia, and outline modern approaches to therapy of acute and chronic hyponatremia.

Methods

Review of relevant literature with focus on physiologic mechanisms.

Results

With careful monitoring, acute hyponatremia can be managed, while minimizing risks both of continued hyponatremia and the osmotic demyelination that can occur with overly rapid correction of severe hyponatremia. Chronic hyponatremia due to disorders of volume regulation (congestive heart failure or cirrhosis) or to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone release can be managed effectively with vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists, but there is no evidence that controlling the hyponatremia enhances survival associated with the underlying diseases.

Conclusions

Therapy in the acute setting balances the risk of the osmotic disturbance with the risk of overly rapid correction. The V2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan has enhanced our ability to improve chronic hyponatremia in conditions such as congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^111PapxU]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements provide recommendations to help evidence-based practice by suggesting the most appropriate diagnostic tests and the most appropriate treatments. Over the years, multiple organizations have developed recommendations to assist clinicians in the management of hyponatremia. To be reliable, these recommendations must be based on a systematic review of the evidence, and have a transparent and multidisciplinary development process. Inconsistencies between recommendations may arise from failing to meet development standards and can only add to unwarranted variability in management. In this study, we aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of the existing guidance documents on the diagnosis and management of hyponatremia in adults and children.

### A step-by-step guide for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke [^1169Ebug]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia is common in patients with stroke and associated with adverse outcomes and increased mortality risk. The present review presents the underlying causes and provides a thorough algorithm for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in stroke patients. Concomitant diseases and therapies, such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease and heart failure, along with diuretics, antidepressants and proton pump inhibitors are the most common causes of hyponatraemia in community. In the setting of acute stroke, the emergence of hyponatraemia might be attributed to the administration of hypotonic solutions and drugs (ie. mannitol and antiepileptics), poor solute intake, infections, as well as stroke-related conditions or complications, such as the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, cerebral salt wasting syndrome and secondary adrenal insufficiency. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from non-hypotonic hyponatraemia, usually caused by hyperglycaemia or recent mannitol administration in patients with stroke. Determining urine osmolality, urine sodium level and volume status are the following steps in the differentiation of hypotonic hyponatraemia. Of note, specific parameters, such as fractional uric acid and urea excretion, along with plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic yield. Therapeutic options are based on the duration and symptoms of hyponatremia. In the case of acute or symptomatic hyponatraemia, hypertonic saline administration is recommended. Hypovolaemic chronic hyponatremia is treated with isotonic solution administration. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for the rest forms of chronic hyponatraemia, therapies increasing renal free water excretion may be necessary. Loop diuretics and urea serve this purpose in patients with stroke, whereas sodium-glucose transport protein-2 inhibitors appear to be a promising therapy. Nevertheless, it is yet unclear whether the appropriate restoration of sodium level improves outcomes in such patients. Randomized trials designed to compare therapeutic strategies in managing hyponatraemia in patients with stroke are required.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^1141Futk]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Six groups included healthcare professionals from different specialties. Multidisciplinary contribution serves to broaden the approach to health-care problems, increase the completeness of evidence-finding strategies, and help to identify hurdles to implementation. When reflecting on approaches to hyponatremia, bringing together several disciplines mirrors the clinical reality of multiple specialty areas dealing with the same problem but looking at it from a different angle. Only one of the development groups reported considering patients' views and experiences, but even then did so to a limited extent. Decisions on clinical care should factor in patient values and preferences. Interventions for chronic hyponatremia, such as fluid restriction, may affect quality of life and patient preference should influence the ultimate recommendations.

Low scores for applicability mostly reflect the absence of describing barriers to guideline implementation and failure to provide tools for putting the recommendations into practice. In part, guidelines are designed to deal with the challenges of increasing knowledge and time-pressure. They are designed to help make decisions at the point of care. However, being often lengthy publications without layered presentation of information, it is likely that the majority of the guidance documents may not reach their target audience or stimulate implementation. Four guidance documents provided algorithms for diagnosis or treatment; although these are likely to increase the utility of a guideline, it is unclear to what extent they truly improve implementation of the recommendations. How to best communicate evidence-based recommendations to the relevant stakeholders is a recent but active area of research lead by the DECIDE consortium. With results of their research expected, guideline developers will have additional targets for improving the applicability in the future.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^114MVSuY]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Fluid Restriction

In patients with SIAD, FR is the first-line therapy currently recommended by EU and US hyponatremia guidelines, though evidence for efficacy is limited. FR has the advantages of being free and readily accessible; however, limitations include patient adherence, accuracy of fluid balance monitoring in real-world conditions, potential competing need for concurrent medications that require coadministration of oral or IV fluid, and potentially poor tolerability with respect to thirst and quality of life. Interestingly, the osmotic threshold for thirst is lower in those with chronic SIAD, which may contribute to discomfort with FR — in a study comparing water intake post hypertonic saline infusion in 8 patients with chronic SIAD and 8 healthy controls, onset of thirst occurred at a significantly lower serum osmolality in those with SIAD, 264 vs 285 mOsml/kgH 2 O.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia: conventional and novel aspects [^113us68x]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a frequent electrolyte disorder. A hyponatremia is called acute severe (< 115 mM) when the duration has been < 36 to 48 h. Such patients often have advanced symptoms as a result of brain edema. Acute severe hyponatremia is a medical emergency. It should be corrected rapidly to approximately 130 mM to prevent permanent brain damage. In contrast, in chronic severe hyponatremia (> 4 to 6 d), there is no brain edema and symptoms are usually mild. In such patients, a number of authors have recommended a correction rate < 0.5 mM/h to approximately 130 mM to minimize the risk of cerebral myelinolysis. Sometimes it is not possible to diagnose whether a severe hyponatremia is acute or chronic. In such cases, an initial imaging procedure is helpful in deciding whether rapid or slow correction should be prescribed. The modalities of treatment of severe hyponatremia have so far consisted of infusions of hypertonic saline plus fluid restriction. In the near future, vasopressin antagonists will become available. Preliminary experience has already demonstrated their efficiency of inducing a sustained water diuresis and a correction of hyponatremia.

It is also possible to have dual pathology, hence an exception to the aforementioned classifications can occur in hypotonic hyponatremia with concurrent raised ineffective osmoles (eg, acute alcohol intoxication), which can lead to a measured osmolality that is normal or even elevated despite the hypotonic hyponatremia.

In this review, the term hyponatremia will refer to hypotonic hyponatremia unless otherwise stated.

Categorization of hypotonic hyponatremia varies, and usually considers both clinical symptoms and the absolute pNa concentration. Biochemically, European guidelines classify hyponatremia as mild (pNa 130–135 mmol/L), moderate (125–129 mmol/L), or profound (< 125 mmol/L). "Severe" hyponatremia is defined by the presence of symptoms or signs of cerebral edema including vomiting, seizures, cardiorespiratory manifestations of raised ICP, decreased conscious state or coma (eg, Glasgow Coma Scale score [GCS] < 8), and warrants emergency treatment (see "Acute Severe Hyponatremia" and "Emergency Management of Severe Hyponatremia"). US expert panel guidelines use the term severe more broadly to indicate serum sodium levels less than 125 mmol/L. To maintain the distinction of symptomatic severity, we use the European definitions in this review.

Another important categorization is acute vs chronic hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia is often defined as duration less than 48 hours, whereas chronic hyponatremia is defined as duration greater than 48 hours, and for practical reasons also includes cases where duration cannot be determined. The biochemical basis for this classification is in the time taken for cerebral adaptation to hyponatremia, via the export or deactivation of intracellular effective osmoles (Fig. 3). Those with chronic hyponatremia are vulnerable to rapid correction of pNa if it outpaces the speed that intracellular osmolality can be restored. A critical consideration in the management of moderate or profound hyponatremia that is chronic, or of unknown duration, is the need to avoid excessively rapid correction of serum sodium — which can lead to ODS and permanent neurological disability or death (see "Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome").

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^1174Gy8M]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with significant complications and controversies regarding its optimal management. Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements have attempted to provide clinicians with evidence-based diagnostic and treatment strategies for hyponatraemia. Recently published guidance documents differ in their methods employed to review the quality of available evidence. Nagler et al. used the Appraisal of Guideline for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument in a systematic review of guidelines and consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia. Nagler and colleagues highlighted the variability in methodological rigour applied to guideline development and inconsistencies between publications in relation to management of hyponatraemia (including the recommended rate of correction of a low serum sodium concentration). These differences could cause confusion for practising physicians managing patients with hyponatraemia. Please see related article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/12/231.

### The management of acute and chronic hyponatraemia [^111yoz7p]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The European guidelines recommend the administration of 150 mL of hypertonic saline over a period of 20 minutes, at which point a repeat plasma sodium measurement is taken, and another infusion of 150 mL 3% hypertonic saline commenced; this can be repeated twice or until a rise in pNa of 5 mmol/L is achieved. If hyponatraemia is presenting with moderate symptoms, then a once off bolus of 150 mL hypertonic saline can be administered. The US guidelines differ slightly; in symptomatically severe hyponatraemia they recommend 100 mL bolus hypertonic saline over 10 minutes to be repeated up to twice more. In patients with moderate symptoms of hyponatraemia, the US guidelines recommended a continuous slow infusion of 3% normal saline at a rate of 0.5–2 ml/kg per hour. Patients should be in a monitored environment, with close supervision of neurological status, urine output and pNa.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^116JUkNn]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Practice Guidelines

After weighing the evidence, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended that correction of hyponatremia be limited to 10 mmol/L in the first day of treatment and 8 mmol/L for every subsequent day thereafter. An expert panel that included six physicians from the United States and one from Ireland (which we will call the "US/Irish expert panel") came to similar conclusions, but with some added nuance (expressed in italics). For chronically hyponatremic patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L (for example, outpatients drinking conventional volumes of water or treated with thiazides and hospital-acquired hyponatremia with a known duration > 48 hours) who were at normal risk of developing osmotic demyelination, the panel recommended a correction limit of 10–12 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and 18 mmol/L in any 48-hour period and a minimum correction of 4–8 mmol/L. The panel recommended increased vigilance for patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L at heightened risk of osmotic demyelination. Factors reported to be associated with a higher risk of osmotic demyelination include sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, alcohol use disorder, hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease. In these high-risk patients, the US/Irish expert panel recommended that correction should not exceed 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and that the minimum daily correction goal should be 4–6 mmol/L. In patients without major risk factors for osmotic demyelination, the panel noted that correction by 8–12 mmol/L in the first day of therapy was greater than necessary, but unlikely to cause harm as long as the 2-day increment does not exceed 18 mmol/L.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^111fLWER]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyponatremia:

- **Definition**: Hyponatremia an electrolyte disorder characterized by low serum sodium concentration, and is typically defined as a serum sodium of < 135 mEq/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyponatremia include increased water intake (psychogenic polydipsia), low dietary solute intake (tea and toast diet), decreased water excretion secondary to elevated plasma ADH levels (volume depletion, SIADH, severe hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and expansion of plasma volume in the context of edematous states.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyponatremia in the general population of the US is 1.72%.
- **Disease course**: Treatment of hyponatremia requires careful attention to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, permanent neurological impairment, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome recover fully, whereas 25% have persistent neurological deficits. Mortality associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome is approximately 6%.

Hyponatremia is the most commonly encountered electrolyte abnormality. Severe hyponatremia in pregnancy poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Pregnancy involves changes in physiology that affect water and sodium homeostasis. Knowledge of these complex physiologic alterations during pregnancy is critical to managing dysnatremias in pregnancy. This teaching case describes a woman with chronic hyponatremia who presented during pregnancy with worsening hyponatremia. She had an activating vasopressin receptor mutation, which was passed on to her child, and her diagnostic workup is described.

Mortality

A consistent association between hyponatremia and increased mortality is observed. Whether this is because multimorbid patients with serious underlying conditions are prone to develop hyponatremia, or whether hyponatremia itself is an independent risk factor, is not entirely clear and needs to be clarified in properly designed intervention studies.

A 2013 meta-analysis identified 81 studies comparing death rates in patients with or without hyponatremia, including a total of more than 850 000 patients (nearly 148 000 with hyponatremia). Hyponatremia was significantly associated with an increased risk of overall mortality (relative risk [RR] 2.60; 95% CI, 2.31–2.93; P < .0001), and this was maintained after adjustment for age, sex, and diabetes mellitus. The association was relatively consistent when analyzed by individual underlying condition (heart failure, cirrhosis, pulmonary infection, myocardial infarction). There was an inverse relationship between serum sodium concentration and mortality — indicating higher risk with lower sodium concentrations. The mean difference in serum sodium between individuals who died compared to survivors was 4.8 mmol/L (pNa 130.1 vs 134.9 mmol/L), so even hyponatremia in the mild range was associated with risk. A causal relationship was not able to be established, by the nature of this analysis. The consistency associated irrespective of the underlying condition suggests that the underlying mechanism, if hyponatremia is indeed causal, is not disease-specific.

A follow-up meta-analysis by the same group in 2015 sought to clarify this association by determining whether an improvement in serum sodium was associated with reduced risk of mortality. In total, 15 observational studies encompassing 13 816 patients, mean follow-up almost 3 years, that assessed the effects of an improved, or normalized, serum sodium on mortality were included. An improvement in serum sodium, through various interventions, was achieved in 53.2% of patients. Serum sodium improvement was associated with a reduced risk of death (OR 0.57; 95% CI, 0.30–0.81; P = 0.002). A majority of the included patients had heart failure, which may limit applicability to the broader chronic hyponatremia cohort. Subsequent retrospective studies have reported that active management of hyponatremia is associated with improved mortality, discussed further in "Management of Chronic Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis".

Risk factors for EAH — For hypervolemic EAH, the major risk factor is excessive hypotonic fluid intake beyond the capacity for renal water excretion. High ambient temperatures appear to increase the risk of EAH, as do longer exercising times and nausea (with or without vomiting). Although women may have greater symptomatic hyponatremia incidence in some environments, when adjusted for body mass index and racing time the apparent sex difference was not statistically significant, meaning men and women are at equal risk for developing EAH and adverse consequences. Along with other nonsomotic stimuli to AVP secretion, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been implicated as a potential risk factor by potentiating the water retention effects of AVP at the kidney, although direct causal evidence remains conflicting. The far less common hypovolemic EAH variant has been associated with chronic diuretic use, higher ambient temperatures, and longer duration of physical activity, especially in older men participating in long-duration exercise in remote settings.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^116cKhyo]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Biochemical and symptomatic severity are not always well correlated, as patients with chronic hyponatremia may have very low serum sodium concentrations with minimal symptoms due to cerebral adaptation, yet patients with an acute precipitous fall in serum sodium, even to concentrations above 120 mmol/L, may present with severe symptoms. The presence of severe symptoms should prompt treatment with careful bolus hypertonic saline aiming for an increment in serum sodium of 4 to 6 mmol, based on clinical improvements seen in published cases. There is clinical evidence to support a 50% reduction in ICP with a pNa increase of this magnitude. A retrospective observational study of 68 patients with transtentorial herniation due to cerebral hemorrhage, stroke, or tumor but with normal serum sodium concentration (mean pNa 140 mmol/L), were administered a small, 30- to 60-mL bolus of very concentrated hypertonic saline (NaCl 23.4%, equivalent Na + to 240 mL of 3% NaCl). ICP reduced from 23 to 11 mm Hg over 24 hours, and reversal of herniation occurred in 75% of cases, predicted by a 5-mmol/L or greater increase in pNa (P = 0.001). There was no control group comparison, however — and this was not a hyponatremic cohort. Collectively, however, these studies illustrate the rationale for active intervention with hypertonic saline in symptomatic hyponatremia to reduce ICP and improve morbidity and mortality.

In patients definitively known to have acute hyponatremia, it is thought that pNa can be corrected (or allowed to correct) more rapidly, as the second phase of cerebral adaptation to low pNa (depletion of organic osmolytes) has not yet occurred (see Fig. 3). In practice, however, when a patient presents to hospital for care, it is often unclear whether their hyponatremia is acute or chronic. Even if there is a compelling history of water intoxication, endurance exercise with hypotonic fluid consumption, or recreational 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA/"ecstasy") use that supports acuity, unless a reliable normal pNa measurement within the previous 24 hours it is available, it is not possible to confirm. While symptom-defined severe hyponatremia should always prompt treatment with hypertonic saline to achieve the initial small increment in serum sodium described earlier, in most cases it is necessary to assume chronicity and adopt conservative serum sodium correction targets from that point to avoid the risk of ODS (see "Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome").

Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

### Clinical management of SIADH [^114zYH9K]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) accounts for approximately one-third of all cases. In the diagnosis of SIADH it is important to ascertain the euvolemic state of extracellular fluid volume, both clinically and by laboratory measurements. SIADH should be treated to cure symptoms. While this is undisputed in the presence of grave or advanced symptoms, the clinical role and the indications for treatment in the presence of mild to moderate symptoms are currently unclear. Therapeutic modalities include nonspecific measures and means (fluid restriction, hypertonic saline, urea, demeclocycline), with fluid restriction and hypertonic saline commonly used. Recently vasopressin receptor antagonists, called vaptans, have been introduced as specific and direct therapy of SIADH. Although clinical experience with vaptans is limited at this time, they appear advantageous to patients because there is no need for fluid restriction and the correction of hyponatremia can be achieved comfortably and within a short time. Vaptans also appear to be beneficial for physicians and staff because of their efficiency and reliability. The side effects are thirst, polydipsia and frequency of urination. In any therapy of chronic SIADH it is important to limit the daily increase of serum sodium to less than 8–10 mmol/liter because higher correction rates have been associated with osmotic demyelination. In the case of vaptan treatment, the first 24 h are critical for prevention of an overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and the serum sodium should be measured after 0, 6, 24 and 48 h of treatment. Discontinuation of any vaptan therapy for longer than 5 or 6 days should be monitored to prevent hyponatremic relapse. It may be necessary to taper the vaptan dose or restrict fluid intake or both.

Chronic asymptomatic hyponatraemia

Apart from hypovolemic hyponatraemia, which can be treated with isotonic saline or balanced crystalloid solution, the treatment of chronic hyponatraemia relies on reducing free water intake and increasing renal free water excretion (Figure 2). Fluid restriction (< 1 l/d) remains the cornerstone therapy for chronic hyponatraemia. The urine to serum electrolyte ratio [(UNa + + UK +) / serum Na +] indicates if the patient is in an antidiuretic or aquaretic phase and can also help estimate the degree of fluid restriction required to increase serum Na + concentration. In case of a ratio > 1, a stricter fluid restriction is recommended (< 500 ml/d), which is difficult to adhere to, and pharmacologic therapy is often required to increase renal free water excretion. Current guidelines unanimously recommend increasing solute intake with 0.25–0.50 g/kg per day of urea or a combination of low-dose loop diuretics and oral sodium chloride in moderate or profound chronic hyponatraemia owing to SIADH (Figure 2). Although there is controversial evidence regarding the efficacy in improving clinical outcomes and safety of vaptans, lithium and demeclocycline, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been recently proposed as a potential treatment option for hospitalized patients with SIADH-induced hyponatraemia.

Vaptans are competitive antagonists of vasopressin receptors without detectable agonist activity. Until now, two of them (intravenous conivaptan and oral tolvaptan) have been approved for the treatment of clinically significant euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that they have been related to overcorrection of hyponatraemia, and they are contra-indicated in severe symptomatic hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 120 mmol/l), in hypovolemic hyponatraemia or in patients with impaired thirst mechanisms, which is common in patients with stroke. Moreover, considering the fact that statin therapy is commonly used in the setting of acute ischemic stroke, physicians should keep in mind that vaptans inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and such a co-administration is contra-indicated.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^114pdHWw]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Study limitations

This study had some limitations. First, this was a single-center retrospective study with a small sample size of 56 patients. Some patients with chronic profound hyponatremia may have been admitted to the general ward and treated by general physicians, without the involvement of nephrologists. Second, the definition of overcorrection varies among studies. Finally, we ourselves designed the algorithm used in hyponatremia treatment. The protocol basically complied with international guideline recommendations for the treatment of chronic profound hyponatremia, although we did employ an exceptionally aggressive strategy involving continuous administration of 3% hypertonic saline in some situations to avoid under-treatment. In addition, the purpose of this standardized algorithm was not to recommend our treatment protocol to other institutions, but to make our results comparable to other studies. The appropriateness of applying diagnostic algorithms to treat hyponatremia remains to be studied, and physiology-based treatment must always be kept in mind. Our data should be interpreted in the light of these limitations.

### Hyponatremia and mortality: moving beyond associations [^112K8tfe]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Acute hyponatremia can cause death if cerebral edema is not treated promptly. Conversely, if chronic hyponatremia is corrected too rapidly, osmotic demyelination may ensue, which also potentially is lethal. However, these severe complications of hyponatremia are relatively uncommon and often preventable. More commonly, hyponatremia predicts mortality in patients with advanced heart failure or liver cirrhosis. In these conditions, it generally is assumed that hyponatremia reflects the severity of the underlying disease rather than contributing directly to mortality. The same assumption holds for the recently reported associations between hyponatremia and mortality in patients with pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, pneumonia, and myocardial infarction. However, recent data suggest that chronic and mild hyponatremia in the general population also are associated with mortality. In addition, hyponatremia has been associated with mortality in long-term hemodialysis patients without residual function in whom the underlying disease cannot be responsible for hyponatremia. These new data raise the question of whether hyponatremia by itself can contribute to mortality or it remains a surrogate marker for other unknown risk factors. We review hyponatremia and mortality and explore the possibility that hyponatremia perturbs normal physiology in the absence of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination.

### Transient seizure-induced sodium increase camouflaging a symptomatic hyponatremia [^114CGH5U]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Hyponatremia is a disturbance of fluid and electrolytes in which there is a relative excess of body fluid water compared with body sodium content. It is generally defined as a sodium concentration of less than 135 mmol/L and is the most commonly observed electrolyte disturbance in clinical medicine with a reported prevalence of 4% in the adult internal medicine patient population treated in the emergency department and up to 30% in hospitalised patients. Hyponatremia has a variety of etiologies and is most commonly caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion, the use of thiazide diuretics, congestive heart failure, severe vomiting and diarrhoea or polydipsia. Symptoms are often mild and non-specific like headache, nausea and confusion but can be severe and life-threatening with cardiorespiratory distress, seizures and coma. Severe symptoms are more commonly seen in cases of acute hyponatremia but also chronic hyponatremia in apparently asymptomatic patients must be considered a serious illness as it is associated with an marked increase in the risk of all-cause mortality. Although rare, encephalopathy is the most serious complication of acute hyponatremia. It is the result of cerebral oedema and increased intracranial pressure caused by the osmotically driven movement of water into brain cells after the extracellular compartment has become hypoosmolar in a relative short period of time (< 48 hours). Left untreated hyponatremic encephalopathy could result in neurological deterioration or death.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^1169HNqy]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium (SNa) concentration of < 135 mEq/L, is a water balance disorder, with a relative excess of body water in relation to sodium. Some reports have classified SNa ≤ 125 mEq/L as "profound" hyponatremia. Since profound hyponatremia is also associated with fatal complications such as brain herniation, appropriate treatments for hyponatremia have been discussed intensively worldwide. For example, urgent therapy using hypertonic saline is justified in life-threatening conditions caused by hyponatremia complicated with seizures and coma. In contrast, the problem of overcorrection makes the treatment of hyponatremia difficult because it can provoke osmotic demyelination (ODS), which is a dreaded neurologic complication associated with high mortality. Therefore, the international guidelines recommend limiting the increase of SNa to within 10 mEq/L and 18 mEq/L during the first 24 and 48 h, respectively, from the initiation of treatment for hyponatremia. To achieve the ideal correction rate of hyponatremia, several strategies including administration of desmopressin acetate (DDAVP), 3% hypertonic saline in combination with DDAVP, and re-lowering the SNa with 5% dextrose in water (D5W) have been introduced. However, there is a paucity of literature on the risk factors for overcorrection, especially in "Chronic" profound hyponatremia, which carries a greater risk of neurologic complications from overcorrection, even though several risk factors for ODS have been identified, including SNa ≤ 105 mEq/L at presentation, overcorrection itself, malnutrition, hypokalemia, and liver disease. We hypothesized that the identification of risk factors for overcorrection can improve the safety and efficacy of the treatment of chronic hyponatremia.

### Treatment of hyponatremic encephalopathy in the critically ill [^115PM8wK]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hyponatremic encephalopathy, symptomatic cerebral edema due to a low osmolar state, is a medical emergency and often encountered in the ICU setting. This article provides a critical appraisal and review of the literature on identification of high-risk patients and the treatment of this life-threatening disorder.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

Online search of the PubMed database and manual review of articles involving risk factors for hyponatremic encephalopathy and treatment of hyponatremic encephalopathy in critical illness.

Data Synthesis

Hyponatremic encephalopathy is a frequently encountered problem in the ICU. Prompt recognition of hyponatremic encephalopathy and early treatment with hypertonic saline are critical for successful outcomes. Manifestations are varied, depending on the extent of CNS's adaptation to the hypoosmolar state. The absolute change in serum sodium alone is a poor predictor of clinical symptoms. However, certain patient specific risks factors are predictive of a poor outcome and are important to identify. Gender (premenopausal and postmenopausal females), age (prepubertal children), and the presence of hypoxia are the three main clinical risk factors and are more predictive of poor outcomes than the rate of development of hyponatremia or the absolute decrease in the serum sodium.

Conclusions

In patients with hyponatremic encephalopathy exhibiting neurologic manifestations, a bolus of 100mL of 3% saline, given over 10 minutes, should be promptly administered. The goal of this initial bolus is to quickly treat cerebral edema. If signs persist, the bolus should be repeated in order to achieve clinical remission. However, the total change in serum sodium should not exceed 5 mEq/L in the initial 1–2 hours and 15–20 mEq/L in the first 48 hours of treatment. It has recently been demonstrated in a prospective fashion that 500mL of 3% saline at an infusion rate of 100mL per hour can be given safely. It is critical to recognize the early signs of cerebral edema (nausea, vomiting, and headache) and intervene with IV 3% sodium chloride as this is the time to intervene rather than waiting until more severe symptoms develop. Cerebral demyelination is a rare complication of overly rapid correction of hyponatremia. The principal risk factors for cerebral demyelination are correction of the serum sodium more than 25 mEq/L in the first 48 hours of therapy, correction past the point of 140 mEq/L, chronic liver disease, and hypoxic/anoxic episode.

### Hyponatremia in the cancer patient [^1135vqck]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder observed in a wide variety of malignancies and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Newer cancer therapies have improved patient outcomes while contributing to new cases of hyponatremia. Patients should be monitored closely for the development of vasopressin- and non-vasopressin-mediated hyponatremia. Acute and symptomatic forms of hyponatremia require urgent intervention, and recent findings support the correction of chronic "asymptomatic" hyponatremia. Optimizing hyponatremia may reduce medical costs, and improve cancer survival likelihood and quality of life. In this article, we review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of hyponatremia in the cancer patient.

### Vasopressin receptor antagonists [^1163Xzd5]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

The first non-peptide vasopressin receptor antagonist (VRA) was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, and several others are now in late stages of clinical development. Phase 3 trials indicate that these agents predictably reduce urine osmolality, increase electrolyte-free water excretion, and raise serum sodium concentration. They are likely to become a mainstay of treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. Although tachyphylaxis to the hydro-osmotic effect of these agents does not appear to occur, their use is accompanied by an increase in thirst, and they do not always eliminate altogether the need for water restriction during treatment of hyponatremia. Experience with use of these agents for treatment of acute, severe, life-threatening hyponatremia as well as chronic hyponatremia is limited. Further studies are needed to determine how they are best used in these situations, but the risk of overly rapid correction of hyponatremia seems low. Results of long-term trials to determine the ability of VRAs to reduce morbidity or mortality in congestive heart failure or to slow the progression of polycystic kidney disease are awaited with great interest.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^111hiyrd]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the past decade, most physicians treating severe hyponatremia have followed international guidelines that recommend limiting the rate of correction to avoid serious iatrogenic neurologic complications, most notably osmotic demyelination. Although these guidelines are based on small retrospective case series, they have been widely accepted by expert clinicians and are designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia. – Established practice has recently been challenged by the publication of a retrospective analysis of hospital administrative data derived from a cohort of over 17,000 patients hospitalized with hyponatremia. On the basis of the results of that study, an accompanying editorial suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of correction; its authors questioned the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration. We believe such conclusions are unwarranted and potentially dangerous; they are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. A review of that controversy, and of how current guidelines came to be, will explain the reason for our position.

### Hyponatremia-induced osteoporosis [^1173dQKV]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyponatremia, defined as serum sodium concentration [Na +] of less than 135 mmol/L, is the most frequently encountered metabolic disorder in clinical practice. It is especially common in elderly individuals, with reported incidences from 7% to 53% in ambulatory and institutionalized geriatric patients, respectively. Approximately 50% of chronic hyponatremia is due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Other causes include medications (e.g. diuretics), hypocortisolism, hypothyroidism, hepatic cirrhosis, renal disease, and congestive heart failure. Although chronic hyponatremia historically has been difficult to treat, the recent development of oral antagonists to the renal vasopressin V2 receptor offers the likelihood that both acute and chronic hyponatremia will be correctable in the near future. Thus this represents a opportune time to evaluate the adverse effects of chronic hyponatremia.

### Evaluation and management of hypo-osmolality in hospitalized patients [^1126c3pz]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the clinical setting. Abnormalities of the mechanisms that maintain normal water and sodium metabolism are often present in hospitalized patients, including defects in renal water excretion. All of the current therapeutic approaches in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and other forms of vasopressin-induced hyponatremia have significant limitations. Studies in animal models and humans have demonstrated that antagonists of the AVP V2 receptor in the kidney are effective in correcting hyponatremia. These new agents have been termed "aquaretics" because of their ability to induce a free water diuresis without the natriuresis or kaliuresis characteristic of diuretic drugs. When approved for clinical use, selective V2, and possibly also combined V1 + V2 receptor antagonists will be helpful in therapy.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^115ryoA7]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Risk of overcorrection

Risk factors for ODS included an initial SNa of < 105 mEq/L and overcorrection. International guidelines recommend avoidance of overcorrection in the management of patients with hyponatremia; however, risk factors for overcorrection have not been fully investigated. In contrast, avoidance of overcorrection or ODS may lead to prolonged or inadequate management of patients with hyponatremia, leading to undercorrection in clinical practice. We need to develop an optimal treatment strategy to assure a safe correction rate of SNa to achieve an appropriate correction while avoiding overcorrection. With this point of view, we conducted this retrospective study to determine the risk factors for overcorrection and believe that our results will guide physicians in the management of these patients. Our study revealed that a low level of SNa at presentation was associated with overcorrection, with an adjusted OR of 1.19 for every 1 mEq/L decrease (0.84 for every 1 mEq/L increase). This meant that a 4 mEq/L lower SNa level doubled the risk of overcorrection. Although several previous retrospective studies have indicated that the SNa at presentation was lower in patients with overcorrection compared to those without, a direct association between the SNa levels and risk of overcorrection has not been evaluated previously. Our results alert clinicians to be cautious of the incremental risk of overcorrection when patients present with low SNa levels.

### Vaptans are not the mainstay of treatment in hyponatremia: perhaps not yet [^111pdJne]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Two vasopressin antagonists ('vaptans') are now in the market for the treatment of euvolemic (Europe) or euvolemic and hypervolemic (United States) hyponatremia: conivaptan for intravenous use and tolvaptan for oral application. Although their specificity and effectiveness are considered established, their indications are not. At present, we do not know which symptoms of hyponatremia and which degree of hyponatremia should serve as indications for vaptans. Other areas of uncertainty relate to the following unanswered questions: do vaptans shorten the duration of hospitalization? Is it justifiable to use them to prevent relapse of hyponatremia in (chronic) SIAD(H)? (In this text we use the abbreviation SIAD(H) instead of the recently proposed abbreviation SIAD to emphasize that vaptans will work only in the presence of ADH ('SIADH') but not in the syndrome of nephrogenic antidiuresis.) Do they decrease the high mortality associated with hyponatremia? How do we justify the cost of chronic vaptan therapy? The optimal vaptan regimen (dose, timing of controls) to treat SIAD(H) is currently not established, as is the procedure to be recommended in a too rapid correction rate of (chronic) hyponatremia. Until these requirements shall be met by additional studies, we are hesitant to consider vaptans a treatment of choice for the appropriate hyponatremias.

### Disorders of salt and water balance after pituitary surgery [^114FHDD2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Management

SIAD after pituitary surgery should be managed similarly to that from other causes. Management options include fluid restriction, oral urea, oral tolvaptan, and administration of 3% hypertonic saline in severely symptomatic cases. Patients with acute hyponatremia of < 48 hours duration are often severely symptomatic if the plasma sodium falls to < 120 mmol/L and benefit from a prompt increase in plasma sodium to reduce cerebral edema. In comparison, those with hyponatremia of > 48 hours duration with minimal neurological symptoms require a slower correction, to avoid the risk of osmotic demyelination. A correction rate of no more than 10 mmol/L during the first 24 hours and 18 mmol/L during the first 48 hours is recommended in this cohort (75,76).

Fluid restriction is often first-line therapy for mild to moderate hyponatremia where the plasma sodium is 125 to 135 mmol/L. Although there are no randomized controlled trials proving the efficacy and safety of fluid restriction in the postpituitary surgery setting, clinical experience supports its continuing use. However, fluid restriction alone is often ineffective or slow at correcting hyponatremia (66,67,77,78). A recent randomized controlled trial in people with chronic SIAD demonstrated a median rise in plasma sodium by 3 mmol/L after 3 days of fluid restriction (1000 mL/day) compared with 1 mmol/L without any specific treatment. Thereafter, minimal increase in plasma sodium occurred, with the rise from baseline being 4 mmol/L vs 1 mmol/L after 30 days in the fluid restriction and no intervention groups, respectively. Similarly, another randomized controlled trial showed a rise in plasma sodium of 4.9 mmol/L after 4 days of fluid restriction (500–1000 mL/day), and by 5.7 mmol/L after 28 days. Data from a hyponatremia registry of over 3000 patients also showed only a very modest rise in plasma sodium of 2 mmol/L over the initial day of fluid restriction monotherapy. In a review of SIAD following pituitary surgery, monotherapy with fluid restriction achieved a mean rise in plasma sodium of 3.3 mmol/L over 72 hours and 32% of patients did not achieve any increase in plasma sodium. Predictors of failure of fluid restriction include urine osmolality > 500 mOsmol/kg, sum of the urine sodium and potassium exceeding plasma sodium, 24-hour urine volume < 1500 mL, and increase in plasma sodium < 2 mmol/L within the initial 24 to 48 hours of fluid restriction < 1000 mL/day. Fluid restriction should be at least 500 mL less than the estimated 24-hour urine output.
