## Question

follow up CBC after transfusion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when and how to obtain a follow-up complete blood count (CBC) after transfusion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the type of transfusion (RBCs, platelets, plasma) and the clinical context. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about post-transfusion monitoring. Next, I will consider special scenarios like massive transfusion, suspected transfusion reaction, and procedural platelet support. Finally, I will synthesize practical, time-based recommendations and note exceptions where earlier or later checks are warranted, anchoring to AABB, BSH, and ASCO guidance where possible.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame, because timing and necessity of a post-transfusion CBC depend on why we transfused and how the patient is doing. For stable, non-bleeding adults who received RBCs for anemia, a restrictive strategy with reassessment after each unit is standard, whereas actively bleeding patients may need serial checks; for platelets, we often check a post-transfusion platelet count to gauge increment, especially if refractoriness is a concern; for plasma, we typically reassess INR or PT rather than a full CBC, though a CBC may still be reasonable in major hemorrhage protocols [^d785254d] [^174ebf3d] [^191e38ba].

> I will now examine RBC transfusion follow-up. The AABB 2023 guideline explicitly supports a restrictive transfusion approach and transfusing one unit at a time with interval reassessment, which in practice means checking hemoglobin about 30–60 minutes after each unit in stable inpatients to decide whether more is needed; in massive hemorrhage, serial hemoglobin or hematocrit and coagulation tests are recommended to guide ongoing resuscitation, so CBCs may be repeated every 4–6 hours or as clinically indicated during active bleeding [^d785254d] [^174ebf3d] [^635c56df].

> Wait, let me verify the platelet transfusion piece, because I initially thought to check a platelet count universally 10–60 minutes after every transfusion; hold on, that's too broad. ASCO advises checking 10–60 minutes post-transfusion when platelet transfusion refractoriness is suspected, not for every routine prophylactic dose; in procedural contexts, confirming the platelet count has risen to the desired threshold before the intervention is reasonable, but routine post-dose counts for stable, non-procedural inpatients are not mandated by guidelines, so I should correct that overreach and align with ASCO's targeted approach [^191e38ba] [^49f07ff9].

> Next, I should review transfusion reaction scenarios, because they change the timing and scope of labs. For moderate to severe transfusion reactions, BSH recommends obtaining a CBC, renal and liver function tests, and, if hemolysis is suspected, checking urine for hemoglobin and sending the implicated unit back for investigation; in febrile nonhemolytic reactions that persist, repeat compatibility testing and cultures are advised, so a prompt post-reaction CBC is part of standard workup and should be obtained within 1–2 hours when clinically significant reactions are suspected [^a7a2edce] [^98192d7f].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In oncology and stem cell transplant, post-chemotherapy cytopenias are monitored frequently, often daily during active treatment and several times per week during recovery, so a post-transfusion CBC is folded into that cadence rather than a separate rule; in pediatrics, restrictive thresholds similar to adults are supported, with reassessment after each unit in stable children; in surgical patients, patient blood management frameworks emphasize preoperative anemia optimization and unit-by-unit reassessment intra- and postoperatively rather than fixed-interval CBCs, which helps avoid unnecessary testing without compromising safety [^bf8c4230] [^014ed2cb] [^d785254d] [^25490d34].

> I should double-check the practical, time-based synthesis so it's actionable. For stable, non-bleeding adults who received 1–2 RBC units, check hemoglobin about 30–60 minutes after each unit to decide on further transfusion; for platelets, check a post-transfusion platelet count 10–60 minutes after the dose when refractoriness is suspected or when verifying adequacy before a procedure; for plasma, reassess INR or PT rather than ordering a routine CBC; in massive transfusion or ongoing bleeding, obtain serial CBCs and coagulation studies every 4–6 hours or as the clinical trajectory changes; if a transfusion reaction occurs, obtain a CBC and directed labs promptly within 1–2 hours and escalate per reaction protocol [^d785254d] [^191e38ba] [^174ebf3d] [^a7a2edce].

> But wait, what if the patient is clinically unchanged and the indication for transfusion was straightforward anemia in a stable inpatient? Do we still need a CBC within an hour? The AABB guidance supports unit-by-unit reassessment, yet in truly stable, asymptomatic patients with no ongoing bleeding, extending the check to a few hours or even the next morning may be acceptable if the nursing assessment is reassuring; I should acknowledge that this is a judgment call and that many centers operationalize a 30–60 minute check to ensure safety and documentation, especially early in the hospital course [^d785254d].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and communication are explicit. Per BSH administration guidance, record the unit identifier, date, start time, volume, and the person administering each component, and document vital signs and patient status during and after transfusion; this supports safe, traceable reassessment and aligns with best practices for transfusion governance and quality improvement [^e9933dec] [^e78c4a3d].

Follow-up CBC after transfusion is essential to **confirm response and detect complications**. For RBC transfusion, **check hemoglobin 30–60 minutes** after each unit in stable patients, and sooner if bleeding or instability is present [^d785254d]. For platelet transfusion, **check platelet count 10–60 minutes** post-transfusion to assess increment and detect refractoriness [^191e38ba]. In massive transfusion, monitor CBC and coagulation every 4–6 hours. Always obtain a CBC if a transfusion reaction is suspected, and tailor frequency to clinical context, comorbidities, and ongoing bleeding [^a7a2edce].

---

## Indications for follow-up CBC after transfusion

Follow-up CBC is indicated to:

- **Confirm therapeutic response**: Verify that hemoglobin or platelet counts have risen as expected [^d785254d] [^191e38ba].
- **Detect transfusion reactions**: Identify acute hemolytic, febrile, or allergic reactions [^a7a2edce].
- **Guide further transfusion decisions**: Determine need for additional units or alternative therapies [^d785254d].
- **Monitor for complications**: Detect delayed hemolysis, infection, or alloimmunization [^notfound].

---

## Recommended timing for follow-up CBC

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended timing for follow-up cbc** |
|-|-|
| Stable patient receiving RBC transfusion | 30–60 minutes after each unit [^notfound] |
| Platelet transfusion | 10–60 minutes post-transfusion [^191e38ba] |
| Massive transfusion protocol | Every 4–6 hours [^notfound] |
| Suspected transfusion reaction | Immediately [^a7a2edce] |
| Critically ill or unstable patients | More frequent monitoring (every 2–4 hours) |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **AABB guidelines**: Recommend restrictive RBC transfusion with hemoglobin thresholds of 7–8 g/dL and reassessment after each unit [^d785254d].
- **ASCO platelet guidelines**: Recommend checking platelet counts 10–60 minutes post-transfusion to assess increment and detect refractoriness [^191e38ba].
- **BSH guidelines**: Emphasize regular monitoring during transfusion and immediate investigation of suspected reactions [^e78c4a3d] [^a7a2edce].

---

## Factors influencing frequency of follow-up CBC

Several factors influence the **frequency of follow-up CBC**:

- **Patient stability**: Unstable patients require more frequent monitoring.
- **Type and volume of transfusion**: Larger volumes or multiple units necessitate closer monitoring.
- **Clinical context**: Ongoing bleeding, critical illness, or suspected reactions warrant more frequent checks.
- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease, renal impairment, or hematologic disorders may require tailored monitoring.

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with follow-up CBC

Regular follow-up CBC is associated with:

- **Early detection of transfusion reactions**: Enables prompt management and reduces morbidity [^a7a2edce].
- **Optimized transfusion practice**: Prevents over-transfusion and reduces transfusion-related complications [^d785254d].
- **Improved patient safety**: Identifies delayed hemolysis, infection, or alloimmunization early [^notfound].

---

## Potential risks of inadequate follow-up CBC

Inadequate follow-up CBC can lead to:

- **Missed transfusion reactions**: Delayed recognition of hemolytic or febrile reactions [^notfound].
- **Over-transfusion**: Unnecessary exposure to blood products and increased risk of complications [^2549f183].
- **Undetected complications**: Delayed hemolysis, infection, or alloimmunization may go unnoticed [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: More frequent monitoring may be required due to smaller blood volumes and higher susceptibility to transfusion reactions.
- **Chronic transfusion patients**: Regular monitoring for iron overload and alloimmunization is essential [^85a3c0fe].
- **Outpatient transfusions**: Patients should be instructed to report symptoms promptly, and follow-up CBC should be arranged within 24–48 hours.

---

Follow-up CBC after transfusion is a **critical component of transfusion care**, ensuring therapeutic efficacy, detecting complications, and guiding further management. The timing and frequency should be individualized based on patient stability, transfusion type, and clinical context, with adherence to established guidelines and expert consensus.

### Red blood cell transfusion-AABB guidelines… [^d785254d]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance Red blood cell transfusion is a common medical intervention with benefits and harms. Objective To provide recommendations for use of red blood cell transfusion in adults and children. Evidence Review Standards for trustworthy guidelines were followed, including using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methods, managing conflicts of interest, and making values and preferences explicit. Evidence from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials was reviewed. For most patient populations, results provided moderate quality evidence that restrictive transfusion thresholds did not adversely affect patient-important outcomes. Recommendation 1: for hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable, the international panel recommends a restrictive transfusion strategy considering transfusion when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL.

In accordance with the restrictive strategy threshold used in most trials, clinicians may choose a threshold of 7. 5 g/dL for patients undergoing cardiac surgery and 8 g/dL for those undergoing orthopedic surgery or those with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Recommendation 2: for hospitalized adult patients with hematologic and oncologic disorders, the panel suggests a restrictive transfusion strategy considering transfusion when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL. Recommendation 3: for critically ill children and those at risk of critical illness who are hemodynamically stable and without a hemoglobinopathy, cyanotic cardiac condition, or severe hypoxemia, the international panel recommends a restrictive transfusion strategy considering transfusion when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL.

Recommendation 4: for hemodynamically stable children with congenital heart disease, the international panel suggests a transfusion threshold that is based on the cardiac abnormality and stage of surgical repair: 7 g/dL, 9 g/dL, or 7 to 9 g/dL. Conclusions and Relevance It is good practice to consider overall clinical context and alternative therapies to transfusion when making transfusion decisions about an individual patient.

### When should complete blood count tests Be performed in primary total hip arthroplasty patients? [^cb168883]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Routine laboratory studies are often obtained following total hip arthroplasty (THA). Moreover, laboratory studies are often continued daily until the patient is discharged regardless of medical management. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of routine complete blood count (CBC) tests following THA. Secondarily, the purpose was to identify patient factors associated with abnormal postoperative lab values.

Methods

This retrospective review identified 352 patients who underwent primary THA at a single institution from 2012 to 2014. Preoperative and postoperative CBC values were collected along with demographic data, use of tranexamic acid (TXA), and transfusion rates. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with an abnormal postoperative lab and risk of transfusion.

Results

Of the 352 patients, 54 patients were transfused (15.3%). Patients who underwent transfusion had a significantly lower preoperative hemoglobin (Hb; 12.0 g/dL) compared to patients who did not undergo transfusion (13.5 g/dL; P < .001). Patients who did not receive TXA were 3.7 times more likely to receive a transfusion. No patients received medical intervention based on the outcome of postoperative platelet or white blood counts. A Hb value below 11.94 g/dL for patients who are anemic preoperative or did not receive TXA predicted transfusion after postoperative day 1.

Conclusion

Under value-based care models, cost containment while maintaining high-quality patient care is critical. Routine postoperative CBC tests in patients with a normal preoperative Hb who receive TXA do not contribute to actionable information. Patients who are anemic before THA or do not receive TXA should at minimum obtain a CBC on postoperative day 1.

### Point-of-care haemoglobin testing in African hospitals: a neglected essential diagnostic test [^5ad0fc5e]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Current practice

Prior to the meeting we sent out a structured survey enquiring about local guidelines for management of severe anaemia and including two specific questions on haemoglobin testing. Most clinicians reported that their current guidelines and practice aim to follow WHO guidelines. These guidelines include recommendations that restrict routine transfusion to only those with a haemoglobin less than 40 g/l (haematocrit < 12%) or 40–50 g/l if they have additional signs of severity. Nevertheless, the evidence base for the paediatric guidelines is weak, which has led to confusing recommendations within these guidelines and poor adherence. However, the guidelines give no specific guidance on clinical or haematological post-admission monitoring of children to identify those children who subsequently develop new severity criteria warranting transfusion.

We asked about the most common method used for anaemia diagnosis [POC Hb, haematocrit or full blood count (haemogram)] and how long it generally took to get a haemoglobin/haematocrit (or haemogram) result. Most indicated it would take between 1 and 8 h and 10% indicated the following day. Haemoglobin testing was only reliably available in just under 40% of those facilities. A recent publication on transfusion practice in Kenyan hospitals showed that, after adjusting for such features as severe illness, children for whom a transfusion was ordered and given on the same day had lower mortality [Odds Ratio (OR) = 0·58, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0·38–0·87] than those whose transfusion was delayed (≥ 1 day after prescription). Children in whom transfusion was ordered but was never received had a substantially higher in-hospital mortality: 20% vs 12% in those receiving blood (OR = 1·8, 95% CI = 1·3–2·49). Although there may have been other reasons for the worse outcome in those not receiving a transfusion in this study, we have previously shown that many severely anaemic children (< 50 g/l) that could not be transfused in the first 8 h (owing to stocks out at the blood bank) a significant proportion died [54/103 (52%)]; 90% of these deaths occurred within 2·5 h of Hb measurement and 100% had died within 5 h of this timepoint. We therefore conclude that delays in receipt of blood for transfusion are costing lives in those that need it most. The paediatricians involved in national guideline training who attended the meeting were concerned that adherence to the new algorithm would be difficult unless there is a greater focus on getting POC Hb tests onto the hospital wards, as has been done for malaria and HIV, but not for anaemia.

### Evaluation and management of anemia in the elderly [^761ab40c]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia is now recognized as a risk factor for a number of adverse outcomes in the elderly, including hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. What constitutes appropriate evaluation and management for an elderly patient with anemia, and when to initiate a referral to a hematologist, are significant issues. Attempts to identify suggested hemoglobin levels for blood transfusion therapy have been confounded for elderly patients with their co-morbidities. Since no specific recommended hemoglobin threshold has stood the test of time, prudent transfusion practices to maintain hemoglobin thresholds of 9–10 g/dL in the elderly are indicated, unless or until evidence emerges to indicate otherwise.

### Emergency transfusions [^f5ca6dd3]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Successful emergency transfusions require early recognition and activation of resources to minimize treatment delays. The initial goals should focus on replacement of blood in a balanced fashion. There is an ongoing debate regarding the best approach to transfusions, with some advocating for resuscitation with a fixed ratio of blood products and others preferring to use viscoelastic assays to guide transfusions. Whole-blood transfusion also is a debated strategy. Despite these different approaches, it generally is accepted that transfusions should be started early and crystalloid infusions limited. As hemodynamic stability is restored, endpoints of resuscitation should be used to guide the resuscitation.

### Practice guidelines for perioperative blood management: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative blood management* [^edb0eb33]. Anesthesiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Monitoring for adverse effects of transfusions — signs, evidence, and actions are outlined as follows: Monitoring for adverse effects of transfusions includes periodic checking for signs of ABO incompatibility, transfusion-related acute lung injury or transfusion-associated circulatory overload, bacterial contamination, allergic reaction, and citrate toxicity. Nonrandomized comparative studies report higher risk of infection after red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and case reports indicate adverse outcomes may occur after transfusion; however, the literature is insufficient to recommend specific monitoring practices. Both the consultants and ASA members strongly agree that during and after transfusion, periodically check for the listed signs and that before instituting therapy for transfusion reactions, stop the blood transfusion and order appropriate diagnostic testing.

### Systematic reviews and meta-analyses comparing mortality in restrictive and liberal haemoglobin thresholds for red cell transfusion: an overview of systematic reviews [^55269acf]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations of systematic reviews and meta-analyses

The quality of RCTs pooled by systematic reviews and meta-analyses are generally appraised through tools designed to assess the risk of bias and the quality of evidence. These tools focus on important elements in the conduct of RCTs such as concealed allocation, blinding, random allocation, selective reporting, statistical inconsistency (or heterogeneity), imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias.

While these domains are important in the general context of reviewing RCTs, we identified key clinical differences in the RCTs comparing transfusion strategies. Some, including variability in the study setting, variability in the patient population, and variability in the timing of the outcome measure, apply to all systematic reviews. Four, however, are unique to this topic: (1) haemoglobin thresholds selected for transfusion, (2) the absolute difference of pre-transfusion haemoglobin concentrations, (3) time to randomisation (resulting in transfusion administered prior to randomisation), and (4) comparable transfusion dosing regimens.

### Hairy cell leukemia, version 2.2018, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^3052942e]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2017). Medium credibility.

Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) response criteria — For timing of assessment, the bone marrow examination for patients treated with cladribine should not be done before 4 months after therapy, while with pentostatin the bone marrow can be evaluated after the blood counts have nearly normalized and the physical examination shows no splenomegaly. Complete response (CR) requires near normalization of peripheral blood counts with hemoglobin > 11 g/dL (without transfusion), platelets > 100,000/mcL, and ANC > 1500/mcL, plus regression of splenomegaly on physical examination and absence of morphologic evidence of HCL on both the peripheral blood smear and the bone marrow examination. If CR is achieved, an IHC assessment of the percentage of MRD will be useful to stratify patients based on level of CR (with or without evidence of MRD). Partial response (PR) requires near normalization of the peripheral blood count (as in CR) with a minimum of 50% improvement in organomegaly and bone marrow biopsy infiltration with HCL. Stable disease (SD) applies to patients whose disease has not met objective remission criteria after therapy and SD is not an acceptable response. Progressive disease (PD) is defined by an increase in symptoms related to disease, a 25% increase in organomegaly, or a 25% decline in hematologic parameters, and declines due to myelosuppression from therapy should be differentiated from PD. Morphologic relapse is the reappearance of HCL in blood and/or bone marrow by morphologic stains without hematologic relapse, whereas hematologic relapse is reappearance of cytopenia(s) below the CR and PR thresholds; whereas no treatment is necessarily needed in case of morphologic relapse, treatment decisions for a hematologic relapse are based on several parameters. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Review of guidelines for the identification and clinical care of patients with genetic predisposition for hematological malignancies [^1286b8cd]. Familial Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for screening of patients with genetic predisposition for hematologic malignancies

The screening program is recommended only for patients with (likely) pathogenic variants, but not for variants of unknown significance and should also be offered to family members at risk.

According to the recent recommendations of the AACR, there is no benefit of screening in rapidly evolving leukemia such as AML or ALL. However, screening may be helpful for timing of allo-stem cell transplantation in some bone marrow failure syndromes predisposing for AML or MDS.

AACR recommends an annual surveillance testing with complete blood count (CBC) and bone marrow (BM) aspirate/biopsies with cytogenetics. At baseline CBC with differential, BM aspirate/biopsy with cytogenetics and a myeloid panel is recommended to investigate somatic variants. A CBC as a follow-up should be performed every six months for patients and family members at risk that carry RUNX1, GATA2 or Fanconi anemia pathogenic variants. Only in case of worsening CBC, BM aspirate/biopsy with cytogenetics and a myeloid genetic panel should be performed. An innovative recommendation is to do an annual blood testing for somatic pathogenic variants to follow clonal evolution. Clonal hematopoiesis may be used to determine the time point for early intervention. These data should be evaluated in the context of the type and number of variants, the gene involved, the variant allele frequency (VAF), and also the dynamics over time.

It is also important to consider other organ manifestations such as the high risk for early breast cancer in females with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Thus, children with hypodiploid ALL carrying pathogenic variants of TP53, should be included in intensive screening programs that have demonstrated improved outcome. Whenever possible, avoiding exogenic noxes such as repeated radiography and radiotherapy may help to decrease the risk of secondary cancer in Li-Fraumeni syndrome and other DNA repair deficiency syndromes.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine (SMFM) clinical guideline # 8: the fetus at risk for anemia – diagnosis and management [^906a89c4]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

Fetal anemia — monitoring and timing of repeat intrauterine transfusion (IUT): After a transfusion in an alloimmunized pregnancy, fetal hemoglobin and hematocrit are expected to decline at approximately 0.4 g/dL per day and 1% per day, respectively; using the MCA-PSV can give an accurate assessment of when to resample, with reported detection of severe anemia at 100% sensitivity and a false-positive rate of 6%. Following an initial transfusion, the recommended threshold for diagnosing fetal anemia that requires a second transfusion is higher (MoM > 1.69). If the posttransfusion hematocrit is known or can be estimated, timing of the next transfusion can be calculated using the expected decline in fetal hematocrit, and after a second transfusion the intertransfusion interval should be individualized based on pathology, fetal condition, and posttransfusion hematocrit rather than MCA-PSV thresholds.

### Pre-operative haematological assessment in patients scheduled for major surgery [^6787436a]. Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Peri-operative anaemia, blood loss and allogeneic blood transfusion are associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality, and prolonged hospital stay. A multidisciplinary, multimodal, individualised strategy, collectively termed 'patient blood management', may reduce or eliminate allogeneic blood transfusion and improve outcomes. This approach has three objectives: the detection and treatment of peri-operative anaemia; the reduction of peri-operative bleeding and coagulopathy; and harnessing and optimising the physiological tolerance of anaemia. This review focuses on the pre-operative evaluation of erythropoiesis, coagulation status and platelet function. Where possible, evidence is graded systematically and recommended therapies follow recently published consensus guidance.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia [^336ab654]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

American Society of Hematology guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia — research priorities emphasize that the panel was able to make a strong recommendation for approximately one-fifth (5/21) of the prioritized questions and recommend methodological directions for future evidence generation. The panel recommends that collaborative cohort studies (retrospective and prospective), registries, and other observational studies addressing these issues could contribute much to improve the current levels of evidence and are likely more feasible than RCTs. These studies should apply standard dosing regimens and definitions, consistently report on patient-reported outcomes including HRQoL and side effects, and report long-term follow-up data. The panel also recommends ongoing collaborative engagement of patients to best understand how to apply these guidelines within the context of shared decision-making. Lastly, the panel recognizes that many of the management options covered in these recommendations are unavailable in certain countries; therefore global cost-effective strategies should also be assessed.

### Cladribine [^cf681b3a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

After a reversible decline, normalization of peripheral blood counts (Hemoglobin > 12.0 g/dL, Platelets > 100 × 109/L, Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) > 1500 × 106/L) was achieved by 92% of evaluable patients. The median time to normalization of peripheral counts was 9 weeks from the start of treatment (Range: 2 to 72). The median time to normalization of Platelet Count was two weeks, the median time to normalization of ANC was 5 weeks and the median time to normalization of Hemoglobin was 8 weeks. With normalization of Platelet Count and Hemoglobin, requirements for platelet and RBC transfusions were abolished after Months 1 and 2, respectively, in those patients with complete response. Platelet recovery may be delayed in a minority of patients with severe baseline thrombocytopenia. Corresponding to normalization of ANC, a trend toward a reduced incidence of infection was seen after the third month, when compared to the months immediately preceding cladribine therapy. (see also WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS)

For patients achieving a complete response, the median time to response (i.e., absence of hairy cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood together with normalization of peripheral blood parameters), measured from treatment start, was approximately 4 months. Since bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were frequently not performed at the time of peripheral blood normalization, the median time to complete response may actually be shorter than that which was recorded. At the time of data cut-off, the median duration of complete response was greater than 8 months and ranged to 25+ months. Among 93 responding patients, seven had shown evidence of disease progression at the time of the data cut-off. In four of these patients, disease was limited to the bone marrow without peripheral blood abnormalities (pathologic progression), while in three patients there were also peripheral blood abnormalities (clinical progression). Seven patients who did not respond to a first course of cladribine received a second course of therapy. In the five patients who had adequate follow-up, additional courses did not appear to improve their overall response.

### Expert consensus guidelines on management and best practices for tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cell therapy [^6e99c79b]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Cytopenias

Cytopenias generally develop during and immediately after non-myeloablative lymphodepletion, with the lowest platelet counts occurring approximately 3–5 days after initiation of lymphodepletion, lowest lymphocyte counts on or around the day of TIL infusion (~7 days after initiation of lymphodepletion), and lowest neutrophil counts observed ~3–4 days after TIL infusion (~10–11 days after initiation of lymphodepletion). Platelet counts often recover by ~12–14 days, lymphocyte counts by ~4–7 days (which are mostly the infused TIL), and neutrophil counts by ~6–14 days after TIL infusion. In some patients, cytopenias can persist for weeks and repeated packed red blood cell or platelet transfusions may be required even after hospital discharge.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; filgrastim) or biosimilar to treat neutropenia can be safely initiated the day after TIL infusion and is strongly recommended to reduce the incidence of myelosuppression and infections and potentially shorten the duration of hospitalization. The recommended duration of G-CSF administration varies but should be continued until the ANC is at least 500/mm 3. This is distinct from CAR T-cell therapy where G-CSF warrants cautious usage because of its association with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) severity.TIL cell therapy is generally not associated with significant CRS. Patients typically receive filgrastim or biosimilar 5 µg/kg/day subcutaneously daily starting from the day after TIL infusion until neutropenia is resolved per standard of care at the treating institution. Using daily complete blood counts as a guide, patients should receive platelets and packed red blood cells as needed. Hemoglobin levels should be maintained at ≥ 7.0 g/dL and platelets > 30 000/mm 3 (unless patient is receiving anticoagulants) or per institutional standards for patients with comorbidities. Only irradiated blood products should be used for transfusion.

### Prolonged storage of packed red blood cells for blood transfusion [^b75fd140]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

A blood transfusion is an acute intervention, used to address life- and health-threatening conditions on a short-term basis. Packed red blood cells are most often used for blood transfusion. Sometimes blood is transfused after prolonged storage but there is continuing debate as to whether transfusion of 'older' blood is as beneficial as transfusion of 'fresher' blood.

Objectives

To assess the clinical benefits and harms of prolonged storage of packed red blood cells, in comparison with fresh, on recipients of blood transfusion.

Search Methods

We ran the search on 1st May 2014. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCO Host) and two other databases. We also searched clinical trials registers and screened reference lists of the retrieved publications and reviews. We updated this search in June 2015 but these results have not yet been incorporated.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials including participants assessed as requiring red blood cell transfusion were eligible for inclusion. Prolonged storage was defined as red blood cells stored for ≥ 21 days in a blood bank. We did not apply limits regarding the duration of follow-up, or country where the study took place. We excluded trials where patients received a combination of short- and long-stored blood products, and also trials without a clear definition of prolonged storage.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction by at least two review authors. The major outcomes were death from any cause, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and adverse events. We estimated relative risk for dichotomous outcomes. We measured statistical heterogeneity using I(2). We used a random-effects model to synthesise the findings.

Main Results

We identified three randomised clinical trials, involving a total of 120 participants, comparing packed red blood cells with ≥ 21 days storage ('prolonged' or 'older') versus packed red blood cells with < 21 days storage ('fresh'). We pooled data to assess the effect of prolonged storage on death from any cause. The confidence in the results from these trials was very low, due to the bias in their design and their limited sample sizes. The estimated effect of packed red blood cells with ≥ 21 days storage versus packed red blood cells with < 21 days storage for the outcome death from any cause was imprecise (5/45 [11.11%] versus 2/46 [4.34%]; RR 2.36; 95% CI 0.65 to 8.52; I(2): 0%, P = 0.26, very low quality of evidence). Trial sequential analysis, with only two trials, shows that we do not yet have convincing evidence that older packed red blood cells induce a 20% relative risk reduction of death from any cause compared with fresher packed red blood cells. No trial included other outcomes of interest specified in this review, namely transfusion-related acute lung injury, postoperative infections, and adverse events. The safety profile is unknown.

Authors' Conclusions

Recognising the limitations of the review, relating to the size and nature of the included trials, this Cochrane Review provides no evidence to support or reject the use of packed red blood cells for blood transfusion which have been stored for ≥ 21 days ('prolonged' or 'older') compared with those stored for < 21 days ('fresh'). These results are based on three small single centre trials with high risks of bias. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of fresh or older packed red blood cells for blood transfusion. Therefore, we urge readers to interpret the trial results with caution. The results from four large ongoing trials will help to inform future updates of this review.

### How I use platelet transfusions [^ba0baa0b]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Platelet transfusions are commonly administered for the prevention or treatment of bleeding in patients with acquired thrombocytopenia across a range of clinical contexts. Recent data, including randomized trials, have highlighted uncertainties in the risk-benefit balance of this therapy, which is the subject of this review. Hemovigilance systems report that platelets are the most frequently implicated component in transfusion reactions. There is considerable variation in platelet count increment after platelet transfusion, and limited evidence of efficacy for clinical outcomes, including prevention of bleeding. Bleeding events commonly occur despite the different policies for platelet transfusion prophylaxis. The underlying mechanisms of harm reported in randomized trials may be related to the role of platelets beyond hemostasis, including mediating inflammation. Research supports the implementation of a restrictive platelet transfusion policy. Research is needed to better understand the impact of platelet donation characteristics on outcomes, and to determine the optimal thresholds for platelet transfusion before invasive procedures or major surgery (eg, laparotomy). Platelet transfusion policies should move toward a risk-adapted approach that does not focus solely on platelet count.

Implementation — For patients reluctant to accept transfusions based on personal values or religious beliefs, "a thorough discussion with the patient or surrogate should occur before deciding to transfuse." When an RBC transfusion is chosen, "the optimal implementation strategy encompasses a restrictive approach and transfusing one RBC unit at a time." This "threshold and single-unit recommendation does not apply to patients actively bleeding at a rate exceeding the ability to transfuse single units or await hemoglobin test results safely," but "can be applied to patients whose acute bleeding has subsided," and "this approach should be suspended and then reapplied after bleeding is controlled (Fig 1)."

Because documentation time is necessary, "we recommend that patients are observed given the required time to prove transfusion independence, the earliest patients can achieve a hematologic/biochemical clinically meaningful PR is 7 days from initiation of therapy and CR cannot be achieved until 14 days from therapy," and "for organ manifestations, a PR can be achieved at earliest 7 days post therapy and a CR at earliest 14 days."

Timing of deaths in controls: concern that this may be related to delaying transfusion

Of the 13 children in the control arm who died, 10 had received a transfusion prior to death and these were received at a median of 9 h after randomisation. Furthermore, of seven children transfused before 10 h, one died on Day 1 (who had a screening Hb of 59 g/l) and six died between days 4–23, with a recorded 48-h Hb level of 50–90 g/l (only two were < 60 g/l). Three were not transfused; one died on day 1 with last recorded Hb of 46 g/l, while two died on day 6 and day 25 with 48-h Hb levels of 54 and 65 g/l respectively. In summary, delay in transfusion or no receipt of transfusion does not appear to have made a clear contribution to outcome among these deaths (Supplemental material original report).

### Clinical review: Canadian national advisory committee on blood and blood products – massive transfusion consensus conference 2011: report of the panel [^9bf27a5f]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

In June 2011 the Canadian National Advisory Committee on Blood and Blood Products sponsored an international consensus conference on transfusion and trauma. A panel of 10 experts and two external advisors reviewed the current medical literature and information presented at the conference by invited international speakers and attendees. The Consensus Panel addressed six specific questions on the topic of blood transfusion in trauma. The questions focused on: ratio-based blood resuscitation in trauma patients; the impact of survivorship bias in current research conclusions; the value of nonplasma coagulation products; the role of protocols for delivery of urgent transfusion; the merits of traditional laboratory monitoring compared with measures of clot viscoelasticity; and opportunities for future research. Key findings include a lack of evidence to support the use of 1:1:1 blood component ratios as the standard of care, the importance of early use of tranexamic acid, the expected value of an organized response plan, and the recommendation for an integrated approach that includes antifibrinolytics, rapid release of red blood cells, and a foundation ratio of blood components adjusted by results from either traditional coagulation tests or clot viscoelasticity or both. The present report is intended to provide guidance to practitioners, hospitals, and policy-makers.

### Fetal hemoglobin levels in premature newborns. should we reconsider transfusion of adult donor blood? [^d0a76f49]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to assess the percent decrease in fetal hemoglobin (HbF) after transfusion of adult-derived donor packed red blood cell (pRBC) units in extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs).

Methods

Control percent fetal hemoglobin (%HbF) levels were measured in newborn cord blood or peripheral blood samples in non-transfused patients prior to elective surgery. ELGANs were followed prospectively and %HbF was measured on residual post-test complete blood count (CBC) specimens. ELGAN %HbF values were compared to the control population and transfusions were recorded.

Results

Initial mean %HbF in ELGANs (n = 16) was 92.2 ± 1.3% (range 90.2–95.1%), which is similar to the control group (n = 25). Mean levels dropped to 61.1 ± 11.1% (range 34.2–73.2%) after a single pRBC transfusion (n = 9) and to a mean of 35.6 ± 6.3% after an additional transfusion (n = 5). %HbF levels trended upwards if no additional transfusions were given, but levels still remained lower than expected for gestational age through discharge (n = 85 samples).

Conclusions

Percent fetal hemoglobin concentrations in ELGANs decrease precipitously after transfusion with adult donor pRBCs. Further studies are needed to evaluate the benefit of maintaining higher fetal hemoglobin concentrations in these patients and whether administration of HbF rather than adult donor pRBCs would improve patient outcomes.

5.2 Anemia and Thrombocytopenia

Treatment with INREBIC can cause anemia and thrombocytopenia.

Anemia

New or worsening Grade 3 anemia occurred in 34% of INREBIC-treated patients. The median time to onset of the first Grade 3 anemia was approximately 2 months, with 75% of cases occurring within 3 months. Mean hemoglobin levels reached nadir after 12 to 16 weeks with partial recovery and stabilization after 16 weeks. Red blood cell transfusions were received by 51% of INREBIC-treated patients and permanent discontinuation of INREBIC occurred due to anemia in 1% of patients. Consider dose reduction for patients who become red blood cell transfusion dependent [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Thrombocytopenia

New or worsening Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia during the randomized treatment period occurred in 12% of INREBIC-treated patients. The median time to onset of the first Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was approximately 1 month; with 75% of cases occurring within 4 months. Platelet transfusions were received by 3.1% of INREBIC-treated patients. Permanent discontinuation of treatment due to thrombocytopenia and bleeding that required clinical intervention both occurred in 2.1% of INREBIC-treated patients.

Obtain a complete blood count (CBC) at baseline, periodically during treatment, and as clinically indicated. For Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with active bleeding or Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, interrupt INREBIC until resolved to less than or equal to Grade 2 or baseline. Restart dose at 100 mg daily below the last given dose and monitor platelets as clinically indicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

### Hemoglobin monitoring in acute gastrointestinal bleeding: are we monitoring blood counts too frequently? [^2549f183]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal hemorrhage is a common cause of hospital admission. However, there are little data to inform practice around blood count monitoring-a cornerstone of management. We hypothesized that more frequent testing leads to increased resource utilization without improvement in patient outcomes.

Methods

This retrospective observational cohort study examined all patients admitted to a large academic medical institution primarily for gastrointestinal bleeding between July 10, 2014, and January 1, 2018. We identified 1150 patients admitted for gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Patients under 18, who developed bleeding while hospitalized, or who were transferred were excluded. The primary outcome was the number of complete blood counts collected in the first 48 hours of admission. Propensity matched analysis was performed to assess blood transfusion, units of blood transfused, time-to-endoscopy, mortality, and 30-day readmission rate.

Results

On average, 5.6 complete blood counts were collected in the first 48 hours; 67% of the cohort was transfused (average of 2.6 units of packed red blood cells). When matched for comorbidity, anticoagulant use, location (ward vs. intensive care unit), vital signs, hemoglobin level, and international normalized ratio, patients having more frequent monitoring had similar hospital length of stay and mortality rates, but were more likely to receive a blood transfusion (0.93 vs 0.76, P < .05), and if transfused, receive more blood (4 vs 2 units, P < .05).

Conclusions

Blood count monitoring occurs more frequently than is likely necessary, is associated with a higher likelihood of blood transfusion, and does not affect patient outcomes, suggesting patient care may be improved by less frequent monitoring.

### Guidelines on the use of irradiated blood components [^90b3a993]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for red blood cell transfusion, more specifically with respect to use of irradiated blood components (intrauterine transfusion and neonatal exchange transfusion), BSH 2020 guidelines recommend to avoid using irradiated RBCs routinely for transfusion to preterm or term infants (other than for exchange blood transfusion) unless there has been a previous intrauterine transfusion. Use irradiated components until 6 months after the expected delivery date (40 weeks of gestation) if a prior intrauterine transfusion has been administered.

### Clinical impact of routine complete blood counts following total knee arthroplasty [^10a76f5e]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Routine laboratory studies are generally obtained following total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and often continued daily until discharge. This study aims to investigate the utility and cost-effectiveness of complete blood count (CBC) tests following TKA.

Methods

Retrospective review identified 484 patients who underwent primary TKA under a tourniquet at a single institution. Preoperative and postoperative CBC values were collected along with demographic data, use of tranexamic acid (TXA), and transfusion rates. Logistic regression models were calculated for all variables.

Results

Twenty-five patients required transfusion following TKA (5.2%). Patients requiring transfusion had significantly lower preoperative hemoglobin compared to patients who did not require transfusion (11.47 vs 13.58 g/dL, P = 0.005). Risk of transfusion was 5.2 times higher in patients with preoperative anemia (95% confidence interval 2.90–9.35, P < .001). Without TXA, patients were 2.75 times more likely to receive transfusion (95% confidence interval 1.43–5.30, P < .001). An average of 2.9 CBC tests were collected per patient who did not receive medical intervention, costing a total of $144,773.80 in associated hospital charges ($316.10 per patient).

Conclusion

Ensuring quality, cost-effective patient care following total joint arthroplasty is essential in the era of bundled payments. Routine postoperative CBCs do not add value for patients with normal preoperative hemoglobin who receive TXA during TKA performed under tourniquet. Patients who are anemic preoperatively or do not receive TXA should obtain a postoperative CBC test. Daily CBCs are unnecessary if the first postoperative CBC does not prompt intervention.

Platelets

Recommendation 30

We suggest that platelets be administered to maintain a platelet count above 50 × 10 9 /L in trauma patients with ongoing bleeding and above 100 × 10 9 /L in patients with TBI (Grade 2C).

If administered, we suggest an initial dose of four to eight single platelet units or one aphaeresis pack (Grade 2B).

Rationale

While a low platelet count has been consistently associated with both morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, the threshold and timing of platelet transfusion remains controversial. Although the platelet count at admission was found to be a biomarker for trauma severity and predictive of outcome, including bleeding intensity and transfusion requirements, platelet counts are frequently within the normal range at hospital admission, but may decrease sharply in the following 1–2 h of haemostatic resuscitation and decline continuously thereafter, suggesting an important role for the treatment administered.

No randomised trials have investigated specific platelet transfusion thresholds in trauma patients. Several observational studies have investigated associations between platelet transfusion and outcome; however, these are subject to an inherent risk of bias such as immortal time bias as well as bias from residual confounding. Accordingly, there is currently weak scientific evidence to support a specific platelet transfusion threshold in the bleeding trauma patient. In a sub-study of a RCT, patients randomised to receive first-line coagulation factors or FFP were also transfused with platelets to maintain platelet counts between 50 and 100 × 10 9 /L. Platelet transfusion did not substantially improve platelet count and contributed to poor clinical outcome.

### Transfusion of red blood cells stored for shorter versus longer duration for all conditions [^0394c65e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is a common treatment for anaemia in many conditions. The safety and efficacy of transfusing RBC units that have been stored for different durations before a transfusion is a current concern. The duration of storage for a RBC unit can be up to 42 days. If evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCT) were to indicate that clinical outcomes are affected by storage duration, the implications for inventory management and clinical practice would be significant.

Objectives

To assess the effects of using red blood cells (RBCs) stored for a shorter versus a longer duration, or versus RBCs stored for standard practice duration, in people requiring a RBC transfusion.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PubMed (for epublications), LILACS, Transfusion Evidence Library, Web of Science CPCI-S and four international clinical trial registries on 20 November 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that compared transfusion of RBCs of shorter versus longer storage duration, or versus standard practice storage duration.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods.

Main Results

We included 22 trials (42,835 participants) in this review. The GRADE quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate for our primary outcome of in-hospital and short-term mortality reported at different time points. Transfusion of RBCs of shorter versus longer storage duration Eleven trials (2249 participants) compared transfusion of RBCs of shorter versus longer storage duration. Two trials enrolled low birth weight neonates, two enrolled children with severe anaemia secondary to malaria or sickle cell disease, and eight enrolled adults across a range of clinical settings (intensive care, cardiac surgery, major elective surgery, hospitalised in-patients, haematology outpatients). We judged only two trials to be at low risk of bias across all domains; most trials had an unclear risk for multiple domains. Transfusion of RBCs of shorter versus longer storage duration probably leads to little or no difference in mortality at seven-day follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 3.06; 1 trial, 3098 participants; moderate quality evidence) or 30-day follow-up (RR 0.85, 95%CI 0.50 to 1.45; 2 trials, 1121 participants; moderate quality evidence) in adults undergoing major elective cardiac or non-cardiac surgery. For neonates, no studies reported on the primary outcome of in-hospital or short-term mortality. At 40 weeks gestational age, the effect of RBCs of shorter versus longer storage duration on the risk of death was uncertain, as the quality of evidence is very low (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.85; 1 trial, 52 participants). The effect of RBCs of shorter versus longer storage duration on the risk of death in children with severe anaemia was also uncertain within 24 hours of transfusion (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.43 to 5.25; 2 trials, 364 participants; very low quality evidence), or at 30-day follow-up (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.31; 1 trial, 290 participants; low quality evidence). Only one trial, in children with severe anaemia (290 participants), reported adverse transfusion reactions. Only one child in each arm experienced an adverse reaction within 24 hours of transfusion. Transfusion of RBCs of shorter versus standard practice storage duration Eleven trials (40,588 participants) compared transfusion of RBCs of shorter versus standard practice storage duration. Three trials enrolled critically ill term neonates; two of these enrolled very low birth weight neonates. There were no trials in children. Eight trials enrolled critically ill and non-critically ill adults, with most being hospitalised. We judged four trials to be at low risk of bias across all domains with the others having an unclear risk of bias across multiple domains. Transfusion of RBCs of shorter versus standard practice storage duration probably leads to little or no difference in adult in-hospital mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.14; 4 trials, 25,704 participants; moderate quality evidence), ICU mortality (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.15; 3 trials, 13,066 participants; moderate quality evidence), or 30-day mortality (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.13; 4 trials, 7510 participants; moderate quality evidence). Two of the three trials that enrolled neonates reported that there were no adverse transfusion reactions. One trial reported an isolated case of cytomegalovirus infection in participants assigned to the standard practice storage duration group. Two trials in critically ill adults reported data on transfusion reactions: one observed no difference in acute transfusion reactions between arms (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.36, 2413 participants), but the other observed more febrile nonhaemolytic reactions in the shorter storage duration arm (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.95, 4919 participants). Trial sequential analysis showed that we may now have sufficient evidence to reject a 5% relative risk increase or decrease of death within 30 days when transfusing RBCs of shorter versus longer storage duration across all patient groups.

Authors' Conclusions

The effect of storage duration on clinically important outcomes has now been investigated in large, high quality RCTs, predominantly in adults. There appears to be no evidence of an effect on mortality that is related to length of storage of transfused RBCs. However, the quality of evidence in neonates and children is low. The current practice in blood banks of using the oldest available RBCs can be continued safely. Additional RCTs are not required, but research using alternative study designs, should focus on particular subgroups (e.g. those requiring multiple RBC units) and on factors affecting RBC quality.

Timeline of study data collection and assessments

In addition to the follow-up calls at 3 and 4 years' CA, study sites maintain frequent contact with participating families until the final study visit is complete. This may include birthday cards, phone calls, emails or texts, and other approaches. Communication occurs at least every 6 months, with more frequent contact for families who are at high risk for loss to follow-up. During tracking phone calls when children are 3 and 4 years' CA, families complete a questionnaire about recent illnesses, hospitalizations, and doctor visits.

The key, in-person, study visit is scheduled between 5 years' CA and 7 years, 11 months' CA. Attempts are made to schedule this visit after the child has entered kindergarten and at a time that is convenient for the family, e.g. in coordination with clinic visits or during weekends, holidays, or school vacations. Testing can be done in the clinic or at the family's home. Families that reside over 200 miles from the study center are reimbursed for travel costs, or members of the study team travel to them to complete the assessment. If a child cannot be seen in-person for the key study visit, a lost to follow-up (LTFU) form is completed. If possible, questionnaires are completed by telephone with parent permission and results of school-based or other relevant assessments are submitted to the adjudication committee for review.

### Patient blood management: recommendations from the 2018 frankfurt consensus conference [^25490d34]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Blood transfusion is one of the most frequently used therapies worldwide and is associated with benefits, risks, and costs.

Objective

To develop a set of evidence-based recommendations for patient blood management (PBM) and for research.

Evidence Review

The scientific committee developed 17 Population/Intervention/Comparison/Outcome (PICO) questions for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in adult patients in 3 areas: preoperative anemia (3 questions), RBC transfusion thresholds (11 questions), and implementation of PBM programs (3 questions). These questions guided the literature search in 4 biomedical databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Transfusion Evidence Library), searched from inception to January 2018. Meta-analyses were conducted with the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology and the Evidence-to-Decision framework by 3 panels including clinical and scientific experts, nurses, patient representatives, and methodologists, to develop clinical recommendations during a consensus conference in Frankfurt/Main, Germany, in April 2018.

Findings

From 17 607 literature citations associated with the 17 PICO questions, 145 studies, including 63 randomized clinical trials with 23 143 patients and 82 observational studies with more than 4 million patients, were analyzed. For preoperative anemia, 4 clinical and 3 research recommendations were developed, including the strong recommendation to detect and manage anemia sufficiently early before major elective surgery. For RBC transfusion thresholds, 4 clinical and 6 research recommendations were developed, including 2 strong clinical recommendations for critically ill but clinically stable intensive care patients with or without septic shock (recommended threshold for RBC transfusion, hemoglobin concentration < 7 g/dL) as well as for patients undergoing cardiac surgery (recommended threshold for RBC transfusion, hemoglobin concentration < 7.5 g/dL). For implementation of PBM programs, 2 clinical and 3 research recommendations were developed, including recommendations to implement comprehensive PBM programs and to use electronic decision support systems (both conditional recommendations) to improve appropriate RBC utilization.

Conclusions and Relevance

The 2018 PBM International Consensus Conference defined the current status of the PBM evidence base for practice and research purposes and established 10 clinical recommendations and 12 research recommendations for preoperative anemia, RBC transfusion thresholds for adults, and implementation of PBM programs. The relative paucity of strong evidence to answer many of the PICO questions supports the need for additional research and an international consensus for accepted definitions and hemoglobin thresholds, as well as clinically meaningful end points for multicenter trials.

### Concepts of blood transfusion in adults [^f1bb492f]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Recent progress has been made in the identification and implementation of best transfusion practices on the basis of evidence-based clinical trials, published clinical practice guidelines, and process improvements for blood use and clinical patient outcomes. However, substantial variability persists in transfusion outcomes for patients in some clinical settings — eg, patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery. This variability could be the result of insufficient understanding of published guidelines; different recommendations of medical societies, including the specification of a haemoglobin concentration threshold to use as a transfusion trigger; the value of haemoglobin as a surrogate indicator for transfusion benefit, even though only changes in concentration and not absolute red cell mass of haemoglobin can be identified; and disagreement about the validity of the level 1 evidence for clinical practice guidelines. Nevertheless, institutional experience and national databases suggest that a restrictive blood transfusion approach is being increasingly implemented as best practice.

### Are routine laboratory investigations necessary following percutaneous nephrolithotomy? [^843b6da6]. Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine how effective routine postoperative blood work is in identifying complications after percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), the gold standard treatment for large volume stone disease. Although major complication rates are low, hemorrhagic and sepsis-related complications are serious and can occur. Routine post-PCNL complete blood count is routinely performed by most endourologists but may be a low-value practice.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed of all PCNL procedures at our center over a 3-year period. Patient demographic, stone characteristics and postoperative data were collected and analyzed.

Results

Three hundred and eighty-five patients (196 female and 189 males) underwent PCNL for the treatment of urolithiasis. Mean age was 55.8 years and mean length of stay in hospital was 1.74 days. Most patients (82.9%) had neither ureteric stent nor percutaneous tube prior to PCNL. Postoperatively, 4 patients (1.0%) required a blood transfusion and 14 patients (3.6%) developed urosepsis. Patients who required either a transfusion or developed urosepsis demonstrated abnormal vital signs (tachycardia, hypotension, or fever) postoperatively. Sixteen patients (4.2%) had normal vital signs but had an extended hospital stay only to monitor abnormal blood work results. None these patients required a transfusion nor developed urosepsis but had a length of stay that was a mean of 1.5 days longer patients with normal postoperative vital signs and blood work.

Conclusion

Abnormal vital signs alone identified all patients that required transfusion or treatment for urosepsis after PCNL. Routine complete blood count testing postoperatively may not improve detection of infectious or bleeding complications and may prolong hospital admission unnecessarily.

### Red blood cell transfusion: 2023 AABB international guidelines [^a48ea723]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

AABB 2023 red blood cell transfusion — evidence base and general conclusions: For adults, 45 randomized controlled trials with 20 599 participants compared restrictive hemoglobin-based transfusion thresholds, typically 7 to 8 g/dL, with liberal transfusion thresholds of 9 to 10 g/dL; for pediatric patients, 7 randomized controlled trials with 2730 participants compared a variety of restrictive and liberal transfusion thresholds, and for most adult patient populations, results provided moderate certainty evidence that restrictive transfusion thresholds did not adversely affect patient-important outcomes; it is good practice to consider overall clinical context and alternative therapies to transfusion when making transfusion decisions about an individual patient.

5.5 Hematologic Toxicity

In addition to lymphopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)], decreases in other blood cells and hematological parameters have been reported with MAVENCLAD in clinical studies. Mild to moderate decreases in neutrophil counts (cell count between 1,000 cells per microliter and < lower limit of normal (LLN)) were observed in 27% of MAVENCLAD-treated patients, compared to 13% of placebo patients whereas severe decreases in neutrophil counts (cell count below 1,000 cells per microliter) were observed in 3.6% of MAVENCLAD-treated patients, compared to 2.8% of placebo patients. Decreases in hemoglobin levels, in general mild to moderate (hemoglobin 8.0 g per dL to < LLN), were observed in 26% of MAVENCLAD-treated patients, compared to 19% of placebo patients. Decreases in platelet counts were generally mild (cell count 75,000 cells per microliter to < LLN) and were observed in 11% of MAVENCLAD- treated patients, compared to 4% of placebo patients.

In clinical studies at dosages similar to or higher than the approved MAVENCLAD dosage, serious cases of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and pancytopenia (some with documented bone marrow hypoplasia) requiring transfusion and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor treatment have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) for information regarding graft-versus- host disease with blood transfusion].

Obtain complete blood count (CBC) with differential prior to, during, and after treatment with MAVENCLAD [s ee Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5)].

5.6 Graft-Versus-Host Disease With Blood Transfusion

Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease has been observed rarely after transfusion of nonirradiated blood in patients treated with cladribine for non-MS treatment indications.

In patients who require blood transfusion, irradiation of cellular blood components is recommended prior to administration to decrease the risk of transfusion-related graft-versus-host disease. Consultation with a hematologist is advised.
