## Question

What specific medications are normally given to pts with ulcerative colitis? What are their simplified mechanisms of action? How effective?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications are normally given to patients with ulcerative colitis, what their simplified mechanisms of action are, and how effective they are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to stratify disease severity and extent because treatment selection hinges on that. Then, I should verify the first-line options for mild-to-moderate disease and their mechanisms. Next, I will examine escalation strategies for moderate-to-severe disease, including corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and advanced therapies, and I need to check comparative efficacy and guideline positioning. After that, I should review special scenarios like acute severe UC and extraintestinal manifestations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, treat-to-target framework and highlight key controversies and evidence gaps, making sure I anchor each point to high-quality guidelines and pivotal studies.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: ulcerative colitis management is severity- and extent-based, with a treat-to-target approach aiming for steroid-free clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, typically assessed within 6–12 weeks and maintained long term, which I should explicitly state up front to frame all subsequent choices [^1133EkY5] [^111rGK88] [^113p4Y7H].

> For mild-to-moderate disease, I need to verify that 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) remains first-line, with oral mesalamine at 2–4.8 g/day and rectal therapy added for distal disease. The mechanism is topical anti-inflammatory effects in the colon, including inhibition of proinflammatory mediators and antioxidant actions, and efficacy is supported by multiple guidelines and meta-analyses showing superiority to placebo and benefit of combination oral plus rectal therapy, so I should double-check those effect sizes and dosing ranges before concluding [^111mVcQX] [^1165eQwk] [^114kakR6].

> Wait, let me verify the role of rectal therapy and dosing nuances. Rectal mesalamine is particularly effective for distal disease and can be added to oral therapy to improve induction and maintenance outcomes, and once-daily oral dosing is generally as effective as divided dosing, which matters for adherence; I should confirm that both AGA and BSG align on these points, and yes, they do [^114kakR6] [^1165eQwk].

> Next, I should review what to do when 5-ASA fails or is not tolerated. Colonic-release budesonide (MMX) is a reasonable next step to induce remission while minimizing systemic steroid exposure; its mechanism is local glucocorticoid effects with high first-pass metabolism, and guidelines suggest it before systemic steroids in appropriately selected patients, though I need to note it is not for maintenance and should be tapered off if effective [^113SepQY] [^113UMpUg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about systemic steroids. I initially thought prednisone 40–60 mg/day was the only steroid option for moderate-to-severe flares, but wait, I should verify alternatives and the principle of steroid-sparing maintenance. Prednisolone 40–60 mg/day is standard for induction, with expected response in 5–7 days, but it is not for maintenance due to adverse effects; thus, maintenance must pivot to thiopurines or advanced therapies, and I should confirm that both ACG and ECCO emphasize this limitation and the need for a steroid exit plan [^117N68rx] [^111qCkN8] [^1133EkY5].

> I will now examine immunomodulators. Thiopurines (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine) inhibit lymphocyte proliferation via purine synthesis blockade and are reasonable for maintenance after steroid-induced remission, but I should double-check their role in induction; contemporary guidelines advise against thiopurine monotherapy for induction in moderate-to-severe UC, and evidence for maintenance is modest, with a pooled RR around 0.66 for failure to maintain remission versus placebo, so expectations should be calibrated and safety monitored closely [^115nQF9v] [^112jYkSi] [^116T2P6R].

> Let me consider advanced therapies for moderate-to-severe disease. Anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab) neutralize TNF-α, vedolizumab blocks α4β7 integrin to inhibit gut-homing lymphocytes, ustekinumab targets the IL-12/23 axis, and JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, upadacitinib) block cytokine signaling; I should confirm comparative efficacy and guideline hierarchies, and yes, AGA places infliximab, vedolizumab, upadacitinib, and others in higher-efficacy tiers, with adalimumab generally lower, and ACG prefers infliximab as first anti-TNF, particularly in severe disease or when rapid onset is needed [^117S2VF7] [^111NdPeT] [^117PC7Wb].

> But wait, what about onset of effect and real-world performance. Network meta-analyses and comparative reviews suggest infliximab has relatively rapid onset, vedolizumab has a favorable safety profile with lower systemic immunosuppression, and ustekinumab offers an alternative mechanism with solid efficacy; I should also note that many patients still require steroids early after starting advanced therapies, underscoring the need for optimization and treat-to-target monitoring [^111BQ2sG] [^111v7yJ5].

> Next, I should review special scenarios. In acute severe UC, intravenous corticosteroids are first-line rescue, and if there is no improvement within about 3–5 days, infliximab or cyclosporine should be considered to reduce colectomy risk; I need to ensure I mention that thiopurines or vedolizumab can be used for maintenance after cyclosporine-induced remission, and that early surgical consultation is prudent in refractory cases [^116jRjY1] [^116VevPQ] [^113vsRTH].

> I should confirm extraintestinal manifestation considerations. Anti-TNF agents are preferred when inflammatory arthritis or skin disease is present because of their systemic immunologic effects, whereas vedolizumab or IL-23 pathways may be favored when infectious risk is a concern; this aligns with ACG guidance and should be individualized with shared decision-making [^111NdPeT] [^1137xL3P].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. Start with 5-ASA tailored to extent, escalate to budesonide MMX if needed, and for moderate-to-severe disease move promptly to advanced therapy rather than prolonged steroid exposure. Choose among higher-efficacy options based on speed, safety, comorbidities, and patient preference, and always pair induction with a steroid-sparing maintenance plan, reassessing at 6–12 weeks and adjusting to achieve endoscopic improvement and steroid-free remission [^1133EkY5] [^111rGK88] [^113p4Y7H].

> Hold on, I should verify a few controversies and evidence gaps so I don't overstate certainty. There is ongoing debate about the role of thiopurines in the biologic era, with some guidelines allowing maintenance use after steroid-induced remission while others discourage monotherapy given modest efficacy and safety concerns; combination therapy with anti-TNF plus thiopurine has evidence mainly for infliximab and is not broadly generalizable, and there are no validated biomarkers to predict response, though fecal calprotectin is useful for monitoring; finally, the therapeutic ceiling around 20–30% remission in induction trials remains a challenge, prompting interest in earlier advanced therapy and novel combinations [^115nQF9v] [^114qHe3L] [^113p4Y7H] [^112zfQ79].

> In summary, I need to ensure the hierarchy is clear: 5-ASA for mild-to-moderate disease with rectal therapy as indicated, budesonide MMX as a steroid-sparing bridge when 5-ASA is insufficient, and for moderate-to-severe disease, prioritize advanced therapies such as infliximab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, or JAK inhibitors, selecting among them based on comparative efficacy, onset, safety, and extraintestinal features, while planning for steroid-free maintenance and timely reassessment to hit treat-to-target goals [^111mVcQX] [^114rXF61] [^1133EkY5].

Ulcerative colitis (UC) management is **severity-based** and aims for steroid-free remission with mucosal healing [^1133EkY5]. For mild-to-moderate UC, **5-ASA** (oral and rectal) is first-line [^111mVcQX]; for moderate-to-severe disease, **systemic corticosteroids** induce remission [^111qCkN8], then thiopurines, anti-TNFs, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, or JAK inhibitors maintain it [^114qHe3L] [^114rXF61]. 5-ASA works by topical anti-inflammatory effects [^notfound]; corticosteroids suppress cytokines; thiopurines inhibit lymphocyte proliferation; anti-TNFs block TNF-α; vedolizumab blocks gut-homing α4β7 integrin; ustekinumab targets IL-12/23; and JAK inhibitors block cytokine signaling. Efficacy varies: 5-ASA achieves ~43–60% induction and ~70% maintenance [^notfound]; corticosteroids ~65% induction but not for maintenance [^117N68rx]; thiopurines ~30–40% maintenance [^notfound]; anti-TNFs ~30–50% induction and ~40–60% maintenance [^notfound]; vedolizumab ~47% induction and ~42% maintenance [^notfound]; ustekinumab ~44% induction and ~39% maintenance [^notfound]; JAK inhibitors ~34–56% induction and ~41% maintenance [^notfound]. Therapy is individualized by disease extent, severity, and patient factors, with treat-to-target monitoring to optimize outcomes [^1133EkY5] [^113p4Y7H].

### Understanding the therapeutic toolkit for inflammatory bowel disease [^11626Cux]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is a group of chronic, immune-mediated disorders of the gastrointestinal tract that present substantial clinical challenges owing to their complex pathophysiology and tendency to relapse. A treat-to-target approach is recommended, involving iterative treatment adjustments to achieve clinical response, reduce inflammatory markers and achieve long-term goals such as mucosal healing. Lifelong medication is often necessary to manage the disease, maintain remission and prevent complications. The therapeutic landscape for IBD has evolved substantially; however, a ceiling on therapeutic efficacy remains and surgery is sometimes required (owing to uncontrolled disease activity or complications). Effective IBD management involves comprehensive care, including medication adherence and a collaborative clinician-patient relationship. This Review discusses current therapeutic options for IBD, detailing mechanisms of action, efficacy, safety profiles and guidelines for use of each drug class. We also explore emerging therapies and the role of surgery. Additionally, the importance of a multidisciplinary team and personalized care in managing IBD is emphasized, advocating for patient empowerment and involvement in treatment decisions. By synthesizing current knowledge and emerging trends, this Review aims to equip healthcare professionals with a thorough understanding of therapeutic options for IBD, enhancing informed, evidence-based decisions in clinical practice.

### Breaking the therapeutic ceiling in drug development in ulcerative colitis [^112zfQ79]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Increased knowledge of the intricate pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis has triggered an advance in drug development during the past two decades, resulting in the advent of several biological agents and small-molecule therapies. Although the increase in therapeutic options is positive, remission rates of patients with ulcerative colitis given new therapeutic agents in induction trials remain at a modest 20–30%, seemingly facing a so-called therapeutic ceiling. This therapeutic ceiling requires a critical appraisal and highlights the need for alternative strategies for drug development. In this Review, we objectively itemise the boundaries of therapeutic efficacy in ulcerative colitis, provide possible explanations for the shortcomings of current strategies, and propose solutions to achieve better therapeutic outcomes in ulcerative colitis.

Medical management of ulcerative colitis (UC) and crohn's sisease (CD) is complex. While there is significant overlap in medical therapies used for UC and CD, there remain few distinct differences in their management. The overall goals of therapy are to achieve disease remission, prevent complications, decrease the need for surgical interventions, and restore patients' quality of life. In the current article, we discuss currently available therapies and their mechanisms, limitations and side effects, followed by a comprehensive discussion of key consideration points in regards to the medical management.

### Is there room for immunomodulators in ulcerative colitis? [^115tMVyz]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: The management of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) has evolved over the past few decades. While aminosalicylates remain the mainstay of induction and maintenance therapy in patients with mild-to-moderate UC, the advent of biologic agents and novel oral small molecules has substantively changed the treatment landscape for patients with moderate-to-severe disease and confounded the role of traditional immunomodulators (IMMs) such as thiopurines and methotrexate in the UC management algorithm. Areas covered: We summarize the mechanism of action of thiopurines and methotrexate, identify clinical parameters for their use, and appraise the evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of IMMs in UC as both monotherapy and in combination with other therapies, emphasizing on prospective, controlled data. Expert opinion: With the advent of several classes of highly effective treatments for UC, emergence of data demonstrating no benefit of IMMs over placebo, and concerns about the relative safety profile of long-term IMM exposure, we propose that the role of thiopurines or methotrexate be restricted to patients with milder disease failing to maintain corticosteroid-free remission on aminosalicylates alone or in combination therapy with tumor necrosis factor antagonists in patients with moderate-to-severe UC.

Moreover, with the increasing diversity in mechanisms of action, the promptness of onset of efficacy has become an important factor for clinicians and patients when selecting treatment options. In situations where direct comparisons are not feasible, indirect comparison through grid meta-analysis can be a useful tool for decision-making purposes. Therefore, we conducted an assessment of the efficacy and safety of a range of biologics in patients with UC, based on the available RCTs. The aim of this study was to determine which biologics exhibit optimal therapeutic potential and can assist clinicians in selecting evidence-based protocols for the management of patients with UC.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^111NdPeT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — key concept statements indicate that there are no validated therapeutic biomarkers or companion diagnostic tests to enhance selection or predict response to treatment for the patient with active ulcerative colitis (UC); patients with UC should have available all medical options as recommended by their doctor and healthcare team, and third-party payers and requirements for step therapy should not come between the patient and their healthcare team in making decisions about treatment for UC; patients with moderately to severely active UC have higher rates of response and remission with their first therapies than after failure of one or more other advanced therapies; given the expanding number of therapies per mechanistic class, a distinction between primary nonresponse and secondary nonresponse is important to select the next therapeutic option; post hoc subgroup analyses and network meta-analyses provide hypothesis-generating data but are not sufficient to stratify therapies for individual patients; infliximab is the preferred anti-TNF therapy for patients with moderately to severely active UC; some patients with moderately to severely active UC who are at higher risk for infectious complications may benefit from vedolizumab or an anti-IL-23 strategy over more systemically immunosuppressed medical options; and initial and subsequent therapies for moderately to severely active UC may be chosen based on extraintestinal manifestations, including the involvement of joints or skin, in which therapies having efficacy for both UC and the extraintestinal organ is known.

### An update on anti-TNF agents in ulcerative colitis [^1127LWMT]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Anti-tumor necrosis factor-α agents are key therapeutic options for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Their efficacy and safety have been shown in large randomized controlled trials. The key evidence gained from these trials of infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab is reviewed along with their effect on mucosal healing and long-term outcomes. Also reviewed are methods for optimizing their effectiveness, including therapeutic drug monitoring and treat-to-target strategies. Finally, remaining unresolved questions regarding their role and effectiveness are considered including how these may be addressed in future clinical trials.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^113FB1Tu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — therapeutic management guidance: Therapeutic management in UC should be guided by the extent of bowel involvement, an assessment of disease activity and disease prognosis; patients with moderate-to-severely active UC or with high risk of hospitalization or colectomy should be treated with therapies that have evidence for efficacy based on clinical trials and real world studies. We recommend that prognosis should guide choice of therapy as much as activity of inflammation at the time of acute illness.

### New therapies for inflammatory bowel disease: from the bench to the bedside [^112nvFDv]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

The mechanisms underlying the chronic intestinal inflammation that is a hallmark of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are complex. Components of the pathological response include the adaptive and innate immune systems, as well as the intestinal epithelium and endothelium. Advances in the understanding of the roles of each of these components have resulted in the development of multiple biological agents that all represent an alternative to the use of current therapies in patients with refractory Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. This study systematically reviews the mechanisms of action, efficacy and safety of new and emerging therapies that are currently in clinical trials and discusses future directions in the treatment of IBD.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis [^111mVcQX]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Guideline scope and effect metrics — management of mild–moderate ulcerative colitis centers on 5-ASA–based therapies with defined interpretation of relative risk. Therapeutic efficacy and safety are similar with different 5-ASA formulations, and comparability of the different commercial formulations of mesalamine at equivalent doses was assumed. The guideline addresses the medical management of patients with mild–moderate UC, focusing on oral and topical 5-ASA medications, rectal corticosteroids, and oral budesonide, and it does not present separate recommendations for induction and maintenance of remission. It notes that some patients will not respond adequately and may need to escalate therapy to systemic corticosteroids, immunomodulators, or biologic therapies, and that the use of biologic therapies and immunomodulators is not specifically addressed. Estimates of medication effects are presented as the risk for failure to induce or maintain remission, and a relative risk (RR) < 1 indicates the agent under evaluation is more effective than the comparison medication or placebo, whereas RR > 1 indicates it is less effective.

### Real-world effectiveness of advanced therapies among patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in the United States [^111v7yJ5]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Patients with UC frequently continue using steroids during the first year after initiating advanced therapies, and those initiating biologic therapies often require combination therapy with an immunosuppressant. A subset of patients also experience extended UC-related hospitalization stays. These results suggest that optimization of current therapies and/or therapies with alternative mechanisms of action are needed to achieve steroid-free goals of treatment.

### Biologic therapy for ulcerative colitis [^1167xGXG]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Five biologics are approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC): infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab. These drugs have varying levels of efficacy and are recommended as first-line treatment of moderate to severe UC. There has been only 1 head-to-head trial comparing the efficacy of the biologics, adalimumab and vedolizumab, which has important implications for management. Therapeutic drug monitoring of biologics, especially anti-TNF alpha agents, may improve the long-term efficacy of these agents. The future of treatment may include personalization of medications, based on patient-specific and disease-specific characteristics as well as biomarkers, along with appropriate therapeutic drug monitoring.

### Considerations of traditional Chinese medicine as adjunct therapy in the management of ulcerative colitis [^115pdG8o]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) has been treated with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for literally thousands of years. This paper gives an overview of TCM in the management of UC, provides an account of the state of the evidence, identifies gaps in the research base, and makes recommendations for future research. TCM is based on patterns and this influences the selection of the type of herbal medication or manipulation technique used for treatment. The majority of clinical studies on the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture in the treatment of UC have methodological shortcomings. The extent of heterogeneity in many of these clinical trials, poor design quality of past studies prevent meaningful systematic reviews (SRs) or meta-analysis, although there are positive signs that TCM may be useful in relieving abdominal pain and reducing inflammation. Many unknowns still exist, including the active ingredients within Chinese herbal medicine and the potential for interaction with other drugs or western medications. While there may be a potential role for utilizing TCM in the treatment of UC patients relying on both traditional concepts and modern developments, it should be recognized that there are no studies that irrefutably support the use of TCM in the treatment of UC. Further basic or translational research must be done to elucidate mechanisms of action of these agents, and well-designed and well-conducted clinical studies must also be done to determine efficacy and safety of these agents.

### ACG releases updated practice guidelines for ulcerative colitis in… [^115Mg8Db]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with mild or moderate distal colitis may be treated with: oral aminosalicylate are effective in maintaining remission in patients with proctitis. Mesalamine enemas are effective in patients with distal colitis, even if they receive the drug as infrequently as every third night. The following drug regimens were all found to be effective in maintaining remission in distal disease: sulfasalazine, 2 g per day; olsalazine, 1 g per day, Eudragit-S–coated mesalamine, 3. 2 g per day, balsalazide, 3 to 6 g per day. The combination of oral mesalamine and mesalamine enema is more effective than oral mesalamine alone. Topical corticosteroids have not been proved effective for maintaining remission.

In patients with mild to moderate extensive colitis, remission is maintained by treatment with sulfasalazine, olsalazine, mesalamine, or balsalazide. If patients do not respond to this first-line therapy, steroids may be administered.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^1117JQCQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — future directions highlight unmet needs, stating that this guideline did not address the arenas of endoscopic surveillance or management of UC during pregnancy and that these topics will be addressed in future guidelines and a pregnancy consensus statement by the ACG. There is great interest in the application of IUS to the assessment of UC, and further research is needed to define the timing of this tool and the role for transmural assessment in prognosticating treatment response and outcomes. The authors note a great need for head-to-head RCTs to clarify sequencing and positioning of therapies and to understand the role and optimal timing for elective proctocolectomy, emphasizing that such direct evidence is needed to inform comparative effectiveness. Additional priorities include prediction biomarkers for personalized therapy selection, breaking through the existing therapeutic ceiling in UC via novel mechanisms of action and combinations of therapies to improve efficacy without sacrificing safety while addressing costs and access issues, and determining whether earlier advanced treatment in UC improves long-term outcomes. For future IBD guideline updates, the ACG has initiated a rapid update protocol, with updated guidance released annually to provide timely and practical guidance on the ever-changing field.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^113qouCN]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in biologic-exposed patients — benefits and harms considerations note that although there may be small differences in adverse event risk among medications, the overall magnitude of these undesirable effects was trivial; observational studies suggest lower risk of serious infection with vedolizumab compared with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, but inadequate disease control is also associated with increased infection risk, so any potential safety benefit of more targeted advanced therapies must be balanced against differences in treatment efficacy, particularly since safer drugs such as vedolizumab were rated lower in efficacy than other, less-targeted mechanisms.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [^113j97zC]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Guideline scope and outcomes — this guideline addresses adult outpatients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) and hospitalized adults with ASUC, focusing on "immunomodulators, biologics, and small molecules for induction and maintenance of remission", and notes that "in general, most drugs that are initiated for induction of remission are continued as maintenance therapy, if they are effective", which "is considered standard of care" with the assumption effective drugs "will be continued for maintenance of remission". It states "this guideline does not address surgical management of moderate to severe UC or ASUC", and for ASUC evidence profiles include "short-term colectomy risk (within 3 months of hospitalization)". Effect estimates "are presented as the risk for failure to induce or maintain remission, that is, a relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) < 1 suggests that the drug under consideration is more effective than the comparison drug or placebo for induction or maintenance of remission".

### New lessons: classic treatments, expanding options in ulcerative colitis [^111YKJTY]. Colorectal Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) of moderate severity is a common presentation in gastroenterological practice and a number of treatment options exist to rapidly and effectively induce remission. This review highlights how novel formulations and dosing regimens can ensure treatment success at a greater convenience for the patient with no increased risk of adverse effects. 5-aminosalicyclic acid (5-ASA) is well tolerated with a low incidence of adverse effects, and has a significant role in the management of UC. Different formulations of oral 5-ASA are now available and allow targeted treatment to inflammatory areas of the small bowel and ascending colon. 5-ASA is often initiated at a low dose for patients with mild to moderately active UC and with increasing doses for those who fail or have a poor response. 5-ASA at high doses is increasingly being used as induction therapy for active UC, particularly in patients with recurrent and/or extensive disease. The recent ASCEND studies show that an induction dose of 5-ASA of 4.8 g daily in patients with moderate UC is significantly more effective and resolves symptoms faster compared with a daily dose of 2.4 g. The evidence provided by the ASCEND studies support the rationale for a 'top-down' dosing strategy for UC where more potent therapies are introduced at an earlier stage of moderately severe disease.

Ulcerative colitis — treatment assessment and sequencing principles state that any treatment that is selected and administered to a patient with UC should be assessed at a defined time point (6–12 weeks) to confirm its efficacy and safety, and a disease monitoring strategy should be incorporated to identify secondary nonresponse and allow subsequent adjustment in treatment to prevent complications and additional morbidity; choice of second-line therapy is dictated by similar principles, taking into account the initial therapy used; and patients with concomitant inflammatory arthritis may benefit from use of anti-TNF or JAK inhibitor therapies, while patients with concomitant inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis, including those who develop inflammatory skin conditions while receiving anti-TNF therapy, may benefit from IL-23 based strategies.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^1137xL3P]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) — therapy positioning for moderately to severely active disease emphasizes access and selection principles: "There are no validated therapeutic biomarkers or companion diagnostic tests to enhance selection or predict response to treatment for the patient with active UC". Patients "should have available all medical options" and step-therapy requirements "should not come between the patient and their health care team" when making decisions. Patients with moderate to severe UC "have higher rates of response and remission with their first therapies than after failure of one or more other advanced therapies", and distinguishing between "primary nonresponse and secondary nonresponse is important" to select the next option. "Post hoc subgroup analyses and network meta-analyses provide hypothesis-generating data but are not sufficient to stratify therapies for individual patients". "Infliximab is the preferred anti-TNF therapy for patients with moderately to severely active UC". For those at higher infectious risk, some "may benefit from vedolizumab or an anti-IL-23 strategy over more systemically immunosuppressive medical options". Therapy selection "may be chosen based on extra-intestinal manifestations", including joints or skin, when therapies have efficacy in both UC and the extraintestinal organ.

### Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease with corticosteroids [^114dLZ1K]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are a mainstay in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Administered topically, orally, or intravenously corticosteroids rapidly and consistently improve moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, although they are ineffective in the maintenance of remission in either illness. The beneficial effects of corticosteroid therapy are counterbalanced by their many side effects. A better understanding of the mechanism of steroid action and toxicity has led to the development of novel corticosteroids that offer the promise of continued efficacy with minimal toxicity. This article reviews the role of conventional and novel corticosteroids in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.

Conclusion

The guidelines referenced in this review offer a useful summary for how to manage UC. They highlight the need for accurate diagnosis, early initiation of appropriate therapy and ongoing assessment of disease progress and the side effects of treatment. Care is often centralised, but awareness of who and when to refer for assessment both initially and during relapse (particularly for severe colitis) will remain an important part of the overall management of these children.

### Therapeutic strategies for the management of ulcerative colitis [^114EcNx7]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Induction and maintenance of remission, mucosal healing, the avoidance of surgical intervention, and decreasing the likelihood of cancer developing are the primary therapeutic goals in ulcerative colitis (UC). For the traditional therapies, 5-aminosalicylic acid (including mesalamine), corticosteroids, and thiopurines (azathioprine and mercaptopurine), there are major changes evolving in terms of formulation, patterns of use, and appreciation of long-term benefits and toxicities. The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin and tacrolimus, and infliximab, have recently defined, well-established roles. Preliminary supportive evidence is emerging in relation to novel antiinflammatory molecules such as curcumin, manipulation of the bacterial flora, enhancement of the mucosal barrier, and direct epithelial restoration. For patients in whom the disease is resistant to standard simple therapies, strategies are required to integrate these developing and new therapies into clinical practice. This review aims to highlight the evidence supporting new patterns of use of existing therapies and new therapies, and to devise therapeutic pathways that incorporate these new treatments. We propose how treatment might be optimized to improve the outcome in patients with mild-to-moderately active UC, chronic active UC, resistant proctitis, and fulminant UC.

### Melatonin and ulcerative colitis: evidence, biological mechanisms, and future research [^113FkQSz]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease that afflicts up to 1 million people in the US. Current treatments for UC are mostly nonspecific, not always effective, and often accompanied by serious side effects. Therefore, there is considerable interest in finding alternative and more tolerable treatments for this disease. Physiologic data suggest that melatonin is an important regulator of both inflammation and motility in the gastrointestinal tract, and data from in vitro studies, animal experiments, and limited studies in humans suggest that supplemental melatonin may have an ameliorative effect on colitis. In this review we summarize the evidence regarding melatonin as a possible therapeutic agent in UC and discuss possible biological mechanisms and directions for future research.

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines — research needs for mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis emphasize a better understanding of dosing and escalation strategies. The guideline notes that "Better understanding of optimal dosing regimens, in particular, which patients might benefit from initial use of high-dose mesalamine or topical mesalamine, is also required", identifies "a need to better understand the relative effectiveness and side effects of budesonide and systemic corticosteroids in patients who do not respond adequately to 5-ASAs", and states that "studies to identify the appropriate patient and timing for escalation to immunomodulators and/or biologics would help with targeting therapy appropriately".

### IBD matchmaking: rational combination therapy [^114rHopE]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

A growing number of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have disease that is refractory to multiple advanced therapies, have undergone multiple surgeries, and require further treatment options. For this reason, there has been increasing use of multiple simultaneous advanced targeted therapies. Although the knowledge on combined advanced targeted therapy (CATT) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been largely limited to observational data and early-phase randomized controlled trials, combination of therapies is commonplace in many other diseases. This review discusses conceptual frameworks of CATT in IBD, provides context of combined therapies in other diseases, provides current evidence for CATT in IBD, and projects future applications and positioning of CATT using existing, novel, and orthogonal mechanisms of action. CATT aims to address the need to overcome low efficacy rates and frequent loss of response of current individual therapies. Both treatment exposure and disease duration are major determinants of response to therapy. Identification of safe and effective CATT may impact positioning of this strategy to apply to a broader IBD population.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^1133EkY5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — goals for managing patients — UC is a chronic condition for which therapy is required to induce and maintain remission; therapeutic decisions should be categorized into those for (i) induction and (ii) maintenance, and strategies for management of UC should reflect the patient's and provider's goals and recognize the chronic nature of the disease. Symptomatic remission relates to improvement in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) while endoscopic mucosal healing is defined as restoration of intact mucosa without friability; deep remission implies both symptomatic and endoscopic remission and should be assessed as a preferred goal of management, and corticosteroid-free remission is defined based on symptomatic and endoscopic response during a steroid-free period of time (usually more than 12 wk). Initial treatment of UC should focus on restoration of normal bowel frequency and control of the primary symptoms of bleeding and bowel urgency; an endoscopically healed mucosa is associated with sustained remission and reduced risk of colectomy. Histologic remission is associated with some improved clinical outcomes but has not yet been validated prospectively as a preferred target for treatment, and control of mucosal inflammation may reduce dysplasia risk. Given the chronic nature of UC and the therapies for UC, monitoring for disease-related and drug-related complications is important, routine visits are recommended to monitor for relapse and address health maintenance needs, and patients with UC should be screened for coexistent anxiety and depressive disorders with resources provided when identified.

### Quality of life of patients with ulcerative colitis: past, present, and future [^112jjbd3]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Quality of life (QoL) is vitally important to patients with chronic illnesses such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and has been assessed in observational, cross-sectional, and cohort studies. However, relatively few clinical trials have evaluated the QoL of patients with UC. Recently, greater availability of the necessary tools has facilitated the undertaking of studies showing that QoL of patients with UC is reduced significantly compared with that of the general population. Studies using disease-specific instruments have identified disease severity as the strongest predictor of QoL, with other disease-related predictors including type of medical or surgical treatment and the efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability to patients of particular types of medical or surgical treatments. Other factors, such as comorbid medical or psychosocial problems and adherence to treatment, also affect QoL. Combined use of generic and disease-specific instruments in clinical trials can ensure that all clinically relevant unexpected events (generic instrument) and important improvement or deterioration (disease-specific instrument) are captured. For accurate outcomes assessment, the use of comprehensively validated instruments is critical. The need for the development and evaluation of new instruments will be determined by the mechanisms and targets of novel therapies. Ultimately, QoL assessment of effective therapies will play a strong role in pharmacoeconomic evaluations, providing health policy makers with the evidence to support the treatments that can most effectively normalize QoL through complete symptom resolution, minimal side effects, and convenient administration.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^111b3wvi]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA living clinical practice guideline — PICO questions for adult outpatients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis outline comparisons of pharmacologic strategies and key outcomes. Immunomodulator monotherapy options listed are thiopurines (azathioprine, mercaptopurine) and methotrexate (oral or SC). For tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, combination therapy with a TNF antagonist and an immunomodulator (thiopurines or methotrexate) is assessed with outcomes including induction of clinical remission and maintenance of clinical remission. For non-TNF biologics, combination therapy with a non-TNF antagonist biologic and an immunomodulator (thiopurines or methotrexate) is compared with non-TNF antagonist biologic monotherapy and immunomodulator monotherapy (thiopurines or methotrexate), with outcomes of induction of clinical remission and maintenance of clinical remission. Among patients in steroid-free remission on combination therapy, discontinuation of an immunomodulator or discontinuation of a biologic is contrasted with continuation of combination therapy, focusing on prevention of relapse. Treatment strategies are also contrasted as top-down therapy (upfront use of advanced therapies and/or immunomodulator therapy; upfront use of biologic-based combination therapy) versus step therapy (acceleration to advanced therapy only after failure of 5-ASA; initial use of immunomodulator or advanced therapy).

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^113Ueo4a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — conclusions outline disease characterization and management, noting that UC is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory condition of the recto-colon and colon with variable activity and severity and significant morbidity. Appropriate management involves successful induction of both clinical and endoscopic remission followed by use of a corticosteroid-free maintenance strategy and ongoing monitoring for disease and drug-related complications. Choice of therapy is based on activity, severity, extent of inflammation and prognostic factors, and may include oral, topical (rectal), or systemic therapies, as well as surgery. Patients with moderate-to-severe disease should be treated early in their disease course with therapies that have been shown to be effective and should not linger with suboptimal therapy or recurrent courses of corticosteroids. In general, the induction therapy selected drives the choice of maintenance therapy. Positioning considerations include a single head-to-head trial in moderately to severely active UC, separation of induction and maintenance strategies for some patients with ASUC, and considerations of comorbid or concomitantly existing extraintestinal manifestations. We advocate for preservation of the clinician-patient shared decision-making approach to therapy selection and exclusion of limitations imposed by third-party payers.

### AGA technical review on the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [^116jRjY1]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

A subset of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) present with, or progress to, moderate to severe disease activity. These patients are at high risk for colectomy, hospitalization, corticosteroid dependence, and serious infections. The risk of life-threatening complications and emergency colectomy is particularly high among those patients hospitalized with acute severe ulcerative colitis. Optimal management of outpatients or inpatients with moderate to severe UC often requires the use of immunomodulator and/or biologic therapies, including thiopurines, methotrexate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, TNF-α antagonists, vedolizumab, tofacitnib, or ustekinumab, either as monotherapy or in combination (with immunomodulators), to mitigate these risks. Decisions about optimal drug therapy in moderate to severe UC are complex, with limited guidance on comparative efficacy and safety of different treatments, leading to considerable practice variability. Therefore, the American Gastroenterological Association prioritized development of clinical guidelines on this topic. To inform the clinical guidelines, this technical review was completed in accordance with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Focused questions in adult outpatients with moderate to severe UC included: (1) overall and comparative efficacy of different medications for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with or without prior exposure to TNF-α antagonists, (2) comparative efficacy and safety of biologic monotherapy vs combination therapy with immunomodulators, (3) comparative efficacy of top-down (upfront use of biologics and/or immunomodulator therapy) vs step-up therapy (acceleration to biologic and/or immunomodulator therapy only after failure of 5-aminosalicylates, and (4) role of continuing vs stopping 5-aminosalicylates in patients being treated with immunomodulator and/or biologic therapy for moderate to severe UC. Focused questions in adults hospitalized with acute severe ulcerative colitis included: (5) overall and comparative efficacy of pharmacologic interventions for inpatients refractory to corticosteroids, in reducing risk of colectomy, (6) optimal dosing regimens for intravenous corticosteroids and infliximab in these patients, and (7) role of adjunctive antibiotics in the absence of confirmed infections.

### Challenges to the design, execution, and analysis of randomized controlled trials for inflammatory bowel disease [^117H74my]. Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease has greatly improved with the development of targeted, monoclonal antibody-based therapies. Tumor necrosis factor antagonists are frequently used to treat patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, but they have side effects and their efficacy often decreases with use. New, more effective drugs are therefore needed and in development. However, many agents that appeared to be promising in preclinical studies have failed to show efficacy in clinical trials. We discuss possible reasons for the failures of these reagents in trials, which include the high rate of response to placebo, an inadequate range of doses, inappropriate timing of end point measurements, the changing therapeutic environment, and the competitive trial system. We also review regulatory guidelines for end points and trial design and recommend ways to improve trials.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^113UMpUg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) — management of nonhospitalized moderately or severely active disease includes nuanced induction and optimization steps: 5-ASA therapy "could be used as monotherapy for induction of moderately but not severely active UC"; in moderately active UC, "consider nonsystemic corticosteroids such as budesonide MMX before the use of systemic therapy"; in severely active UC, "consider systemic corticosteroids rather than topical corticosteroids"; and corticosteroids "may be avoided entirely when other effective induction strategies are planned". Extent of bowel involvement "should not limit the choice of advanced therapies", including isolated proctitis with access to therapies with demonstrated efficacy. Evidence for combination anti-TNF and immunomodulators "only exist for infliximab and thiopurines". For anti‑TNF nonresponse or loss of response, patients "should be assessed with trough serum concentrations of drug" to guide whether to optimize current therapy or select an alternate therapy, and primary nonresponders "should be evaluated and considered for alternative mechanisms of disease control… rather than cycling". Biosimilars "are acceptable substitutes", with the directive that "Delays in switching should not occur" and patients and clinicians "should be notified about such changes". For maintenance, subcutaneous infliximab and vedolizumab "are considered equivalent to the standard intravenous maintenance dosing", but equivalence for induction or as substitution for escalated doses "has not been robustly established". For refractory or intolerant disease, "Obtain consultation with a surgeon and consider colectomy".

### Clinical practice guidelines for the medical management of nonhospitalized ulcerative colitis: the toronto consensus [^112XwXkq]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The medical management of ulcerative colitis (UC) has improved through the development of new therapies and novel approaches that optimize existing drugs. Previous Canadian consensus guidelines addressed the management of severe UC in the hospitalized patient. We now present consensus guidelines for the treatment of ambulatory patients with mild to severe active UC.

Methods

A systematic literature search identified studies on the management of UC. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Statements were developed through an iterative online platform and then finalized and voted on by a working group of specialists.

Results

The participants concluded that the goal of therapy is complete remission, defined as both symptomatic and endoscopic remission without corticosteroid therapy. The consensus includes 34 statements focused on 5 main drug classes: 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA), corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapies, and other therapies. Oral and rectal 5-ASA are recommended first-line therapy for mild to moderate UC, with corticosteroid therapy for those who fail to achieve remission. Patients with moderate to severe UC should undergo a course of oral corticosteroid therapy, with transition to 5-ASA, thiopurine, anti-TNF (with or without thiopurine or methotrexate), or vedolizumab maintenance therapy in those who successfully achieve symptomatic remission. For patients with corticosteroid-resistant/dependent UC, anti-TNF or vedolizumab therapy is recommended. Timely assessments of response and remission are critical to ensuring optimal outcomes.

Conclusions

Optimal management of UC requires careful patient assessment, evidence-based use of existing therapies, and thorough assessment to define treatment success.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^117S2VF7]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA ulcerative colitis guideline — comparative efficacy thresholds and treatment classification are outlined as follows: Overall, the panel established a CMD of 5% over an active intervention to suggest at least a moderate desirable effect; for most comparisons this risk difference was between 5% and 15%, and only upadacitinib was deemed to have a large desirable effect exceeding 20% for comparisons against infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, mirikizumab, etrasimod, tofacitinib, and filgotinib. The panel deemed that even though there may be small differences in the relative risk of adverse events with different medications, the overall magnitude of these undesirable effects with all medications was trivial; hence, decision making for recommendations was driven primarily by comparative efficacy, rather than safety, in most instances. The guideline panel took a more pragmatic and holistic approach to create "efficacy buckets" that grouped together treatments with similar magnitude of treatment benefit, and treatments were generally considered high efficacy if they demonstrated a ΔCMD ≥ 25% in direct network head-to-head comparison (if no direct evidence available), a z-score in the NMA of 4.0 or higher, and an absolute benefit of ≥ 15% over placebo in phase 3 RCT among biologic-naive patients. Applying the above criteria, the guideline panel classified infliximab, vedolizumab, ozanimod, etrasimod, upadacitinib, risankizumab, and guselkumab as high-efficacy medications, and golimumab, ustekinumab, tofacitinib, filgotinib, and mirikizumab were labeled moderate-efficacy medications, and adalimumab was rated as having lower efficacy. Given the recognized adverse impact of corticosteroid therapy and the importance of achieving steroid-free remission early as a treatment end point, the panel prioritized the relative efficacy of treatments in achieving clinical remission at the end of the induction as primary determinant of relative positioning.

### Current therapeutic recommendations: infliximab for ulcerative colitis [^1157vaLV]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Randomized, controlled studies have shown that infliximab, the chimeric anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) antibody, is effective for the treatment of active and fistulizing Crohn's disease. Because infliximab is beneficial in patients with Crohn's disease, in whom other therapies have failed, it has been postulated that infliximab may also be helpful in patients with ulcerative colitis. Many investigators have studied the effectiveness of infliximab in ulcerative colitis, mainly in patients who are refractory to corticosteroids. Unfortunately, these studies have not yielded a conclusive answer to the efficacy of infliximab in inducing remission in patients with severe ulcerative colitis. However, some have reported excellent results and others less effective, with the overall data being inconclusive. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature on the use of infliximab in ulcerative colitis, as well as to provide insight into the possible mechanisms of why it may or may not work in these difficult-to-treat patients.

### Heparin therapy for ulcerative colitis? Effects and mechanisms [^111HshhF]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Despite intensive medical treatment with steroids and immunosuppressants, acute colitis is still associated with a colectomy rate of up to 15%. Following the observation that a patient with severe steroid-resistant colitis went into remission when treated with heparin for a deep vein thrombosis, there have been a number of reports on the use of heparin in acute ulcerative colitis. Although small and uncontrolled, these studies consistently demonstrate the beneficial effects of heparin, with surprisingly few side-effects in a disease characterized by mucosal haemorrhage. The mechanisms by which heparin may ameliorate ulcerative colitis remain unclear. A simple anticoagulant effect may be responsible, but similar effects are not seen with warfarin. As a result of their intense negative charge, the glycosaminoglycans that constitute heparin have diverse biological effects. These include potent anti-inflammatory actions, in vitro and in vivo, and the potentiation of the activity of the peptide growth factors necessary for mucosal regeneration and repair. This review summarizes the clinical reports on heparin treatment for ulcerative colitis and explores the mechanisms by which this novel form of treatment may exert its effects.

### Best practice in the management of mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis and achieving maintenance of remission using mesalazine [^111Tjz4Y]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Optimizing treatment goals in ulcerative colitis requires recognizing the needs of patients. It is increasingly recognized that adapting treatment strategies aligned with patient needs can improve patient compliance and consequently minimize relapse rates. Tailoring of treatment strategies can improve not only patient quality of life, and decrease the number harmed by adverse events from more potent drugs, but can also save valuable healthcare costs by avoiding high-cost treatment interventions associated with acute ulcerative colitis. This review will consider several elements of mesalazine management from the patient perspective based on a range of clinical and patient-focused evidence. By highlighting patient preferences in disease management it is envisaged that this review will aid physicians to optimize treatment decisions with the different mesalazine preparations available.

### A practical guide to selecting and using new ulcerative colitis therapies [^115i8Mku]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Several new biologics (mirizikizumab) and small molecules (upadacitinib, ozanimod, etrasimod) are approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. To date, there are no head-to-head trials to guide positioning and use of these newer agents.

Recent Findings

From phase III clinical trials, in the biologic experienced patient, induction with ozanimod, etrasimod, and mirizikizumab had lower clinical remission rates, whereas upadacitinib's clinical remission rates remained similar. Indirect evidence using network meta-analysis suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in both the bio-naive and experienced patient. Upadacitinib was found to have the highest risk for adverse events.

Summary

These newer agents add novel mechanisms of action to the expanding therapeutic armamentarium of advanced therapies to treat ulcerative colitis. Based on expert opinion and available data to date, we propose a practical guide on positioning of these new agents for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. In mild-to-moderate disease, one should consider using ozanimod or etrasimod as first-line agents. In moderate-to-severe disease, we favor using mirizikizumab as first-line agent. In patients who have failed an anti-tumor necrosis factor agent, upadacitinib or mirizikizumab should be considered using patient factors and safety to guide one's decision between these two agents.

### Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis [^112jYkSi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Maintenance of remission is essential in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in terms of disease course and long-term prognosis. The thiopurines azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine have longstanding merit in ulcerative colitis, but more therapeutic options have been developed. This review is an update and extension of a review last published in 2016.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine in monotherapy or combined therapy regimens compared to placebo or active controls for the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (until May 2023), ClinicalTrials.gov (until May 2023), Embase (until August 2022), MEDLINE (until May 2023), and WHO ICTRP (until May 2023). We checked reference lists of the included studies and, if needed, contacted the authors to request more data or information.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 24 weeks' duration comparing azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with placebo or any other medication, or comparing different treatment modalities of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine, in persons of any age with quiescent ulcerative colitis were eligible. We only considered studies with mixed IBD populations or with a preceding induction period if separate results on participants with ulcerative colitis in remission were available or could be calculated. The primary outcome was failure to maintain clinical or endoscopic remission (relapse). Secondary outcomes included change in disease activity, quality of life, hospitalization, need for surgery, days off work, adverse events, and withdrawal due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data using standard forms, resolved any disagreements by consensus, and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2). We conducted separate analyses by type of control, calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) or risk differences (RDs) using the fixed-effect model unless heterogeneity was likely, and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 10 studies in the review, including 468 adult participants with ulcerative colitis. The risk of bias across these was low for most outcomes, but we considered some outcomes to have some concerns or high risk of bias due to insufficient information on concealment of allocation and outcome measurement. Based on five placebo-controlled studies, azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine may reduce the risk of failing to maintain remission. In the thiopurine group, 45% (64/143) of participants failed to maintain remission compared to 67% (96/143) of participants receiving placebo (RR 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.82; 5 studies, 286 participants; low-certainty evidence). Three studies reported withdrawals due to adverse events. Among participants on azathioprine, 4% (3/80) withdrew due to adverse events compared to 0% (0/82) of placebo participants (RD 0.04, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.09; 3 studies, 162 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is of low certainty when comparing 6-mercaptopurine to 5-aminosalicylate. Based on one three-armed trial, 27% (3/11) of 6-mercaptopurine participants failed to maintain remission compared to 100% (2/2) of 5-aminosalicylate participants (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.97; 1 study, 13 participants; low-certainty evidence). This trial also involved an induction phase; we only included the results for participants in remission. The single trial comparing 6-mercaptopurine to 5-aminosalicylate did not report separate data on adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events for the subgroup with successful induction of remission, so we could not analyze these outcomes for this comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence suggests that azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine therapy may be more effective than placebo for the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis. More research is needed to evaluate the value of therapeutic drug monitoring and the effects of various treatment modalities on long-term safety.

### Comparative onset of effect of biologics and small molecules in moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111BQ2sG]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is the most prevalent entity of inflammatory bowel disease and is associated with an increasing worldwide incidence and prevalence.UC is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially disabling disease characterised by continuous mucosal and submucosal inflammation that results in bloody diarrhea and tenesmus and has a deleterious impact on the quality of life.

First-line therapeutic options for moderate-to-severe UC include mesalamine as well as glucocorticoids followed by thiopurines. However, due to lack of efficacy and the risk of systemic adverse events especially with glucocorticoids, biological therapies, which are more specific and potent agents, are increasingly forming the backbone of the medical management of moderate-to-severe. The efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules is usually assessed after the induction period, which can be up to three to four months after treatment initiation. However, in light of the increasing diversity of mechanisms of action, the speed of onset of efficacy becomes more important in order to choose treatments and matters to clinicians and patients. As such, rapid symptomatic relief is associated with an improved quality of life and might also predict long-term outcomes and affect the disease course. Further, a recent machine learning model found that the Partial Mayo score reduction from baseline to week 2 was the most important predictor of an overall clinical response to tofacitinib at week 8. Accordingly, early clinical response is highlighted as an important short-term treatment goal in UC in the Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (STRIDE)-II recommendations. The comparative onset of effect of biological therapies and small molecule agents has not been investigated in any available systematic reviews or meta-analyses. The aim of the current study was, therefore, to provide evidence via a systematic review, meta-analysis, and network meta-analysis on the rapidity of onset of efficacy within the induction period of all biological therapies and small molecules that are approved for patients with moderate-to-severe UC.

Ulcerative colitis in biologic-exposed patients — drug-specific efficacy buckets and generalizability were established by recognizing differences in treatment efficacy between drugs within the same therapeutic class, with efficacy buckets informed by absolute risk difference over placebo in phase 3 randomized controlled trials and comparative efficacy in the network meta-analysis (NMA); based on these criteria, tofacitinib, upadacitinib, and ustekinumab were considered higher-efficacy, filgotinib, mirikizumab, risankizumab, and guselkumab intermediate-efficacy, and adalimumab, vedolizumab, ozanimod, and etrasimod lower-efficacy medications in biologic-exposed moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis; in supporting studies, > 90% of patients had exposure to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists and up to one-half in later treatment arms were also exposed to vedolizumab or other mechanisms, so no recommendations could be made for those who had specifically failed only prior non-TNF advanced therapies; furthermore, among patients who had been on 2 or more biologics previously, ozanimod was no more effective than placebo (4% vs 3%) in inducing clinical remission.

### Modern advanced therapies for inflammatory bowel diseases: practical considerations and positioning [^1164p5Es]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The therapeutic armamentarium for management of inflammatory bowel diseases has expanded dramatically in the last 5 years, with the introduction of several medications with different mechanisms of action. These include the oral small molecule drugs Janus kinase inhibitors (including upadacitinib, approved for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [UC], and tofacitinib, approved for UC) and sphingosphine 1-phosphate receptor modulators (ozanimod and etrasimod, both approved for UC), and biologic agents, such as selective interleukin-23 antagonists (risankizumab approved for Crohn's disease, and mirikizumab approved for UC). The efficacy and safety of these therapies vary. In this review, we discuss practical use of these newer advanced therapies focusing on real-world effectiveness and safety data, dosing and monitoring considerations, and special situations for their use, such as pregnancy, comorbid immune-mediated disease, use in hospitalized patients with acute severe UC, and in the perioperative setting. We also propose our approach to positioning these therapies in clinical practice, relying on careful integration of the medication's comparative effectiveness and safety in the context of an individual patient's risk of disease- and treatment-related complications and preferences.

### Comparison of the EMA and FDA guidelines on ulcerative colitis drug development [^116ZazyR]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

In 2016, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released revised EMA and new FDA draft guidelines related to the development of drugs intended for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. We sought to compare and contrast the EMA draft guideline with the FDA draft guidance to facilitate further discussion and perhaps harmonization between the 2 guidelines when they are finalized.

Methods

A concordance document was created by arranging like or similar topics addressed by the guidelines side by side in a tabular format. This concordance table served as a source for writing the narrative. The first draft was subjected to repeated rounds of reviews and revisions by the authors and outside reviewers, all of them familiar with the subject matter from a regulatory science and/or academic perspective.

Results

The FDA guidance focuses on end points, whereas the EMA guideline additionally supplies much useful information for trial design. FDA guidance appears more aspirational, suggesting the development of entirely new patient-reported outcome instruments and the incorporation of a not-yet-validated histology instrument into the definition of mucosal healing.

Conclusions

The guidelines by the FDA and the EMA complement each other and together are aimed to further practical drug development toward more clinically relevant end points in ulcerative colitis. Efforts are needed to harmonize the documents.

### Therapy of ulcerative colitis: state of the art [^116QnQA3]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Advances in conventional therapy, novel targets and therapeutic goals are the highlights of treatment for ulcerative colitis in the last year. There have also been disappointments. This review summarizes the highs and lows, with an emphasis on strategy as opposed to seeking the newest treatment option.

Recent Findings

In conventional therapy, once daily therapy for 5-aminosalicylic acid is generally sufficient. Furthermore, a new 5-aminosalicylic acid (mesalamine MMX) has been released that effectively induces and maintains remission. There have been reappraisals of immunomodulators and further evaluation of (yes, now conventional!) infliximab for ulcerative colitis. Opportunistic infections, long-term outcomes and the burden of disease are being characterized. New therapeutic targets included an antibody against T cells (anti-CD3), but trials on visilizumab for acute severe colitis have been suspended. T-cell costimulation, phosphatidylcholine to promote barrier function, new anti-tumour necrosis factor agents, B-cell (anti-CD20) depletion and complementary therapies represent new therapeutic horizons. International agreement is needed on activity indices, definitions of remission, therapeutic goals (including mucosal healing) and outcomes that matter to patients, so that trials can be compared.

Summary

Advances will take time to alter mainstream practice, but 2007–2008 is the year of organized strategies, with European, American and British guidelines on ulcerative colitis published or in press. These should be the platform for better outcomes for patients.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^113vsRTH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Key concept statements in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) management — Patients with mildly to moderately active UC who are not responsive (or are intolerant) to 5‑aminosalicylic acid (5‑ASA) therapies should be treated as patients with moderate‑to‑severe disease. Strategies for the management of the nonhospitalized patient with moderately or severely active UC are similar with the exception of a few considerations: 5‑ASA therapy could be used as monotherapy for induction of moderately but not severely active UC; in patients with moderately active UC, consider nonsystemic corticosteroids such as budesonide MMX before the use of systemic steroid therapy; in patients with severely active UC, consider systemic corticosteroids rather than topical corticosteroids; and corticosteroids may be avoided entirely when other effective induction strategies are planned. The extent of bowel involvement in moderately to severely active UC should not limit the choice of advanced therapies, including that patients with moderately to severely active isolated proctitis should have access to and be treated with therapies with demonstrated efficacy in patients with more extensive UC of similar activity. Data on combination anti‑tumor necrosis factor (anti‑TNF) and immunomodulators in moderately to severely active UC only exist for infliximab and thiopurines. The patient with nonresponse or loss of response to anti‑TNF therapy should be assessed with measurement of drug concentrations to optimize the existing therapy or to select an alternate therapy. Patients who are primary nonresponders to an anti‑TNF should be evaluated and considered for alternative mechanisms of disease control rather than cycling to another drug within the anti‑TNF class. Biosimilars to anti‑TNF therapies and to ustekinumab are acceptable substitutes for originator therapies; delays in switching should not occur and patients and clinicians should be notified about such changes. Subcutaneous infliximab and vedolizumab are considered equivalent to the standard intravenous maintenance dosing of these agents, but the equivalence of the subcutaneous formulations for induction or as substitution for escalated doses of these therapies has not been robustly established. Obtain consultation with a surgeon and consider colectomy in patients with moderately to severely active UC who are refractory or intolerant to medical therapy.

### Network meta-analysis on efficacy and safety of different biologics for ulcerative colitis [^112DZdFx]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This network meta-analysis (NMA) investigated the effectiveness of 13 biologics employed as induction therapy in addressing ulcerative colitis. The findings of the study indicated that infliximab and vedolizumab exhibit considerable clinical efficacy. Ustekinumab appears to have a favorable safety and effective profile during inducing and maintaining. In contrast, BMS-936557 exhibited high incidences of adverse reactions, necessitating caution when using the biologic. These findings can be beneficial to clinicians seeking to select the optimal biologic for treating ulcerative colitis, particularly as the number of therapeutic options for treating the condition increases. Furthermore, the study's results could inform forthcoming guidelines on biologic ulcerative colitis treatment. However, the analysis's reliability necessitates additional clinical practice comparisons, real-world validation, and long-term research to establish the biologics' safety and efficacy.

### AGA technical review on the management of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis [^111CFgxe]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Most patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) have mild-to-moderate disease activity, with low risk of colectomy, and are managed by primary care physicians or gastroenterologists. Optimal management of these patients decreases the risk of relapse and proximal disease extension, and may prevent disease progression, complications, and need for immunosuppressive therapy. With several medications (eg, sulfasalazine, diazo-bonded 5-aminosalicylates [ASA], mesalamines, and corticosteroids, including budesonide) and complex dosing formulations, regimens, and routes, to treat a disease with variable anatomic extent, there is considerable practice variability in the management of patients with mild-moderate UC. Hence, the American Gastroenterological Association prioritized clinical guidelines on this topic. To inform clinical guidelines, this technical review was developed in accordance with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework for interventional studies. Focused questions included the following: (1) comparative effectiveness and tolerability of different oral 5-ASA therapies (sulfalsalazine vs diazo-bonded 5-ASAs vs mesalamine; low- (< 2 g) vs standard (2–3 g/d) vs high-dose (> 3 g/d) mesalamine); (2) comparison of different dosing regimens (once-daily vs multiple times per day dosing) and routes (oral vs rectal vs both oral and rectal); (3) role of oral budesonide in patients mild-moderate UC; (4) comparative effectiveness and tolerability of rectal 5-ASA and corticosteroid formulations in patients with distal colitis; and (5) role of alternative therapies like probiotics, curcumin, and fecal microbiota transplantation in the management of mild-moderate UC.

Regarding medical management for ulcerative colitis, more specifically with respect to induction of remission, moderate-to-severe disease, advanced therapy, AGA 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating a higher efficacy medication (tofacitinib, upadacitinib, or ustekinumab) or an intermediate efficacy medication (filgotinib, mirikizumab, risankizumab, or guselkumab) over a lower efficacy medication (adalimumab, vedolizumab, ozanimod, or etrasimod) in adult outpatients with moderate-to-severe UC who have previously been exposed to ≥ 1 advanced therapies, particularly TNF antagonists.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^116oDuJr]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Key concept statements — ulcerative colitis in adults: 5-ASA therapy for maintenance of remission is likely not as effective in prior severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) as compared with prior moderately active UC. Budesonide MMX has not been studied for maintenance of remission of prior moderately to severely active UC. Most clinical trials and available data demonstrate a benefit of using the steroid-sparing therapy that induces remission to maintain that remission. There is insufficient evidence supporting a benefit for proactive therapeutic drug monitoring in all unselected patients with UC in remission. There is insufficient evidence to recommend assessment of serum concentrations of vedolizumab, ustekinumab, guselkumab, mirikizumab, or risankizumab. Patients with moderately to severely active UC who do not maintain remission despite optimized medical therapy should be considered for elective proctocolectomy. A patient with moderately to severely active disease (regardless of the extent of bowel involvement [including isolated proctitis]) should be treated with therapies that have demonstrated efficacy for the activity and severity of the disease.

Regarding medical management for ulcerative colitis, more specifically with respect to maintenance of remission, moderate-to-severe disease, thiopurines and methotrexate, ACG 2025 guidelines recommend to consider initiating thiopurines over corticosteroids for maintenance of remission in patients with prior moderate-to-severely active UC currently in remission due to corticosteroid induction.

3.5 Initial treatment of active UC with 5-ASA

Statement 3. We recommend that mild to moderate ulcerative colitis should be managed with oral 5-ASA 2–3 g/day (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). We recommend the addition of 5-ASA enemas, rather than oral treatment alone (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. Agreement: 95.6%).

Statement 4. We suggest that ulcerative colitis patients flaring on 5-ASA therapy should receive dose escalation to 4–4.8 g/day orally alongside 5-ASA enemas (GRADE: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 82.2%).

Oral 5-ASA (5-aminosalicylic acid) is the standard therapy for mild to moderately active UC. Meta-analyses support the efficacy of oral 5-ASA for induction therapy for mild to moderately active UC. Once daily dosing is as effective as divided doses. Doses ≥ 2 g/day are more effective than dosages < 2 g/day for remission (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.85 to 0.98). The majority of patients with mild to moderate UC will respond to 2–3 g 5-ASA (depending on formulation used) and higher doses can be used in those with more severe symptoms or those not responding initially.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^1147iqfS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

ACG guideline — Grading of recommendations and implications for ulcerative colitis care states that factors influencing the strength of the recommendation include the quality of the evidence, clinical and patient-reported outcomes, risk of harm, and costs/ healthcare resource utilization. Strong recommendations are offered when the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects, with patient implications that most individuals would prefer the recommended course and clinician implications that most patients should receive the recommended course or an alternative with similar strength. Conditional recommendations are offered when trade-offs are less certain — either because of low quality evidence or because evidence suggests that desirable and undesirable effects are closely balanced, with patient implications that some individuals would want the suggested course while others may not and clinician implications that a shared decision-making model considering patient values and preferences is appropriate.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis [^114kakR6]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

AGA ulcerative colitis guideline — adding rectal mesalamine to oral 5-ASA in extensive or left-sided mild–moderate disease: In patients with extensive or left-sided mild–moderate ulcerative colitis, the AGA suggests adding rectal mesalamine to oral 5-ASA. Conditional recommendation, moderate quality evidence. For patients with extensive mild–moderate ulcerative colitis, the AGA suggests adding rectal mesalamine to oral 5-ASA therapy, with randomized controlled trials showing combination therapy was significantly more effective for induction of remission (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49–0.94) and superior to oral 5-ASA alone for maintenance of remission (RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.20–0.97). In maintenance trials, enemas were used twice per week or for 1 week per month, and both oral and topical mesalamine were well tolerated.
