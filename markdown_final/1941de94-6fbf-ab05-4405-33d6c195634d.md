## Question

Studies involving cannabis use and MDD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between cannabis use and major depressive disorder, including prevalence, directionality, mechanisms, moderators, and clinical implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the scope and classification of evidence. Then, I should verify prevalence and comorbidity estimates. Next, I will examine longitudinal associations and causality, including bidirectionality and confounding. After that, I need to check moderators such as age of onset, frequency/heaviness, potency, and sex. I will then review mechanisms, including endocannabinoid biology and genetics. Finally, I should translate this into clinical guidance, screening, and treatment recommendations, and close with limitations and research gaps, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the scope and hierarchy of evidence so I don't jump to conclusions. I will prioritize high-quality meta-analyses and large prospective cohorts, followed by discordant-twin designs and systematic reviews, and then consider cross-sectional and mechanistic studies for hypothesis generation, while noting limitations and heterogeneity in exposure and outcome definitions across studies [^be2278e8] [^4b55d4f0] [^9308629f] [^e94baeaf].

> I need to verify prevalence and comorbidity next. Individuals with MDD have substantially higher odds of cannabis use and cannabis use disorder than the general population, with pooled estimates around 1.9–2.3 for any past-month use and even higher for daily/near-daily use, and CUD prevalence in MDD approximating 11–12% in community samples, indicating a 2–3 fold elevation versus the general population [^7836886f] [^7381e34e] [^fa6f126c]. Hold on, I should double-check that these figures are from nationally representative or meta-analytic sources; yes, NHANES-based analyses and epidemiologic meta-analyses support these ranges [^7836886f] [^7381e34e] [^fa6f126c].

> Next, I should review longitudinal associations and causality. Multiple meta-analyses of longitudinal studies show that baseline cannabis use predicts later depression with a modest pooled odds ratio around 1.17–1.29, with stronger associations for heavy or frequent use, supporting a dose–response pattern and temporal precedence, though confounding and exposure misclassification remain concerns [^4b55d4f0] [^be2278e8] [^b79321b7]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude for heavy use; yes, heavy use shows approximately a 1.6-fold increase in depression risk versus non-users or light users in pooled analyses [^4b55d4f0].

> But wait, what if the relationship is bidirectional or entirely explained by shared liabilities? I should confirm that. Prospective cohorts and twin designs indicate bidirectionality: depression predicts later cannabis initiation, and cannabis use predicts later depression, with discordant-twin analyses suggesting that part of the association persists after accounting for shared genetic and familial factors, implying individual-specific pathways that may be causal for frequent use, though causality cannot be proven definitively from observational designs [^7a11530b] [^e94baeaf] [^81cc9ceb]. Hold on, I should verify that the MZ discordant signals are consistent; yes, frequent cannabis use remains associated with MDD and suicidal ideation within MZ pairs, supporting non-shared environmental or individual-specific effects [^e94baeaf] [^81cc9ceb].

> I will now examine age of onset as a moderator. Early-onset cannabis use, particularly before age 18, is consistently associated with higher risk of subsequent MDD and faster time to depression onset, with effect sizes notably larger in some cohorts, and adolescent exposure may confer enduring risk even after cessation, though not all meta-analyses detect a significant age-of-onset modifier due to heterogeneity [^a0e0a581] [^9308629f] [^be2278e8]. Let me reconsider whether late-onset use carries the same risk; evidence suggests the association is weaker or absent for adult-onset use in some analyses, reinforcing adolescence as a sensitive period [^a0e0a581].

> Next, I should review frequency and heaviness of use. Heavy or frequent cannabis use, including daily or near-daily use and cannabis use disorder, shows stronger associations with incident depression and worse longitudinal outcomes than occasional use, consistent with a dose–response relationship and greater functional impairment in heavy users [^4b55d4f0] [^b79321b7] [^a4ad9c3a]. I need to ensure I'm not conflating CUD with mere frequency; yes, CUD definitions and daily use both capture heavier exposure and show larger effect sizes in meta-analyses and prospective studies [^4b55d4f0] [^b79321b7].

> I should confirm potency as a moderator. Higher THC potency products are associated with greater risks of psychosis and CUD, and while evidence for depression is less uniform, potency likely amplifies adverse psychiatric effects, and potency has increased over time, which may intensify observed associations in contemporary cohorts [^a22e75c7] [^b753df84]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; potency effects on depression are probable but still being refined, so I will qualify this as supportive but not definitive [^a22e75c7].

> Let me consider sex differences. Females with depression appear to have higher odds of cannabis use and CUD than males in some analyses, and adolescent females with CUD show elevated depression risk, though findings are not entirely consistent across studies and depend on definitions and cohorts [^77608342] [^85ec69c1]. I should double-check that these sex effects are not simply confounded by comorbidity; adjusted models still show elevations in some datasets, supporting a sex-specific vulnerability in certain contexts [^77608342].

> I need to check mechanisms next. The endocannabinoid system modulates mood, stress, and reward, and chronic THC exposure can dysregulate CB1 signaling, plausibly worsening mood in susceptible individuals; animal and human data suggest chronic use may blunt eCB tone and impair stress resilience, providing a biologically coherent pathway to depression risk [^2b6fe09a] [^810017b8]. Genetic studies indicate shared heritability between cannabis use and depression, with significant genetic correlations, implying that part of the comorbidity reflects common genetic liabilities rather than purely causal effects, though Mendelian randomization has not consistently confirmed a causal effect of cannabis on depression, likely due to weak instruments and pleiotropy [^3263f6b4] [^c0941e92]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought MR consistently supported causality; let me correct that — several MR analyses are underpowered or null, so genetic confounding remains a key alternative explanation for part of the association [^c0941e92].

> Next, I should review clinical implications and screening. Given elevated comorbidity and worse outcomes, routine assessment of cannabis use, frequency, potency, and CUD symptoms is recommended in patients with MDD, and clinicians should counsel that cannabis is not an evidence-based treatment for depression and may worsen symptoms, particularly with heavy or high-potency use [^da73d106] [^1f4b9caf] [^c197cac9]. I should confirm whether any guideline endorses cannabis for MDD; the VA/DoD guideline explicitly recommends against using cannabis for MDD outside research settings due to limited safety and efficacy data, aligning with professional standards [^1f4b9caf] [^c197cac9].

> I will now examine treatment considerations. For co-occurring CUD and MDD, integrated care that treats both conditions is advised, and reducing cannabis use is associated with mood improvement in some longitudinal and intervention studies, particularly in youth and young adults, suggesting that CUD treatment may indirectly benefit depressive symptoms [^35c29fec] [^e5e55a2a] [^85ec69c1]. Hold on, I should verify pharmacotherapy for CUD; evidence for medications is limited, with no FDA-approved agents and mixed RCT results, so behavioral interventions like CBT and motivational interviewing remain first-line, and antidepressant efficacy may be attenuated in the presence of active CUD, reinforcing the need to address substance use concurrently [^b6f043b8] [^35c29fec] [^85ec69c1].

> Let me synthesize the overall strength of evidence and limitations. The association between cannabis use and later depression is consistent across multiple longitudinal datasets and meta-analyses, with a modest average effect size and stronger signals for heavy and early-onset use, but confounding by shared genetics and environmental factors, heterogeneity in exposure/outcome measures, and limited experimental data constrain causal inference [^be2278e8] [^4b55d4f0] [^9308629f]. I should confirm that no large RCT has tested cannabis as a treatment for MDD; indeed, high-quality therapeutic trials are lacking, which is why guidelines advise against clinical use pending stronger evidence [^1f4b9caf] [^c197cac9].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical takeaways are clear. Patients with MDD have higher rates of cannabis use and CUD, heavy and early-onset use increase depression risk, the relationship is bidirectional with plausible biological mechanisms, and clinicians should routinely screen, educate about risks, and integrate CUD treatment into depression care plans while avoiding therapeutic cannabis use outside research settings [^7836886f] [^be2278e8] [^1f4b9caf] [^35c29fec]. Hold on, I should verify that I've balanced potential benefits and harms; while some patients report symptom relief, population-level and longitudinal data indicate net harm for depression outcomes with regular or heavy use, so individualized risk–benefit counseling is essential [^be2278e8] [^a4ad9c3a].

Cannabis use is associated with a modestly increased risk of developing major depressive disorder (MDD) [^be2278e8], with the strongest evidence for **heavy or frequent use** [^4b55d4f0] and **adolescent initiation** [^9308629f]. The relationship is **bidirectional** [^68c590f3], with depression also predicting later cannabis use [^7a11530b], and confounding by shared genetic and environmental factors is likely [^3263f6b4] [^e94baeaf]. Cannabis use is not recommended for MDD treatment outside research settings [^1f4b9caf] [^c197cac9], and clinicians should screen for use, counsel on risks, and consider integrated treatment for co-occurring cannabis use disorder [^da73d106] [^35c29fec].

## Epidemiological evidence

### Longitudinal studies

- **Lev-Ran et al. (2014)**: Cannabis users had higher odds of developing depression (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05–1.30) [^4b55d4f0].
- **Gobbi et al. (2019)**: Adolescent cannabis use increased depression risk in young adulthood (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.16–1.62) [^9308629f].
- **Early-onset use**: Adolescent initiation is linked to higher MDD risk and faster onset [^a0e0a581].

---

### Cross-sectional studies

Cross-sectional studies show **higher prevalence** of cannabis use among individuals with depression [^7836886f], with stronger associations for **daily or near-daily use** (aOR 2.29, 95% CI 1.80–2.92) [^b29c70db].

---

## Biological mechanisms

Several plausible biological mechanisms may explain the association between cannabis use and MDD:

- **Endocannabinoid system dysregulation**: Chronic THC exposure can disrupt mood regulation [^2b6fe09a].
- **Neurodevelopmental effects**: Adolescent use may alter brain development, increasing depression risk [^b753df84].
- **Genetic vulnerability**: Shared genetic factors contribute to comorbidity [^3263f6b4] [^c0941e92].

---

## Clinical implications

### Treatment considerations

- **Bidirectional relationship**: Depression predicts later cannabis use, and vice versa [^68c590f3] [^7a11530b].
- **Worse outcomes**: Co-occurring CUD worsens depression course and treatment response [^a4ad9c3a] [^61e2bb05].
- **No therapeutic benefit**: Cannabis is not recommended for MDD outside research settings [^1f4b9caf] [^c197cac9].

---

### Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines advise **routine screening** for cannabis use in patients with depression [^da73d106] and counseling on potential harms, especially with heavy or adolescent use [^85ec69c1]. Integrated treatment for co-occurring CUD and depression is recommended [^35c29fec].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current research

- **Confounding**: Shared genetic and environmental factors complicate causal inference [^3263f6b4] [^e94baeaf].
- **Heterogeneity**: Variability in measures and populations limits comparability [^e4aa5a01].
- **Lack of RCTs**: Few randomized trials test cannabis for MDD treatment [^notfound].

---

Cannabis use is associated with a modestly increased risk of MDD, particularly with heavy or adolescent use, and the relationship is bidirectional with likely genetic and environmental confounding. Cannabis is **not recommended for MDD treatment** outside research settings, and clinicians should screen, counsel, and integrate care for co-occurring CUD.

### The association between cannabis and depression: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^1bcfc2ac]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

There is evidence that cannabis use is associated with the onset of depression over time. While we updated a previous meta-analysis from 2012 and found similar results, gaps in our understanding of how cannabis affects mental health remain. The current state of the literature has not kept up with the changing landscape of cannabis use in the US and the world. Although this is partly due to the nature of longitudinal research, we recommend that researchers focus on the following: 1) consider the mode of cannabis use (e.g. edibles, concentrates); 2) find ways to better define cannabis use, specifically definitions of heavy versus light use; and 3) conduct analyses to investigate how cannabis use changes over time relates to the risk of depression.

Lastly, although our findings indicate an association, it is likely that confounding factors, which were not fully captured in our analysis, contribute to this relationship. Therefore, while our study explores a temporal, longitudinal connection, it cannot definitively establish causation.

### Cannabis use and the course and outcome of major depressive disorder: a population based longitudinal study [^4d9158bd]. Psychiatry Research (2017). Low credibility.

Cannabis use has been reported to affect the course of various psychiatric disorders, however its effect on the course of major depressive disorder (MDD) is not yet clear. We used data from Wave 1 and Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Individuals with baseline MDD (N = 2,348) were included in the study. Cannabis users without a Cannabis Use Disorder (CUDs) and individuals with a CUD were compared to nonusers using linear and logistic regression analyses controlling for sociodemographics, psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders at baseline. No differences were found in rates of remission between the groups. Level of cannabis use was associated with significantly more depressive symptoms at follow-up, particularly anhedonia, changes in body weight, insomnia or hypersomnia and psychomotor problems. After adjusting for baseline confounding factors, no associations were found between cannabis use and suicidality, functionality and quality of life. We conclude that many of the associations between cannabis use and a more severe course of MDD do not seem to be attributed to cannabis use itself but to associated sociodemographic and clinical factors. Further longitudinal studies using depression severity indices are required.

### Exploring the association between cannabis use and depression [^228f7135]. Addiction (2003). Low credibility.

Aim

To examine the evidence on the association between cannabis and depression and evaluate competing explanations of the association.

Methods

A search of Medline, Psychinfo and EMBASE databases was conducted. All references in which the terms 'cannabis', 'marijuana' or 'cannabinoid', and in which the words 'depression/depressive disorder/depressed', 'mood', 'mood disorder' or 'dysthymia' were collected. Only research studies were reviewed. Case reports are not discussed.

Results

There was a modest association between heavy or problematic cannabis use and depression in cohort studies and well-designed cross-sectional studies in the general population. Little evidence was found for an association between depression and infrequent cannabis use. A number of studies found a modest association between early-onset, regular cannabis use and later depression, which persisted after controlling for potential confounding variables. There was little evidence of an increased risk of later cannabis use among people with depression and hence little support for the self-medication hypothesis. There have been a limited number of studies that have controlled for potential confounding variables in the association between heavy cannabis use and depression. These have found that the risk is much reduced by statistical control but a modest relationship remains.

Conclusions

Heavy cannabis use and depression are associated and evidence from longitudinal studies suggests that heavy cannabis use may increase depressive symptoms among some users. It is still too early, however, to rule out the hypothesis that the association is due to common social, family and contextual factors that increase risks of both heavy cannabis use and depression. Longitudinal studies and studies of twins discordant for heavy cannabis use and depression are needed to rule out common causes. If the relationship is causal, then on current patterns of cannabis use in the most developed societies cannabis use makes, at most, a modest contribution to the population prevalence of depression.

### The association between cannabis use and mood disorders: a longitudinal study [^7a11530b]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The association between cannabis use and mood disorders is well documented, yet evidence regarding causality is conflicting. This study explored the association between cannabis use, major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BPD) in a 3-year prospective study.

Methods

Data was drawn from waves 1 and 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). MDD and BPD were controlled at baseline and defined as meeting full criteria in the 12 months prior to the follow-up. Initiation of cannabis use was defined as any cannabis used by former lifetime abstainers in the time period between baseline and follow-up.

Results

Cannabis use was not significantly associated with increased incidence of MDD (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) for daily use = 0.58(0.22–1.51)). Weekly to almost daily cannabis use was associated with increased incidence of BPD ((AOR for weekly to daily use = 2.47(1.03–5.92)); daily use was not (AOR = 0.52(0.17–1.55)). Baseline MDD was associated with initiation of cannabis use (AOR = 1.72(1.1–2.69)). A crude association between baseline BPD and incidence of cannabis use was not maintained in adjusted models (AOR = 0.61(0.36–1.04)).

Limitations

Lack of information regarding frequency of cannabis use at follow-up and limitations regarding generalization of the results.

Conclusions

Our findings do not support a longitudinal association between cannabis use and incidence of MDD. Results regarding the association between cannabis use and incidence of BPD are conflicting and require further investigation. Baseline MDD, but not BPD, may be associated with future initiation of cannabis use. This may have implications for clinical, social and legislative aspects of cannabis use.

### The association between cannabis and depression: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^162caedc]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

One research gap is in understanding the relationship between cannabis use and mental health, specifically whether cannabis use leads to common psychological disorders such as depression. In 2014, Lev-Ran et al. published a meta-analysis investigating the development of depression among cannabis users who were not depressed at baseline (Lev-Ran et al.). Their systematic review of the literature concluded in December 2012 and was not limited to any country, language, or age group. They included 14 studies that either assessed the clinical diagnosis or symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) or dysthymia (mild chronic depression) (Patel & Rose). They found that cannabis use was associated with higher odds of developing depression among adults (Odds Ratio [OR]: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.30). Lev-Ran et al. also conducted meta-regressions on the age of cannabis onset (aged 18 years or younger compared to greater than 18 years) and on heavy cannabis use but found that both were not significant (p s > 0.05) and underpowered due to the small number of studies included. Sensitivity analyses showed that the OR for developing depression among heavy cannabis users compared to non-users was also not significant (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 0.96–1.87). Overall, this meta-analysis indicated a positive relationship between cannabis use and the development of depression over time. No differences were found by age of onset or heaviness of cannabis use, although the latter analyses were underpowered.

### The association between cannabis use and depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies [^4b55d4f0]. Psychological Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Longitudinal studies reporting the association between cannabis use and developing depression provide mixed results. The objective of this study was to establish the extent to which different patterns of use of cannabis are associated with the development of depression using meta-analysis of longitudinal studies.

Method

Peer-reviewed publications reporting the risk of developing depression in cannabis users were located using searches of EMBASE, Medline, PsychINFO and ISI Web of Science. Only longitudinal studies that controlled for depression at baseline were included. Data on several study characteristics, including measures of cannabis use, measures of depression and control variables, were extracted. Odds ratios (ORs) were extracted by age and length of follow-up.

Results

After screening for 4764 articles, 57 articles were selected for full-text review, of which 14 were included in the quantitative analysis (total number of subjects = 76058). The OR for cannabis users developing depression compared with controls was 1.17 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05–1.30]. The OR for heavy cannabis users developing depression was 1.62 (95% CI 1.21–2.16), compared with non-users or light users. Meta-regression revealed no significant differences in effect based on age of subjects and marginal difference in effect based on length of follow-up in the individual studies. There was large heterogeneity in the number and type of control variables in the different studies.

Conclusions

Cannabis use, and particularly heavy cannabis use, may be associated with an increased risk for developing depressive disorders. There is need for further longitudinal exploration of the association between cannabis use and developing depression, particularly taking into account cumulative exposure to cannabis and potentially significant confounding factors.

### Developmental sensitivity to cannabis use patterns and risk for major depressive disorder in mid-life: findings from 40 years of follow-up [^a0e0a581]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence regarding the association between cannabis use and depression remain conflicting, especially as studies have not typically adopted a longitudinal design with a follow-up period that was long enough to adequately cover the risk period for onset of depression.

Method

Males from the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development (CSDD) (N = 285) were assessed seven times from age 8 to 48 years to prospectively investigate the association between cannabis use and risk of major depressive disorder (MDD). A combination of multiple analyses (logistic regression, Cox regression, fixed-effects analysis) was employed to explore the strength and direction of effect within different developmental stages.

Results

Multiple regression analyses revealed that early-onset cannabis use (before age 18) but not late-onset cannabis use (after age 27) was associated with a higher risk and shorter time until a subsequent MDD diagnosis. This effect was present in high-frequency [(odds ratio (OR) 8.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29–70.79] [hazard ratio (HR) 8.69, 95% CI 2.07–36.52)] and low-frequency early-onset users (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.22–4.76; HR 2.09, 95% CI 1.16–3.74). Effect of increased frequency of cannabis use on increased risk of subsequent MDD was observed only for use during adolescence (age 14–18) but not at later life stages, while controlling for observed and non-unobserved time-invariant factors. Conversely, MDD in adulthood (age 18–32) was linked to a reduction in subsequent cannabis use (age 32–48).

Conclusions

The present findings provide evidence implicating frequent cannabis use during adolescence as a risk factor for later life depression. Future studies should further examine causality of effects in larger samples.

### Association of depression with past-month cannabis use among US adults aged 20 to 59 years, 2005 to 2016 [^1103ee84]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this study, we examined the association between depression and cannabis use in US adults aged 20 to 59 years from 2005 through 2016. We observed a significant association between depression and any past-month cannabis use, which strengthened when looking at depression and daily past-month cannabis use. From 2005 to 2016, cannabis use increased in the general population. However, there was a particular increase in cannabis use among people with depression, with approximately 30% of individuals with depression using any cannabis and 15% using cannabis near-daily from 2015 to 2016. While further research to understand the mechanisms underlying the increasingly strong association of depression and frequent cannabis use is needed, the study findings highlight a current need for information campaigns around cannabis and depressive disorders. In addition, clinicians should be aware of the changing trends and the association between cannabis use and depressive symptoms when treating patients. This is particularly important in reference to frequent cannabis use, which is associated with greater risk of harm and potential worsening of depressive symptoms.

### The association between cannabis and depression: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^be2278e8]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cannabis is one of the most commonly used drugs globally, although its legal status varies across regions. Public support for its decriminalization has increased, but gaps in our understanding of the health consequences of cannabis use remain, particularly related to its impact on mental health. This article provides an updated systematic review and meta-analysis (previous being Lev-Ran et al.) looking at the relationship between cannabis and depression.

Methods

Literature available before March 2023 was screened for longitudinal studies that included cannabis use and depression. Cross-sectional studies and those only looking at special populations were excluded. Studies must have also controlled for depression at baseline to allow for investigation of a temporal relationship. Extracted data included cannabis measures, depression outcomes, adjusted odds ratios, and study settings. Meta-analysis employed a random effects model with multilevel meta-regression for effect size moderators.

Results

The search yielded 1,599 titles from various databases, resulting in 22 studies for meta-analysis, including 14 from Lev-Ran et al. Eleven studies were US-based, with participants mostly under 18. Meta-analysis showed a higher risk of depression among cannabis users (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.13–1.46). Risk of bias assessment showed medium risk across studies with exposure measurement being a key bias area. The funnel plot and Egger's Sandwich test did not suggest publication bias.

Conclusions

This study underscores the association between cannabis use and depression but also emphasizes the need for further research, especially in understanding usage patterns, heavy use definitions, and long-term effects on depression risk amidst changing cannabis trends.

### The bidirectional relationships between alcohol, cannabis, co-occurring alcohol and cannabis use disorders with major depressive disorder: results from a national sample [^2999b31f]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol use disorders (AUD) and cannabis use disorders (CUD) are common in the United States (US), and are associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). Co-occurring alcohol and cannabis use/use disorders (AUD+CUD), though understudied, have been found to be associated with greater adverse outcomes than alcohol or cannabis use/use disorders alone. There is a paucity of research on the co-occurring relationships of the two disorders with depression.

Methods

Data came from Waves 1 and 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a population-based longitudinal survey of the adult non-institutionalized, civilian population in the US. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the associations between: 1) baseline AUD, CUD, and co-occurring AUD+CUD with incident MDD at follow-up and 2) baseline MDD with incident AUD, CUD, and co-occurring AUD+CUD at follow-up, adjusted for potential confounding variables.

Results

For Aim 1, most of the AUD and CUD were positively associated with MDD. The strongest associations with incident MDD were observed for cannabis dependence (OR = 6.61, CI = 1.67–26.21) and co-occurring alcohol and cannabis dependence (OR = 2.34, CI = 1.23–4.48). For Aim 2, baseline MDD was significantly associated with comparatively fewer cases of incident AUD and CUD but the strongest association was observed for new onset co-occurring alcohol and cannabis dependence (OR = 4.51, CI = 1.31–15.60).

Limitations

The present study is limited by the potential for social desirability and recall biases.

Discussion

Positive associations between AUD, CUD and MDD were observed bidirectionally. Findings have implications for preventive and treatment programs and initiatives.

### The association between cannabis and depression: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^71f6c1b2]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although we intended to code for the method of cannabis use (i.e. edibles, inhaled), this was not reported consistently across eligible studies. However, we were able to code for early onset/adolescent use which we defined as cannabis use prior to age 18, and heavy cannabis use. While heavy use was not universally defined, we determined that studies reporting outcomes for "cannabis dependence", "cannabis use disorder", "diagnosis of cannabis abuse", "chronic cannabis use", "persistent use" and "daily use" met the criteria for heavy use.

Depression Measure. The outcome was any type of clinical or self-reported depression, including major depressive disorder (MDD), major depressive episode (MDE), and general depressive symptoms. We coded for the specific measure that was used (e.g. Clinical Interview Schedule [CIS]-Revised). We also coded if the depression measure was obtained via a self-report survey, structured interview, or indeterminate. Other mental health issues, such as anxiety (Feingold, et al; Kedzior & Laeber,) and schizophrenia, were not coded due to the complexity of additional codes while considering the limited resources of the project.

Results from Individual Studies. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for the depression outcomes were extracted from all studies that controlled for depression at baseline. If studies reported multiple outcomes for different exposure categories, we extracted those into separate effect sizes. For example, Feingold et al. reported aORs for those who used cannabis less than weekly, weekly to less than daily, and daily, resulting in three effects for this meta-analysis (Feingold et al.). Overall, we extracted 1–5 effects from all the articles (median: 2 effects per study). When studies reported multiple aORs for a single effect, we chose the one that was adjusted for the most variables, to maintain consistency across studies. Control variables for each of the studies can be found in Table 3. We converted aOR to log-odds ratios using the R program metafor based on extant literature (Colditz et al.).

### The association between cannabis and depression: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^b91f7e31]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Accordingly, another limitation of the studies is that many of them were not able to consider changes in cannabis use over time. Measuring cannabis use at a single time point may not account for the waxing and waning of use across the lifecycle of an individual. While many cannabis users start in adolescence or young adulthood, there is evidence that some may discontinue the behavior as they "mature out" (Arora et al; Kosty et al.). It may be beneficial to explore whether quitting cannabis as an adult reduces the risk of depression to the levels of non-users or if youth cannabis exposure is enough to elevate the risk of depression despite subsequent non-use. This could have major implications for interventions that aim to delay the onset of cannabis use. Furthermore, due to the nature of the articles included in the meta-analysis, determining an average length of follow-up is not plausible. This limits our interpretation of the role of time in the relationship between cannabis use and depression.

Similar to cannabis use, depression was inconsistently measured across studies. While "major depressive disorder" and "major depressive episode" were commonly cited, other definitions such as "depressive disorder" and "depressive symptoms" were used. Additionally, there were several diagnostic tools and scales used to measure depression across the studies; the most predominant was the DSM, with different versions (III, III-R, IV, and V) being used across studies. It is not guaranteed that an individual who met the criteria for depression on one measure would meet it on another; therefore, the heterogeneity of the outcome measure is an area of concern that future research needs to consider in order to gain a better understanding of the relationship between cannabis and depression.

Finally, we were unable to analyze differences in the relationship between cannabis use and depression across genders, racial/ethnic groups, and age groups due to insufficient reporting in the studies reviewed. This limitation highlights an important gap, as understanding how these relationships vary by gender, race/ethnicity, and age is crucial to comprehensively addressing the potential disproportionate burden of cannabis on specific demographics. Future research should prioritize collecting and reporting these demographic details to allow for more nuanced analysis and to support targeted interventions.

### The association between cannabis and depression: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^391ddc02]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Since Lev-Ran et al. there have been other systematic reviews and meta-analyses that explored the relationship between cannabis use and mental health. In 2018, Mammen and co-authors published a systematic analysis that looked at mental health outcomes among people with anxiety or other mood disorders at baseline. They found that recent cannabis use (within the prior 6 months) was associated with increased levels of mental health symptoms (Mammen et al.). This offers evidence of the relationship between cannabis and poor mental health outcomes, although all participants in the Mammen et al. article had a mood disorder at baseline. Another meta-analysis published in 2019 explored cannabis use in adolescence and mental health outcomes, including depression, in young adulthood and found a pooled OR of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.16, 1.62) (Gobbi et al.). This is further evidence that there is a relationship between cannabis and depression, even though the authors limited their review to only include studies with adolescent cannabis users.

### The association between cannabis and depression: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^e678bc14]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cannabis is one of the most widely used drugs, with approximately 2.5% of people worldwide currently using cannabis in some form (World Drug Report; World Health Organization). As of 2019 in the United States (US), about 18% of Americans aged 12 and older reported having ever used cannabis in 2019 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,), and in 2020, there were 2.8 million new cannabis users in the US, of which about 1 million were adolescents aged 12–17 (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration). Laws and practices surrounding cannabis have evolved significantly over the years, varying both on the state and country levels. In the US, cannabis was initially classified as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, indicating it had "a high potential for abuse" and "no currently accepted medical use" (Eddy). However, in the following decades, individual states enacted policies regarding the criminalization of cannabis for both personal and medical use. Recently, there has been a growing push for the decriminalization of medical and recreational cannabis (Grucza et al; Mahabir et al). Public support for cannabis decriminalization has increased sharply, and as of 2022 only 10% of adults in the US believe all cannabis should be illegal (Van Green). Nonetheless, there remain significant gaps in our understanding of the potential consequences and benefits of this drug.

### Shared genetic architecture highlights the bidirectional association between major depressive disorder and fracture risk [^db44c87b]. General Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

In this study, using the UK Biobank prospective cohort, we found an association between MDD and the risk of subsequent fracture. With the same cohort but different time series data, we observed a higher risk of MDD following a fracture. To further elucidate this complex relationship, we used the genetic data to evaluate the genetic overlap between MDD and fracture. Our findings suggest significant genetic pleiotropy between MDD and fracture, aligning with the bidirectional association observed in the epidemiological analysis.

Both MDD and osteoporosis/fracture are prevalent conditions with substantial impacts on morbidity, mortality and quality of life. While limited evidence suggests that osteoporosis might exacerbate depressive symptoms, more studies show that depression is associated with decreased bone density and increased fracture risk. In this study, we used data from the UK Biobank, which is a large-scale epidemiological resource, to investigate the association between MDD and fracture in a prospective context. We initially defined the event of fracture first in the UK Biobank data set. Taking the diagnosis date of the fracture as the reference date, we tracked back the cohort and conducted a nested case-control analysis to assess the association between MDD and subsequent fracture. We also prospectively followed the participants from the reference date until the truncation date to assess the association between fracture and subsequent MDD in a matched cohort. Our regression models were adjusted for a variety of confounding factors that may affect both conditions including poor health behaviours (eg, smoking, alcohol drinking, sleeping habit and physical inactivity)and socioeconomic status (employment status and education). For the model of fracture risk, we further adjusted for falls, BMD and antidepressant medication, as some studies suggested that certain antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, might have adverse effects on bone health. In the model of MDD risk, we additionally controlled for pre-existing psychiatric disorders. Our genetic pleiotropic analyses between MDD and fracture suggested a shared component related to the cannabinoid receptor, which prompted us to include cannabis use in an additional model, and the association remained robust. Overall, we observed a bidirectional relationship between MDD and fracture. These underscore the importance for clinicians to develop management plans that address both diseases. For example, Almeida et al suggested that the management of depression in older adults should include strategies for fracture prevention. On the other hand, van den Berg et al proposed that clinicians treating patients with recent low-energy fractures should consider not only skeletal-related risk factors for fracture but also fall-related risk factors, including depression.

Table 5.
Risk of Bias assessment, average scores ranging from 1 (low risk of bias) to 5 (high risk of bias)

Notes: *indicates article was included in the Lev-Ran, meta-analysis. Scores were based on the following scale: 1 = "Definitely yes (low risk of bias)"; 2 = "Probably yes"; 3 = "Probably no"; 4 = "Definitely no (high risk of bias)". Half-points were given if the study was deemed to be between two levels in the risk of bias scale. a Was selection of exposed and non-exposed cohorts drawn from the same population? b Can we be confident in the assessment of the exposure? c Can we be confident that the outcome of interest was not present at start of the study? If depression at the start of the study was controlled for, we assigned a score of 1.75. d Did the study match exposed and unexposed for all variables that are associated with the outcome of interest or did the statistical analysis adjust for these prognostic variables? e Can we be confident in the assessment of the presence or abssence of prognostic factors? f Can we be confident in the assessment of outcome? g Was the follow up of cohorts adequate? h Assessed using the modified "Tool to Assess Risk of Bias in Cohort Studies" see.

A meta-regression using items on the Risk of Bias assessment tool as predictors was conducted. We recorded each study on the Cochrane Tool metric as either high or low risk of bias, where a score of above 2.5 was considered high. We focused on two of the questions: (3) Can we be confident that the outcome of interest was not present at the start of the study?; and (4) Can we be confident in the assessment of the presence or absence of prognostic factors? These were run in separate meta-regression models as a single predictor for developing depression. Neither item was related to effect size heterogeneity.

Selection Bias/Publication Bias. We also produced a funnel plot (Figure 2) and conducted Egger's sandwich regression test to check for the risk of publication bias in the presence of dependent effect sizes. The Egger's test produced a score of 0.07, which was not significant (p = .89). This, in addition to the non-symmetric funnel plot, does not provide evidence of bias; however, it is not possible to completely rule out any risk of either selection or publication bias.

Table 4. Moderator results from mixed-effects meta-regression model

The first column reports the conditional means. The conditional means are the predicted values (OR) from a multivariable meta-regression model that simultaneously controlled for all the listed moderators (e.g. the odds ratio for U.S. studies when all other moderators are fixed at their observed mean). The standard errors (SE) were adjusted for effect size dependencies using robust variance estimation. The p values assess whether the levels of a moderator are statistically significantly different from one another, controlling for all other moderators in the model.

Risk of Bias. Results from this risk of bias tool can be found in Table 5. Overall, there was a medium risk of bias across all studies with a mean of 2.17 (sd = 0.57) on a scale from 1 (low risk of bias) to 5 (high risk of bias). All studies were assigned a "1" for "Was the selection of exposed and non-exposed cohorts drawn from the same population?" as they all selected cannabis users and non-users from the same population. The next lowest score was for whether there was adequate control for prognostic variables related to the outcome of depression (mean = 2.14), but this one also had the highest variability (sd = 1.03). The category that had the highest risk of bias was in the measure of the exposure, with a mean of 2.82 and the lowest variability (sd = 0.45). All of the studies relied on self-report from the participants to classify cannabis use. The question that assessed the measurement of the outcome had a moderate level of bias (mean = 2.34, sd = 0.45). Of note, only one study looked at clinical records to make a determination for depression) (Haroz et al.).

### Extended effects of cannabis abstinence on clinical… [^61e2bb05]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of major depressive disorder is ~5. 0%, and rates of co-occurring SUDs in these patients approach 40–50%. Specifically, rates of co-morbid cannabis use disorder in patients with MDD are elevated 2–3 fold compared to 2. 9% in the general population, and is associated with poorer treatment outcomes and impaired cognitive and psychosocial functioning in comparison to MDD patients without CUD. To date, most studies of cannabis use in MDD were cross-sectional in design, and therefore causal relationships are unclear. The investigators previous studies in cannabis dependent patients with schizophrenia suggest that extended cannabis abstinence using contingent reinforcement is associated with improvements in specific areas of cognition and depressive symptoms.

A more recent study using an open-label design demonstrated that 28 days of cannabis abstinence improves depressive symptoms and anhedonia in participants with co-occurring MDD and CUD. The investigators propose a controlled cannabis abstinence paradigm in patients with co-morbid MDD and CUD to further investigate these findings. Stabilized MDD patients with moderate to severe CUD will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) A contingent reinforcement intervention; 2) a non-contingent reinforcement intervention, which will serve as a time and non-abstinence control. In the CR group, subjects achieving biochemically-verified cannabis abstinence at study endpoint will receive a $300 contingent payment; participants in the NCR group will not receive this contingent payment.

The primary outcomes are: 1) cannabis abstinence rates at Day 28 in CR versus NCR groups; 2) changes in mood, anxiety and sleep symptoms over the 28-day assessment period. Secondary outcomes include cognition. Behavioral: Contingency Reinforcement Behavioral: Non-Contingency Reinforcement

### Association of depression with past-month cannabis use among US adults aged 20 to 59 years, 2005 to 2016 [^b29c70db]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Second, consistent with our hypotheses and prior research, we observed a significant association between any past-month cannabis use and depression. We also observed a stronger association between depression and daily cannabis use (aOR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.80–2.92) compared with depression and any cannabis use (aOR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.62–2.24). In 2015 to 2016, more than 30% of individuals with depression reported using cannabis in the past 30 days, and more than 15% reported using cannabis approximately daily. Although the current study is cross-sectional and therefore cannot provide information on the direction of the association between depression and cannabis use, these findings are concerning, given that both heavier use and depression have been associated with increased risk of cannabis-related harm. Individuals with depression who use cannabis may represent a high-risk group for cannabis-involved adverse consequences, potential worsening of depressive symptoms, and suicidality. In health care settings where depression is addressed, discussion with patients regarding the frequency of their cannabis use, strategies for cutting back, and the effects of cannabis on depressive symptoms may be useful.

Finally, we found a marked increase in the association between any and daily or near-daily cannabis use and depression from 2005 to 2016. In 2005 to 2006, individuals with depression had 46% higher odds of any cannabis use and 30% higher odds of near-daily cannabis use. In 2015 to 2016, individuals with depression had 130% higher odds of any cannabis use and 216% higher odds of daily cannabis use. These results suggest that over time, a higher proportion of individuals with depression are using cannabis. This could be the case if an increasing number of individuals with depression are using cannabis to self-medicate, potentially influenced by media and advertising presenting cannabis as beneficial to health. These results could also be interpreted as indicating that an increasing proportion of individuals who use cannabis are developing depression. However, if this were true, we would expect to see that as the prevalence of cannabis use increased, the prevalence of depression increased as well. However, depression stayed relatively stable during the study period, not supporting the latter interpretation.

### Correlates of cannabis use and cannabis use disorder among adolescents with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder in the national comorbidity survey-adolescent supplement (NCS-A) [^68be9c3d]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite evidence regarding prevalence and correlates of cannabis use (CU) and cannabis use disorder (CUD) in major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) in adults, little is known about this topic among adolescents.

Methods

Data are from the 2001–2004 National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement, an in-person, cross-sectional epidemiologic survey of mental disorders. Participants included adolescents, ages 13–18 years, with MDD (n = 354 with CU, n = 70 with CUD, n = 688 with no CU), BD (n = 79 with CU, n = 32 with CUD, n = 184 with no CU), or adolescents without mood disorders (n = 1413 with CU, n = 333 with CUD, n = 6970 with no CU). Analyses examined prevalence and correlates of CU and CUD within MDD and BD groups.

Results

CU was most prevalent in adolescents with MDD followed by adolescents with BD then controls. CUD was most prevalent in adolescents with BD followed by adolescents with MDD then controls. In covariate-adjusted ordinal logistic regression models, within MDD and BD, CU and CUD groups had significantly higher odds of lifetime suicidal ideation/attempts, as well as other significant indicators of clinical severity.

Limitations

Based on changes in cannabis acceptance, potency, and availability in the two decades since this study was conducted, present findings may underestimate adverse cannabis associations.

Conclusion

CU and CUD are both associated with adverse clinical characteristics in a community-based sample of adolescents with MDD and BD. Evidence that risks of cannabis use extend across the spectrum of use is important for adolescents with MDD and BD, in whom cannabis-related consequences tend to be more severe.

### The association between cannabis and depression: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^b753df84]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Several explanations for the cannabis-depression link have been proposed. One mechanism focuses on the role of cannabis use, especially during formative periods, in changing brain structure and regulations, (Langlois et al,) with some evidence from animal models (Bambico, Nguyen, Katz, & Gobbi). Another implicates shared genetic factors that might be responsible for both depression and cannabis use (Hodgson et al.). Others focused on shared social or environmental factors (Degenhardt et al). Evidence supporting these mechanisms indicates that multiple pathways might be in play in explaining the relationship between cannabis and depression.

Considering the changing landscape of cannabis in the US and globally, an update to the Lev-Ran et al. meta-analysis is warranted. Besides growing social and legal acceptance of cannabis, over the years, the potency of cannabis products has been increasing (ElSohly et al; ElSohly et al.). Modes of administration are also changing, with vaping cannabis becoming more popular, as well as using concentrated cannabis products (e.g. shatter, wax), all of which differ in terms of potency and delivery of the psychoactive substance (Prince & Conner). Furthermore, it is particularly important to address the issue of mental health in the US. Studies have shown that rates of depression in the US have increased in recent years, especially since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (Niedzwiedz et al; Zheng et al.). The purpose of this article was to update the Lev-Ran et al. meta-analysis by including additional studies published since 2013 and to further explore the relationship between cannabis use and depression. In addition, we conducted meta-analyses looking at the nuanced relationships between early-onset cannabis use (i.e. initiating use in adolescence) and depression, as well as heavy cannabis use and depression. We hypothesized that those who start using cannabis at a younger age would be more likely to develop depression, compared to those who initiate use as adults, which may be due to the psychosocial consequences of early cannabis use that have been demonstrated in the literature (Meier; Pacheco-Colón et al.). We also expected that heavy cannabis users would be more likely to develop depression, compared to light/occasional users due to the potential for a dose–response relationship between cannabis and depression.

### The association between cannabis and depression: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^41c470e5]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to explore the longitudinal relationship between cannabis use and depression, building upon a prior meta-analysis by Lev-Ran et al. (2013). In updating this work, identified eight additional studies (Arseneault; Blanco et al; Copeland et al; Danielsson et al; Feingold et al; Gage et al; Hengartner et al; Schaefer et al.) that we added to the original studies from the Lev-Ran et al. analysis (Bovasso; Brook et al; Brook et al; Degenhardt et al; Fergusson & Horwood; Georgiades & Boyle; Harder et al; Manrique-Garcia et al; Marmorstein & Iacono; Paton et al; Patton et al; Pedersen; van Laar et al).

Our findings indicated an odds ratio of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.46) compared to non-users, consistent with Lev-Ran et al.'s 1.17 (95% CI: 1.05–1.30) but with a high degree of heterogeneity (95% PI: 0.75, 2.20). Similar to Lev-Ran et al. we found that studies with heavy cannabis users reported a higher odds ratio than those on non-heavy users and that the effect estimate did not significantly differ between early- and late-onset cannabis users. This lack of statistically significant difference may reflect the high heterogeneity in exposure and outcome measurements across studies, making it difficult to infer robust conclusions.

There was no significant difference in odds of depression after cannabis use when US and non-US countries were compared directly and holding the heaviness of cannabis use and onset constant. However, our interpretation of this insignificant finding remains cautious as dichotomizing US vs non-US results may not be inappropriate for the outcome of depression. For instance, a systematic review of qualitative literature exploring the definition of depression globally found that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) commonly used in Western countries does not adequately reflect how depression is expressed by individuals in other countries (Haroz et al; Kessler & Bromet).

### The cannTeen study: cannabis use disorder, depression, anxiety, and psychotic-like symptoms in adolescent and adult cannabis users and age-matched controls [^d5f62010]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results from multiple large-scale studies indicate that there is a small association between cannabis use and depression. A meta-analysis of longitudinal studies found cannabis users had a higher likelihood of developing depression compared to controls (OR = 1.17) and another meta-analysis supported the link between cannabis use in adolescence and depression in early adulthood (OR = 1.37). Some longitudinal studies have reported a greater vulnerability to depression in those with a younger age-of-onset and one systematic review concluded that there was some evidence that a younger age-of-onset was linked to depression. However, a nonlinear association between age and contemporaneous depressive symptoms has been reported. Moreover, a meta-analysis did not find a significant age-of-onset effect. Hence, an age-specific vulnerability to cannabis-related depression is unclear. Moreover, the population cohort studies that contribute to these meta-analyses often include small numbers of frequent cannabis users and define frequent cannabis liberally, for example, once per month. Purposive sampling of frequent cannabis users is one way to address this.

### The association between cannabis and depression: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^015b6eed]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

This review follows the PRISMA 2020 reporting guidelines (Page et al.). Although this review closely adhered to systematic review methodologies, the timing of the project did not allow for registration in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO).

To guide this review, we applied the PICO framework: Population (non-institutionalized youth and adults worldwide); Intervention (cannabis use); Comparison (non-cannabis users); and Outcome (depression).

Eligibility criteria

The literature search included literature from inception through March 31, 2023. Initial eligibility criteria were established a priori, but additional criteria were added after the literature search began. Articles could originate from any country as long as they were available in English. The inclusion criteria established prior to the literature search were: (1) studies had to report on cannabis use separate from other drug use; (2) studies had to report on depression, separate from any other mental health outcomes; and (3) studies had to be longitudinal, with cannabis use measured prior to the outcome of depression or controlled for at baseline. Exclusion criteria were: (1) cross-sectional studies and (2) other systematic review and meta-analysis articles. After the preliminary search, we decided to exclude studies that only focused on special populations that were likely to have a higher risk of both cannabis use and depression, to reduce confounders. For example, LGBTQ-only studies were excluded (Dyar et al.) as it has been shown that gender and sexual minority populations have higher rates of depression than cisgender and heterosexual populations (Ferlatte et al.) as well as higher rates of problematic cannabis use (Dyar et al.). In addition, studies that focused on war Veteran-only populations were excluded (Gunn et al.) because this population also has unique experiences that may lead to differing rates of cannabis use (Davis et al.) and depression (Liu et al.) compared to the general population. We excluded studies that only included participants who were seeking treatment for a mental health issue at baseline (Bahorik et al.).

### Prospective associations between cannabis use and depressive symptoms across adolescence and early adulthood [^68c590f3]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Cannabis use and occurrences of depression during adolescence are common. However, the temporal relationship between the two is less understood. Does depression lead to cannabis use, or does cannabis use lead to depression, or is it a combination of both? Furthermore, this directionality is confounded by other substance use, specifically binge drinking, which is common during adolescence. This study aimed to examine the temporal directionality of cannabis use and depression among a prospective, longitudinal, sequential cohort of 15 to 24-year-olds. Data were drawn from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) study. The final sample included 767 participants. Multilevel regression models were run to assess concurrent (at the same time point) and prospective (1 year later) associations between cannabis use and depression. When measured concurrently, depressive symptoms did not significantly predict past-month cannabis use but did significantly predict more days of use among cannabis users. Prospective associations indicated that depressive symptoms significantly predicted cannabis use 1 year later and cannabis use significantly predicted depressive symptoms 1 year later. We found no evidence that these associations varied by age or binge drinking. Overall, the relationship between cannabis use and depression appears to be complex and not unidirectional.

### Does cannabis use predict the first incidence of mood and anxiety disorders in the adult population? [^bd895f41]. Addiction (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate whether cannabis use predicted the first incidence of mood and anxiety disorders in adults during a 3-year follow-up period.

Design and Participants

Data were derived from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS), a prospective study in the adult population of 18–64 years. The analysis was carried out on 3881 people who had no life-time mood disorders and on 3854 people who had no life-time anxiety disorders at baseline.

Measurements

Life-time cannabis use and DSM-III-R mood and anxiety disorders, assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).

Findings

After adjustment for strong confounders, any use of cannabis at baseline predicted a modest increase in the risk of a first major depression (odds ratio 1.62; 95% confidence interval 1.06–2.48) and a stronger increase in the risk of a first bipolar disorder (odds ratio 4.98; 95% confidence interval 1.80–13.81). The risk of 'any mood disorder' was elevated for weekly and almost daily users but not for less frequent use patterns. However, dose-response relationships were less clear for major depression and bipolar disorder separately. None of the associations between cannabis use and anxiety disorders remained significant after adjustment for confounders.

Conclusions

The associations between cannabis use and the first incidence of depression and bipolar disorder, which remained significant after adjustment for strong confounders, warrant research into the underlying mechanisms.

### Association of cannabis use in adolescence and risk of depression, anxiety, and suicidality in young adulthood: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9308629f]. JAMA Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Cannabis is the most commonly used drug of abuse by adolescents in the world. While the impact of adolescent cannabis use on the development of psychosis has been investigated in depth, little is known about the impact of cannabis use on mood and suicidality in young adulthood.

Objective

To provide a summary estimate of the extent to which cannabis use during adolescence is associated with the risk of developing subsequent major depression, anxiety, and suicidal behavior.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Proquest Dissertations and Theses were searched from inception to January 2017.

Study Selection

Longitudinal and prospective studies, assessing cannabis use in adolescents younger than 18 years (at least 1 assessment point) and then ascertaining development of depression in young adulthood (age 18 to 32 years) were selected, and odds ratios (OR) adjusted for the presence of baseline depression and/or anxiety and/or suicidality were extracted.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Study quality was assessed using the Research Triangle Institute item bank on risk of bias and precision of observational studies. Two reviewers conducted all review stages independently. Selected data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The studies assessing cannabis use and depression at different points from adolescence to young adulthood and reporting the corresponding OR were included. In the studies selected, depression was diagnosed according to the third or fourth editions of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or by using scales with predetermined cutoff points.

Results

After screening 3142 articles, 269 articles were selected for full-text review, 35 were selected for further review, and 11 studies comprising 23 317 individuals were included in the quantitative analysis. The OR of developing depression for cannabis users in young adulthood compared with nonusers was 1.37 (95% CI, 1.16–1.62; I2 = 0%). The pooled OR for anxiety was not statistically significant: 1.18 (95% CI, 0.84–1.67; I2 = 42%). The pooled OR for suicidal ideation was 1.50 (95% CI, 1.11–2.03; I2 = 0%), and for suicidal attempt was 3.46 (95% CI, 1.53–7.84, I2 = 61.3%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Although individual-level risk remains moderate to low and results from this study should be confirmed in future adequately powered prospective studies, the high prevalence of adolescents consuming cannabis generates a large number of young people who could develop depression and suicidality attributable to cannabis. This is an important public health problem and concern, which should be properly addressed by health care policy.

### Patterns of cannabis use and clinical correlates among individuals with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder [^29d4e6a8]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BPD) are the most severe mood disorders globally. Previous reports indicate high co-occurrence of cannabis use and cannabis use disorders (CUDs) associated with both disorders, yet studies comparing patterns of cannabis use between individuals with MDD and BPD are scarce.

Methods

Data were drawn from Wave 1 (2001–2002) of the National Epidemiologic survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Cannabis users who qualified for a diagnosis of past-year MDD (N = 217) were compared to those with BPD (N = 168) in frequency and daily dose of cannabis use, rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders including specific criteria of CUDs, treatment utilization and suicidality.

Results

Among past-year cannabis users, individuals with BPD reported using cannabis more frequently and smoking more joints per day compared to those with MDD. They were also more likely to suffer from comorbid personality disorders and qualify for specific CUD-criteria, including use in physically hazardous situations and unsuccessful efforts to control substance use.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that individuals with BPD may present more intensive patterns of cannabis use compared to those with MDD. This may have potential effects on the course of BPD and should be further explored in longitudinal studies.

### Major depressive disorder, suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and cannabis involvement in discordant twins: a retrospective cohort study [^10a37cc6]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Our study has some limitations. First, our sample is restricted to Australians, and sample 1 was older and likely represents secular differences. To address this possibility, we excluded the earliest-born members of sample 1 (1902–1940; Supplemental Table S1). To demonstrate the generalizability of the discordant pair analyses, future studies should attempt to validate the model in independent datasets. Second, we were limited by the available cannabis – related variables in the data and could not test for discordance on other indices of cannabis use. Similarly, we were unable to look in a more nuanced fashion at sub – groups of individuals with suicidal ideation and suicide attempt (e.g. severity). Third, even though we only studied early-onset behaviours as covariates, some covariates may have occurred subsequent to the onset of cannabis use. In such cases, our covariate correction may be viewed as overly conservative. Fourth, it is possible that interactions between early and frequent use are more strongly related to MDD and suicidal thoughts and behaviours than either measure is alone. Studies of larger samples might be able to model such interaction effects within a discordant twin framework. Fifth, in order to create discordant pairs, we selected thresholds to represent "early" and "frequent" use. While our choice of age and frequency cut-offs might have influenced our estimates, results were consistent with post-hoc analyses of continuous discordance in frequency of use (Supplemental Table S9). Finally, even though our discordant MZ twin design is powerful in excluding possible causal explanations, it cannot be used to prove causation.

Based on these results, we are unable to exclude the possibility that frequent cannabis use might increase risks for MDD and suicidal ideation, independent of shared predisposing influences. While we cannot identify the nature of this increased vulnerability, such a persisting increase in likelihood of MDD and suicidal ideation in frequent cannabis users is important to consider, especially against the backdrop of evidence supporting a role of the endocannabinoid system in mood regulation. However, interventions aiming to curb cannabis use should form only one part of the broader strategies to reduce its mental health correlates. Risk and protective influences that encourage cannabis use in one individual but not their sibling can also exacerbate their liability to MDD or suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and the identification of such factors that generate discordance in cannabis use within twin pairs is of considerable importance.

### The association between cannabis and depression: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^d57d6b1d]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

A few key limitations should be noted. First, this review was not registered in advance with PROSPERO or a similar systematic review registry, which could have enhanced transparency and methodological rigor by establishing a priori protocols for study selection and data extraction. As such, some risk of selection bias exists, given the absence of a public pre-registration outlining the study design.

Second, we did not search all possible databases and instead relied heavily on PubMed as our primary data source. While this was in line with the previous methodology of Lev-Ran et al. it may have limited the comprehensiveness of our search and increased the risk of missing relevant studies published in other databases. Cannabis use and mental health studies, in particular, are multidisciplinary and may be published in journals indexed in databases like PsycINFO or Scopus, potentially omitting relevant literature.

Furthermore, we excluded studies focusing on specific subpopulations, such as LGBTQ+ communities, or individuals with specific psychiatric comorbidities. While this decision was made to maintain a more generalizable sample, it may have inadvertently reduced the applicability of our findings to these groups.

In summary, these limitations underscore the need for a cautious interpretation of our results, as they may not fully reflect the broader body of literature on cannabis use and depression. Future research should prioritize protocol registration, utilize a wider range of databases, and include diverse populations to provide a more comprehensive understanding of this complex relationship.

Suggestions for future research

Throughout the process, we identified several opportunities for future research to more clearly determine the relationship between cannabis use and depression.

The definition of who is a cannabis user is not consistent across studies. For example, some studies dichotomize people into cannabis "users" and "non-users". However, even this is not consistent across studies. The article by van Laar et al. defined a cannabis user as anyone who used it more than 5 times in their lifetime, whereas Manrique-Garcia et al. defined a cannabis user as anyone who used it at least once. Manrique-Garcia et al. had tried to categorize into more groups, but were unable to due to "the small number of cases". Attempts to label cannabis users as "heavy", "moderate", and "light" were also not consistent. Furthermore, some studies looked at the past year to determine the heaviness of use, while others looked at lifetime use.

Meta-analysis

Extracted effects can be found in Table 3.

Table 3.
Results from the systematic review

Notes: * included in the initial Lev-Ran et al. article.

Mean Effect Size and Heterogeneity. We estimated the mean effect size using a correlated and hierarchical effects model (CHE) with robust variance estimation using clubSandwich. The estimated mean log-odds of depression was 0.25 (SE = 0.06, df = 18, p < .001). This corresponds to an OR of 1.29, with a 95% CI [1.13, 1.46]. This would suggest a higher risk of developing depression among people who used cannabis at baseline.

We utilized the model to create a 95% prediction interval of 0.75 and 2.20. This is the likely range of effect size values where we would expect a randomly selected new study for the meta-analysis to fall. This is a wide interval, suggesting a high degree of uncertainty around future predictions.

Meta-regression

To explore the heterogeneity across studies, we used the CHE model with robust variance estimation to fit a meta-regression using Country (US versus non-US), Cannabis Use (Non-heavy vs Heavy), and Onset (Late vs Early) as moderators. Table 4 presents the results of the meta-regression model with all three moderators and the associated Satterthwaite degrees of freedom. The meta-regression results test the difference between the levels of each moderator, controlling for the other moderators in the model. Only Cannabis Use was statistically significant at the p < 0.10 level, indicating that controlling for Country and Onset, heavy cannabis users had higher log odds of depression than non-heavy users. Table 4 also presents the adjusted means for each level of the three moderators, adjusted for the other moderators in the model. With the exception of US studies, the adjusted sub-group mean odds ratios were all significantly different from 1. The US studies had an average odds ratio that did not differ from 1.

### Prevalence of comorbid substance use in major depressive disorder in community and clinical settings, 1990–2019: systematic review and meta-analysis [^7381e34e]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Comorbidity between Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) and major depression is highly prevalent. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of SUDs in subjects diagnosed with a major depressive disorder (MDD) in community, inpatient and outpatient settings.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search of Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases was conducted from 1990 to 2019. Prevalence of co-morbid SUDs and MDD were extracted and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using random effects meta-analysis.

Results

There were 48 articles identified by electronic searches with a total sample size of 348,550 subjects that yielded 14 unique epidemiological studies, 2 national case registry studies, 7 large cohort studies and 20 clinical studies using in- or out-patients. The prevalence of any SUD in individuals with MDD was 0.250. Maximum prevalence was found with alcohol use disorder (0.208), followed by illicit drug use disorder (0.118) and cannabis use disorder (0.117). Meta-analysis showed the pooled variance of any AUD in men with MDD was 36%, which was significantly higher than that for females with MDD (19%, OR 2.628 95% CI 2.502, 2.760).

Conclusions

Few studies were published over the last decade so current prevalence rates of SUD in MDD are needed. Meta-analysis revealed that SUDs in MDD are highly prevalent and rates have not changed over time. The persistently high prevalence suggests there is an urgent need for more informative studies to help develop better prevention and treatment options for reducing prevalence of SUDs in persons with major depression and co-morbid disorders.

### Cannabis use before and after metabolic and bariatric surgery: literature review [^5bd9cedd]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Psychological considerations — associations between cannabis use, cannabis use disorder (CUD), and mental health — those who begin using cannabis prior to age 18 years are at increased risk for developing CUD, and adolescent cannabis exposure and adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes are strongly associated. In adults, CUD is comorbid with other substance use disorders and psychiatric conditions, with high rates of alcohol use disorder (> 50%) and tobacco use disorder (53%) observed in individuals with past-year or lifetime CUD, and comorbidities may include major depressive disorder (11%), bipolar I disorder (13%), or any anxiety disorder (24%). Interpretation of these associations is limited by variable assessment of cannabis use, reliance on self-report, underreporting of confounders, study design issues, small sample sizes, and questions of temporality.

### Association of depression with past-month cannabis use among US adults aged 20 to 59 years, 2005 to 2016 [^40826ea1]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Sensitivity Analyses

After redefining the primary exposure variable as positive if the PHQ-9 score potentially indicated severe major depression (ie, score ≥ 20), results were virtually unchanged. The aOR indicating the association between any past-month cannabis use and severe depression was 2.22 (95% CI, 1.32–3.74; P = 0.003), while the aOR for daily or near-daily past-month use and severe depression was 3.26 (95% CI, 1.62–6.57; P = 0.001). The tests for interaction between severe depression and survey year were not significant for the association between severe depression and any cannabis use (χ²₁ = 3.84; P = 0.05) but showed a significant increase in the association between severe depression and daily or near-daily cannabis use over time (χ²₁ = 7.71; P = 0.006).

### Cannabis use before and after metabolic and bariatric surgery: literature review [^6a0e93cc]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Cannabis and mental health disorders — evidence synthesis: A National Academies review reports moderate evidence that cannabis use is associated with increased risk for the development of depression and social anxiety disorder — but not other anxiety disorders; limited evidence links cannabis use with increased severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety symptoms, and it supported a dose-response effect on suicidality while high quality research on PTSD development or depressive disorder course was found to be lacking. Evidence appears strongest for associations with psychotic symptoms or disorders, particularly among individuals with a genetic predisposition, with a 2014 review rating the cannabis–schizophrenia relationship as "medium" and a synthesis of five fair-to-high quality reviews suggesting a "moderate to large" dose-dependent association with psychotic disorder development. Acute adverse effects — particularly among naive users — may include anxiety, paranoia, suicidal thoughts, and/or panic, are likely exacerbated by higher tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content, may account for up to 25–30% of cannabis-related emergency department visits, and anxiety and depression may also be reported with cannabis withdrawal.

### Major depressive disorder, suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and cannabis involvement in discordant twins: a retrospective cohort study [^810017b8]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Several mechanisms might explain the associations. Evidence from animaland human studiessuggests that the endocannabinoid system may be critical in modulation of mood, especially in the context of stress. MDD and suicidal ideation were among the adverse side effects in clinical trials of the endocannabinoid receptor (CB₁) inverse agonist. Frequent cannabis use may result in similar modifications in the endocannabinoid system and a corresponding increase in negative mood. The strong between (i.e. concordant frequent vs. concordant less frequent/never user MZ twins) and within – pair (i.e. frequent vs. less frequent/never user members of MZ discordant pairs) differences in rates of suicidal ideation as a function of frequent cannabis use imply that such a direct effect is plausible. For ideation, there was little evidence that the presence of an unexposed co-twin modified the likelihood of an individual's liability to suicidal ideation, hinting at a potential direct biological effect of cannabis exposure. Alternatively, frequent cannabis use might lead to increased exposure to environmental factors (e.g. increased trauma exposure)or outcomes (e.g. diminished life opportunities, other drug use)that might also increase the likelihood of MDD and suicidal ideation. For MDD, the non-frequently using co – twins of frequent use twins were at a somewhat increased likelihood of reporting MDD than concordant never - use twins, suggesting that the environment related to the co-twin's frequent cannabis use might modify liability to MDD. Relatedly, we cannot discount the possibility that an unmeasured individual – specific factor (e.g. deviant peers, other traumas), is responsible for these associations in MZ pairs.

### Association of depression with past-month cannabis use among US adults aged 20 to 59 years, 2005 to 2016 [^7836886f]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Despite studies showing that repeated cannabis use may worsen depressive symptoms, the popular media increasingly presents cannabis as beneficial to mental health, and many members of the public view cannabis as beneficial for depression. Therefore, cannabis use among individuals with depression may be becoming more prevalent.

Objective

To examine the association of depression with past-month cannabis use among US adults and the time trends for this association from 2005 to 2016.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This repeated cross-sectional study used data from 16 216 adults aged 20 to 59 years who were surveyed by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a national, annual, cross-sectional survey in the United States, between 2005 and 2016. Data analysis was conducted from January to February 2020.

Exposures

Survey year and depression, as indicated by a score of at least 10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Any past-month cannabis use (ie, ≥ 1 use in the past 30 days) and daily or near-daily past-month cannabis use (ie, ≥ 20 uses in the past 30 days). Logistic regression was used to examine time trends in the prevalence of cannabis use, depression, and the association between cannabis use and depression from 2005 to 2016.

Results

The final analysis included 16 216 adults, of whom 7768 (weighted percentage, 48.9%) were men, 6809 (weighted percentage, 66.4%) were non-Hispanic White participants, and 9494 (weighted percentage, 65.6%) had at least some college education. They had a weighted mean age of 39.12 (95% CI, 38.23–39.40) years. Individuals with depression had 1.90 (95% CI, 1.62–2.24) times the odds of any past-month cannabis use and 2.29 (95% CI, 1.80–2.92) times the odds of daily or near-daily cannabis use compared with those without depression. The association between cannabis use and depression increased significantly from 2005 to 2016. The odds ratio for depression and any past-month cannabis use increased from 1.46 (95% CI, 1.07–1.99) in 2005 to 2006 to 2.30 (95% CI, 1.82–2.91) in 2015 to 2016. The odds ratio for depression and daily or near-daily past-month cannabis use increased from 1.37 (95% CI, 0.81–2.32) in 2005 to 2006 to 3.16 (95% CI, 2.23–4.48) in 2015 to 2016.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this study indicate that individuals with depression are at increasing risk of cannabis use, with a particularly strong increase in daily or near-daily cannabis use. Clinicians should be aware of these trends and the evidence that cannabis does not treat depression effectively when discussing cannabis use with patients.

### Major depressive disorder, suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and cannabis involvement in discordant twins: a retrospective cohort study [^e94baeaf]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Early-onset and frequent cannabis use are associated with an increased likelihood of major depressive disorder (MDD) as well as suicidal thoughts and behaviours. We identify associations between aspects of cannabis use and MDD as well as suicidal thoughts and behaviours and examine whether such associations persist after accounting for those predisposing factors, including genetic liability and early family environment, that are shared by identical twins who are discordant for cannabis exposure. Any residual association in such identical pairs might be indicative of individual – specific pathways that may be of a causal nature.

Methods

We did a logistic regression analysis of cannabis use from retrospective data on same-sex male and female twin pairs drawn from 3 studies that had recruited twins from the Australian Twin Registry, 1992–93 (sample 1), 1996–2000 (sample 2), and 2005–09 (sample 3). We studied associations between early use and frequent use of cannabis and MDD, suicidal ideation (ever and persistent), and suicide plan and attempt in the full sample as well as in pairs of monozygotic and dizygotic twins that were discordant for each measure of cannabis involvement at a single timepoint. Significant monozygotic associations were further adjusted for covariates, such as early alcohol or nicotine use, early dysphoric or anhedonic mood, conduct disorder, and childhood sexual abuse. Interactions between each cannabis measure and sex, sample or study effects, and birth year category were also examined as covariates.

Findings

In 13 986 twins (6181 monozygotic and 7805 dizygotic), cannabis use ranged from 1345 (30·4%) of 4432 people in sample 1 to 2275 (69·0%) of 3299 in sample 3. Mean age of first cannabis use ranged from 17·9 years (SD 3·3) in sample 3 to 21·1 years in sample 1, and frequent use (≥ 100 times) was reported by 214 (4·9%) people in sample 1 and 499 (15·2%) in sample 3. The prevalence of suicidal ideation ranged from 1102 (24·9%) in sample 1 to 1644 (26·3%) of 6255 people in sample 2 and 865 (26·2%) people in sample 3. Prevalence of MDD ranged from 901 (20·3%) people in sample 1 to 1773 (28·5%) people in sample 2. The monozygotic twin who used cannabis frequently was more likely to report MDD (odds ratio 1·98, 95% CI 1·11–3·53) and suicidal ideation (2·47, 1·19–5·10) compared with their identical twin who had used cannabis less frequently, even after adjustment for covariates. For early cannabis use, the monozygotic point estimate was not significant but could be equated to the significant dizygotic estimate, suggesting a possible association with suicidal ideation.

Interpretation

The increased likelihood of MDD and suicidal ideation in frequent cannabis users cannot be solely attributed to common predisposing factors.

### Reductions in cannabis use are associated with mood improvement in female emerging adults [^e5e55a2a]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cannabis use and the development of depression symptoms have been linked in prospective research. However, no research has examined how depression symptoms might change relative to reductions in cannabis use. One group at risk for comorbid cannabis-use disorders and clinical depression is female emerging adults (those aged 18–25 years old) as cannabis use peaks during this period, depression is the most common psychiatric disorder among emerging adults, and females are at increased risk for depression relative to males. This study examined the longitudinal association between reductions in cannabis use and existing depression symptoms.

Methods

Secondary analyses from a cannabis intervention trial for 332 female emerging adults were conducted. Changes in depression symptoms (categorized as minimal, mild, and moderate or more severe depression) were assessed in relation to changes in cannabis use at 3- and 6-months postbaseline assessment.

Results

After controlling for alcohol use, the association between change in cannabis-use frequency and change in depression (measured by Beck Depression Inventory-II) was significantly stronger for those with mild depression (b = -0.26; 95% CI: -0.44, -0.08; P = 0.004), and for those with moderate or more severe depression (b = -0.50; 95% CI: -0.68, -0.33; P < .001) relative to those with minimal depression.

Conclusions

These results indicate a relationship between reductions in cannabis use and reductions in depression symptoms among female emerging adults who report at least mild depression symptoms. This represents a clinically meaningful effect for clinicians treating patients with co-occurring cannabis use and depressive disorders.

### Does cannabis use modify the effect of post-traumatic stress disorder on severe depression and suicidal ideation? Evidence from a population-based cross-sectional study of Canadians [^9a804b0d]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-traumatic stress disorder sharply increases the risk of depression and suicide. Individuals living with post-traumatic stress disorder frequently use cannabis to treat associated symptoms. We sought to investigate whether cannabis use modifies the association between post-traumatic stress disorder and experiencing a major depressive episode or suicidal ideation.

Methods

We used data from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of non-institutionalized Canadians aged ⩾15years. The relationship between post-traumatic stress disorder and each outcome was modelled using logistic regression with an interaction term for cannabis and post-traumatic stress disorder, controlling for demographic characteristics, mental health, and substance use comorbidities. The ratio of odds ratios and relative excess risk due to interaction was calculated to measure interaction on the multiplicative and additive scales, respectively.

Results

Among 24,089 eligible respondents, 420 (1.7%) reported a current clinical diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. In total, 106 (28.2%) people with post-traumatic stress disorder reported past-year cannabis use, compared to 11.2% of those without post-traumatic stress disorder (p < 0.001). In multivariable analyses, post-traumatic stress disorder was significantly associated with recent major depressive episode (adjusted odds ratio = 7.18, 95% confidence interval: 4.32–11.91) and suicidal ideation (adjusted odds ratio = 4.76, 95% confidence interval: 2.39–9.47) among cannabis non-users. post-traumatic stress disorder was not associated with either outcome among cannabis-using respondents (both p > 0.05).

Conclusions

This study provides preliminary epidemiological evidence that cannabis use may contribute to reducing the association between post-traumatic stress disorder and severe depressive and suicidal states. There is an emerging need for high-quality experimental investigation of the efficacy of cannabis/cannabinoids for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder.

### The association between cannabis and depression: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^b487bc07]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Search strategies

Systematic literature searches were conducted by VC and CC. The initial search started with articles that cited the Lev-Ran et al. meta-analysis. Searches were then conducted in PubMed, Ovid Medline, and Google Scholar. Gray literature was searched using ProQuest for unpublished theses and dissertations. An ancestor search of the Lev-Ran articles was conducted by reviewing all the "Cited By" articles in PubMed. The full search strategy, including keywords and limits for each database, can be found in.

Screening

The screening was conducted in three stages (initial screening of titles; title and abstract screening; and full-text screening) on Rayyan (Ouzzani et al.) using the eligibility criteria specified above. VC conducted the original screening of potential studies published through March 31, 2022, with no specified beginning date. Both VC and CC conducted the screening of potential studies published between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. Disagreements between VC and CC were discussed and TP acted as the tie-breaking vote for seven articles when agreement could not be reached. Detailed screening results, including citations of excluded articles and reasons for exclusion, can be found in.

Extraction

Study information was independently extracted by VC, with TP serving to assist with extracting data when clarity was needed. The coding sheet can be found in. The final codes are detailed below.

Cannabis Use Measure. Cannabis use in any form was the exposure of interest. Codes specific to cannabis included: how cannabis use was measured (for example, self-reported frequency, or a validated measure such as the Composite International Diagnostic Interview [CIDI]). Specific definitions of exposure were collected. These ranged from ever use to cannabis use disorder. Most of the articles included analyses for different levels of exposure, so these were extracted as separate effect sizes. For example, Pedersen reported on participants who had used cannabis 1–10 times in the past 12 months, as well as those who used cannabis 11 or more times in the past 12 months.

### Major depressive disorder, suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and cannabis involvement in discordant twins: a retrospective cohort study [^1c01a6ea]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Cannabis use has been linked to both major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicidal thoughts and behaviours. Daily cannabis use, especially during adolescence, was associated with a 6·8 odds of suicide attempt. In a 30 – year longitudinal study, even weekly cannabis use was linked to onset of suicidal ideation, particularly in males, and the association largely persisted after controlling for the confounding effects of a variety of sociodemographic and mental health characteristics and familial risk factors.MDD is partially correlated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors. However, associations between cannabis use and MDD are weaker than those noted for suicidal thoughts and behavioursand often, have not survived covariate correction.

One approach to understanding the nature of the relationship of cannabis use with MDD and suicidal thoughts and behaviours is to study monozygotic (MZ) twins reared together who are discordant for cannabis use. Cannabis use (h² = 50–60%), MDD (h² = 30–40%) and suicidal thoughts and behaviours (h² = 40–45%) are heritable. – MZ twins typically share all their segregating loci identical-by-descent and are also highly likely to share early familial influences. Therefore, if the twins who use cannabis show an increased likelihood of MDD or suicidal thoughts and behaviours, relative to their co-twins who do not use cannabis this residual association may be viewed as evidence supporting person – specific factors, and putatively, causal mechanisms. While cross-sectional discordant twin data cannot prove causality, the absence of an association in discordant twin pairs might be viewed as evidence against causal mechanisms. In one such study, we showed that relative to their co-twin, the cannabis dependent twin was at 3·4 conditional odds of reporting suicidal ideation and attempts. A similarly significant association was noted for suicide attempts when discordance for early cannabis use was examined. Thus, some of the relationship between cannabis use and suicidal thoughts and behaviours is attributable to those predisposing factors that are shared by twin pairs; and even after accounting for those influences, cannabis dependence resulted in an increase in likelihood of suicidal thoughts and behaviours. In contrast, increased likelihood of MDD was noted in DZ but not MZ twin pairs that were discordant for cannabis dependence, suggesting that common genetic influences could alone be implicated in this association.

### The persistence of the association between adolescent cannabis use and common mental disorders into young adulthood [^1177abe8]. Addiction (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Debate continues about whether the association between cannabis use in adolescence and common mental disorders is causal. Most reports have focused on associations in adolescence, with few studies extending into adulthood. We examine the association from adolescence until the age of 29 years in a representative prospective cohort of young Australians.

Design

Nine-wave, 15-year representative longitudinal cohort study, with six waves of data collection in adolescence (mean age 14.9–17.4 years) and three in young adulthood (mean age 20.7, 24.1 and 29.1 years).

Participants

Participants were a cohort of 1943 recruited in secondary school and surveyed at each wave when possible from mid-teen age to their late 20s.

Setting

Victoria, Australia.

Measurements

Psychiatric morbidity was assessed with the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R) at each adolescent wave, and as Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)-defined ICD-10 major depressive episode and anxiety disorder at 29 years. Frequency of cannabis use was measured in the past 6 months in adolescence. Cannabis use frequency in the last year and DSM-IV cannabis dependence were assessed at 29 years. Cross-sectional and prospective associations of these outcomes with cannabis use and dependence were estimated as odds ratios (OR), using multivariable logistic regression models, with the outcomes of interest, major depressive episode (MDE) and anxiety disorder (AD) at 29 years.

Findings

There were no consistent associations between adolescent cannabis use and depression at age 29 years. Daily cannabis use was associated with anxiety disorder at 29 years [adjusted OR 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI): < 1.2–5.2], as was cannabis dependence (adjusted OR 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1–4.4). Among weekly+ adolescent cannabis users, those who continued to use cannabis use daily at 29 years remained at significantly increased odds of anxiety disorder (adjusted OR 3.2, 95% CI: 1.1–9.2).

Conclusions

Regular (particularly daily) adolescent cannabis use is associated consistently with anxiety, but not depressive disorder, in adolescence and late young adulthood, even among regular users who then cease using the drug. It is possible that early cannabis exposure causes enduring mental health risks in the general cannabis-using adolescent population.

### Association of depression with past-month cannabis use among US adults aged 20 to 59 years, 2005 to 2016 [^a8e7a040]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

A new sample weight variable for the 6 combined data sets from 2005 to 2016 was created by dividing each MEC sample weight by the total number of data sets, then summing them. Prevalence for all outcomes and demographic characteristics were calculated for each survey year. Unadjusted and covariate-adjusted logistic regression models were used to assess linear time trends in both cannabis outcomes and depression from 2005 to 2016 and the association between depression and cannabis outcomes, adjusting for survey year. Within the first set of models, unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs and aORs, respectively) reflected the increased or decreased odds of depression or cannabis use between 2005 and 2016. Within the second set of models, the ORs and aORs reflected the increased or decreased odds of cannabis use by depression status, adjusting for survey year. To determine whether associations differed by survey year, the logistic models were rerun including an interaction term between survey year and depression. In all analyses, Taylor series estimation methods were used to obtain standard error estimates. Statistical significance was set at α < .05 for all analyses, and tests were 2-tailed. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute).

To check robustness of results, analyses were rerun using a redefined depression variable to potentially indicate severe major depression. This was dichotomized as a PHQ-9 score of at least 20 vs less than 20.

### Major depressive disorder, suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and cannabis involvement in discordant twins: a retrospective cohort study [^b2b306aa]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Early and frequent cannabis use are associated with an increased likelihood of major depressive disorder (MDD) as well as suicidal thoughts and behaviours. We identify associations between aspects of cannabis use, MDD, and suicidal thoughts and behaviours and examine whether such associations persist after accounting for those predisposing factors, including genetic liability and early family environment, that are shared by identical twins who are discordant for cannabis exposure. Any residual association in such identical pairs might be indicative of individual-specific pathways that might be of a causal nature.

Methods

We did a logistic regression analysis of cannabis use from retrospective data on same-sex male and female twin pairs drawn from 3 studies that had recruited twins from the Australian Twin Registry, 1992–93 (sample 1), 1996–2000 (sample 2), and 2005–09 (sample 3). We studied associations between early use and frequent use of cannabis and MDD, suicidal ideation (ever and persistent), and suicide plan and attempt in the full sample as well as in pairs of monozygotic and dizygotic twins that were discordant for each measure of cannabis involvement at a single timepoint. Significant monozygotic associations were further adjusted for covariates, such as early alcohol or nicotine use, early dysphoric or anhedonic mood, conduct disorder, and childhood sexual abuse. Interactions between each cannabis measure and sex, sample or study effects, and birth year category were also examined as covariates.

Findings

In 13986 twins (6181 monozygotic and 7805 dizygotic), cannabis use ranged from 1345 (30·4%) of 4432 people in sample 1 to 2275 (69·0%) of 3299 in sample 3. Mean age of first cannabis use ranged from 17·9 years (SD 3·3) in sample 3 to 21·1 years (5·2) in sample 1, and frequent use (≥ 100 times) was reported by 214 (15·9%) of 1345 users in sample 1 and 499 (21·9%) of 2275 in sample 3. The prevalence of suicidal ideation ranged from 1102 (24·9%) of 4432 people in sample 1 to 1644 (26·3%) of 6255 people in sample 2 and 865 (26·2%) of 3299 people in sample 3. Prevalence of MDD ranged from 901 (20·3%) people in sample 1 to 1773 (28·3%) in sample 2. The monozygotic twin who used cannabis frequently was more likely to report MDD (odds ratio 1·98, 95% CI 1·11–3·53) and suicidal ideation (2·47, 1·19–5·10) compared with their identical twin who had used cannabis less frequently, even after adjustment for covariates. For early cannabis use, the monozygotic point estimate was not significant but could be equated to the significant dizygotic estimate, suggesting a possible association with suicidal ideation.

Interpretation

The increased likelihood of MDD and suicidal ideation in frequent cannabis users cannot be solely attributed to common predisposing factors.

### Major depressive disorder, suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and cannabis involvement in discordant twins: a retrospective cohort study [^941c7fad]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

After temporal ordering, cannabis use was associated with MDD and suicidal thoughts and behaviours; however, these associations were no longer significant after accounting for covariates (Supplemental Table S2). Thus, we did not examine cannabis use in discordant twin models. On the other hand, both early and frequent cannabis use were robustly associated with MDD and all aspects of suicidal thoughts and behaviours (adjusted ORs ranging from 1·28 to 2·38), even after adjustment for covariates. These significant associations persisted even when lifetime never users of cannabis were excluded from the analysis; for instance, those who reported using cannabis ≥ 100 times were twice as likely to report suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, relative to those who reported lifetime cannabis use, but less frequently. Overall, these analyses suggest that early and frequent cannabis use are associated with MDD and suicidal thoughts and behaviours, even after accounting for key confounders.

Within – pair associations (Table 3) between early cannabis use, MDD and suicidal thoughts and behaviours, in analyses with and without never users, were significant within DZ (OR range from 2·23 to 6·50), but not MZ (OR 1·17–2·00), pairs. This pattern of results is consistent with the role of shared genetic influences contributing to the relationship. In some instances (e.g. ideation), the DZ and MZ OR had overlapping confidence intervals, indicating equality of effect sizes, with the association potentially being non-significant in discordant MZ pairs due to marginally fewer discordant pairs.

Associations between frequent cannabis use and MDD, suicidal ideation and persistent ideation were significant within both DZ and MZ pairs and with similar effect sizes. There was no association with suicide attempt (p = 0.07) and more conservative bootstrapped confidence intervals suggest imprecision in the point estimates (Supplemental Table S3). For instance, relative to their genetically identical co-twin who did not use cannabis as frequently, a MZ twin who reported using cannabis ≥ 100 times was at 1·72, 2·71 and 3·14 odds of meeting criteria for MDD and reporting suicide ideation and persistent ideation respectively. An MZ OR > 1 suggests that factors other than those shared by members of identical twin pairs (including the effect of segregating loci and early familial environment) contribute to the association. A significant association within discordant MZ pairs, thus, is suggestive of individual-specific factors that may be causal. Furthermore, the magnitude of ORs within the DZ and MZ pairs were similar to each other and to associations observed in the full sample (Table 2).

### Major depressive disorder, suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and cannabis involvement in discordant twins: a retrospective cohort study [^364175e5]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Causal inferences regarding the effects of frequent cannabis use on the subsequent onset of MDD and suicidal thoughts and behaviours cannot be drawn from these cross-sectional data. Even though we only included individuals with onset of MDD and suicidal thoughts and behaviours subsequent to onset of cannabis use, we might not have adequately accounted for confounders. However, post-hoc analyses found inconsistent associations when this temporal ordering was reversed. We have previously noted that cannabis use is negatively correlated with MDD and suicidal thoughts and behaviours that precede it. Based on earlier examinations of the gateway theory, these results further support the importance of temporal ordering of onsets, and hint at causal pathways.

A strength of the current study is that suicidal ideation and suicide attempt were assessed in all individuals, regardless of their MDD status. While suicidal thoughts and behaviours are a feature of MDD, they are also frequently viewed as distinct psychiatric entities that are related, in equal part, to the internalizing aspects of mood disorders as well as to externalizing behaviours (e.g. subtypes of suicide attempt that relate to impulsive aggression). – Possibly, suicidal thoughts and behaviours are an early index of a broader liability to emotion dysregulation with a subset of ideators progressing to MDD. Comparisons of MDD and suicidal ideation prevalence across less frequent/never users from concordant and discordant pairs also hint at potential differences (i.e. no effect of co-twin status for suicidal ideation). Therefore, the associations between frequent cannabis use, MDD and, suicidal thoughts and behaviours might reflect partially distinct etiological processes.

### Comorbid cannabis use disorder with major depression and generalized anxiety disorder: a systematic review with meta-analysis of nationally representative epidemiological surveys [^fa6f126c]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies have shown a high degree of comorbidity between cannabis use disorder (CUD) and other mental illnesses. However, there is a paucity of research on the comorbidity between CUD with major depression (MD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). This systematic review with meta-analysis aimed to assess the prevalence and strength of association between co-morbid CUD with MD and GAD.

Methods

An extensive search of Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and grey literature were conducted to cover articles published between January 1 st, 1980, and July 31 st, 2020. Inclusion criteria were publications in English Language, original research, nationally representative samples, and non-clinical randomly selected adult populations. A systematic review and meta-analysis for the prevalence and ORs for comorbid CUD with MD or GAD were done.

Results

A total of 67 articles were identified by the electronic searches. A full-text review yielded 8 publications on nationally representative epidemiological surveys. 12-month and lifetime comorbidity estimates were extracted and used for the meta-analysis. CUD was strongly associated with MDE (OR 3.22; 2.31–4.49) and with GAD (OR 2.99; 2.14–4.16).

Limitations

Limitations of this study include the heterogeneity observed due to the combination of studies from different geographic regions with different modifications of diagnostic criteria and varied response rates. This was addressed with a random-effects model.

Conclusion

This review confirms the evidence of high prevalence and a 3-fold comorbid association between CUD with MD and CUD with GAD. Implementation of evidence-based policy interventions with effective, integrated management of comorbid CUDs with psychiatric disorders may contribute to positive patient outcomes.

### Major depressive disorder, suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and cannabis involvement in discordant twins: a retrospective cohort study [^81cc9ceb]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, frequent cannabis use was associated with MDD and suicidal thoughts and behaviours, even after controlling for confounders. When these associations were examined within identical twin pairs, frequent use remained associated with MDD and suicidal ideation, suggesting that factors beyond those shared by identical twins might contribute to the association. Analyses conducted in the smaller subset of cannabis users did not significantly differ, suggesting that risk for MDD and suicidal ideation in never and lighter users may be comparably low.

The similarity in the ORs across DZ and MZ twin pairs indicates that genetic factors play only a modest role in the association between cannabis involvement and MDD and suicidal thoughts and behaviours, even though prior studies with samples 2 and 3 suggested moderate genetic correlations. The importance of the present study lies in our ability to disentangle predisposing factors, related to genetic liability and early familial environment, from environmental factors that are individual - specific and might be causal. Twins reporting frequent cannabis use were more likely to report MDD and suicidal ideation when compared to their identical co – twin who either did not use cannabis or used it less frequently. Unadjusted and adjusted OR from the discordant pair analyses were similar to the full population, suggesting that the associations might be due to individual-specific factors, possibly, of a causal nature. These results are broadly consistent with, but more conservative than, our previous discordant twin study that used data from sample 2 and reported an association between early cannabis use and suicide attempt as well as between cannabis dependence and both ideation and attempt. However, that study found no evidence for a residual association between MDD and early cannabis use or cannabis dependence in discordant MZ pairs. We see an identical null finding for early cannabis use but note that frequent use did increase liability to MDD in these pairs, perhaps due to the larger sample size.

### Treatment-resistant depression as risk factor for substance use disorders-a nation-wide register-based cohort study [^243aa3f4]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent and often recurrent condition with substantial consequences for both the individual and for society in terms of function loss, costs and premature death 1, 2. Far from all depressed individuals respond as intended to treatment, as 10–20% do not tolerate an initial treatment trial, and 25–60% of completers of an adequate trial do not achieve remission 3, 4, 5. During the last decades, several definitions of treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) have been proposed for clinical and research purposes, with a common denominator among them being at least two adequate treatment attempts without achieving remission 6, 7.

Substance use disorders (SUD) as defined by DSM‐5 are conditions in which the use of one or more psychoactive substances leads to a clinically significant impairment or distress 1, replacing the earlier diagnostic concepts of abuse, addiction and dependence. SUD may lead to various adverse mental, physical and economic outcomes, and account for 5% of the global burden of lost disability‐adjusted life‐years 8. In administrative data, the 12‐month prevalence of alcohol or drug dependence in MDD patients is estimated at approximately 12% 9, increasing by to up to 30% in clinical samples 10.

A wide range of studies show a temporal association from depression to SUD, but the relationship appears to be complex. Depression and other mental disorders often precede the presentation of SUDs, regardless of substance being used 11, 12. There is also evidence that the relationship may be temporally reversed or bidirectional, and that it may vary for different types of drug use and during different stages in life 12, 13, 14, 15. Antidepressant effect is generally lower when a comorbid SUD is present 16, 17, 18.

In recent years, several novel treatments for TRD have been introduced, including ketamine and hallucinogenic agents such as psilocybin and ayahuasca 19, 20, 21. Although the effect of these treatments may seem superior to current antidepressant medications, one of the unresolved issues regarding these treatments is their known potential for illicit substance use, and whether or not they can be offered safely to patients with or at risk for SUD 22.

### Major depressive disorder, suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and cannabis involvement in discordant twins: a retrospective cohort study [^43e4068e]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

We conducted post-hoc analyses to examine whether frequent cannabis use was associated with MDD and suicidal thoughts and behaviours that occurred prior to the onset of cannabis use. Despite large sample sizes (Supplemental Table S7), associations between frequent (as well as early and ever) cannabis use and MDD as well as suicidal thoughts and behaviours were inconsistent. For instance, when suicidal ideation occurred prior to the onset of cannabis use, frequent cannabis use was associated with 0.73 adjusted odds of ideation (Supplemental Table S7), whereas the corresponding OR for MDD was 1.40. Second, we tested whether our definition of "frequent" cannabis use as a dichotomous measure had influenced our primary findings. Both continuous and categorical measures of cannabis frequency were associated with MDD and suicidal thoughts and behaviours (Supplemental Table S8). We also defined discordant MZ pairs as twins who differed by at least 10 units in their frequency of use. Even within these discordant pairs, the twin who used cannabis more frequently was more likely to report suicidal ideation and MDD (Supplemental Table S9) than their co-twin who used it less often.

### Major depressive disorder, suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and cannabis involvement in discordant twins: a retrospective cohort study [^46a0b721]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

In this study, we incorporate data from additional twin datasets (N = 13,986 for current study, vs. 6,257 for prior study) resulting in substantially greater numbers of discordant MZ pairs and we examine additional aspects of cannabis use as well as suicidal thoughts and behaviours. The goals of the present study were to examine whether: (a) a lifetime history of cannabis use as well as early – onset use and frequent use was associated with MDD, suicidal ideation, persistent ideation, ideation with a plan and, suicide attempt; (b) any significant associations that were observed in the full sample of twins persisted when twin pairs discordant for each cannabis measure were examined; and (c) associations within pairs of twins persisted after accounting for additional covariates that might have contributed to discordance in cannabis use and subsequently, to MDD and suicidal thoughts and behaviours.

### Substance use disorders and risk for treatment resistant depression: a population-based, nested case-control study [^a8779682]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Substance use disorders (SUD) are conditions in which the use of one or more psychoactive substances leads to clinically significant distress or functional impairment 1. SUD are major contributors to disability world‐wide, and constitute risk factors for a vast array of adverse mental and physical outcomes, including depressive disorders 2, 3.

Among patients with depression the life‐time prevalence of SUD is up to 40%, most commonly alcohol use disorder 4. Self‐reported 12‐month prevalence of SUD is 19% 5. Although the association between SUD and depression is robust in the literature, causality is unclear, as the temporal association appears bidirectional and may show life‐time variation 6. Alcohol, opioid, and in some studies also cannabis use, have been identified as risk factors for depression 7, 8, 9. The role of benzodiazepine and stimulant use is less clear, and may also be influenced by post‐SUD anhedonia 2, 10, 11.

Depression is a leading cause of disability in the world, with potentially disastrous outcomes such as suicide 12, 13. In clinical studies of sequential antidepressant treatment of depression, designed to emulate real‐life treatment conditions, up to 30% of patients do not respond, and up to 50% do not respond adequately after two antidepressant treatment trials 14, 15. As a consequence, the study of patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD) has garnered increasing interest during the last decades. Several methods of defining and staging TRD have been proposed, with failure to achieve an adequate treatment response after two separate, adequate treatment trials being the most common definition 16, 17. The current recommended treatment strategies in TRD include switching within and between classes of antidepressants, combining antidepressants, add‐on medication with anti‐convulsant or anti‐psychotic agents, psychotherapy alone or in combination with pharmacological therapy and neurostimulation 18. In the NIMH Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial, a multi‐center randomized treatment study taking patient preference into account (n = 4177), no strategy emerged as superior over another; instead, response and remission rates were, rather, dependent on the number of previously failed trials 14.

### Major depressive disorder, suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and cannabis involvement in discordant twins: a retrospective cohort study [^92d8c83c]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Statistical analyses

All primary analyses were conducted within SAS (v9). Logistic regression was used to examine the association between cannabis use and MDD as well as suicidal thoughts and behaviours in the full sample. First, we examined whether each measure of cannabis use was associated with MDD and each index of suicidal thoughts and behaviours (unadjusted odds–ratio, OR). We re-examined these associations while accounting for covariates (adjusted OR).

Those adjusted associations that were significant in the full sample were then examined within pairs of MZ and DZ same – sex twins that were discordant for each cannabis use measure. Conditional logistic regression was used for discordant twin (i.e. within – pair) analyses. Similar to the analyses in the full sample, an unadjusted OR was computed for the discordant MZ and DZ pairs. For each unadjusted association that was significantly greater than 1.0 within the discordant MZ pairs, an adjusted OR was further computed by accounting for only those covariates that were associated with within-pair discordance for the respective cannabis measure. Paired data were also re-analyzed using a bootstrapping approach in STATA (v7). A comparison of the unadjusted OR from the discordant DZ and MZ pairs, relative to the full sample, provided an estimate of the extent to which genetic and environmental factors contributed to the association. Evidence for individual-specific factors that might be causal was derived from an adjusted MZ OR > 1.0.

For associations that further survived covariate correction, we compared the prevalence of the corresponding MDD and suicidal thoughts and behaviours measure in discordant MZ pairs with its prevalence in MZ twin pairs that were concordant for cannabis use (e.g. both frequent users or both infrequent/never users). For instance, the prevalence of MDD was contrasted across twins from MZ pairs where (a) both twins used cannabis frequently, (b) neither twin used cannabis frequently, (c) one twin used cannabis frequently while (d) the other did not (i.e. members of discordant pairs).

Role of funding source

The research was funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) with additional support for aspects of data collection and personnel support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). The funders had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis and interpretation, or writing of the study. AA and RT had full access to all data. AA submitted the study for publication.

### Comorbid substance use disorder, major depression, and associated disability in a nationally representative sample [^e29553da]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorders (MDD) and substance use disorders (SUDs) are commonly linked to disability, but there is a lack of research on the risk of disability among individuals who have both SUDs and MD in the general population. This study aimed to investigate the associated risk of disability in people with comorbid SUDs- specifically cannabis use disorder, alcohol use disorder, other drug (except cannabis) use disorder, and a major depressive episode using a nationally representative sample.

Methods

The 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey- Mental Health (CCHS-MH) data were analyzed using multilevel logistic regression models. The survey included a nationally representative sample of Canadians aged 15 years and older (n = 25,113) residing in the ten Canadian provinces from January to December 2012. The diagnoses of major depressive episodes (MDE) and the SUDs were derived from the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria using a modified WHO-CIDI instrument, while disability was assessed using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Score (WHODAS) 2.0.

Results

The strongest predictor of disability was found to be comorbidity. Individuals diagnosed with both a SUD and MDE were 4 to 9 times more likely to experience disability, depending on the substance used, compared to those without either diagnosis.

Limitations

The study's cross-sectional design limits causal inferences.

Conclusions

Our research discovered that individuals who have both SUD and MDE are at a significantly higher risk of experiencing disability. This highlights the importance of integrating mental health and addiction services to mitigate the risk of disability and improve overall treatment outcomes.

### Directional associations between cannabis use and depression from late adolescence to young adulthood: the role of adverse childhood experiences [^e7a45e43]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Although the co-occurrence of cannabis and depression is well established, less is known about the temporal sequence of cannabis use and depression. The present study had three main aims: to test a symptom-driven pathway in which depression may drive increases in cannabis use, to test a substance-induced pathway in which cannabis use may drive increases in depression and to assess a shared vulnerability model assessing associations between individuals who have (and have not) experienced adverse childhood experiences (ACEs).

Design

Data are from an ongoing, longitudinal, cohort study (n = 2234). Data were set up in an accelerated longitudinal design from age 17 to 24years.

Setting

Initial sample was recruited from Southern California, USA. The majority of participants still live in Southern California.

Participants

On average, participants were aged 18years at wave 8, with more than half identifying as female (54.3%; n = 1350). Most participants identified as Hispanic (1127; 45.4%), followed by non-Hispanic white (510; 20.5%), Asian (503; 20.2%), multi-racial/other (284; 11.4%) and non-Hispanic black (60; 2.2%).

Measurements

Primary outcomes were past-month days of cannabis use and depression symptoms [patient health questionnaire (PHQ)-8]. The Adverse Childhood Experiences scale was used as our main grouping measure.

Findings

In the full sample, we showed that prior levels of depression symptoms were associated with a decrease in cannabis use [opposite to the proposed symptom driven model; B = -0.33 (-0.58, -0.09)]. Dynamic coupling parameters noted individuals who evidenced greater increases in cannabis use between two prior ages reported greater increases in depressive symptoms between subsequent ages [support for a substance-induced pathway; B = 0.53 (0.18, 0.89)]. Similar to the overall sample, for those who had not experienced ACEs, as cannabis use increased we saw a steady increase in depression [support for a substance induced pathway; B = 0.14 (0.04, 0.29)]. However, for those who experienced ACEs, as cannabis use increased we saw a consistent decrease in depression [opposite to the proposed substance-induced pathway; B = -0.18 (-0.28, -0.08)].

Conclusion

There is mixed support for both symptom-driven and substance-induced pathways between cannabis use and depression.

### Associations of suicidality trends with cannabis use as a function of sex and depression status [^fb6403d1]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

During the past decade, cannabis use among US adults has increased markedly, with a parallel increase in suicidality (ideation, plan, attempt, and death). However, associations between cannabis use and suicidality among young adults are poorly understood.

Objective

To determine whether cannabis use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) are associated with a higher prevalence of suicidality among young adults with or without depression and to assess whether these associations vary by sex.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This survey study examined data from 281 650 adults aged 18 to 34 years who participated in the National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. Data were collected from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2019.

Exposures

Prevalence of past-year daily or near-daily cannabis use (≥ 300 days in the past year), CUD, and major depressive episode (MDE). Past-year CUD and MDE were based on DSM-IV diagnostic criteria.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Past-year suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt.

Results

Among the 281 650 adults aged 18 to 34 (men, 49.9% [95% CI,49.6%-50.2%]; women, 50.1% [95% CI, 49.8%-50.4%]) included in the analysis, past-year suicidal ideation and plan along with daily cannabis use increased among all examined sociodemographic subgroups (except daily cannabis use among current high-school students), and past-year suicide attempt increased among most subgroups. National trends in adjusted prevalence of past-year suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt varied by daily and nondaily cannabis use and CUD among adults with or without MDE. After controlling for MDE, CUD, cannabis use status, and potential confounding factors, the adjusted prevalence of suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt increased 1.4 to 1.6 times from the 2008–2009 to 2018–2019 periods (adjusted risk ratio [ARR] for suicidal ideation, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.3–1.5]; ARR for suicide plan, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.5–1.9]; ARR for suicide attempt, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.2–1.7]), with 2008 to 2009 as the reference period. Past-year CUD, daily cannabis use, and nondaily cannabis use were associated with a higher prevalence of past-year suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt in both sexes (eg, among individuals without MDE, prevalence of suicidal ideation for those with vs without CUD was 13.9% vs 3.5% among women and 9.9% vs 3.0% among men; P < .001), but significantly more so in women than men (eg, suicide plan among those with CUD and MDE was 52% higher for women [23.7%] than men [15.6%]; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

From 2008 to 2019, suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt increased 40% to 60% over increases ascribed to cannabis use and MDE. Future research is needed to examine this increase in suicidality and to determine whether it is due to cannabis use or overlapping risk factors.

### Major depressive disorder, suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and cannabis involvement in discordant twins: a retrospective cohort study [^dfd8005a]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Interactions between the cannabis exposure variable and sex, sample or birth year category were not significant. Discordance on frequent cannabis use was associated with conduct disorder alone (Supplemental Table S4). However, even after accounting for conduct disorder, frequent cannabis-using twins were at 2·35–2·47 odds of reporting suicidal ideation when compared to their genetically identical (MZ) co-twins who did not use cannabis so frequently or never used it at all (Table 4; Supplemental Table S5 for bootstrapped confidence intervals; see Supplemental Table S6 for all adjusted OR for unadjusted OR from Table 3). For MDD, the association in the subset of ever users was also robust to covariate adjustment with frequent users remaining at 1·98 odds of MDD when compared to their identical co-twin who used cannabis less frequently. These results indicated that individual-specific factors other than these covariates contribute to the association between frequent cannabis use and MDD and suicidal ideation (but not persistent ideation).

We compared the prevalence of MDD and suicidal ideation across twins drawn from pairs where both had used cannabis frequently (concordant exposed), neither had used it frequently (concordant unexposed) and twins from discordant pairs. The prevalence of MDD and suicidal ideation in concordant exposed twins was greater than in concordant unexposed twins (Table 5), suggesting a strong, main effect of frequent cannabis use on suicidal ideation. Consistent with the discordant twin analyses, the exposed twin from discordant pairs was more likely to report suicidal ideation and MDD than their identical but unexposed co-twin (Table 5). Importantly, while there was minimal effect of the co-twin's exposure status on an individual twin's report of suicidal ideation, the rate of MDD was slightly higher in unexposed twins from discordant than concordant pairs (Table 5).

### Association of cannabis potency with mental ill health and addiction: a systematic review [^a22e75c7]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Cannabis potency, defined as the concentration of Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), has increased internationally, which could increase the risk of adverse health outcomes for cannabis users. We present, to our knowledge, the first systematic review of the association of cannabis potency with mental health and addiction (PROSPERO, CRD42021226447). We searched Embase, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE (from database inception to Jan 14, 2021). Included studies were observational studies of human participants comparing the association of high-potency cannabis (products with a higher concentration of THC) and low-potency cannabis (products with a lower concentration of THC), as defined by the studies included, with depression, anxiety, psychosis, or cannabis use disorder (CUD). Of 4171 articles screened, 20 met the eligibility criteria: eight studies focused on psychosis, eight on anxiety, seven on depression, and six on CUD. Overall, use of higher potency cannabis, relative to lower potency cannabis, was associated with an increased risk of psychosis and CUD. Evidence varied for depression and anxiety. The association of cannabis potency with CUD and psychosis highlights its relevance in health-care settings, and for public health guidelines and policies on cannabis sales. Standardisation of exposure measures and longitudinal designs are needed to strengthen the evidence of this association.

VA/DoD 2022 MDD guideline — psilocybin, MDMA, cannabis, and other unapproved pharmacologic treatments: Given limited information on safety and efficacy, we recommend against using these agents for MDD outside of a research setting (Strong against | Reviewed, New-added). Evidence included one small low‑quality psilocybin study comparing immediate versus delayed therapy with improvements in depressive symptoms at five and eight weeks and decreased anxiety at eight weeks; however, the intervention was multi‑component, the comparator was effectively a waitlist control, and no studies met criteria for cannabis, cannabinoid, or MDMA. The guideline cites concerns for potential harms (abuse and addiction potential), resource and feasibility challenges with prolonged therapeutic interventions and monitoring (between eight to 12 hours) and pharmacy implications with psilocybin and MDMA currently classified as U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Schedule 1 compounds, and it states the confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low.

### Risk of depressive disorders associated with medical cannabis authorization: a propensity score matched cohort study [^2827573c]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

There is an increase in the medical use of cannabis. However, the safety of medical cannabis, particularly for mental health conditions, has not yet been clearly established. Thus, this study assessed the risk of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalization for depressive disorders among medical cannabis users. We conducted a retrospective longitudinal cohort study of patients who received medical authorization to use cannabis from 2014 to 2019 in Ontario, matched (1:3 ratio) to population-based controls using propensity scores. Conditional Cox regressions were used to assess the association between cannabis authorization and the outcome. A total of 54,006 cannabis-authorized patients and 161,265 controls were analyzed. Approximately 39% were aged under 50 years, 54% were female, and 16% had a history of anxiety or mood disorders. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for depressive disorders was 2.02 (95%CI: 1.83–2.22). The aHR was 2.23 (1.95–2.55) among subjects without prior mental health disorders. The interaction between sex (or age) and exposure was not significant. In conclusion, medical cannabis authorization was associated with an increased risk of depressive disorders. This finding highlights the need for a careful risk-benefit assessment when authorizing cannabis, particularly for patients who seek cannabis to treat a depressive condition.

Psychiatric comorbidities

US surveys estimate substantial comorbidity of CUDs with mood (39.6%), anxiety (30.5%) and personality (35.9%) disorders 92. Most evidence points towards a bidirectional relationship, where CUD increases the odds and symptom severity of other psychiatric disorders and vice versa 93. For example, there is substantial evidence that cannabis use negatively impacts the development of manic symptoms in bipolar disorder (e.g. 27) and CUD is associated with higher risks for comorbid depression (e.g. 94). In turn, depression may increase CUD risk 25. Self‐medication may play an important role in explaining these relationships. Although the therapeutic effects of cannabis remain to be confirmed, reduction of anxiety or post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)‐related sleep problems are commonly reported motives of use 30, 95. However, cannabis intoxication may also trigger anxiety attacks, especially at higher doses 14, 28, and increase the risk for an anxiety disorder 28, 29.

Although evidence is mixed 96, 97, earlier onset and heavier patterns of use may increase risks for comorbid psychiatric disorders. For example, adolescent‐onset relative to adult‐onset cannabis users had an increased risk of developing depression in mid‐life 26. Early onset has also been associated with an increased likelihood of attempting suicide (e.g. 98).

The relationship between cannabis and psychosis and schizophrenia is among the most investigated topics in the cannabis literature 31, 32, 33. Intoxication studies show a time‐bound, dose‐dependent effect of cannabis on positive psychotic symptoms (e.g. paranoia, delusions and fragmented thinking) (e.g. 99). THC is responsible for these transient effects, which CBD may attenuate (e.g. 100). Studies investigating negative psychotic symptoms are scarce, but there are indications of THC‐induced blunted affect, psychomotor problems, and emotional withdrawal (e.g. 101). For individuals with schizophrenia, cannabis use can aggravate symptoms (e.g. 102). Age of onset, heavy use and using high‐potency cannabis increases the risk for psychosis and schizophrenia 33. However, more longitudinal studies are needed to establish causality and exclude the possibility of other explanations, such as shared (genetic) risk factors or self‐medication of premorbid symptoms.

### Major depressive disorder, suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and cannabis involvement in discordant twins: a retrospective cohort study [^db9e843e]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Major Depressive Disorder

In samples 2 and 3, DSM-IV criteria were used to diagnose MDD. Sample 1 assessed DSM-IIIR criteria and these were modified to define DSM-IV MDD. In samples 2 and 3, onset was conservatively assumed to occur when an individual reported experiencing recurring episodes of dysphoria (feeling depressed or down for most of the day for two weeks or longer) or anhedonia (lot less interested in most things for most of the day for two weeks or longer). In sample 1, age at onset of the most severe depressive episode was used. Across the samples, a subset of participants meeting criteria for MDD reported onset of dysphoric/anhedonia mood (or of the most severe episode, if sample 1) prior to onset of cannabis use (n = 791). MDD diagnosis was set to missing in these individuals for analysis of MDD only.

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviours

All participants were asked if they had ever thought about taking their own life (suicidal ideation) and whether they had ever tried to take their own life (suicide attempt), regardless of ideation. In addition, those who reported ideation were also asked if they had experienced ideation for longer than a day (persistent ideation) and whether they had made a plan to take their own life (suicide plan). Individuals reporting suicidal ideation (n = 868) or suicide attempt (n = 140) prior to onset of cannabis use were uninformative and, thus, set to missing for analyses related to these outcomes only.

### Associations between substance use disorders and major depression in parents and late adolescent-emerging adult offspring: an adoption study [^19f86d9a]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

To examine whether major depressive disorder (MDD) and substance use disorders [SUDs: specifically, nicotine dependence (ND), alcohol use disorders (AUDs), and cannabis use disorders (CUDs)] in parents predicted increased risk for these disorders in late adolescent-emerging adult offspring and, specifically, the extent to which the pattern of risk differed for adopted and non-adopted youth.

Participants

Late adolescent and emerging adult participants from the Sibling Interaction and Behavior Study (mean age = 18.8), a community-based investigation of adopted and non-adopted adolescents, and their parents (adoptive parents of adopted youth, biological parents of non-adopted adolescents) were included.

Measurements

Structured interviews were used to assess these disorders.

Findings

(i) When the same disorder in parents and adolescents was examined, parental MDD was associated with increased risk for MDD among both adopted (P < 0.001) and non-adopted (P < 0.01) adolescents; in contrast, SUDs were associated with increased risk for the same SUD in non-adopted offspring (all P < 0.01). (ii) When cross-SUD effects were examined, for the most part, each SUD was associated with increased risk for other SUDs among non-adopted but not adopted offspring (most P < 0.05). (iii) When MDD-SUD associations were examined, parental ND and CUDs predicted increased risk for MDD in non-adopted (P < 0.001), but not adopted, adolescents. These effects tended to remain significant when adjusting for within-person comorbidity (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Major depressive disorder in parents appears to be a risk factor for late adolescent-emerging adult major depressive disorder but not substance use disorder in offspring, with this risk being environmentally mediated. Substance use disorder in parents appears, via genetic mediation, to increase risk of substance use disorder in adolescent offspring, and cannabis and nicotine use disorders in parents contribute similarly to major depressive disorder in those offspring.

### Major depression: the relative contribution of gender, MDMA, and cannabis use [^77608342]. Depression and Anxiety (2008). Low credibility.

Previous research has suggested that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) users have elevated depressive symptomatology, although it is not clear whether this is due to MDMA or other drug use. This study aimed to investigate the contributions of MDMA and cannabis use to Major Depressive Disorder in MDMA users. A total of 226 MDMA users were studied. Participants (65% male) reported an average number of 35.8 uses of MDMA (SD = 45.6, range = 2–400). Participants were administered a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Twenty-six individuals (11.5%) met lifetime criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. High rates of lifetime Cannabis Abuse (30.1%) and Cannabis Dependence (12.4%) were reported. No association was found between number of uses of MDMA and Major Depressive Disorder. Those with lifetime major depression were found, however, to have higher rates of lifetime cannabis use disorder (adjusted OR = 2.40). A logistic regression indicated that lifetime cannabis use disorder, but not MDMA use, was significantly associated with lifetime Major Depressive Disorder. Stratified analyses suggested that for males, neither drug use variable was associated with major depression. For females, a lifetime cannabis use disorder (adjusted OR = 4.99), but not MDMA use, was associated with lifetime Major Depressive Disorder. Results of this study suggest that although MDMA use was not found to be significantly associated with major depression for either gender, a lifetime cannabis use disorder was significantly associated with lifetime major depression for female, but not male, users of MDMA.

### Depression and past-month cannabis use among US adults aged 20 to 59 years, 2005–2016… [^c4b45d2f]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

In this repeated cross-sectional study of 16 216 adults, those with depression increased their rates of cannabis use significantly faster than those without depression. In 2005 to 2006, individuals with depression had 46% higher odds of any cannabis use and 37% higher odds of near-daily cannabis use, while in 2015 to 2016, individuals with depression had 130% higher odds of any cannabis use and 216% higher odds of daily cannabis use. Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this study indicate that individuals with depression are at increasing risk of cannabis use, with a particularly strong increase in daily or near-daily cannabis use. Clinicians should be aware of these trends and the evidence that cannabis does not treat depression effectively when discussing cannabis use with patients. This study used nationally representative data to examine trends in the association between depression and cannabis use in US adults aged 20 to 59 years using the NHANES.

Overall, there were 3 major findings, as follows: the prevalence of any past-month cannabis use and daily or near-daily cannabis use increased from 2005 to 2016, while the prevalence of depression remained stable; individuals with depression had approximately double the odds of using cannabis compared with people without depression; and the association between depression and cannabis use strengthened from 2005 to 2016. Finally, we found a marked increase in the association between any and daily or near-daily cannabis use and depression from 2005 to
2016. In 2005 to 2006, individuals with depression had 46% higher odds of any cannabis use and 30% higher odds of near-daily cannabis use. In 2015 to 2016, individuals with depression had 130% higher odds of any cannabis use and 216% higher odds of daily cannabis use. These results suggest that over time, a higher proportion of individuals with depression are using cannabis.

This could be the case if an increasing number of individuals with depression are using cannabis to self-medicate, potentially influenced by media and advertising presenting cannabis as beneficial to health. 32–35 These results could also be interpreted as indicating that an increasing proportion of individuals who use cannabis are developing depression. However, if this were true, we would expect to see that as the prevalence of cannabis use increased, the prevalence of depression increased as well. However, depression stayed relatively stable during the study period, not supporting the latter interpretation.

### Cannabis and cannabinoids in adults with cancer: ASCO guideline [^fbeb044e]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Psychiatric and dependence-related effects of cannabis — chronic cannabis use carries long-term psychiatric risks, which may be correlated with cumulative exposure including age of first use, and may be associated with an increased risk for developing depressive disorders and may exacerbate psychiatric disorders in vulnerable individuals. Ten percent of adults with chronic cannabis use may also develop cannabis use disorders, associated with clinically significant impairment or distress, including using more cannabis than expected and difficulty in cutting back on use. Outside of oncology, a randomized trial found that participants who received a medical cannabis card had an almost two times greater incidence (17% versus 9%) of developing cannabis use disorder within 12 weeks than controls without a medical cannabis card. Clinicians should also recognize that long-term daily cannabis users may experience non–life-threatening withdrawal symptoms after cessation of cannabis, with symptoms that usually occur within 3 days after cessation and may last up to 14 days.

### Safety and toxicology of cannabinoids [^f9798f0b]. Neurotherapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Effects on Mental Health

Disruptions of the cannabinergic system may have important implications for a number of neurobehavioral processes. There is evidence of an association between cannabis use and both acute and chronic mental illness and psychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, psychosis, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and an amotivational state. However, given the variation in the disease process, as well as inconsistent cannabis dosing and composition, the full nature of the associations remains to be clarified.

In studies of cannabis use and bipolar disorder, it appears that cannabis use may exacerbate or trigger manic symptoms among individuals previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Gibbs et al. found a 3-fold increase in risk for onset of manic symptoms after cannabis use. However, there does not seem to be evidence that cannabis use is a risk factor for developing bipolar disorder. Mixed findings are found when examining the relationship between cannabis use and depression and anxiety. There is some evidence that cannabis use and cannabis withdrawal may result in acute depressed mood. Similarly, studies suggest that cannabis may increase acute anxiety. The picture of chronic anxiety and depression and cannabis use is more complicated, in part because frequent cannabis users have both a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders, and individuals with anxiety have high rates of cannabis use. The fact that individuals who initiate cannabis use in adolescence may develop depression and anxiety that persists after cessation may also influence this relationship. Furthermore, interpreting causality is complicated by the fact that a low concentration of THC may have anxiolytic effects, whereas higher concentrations produce anxiogenic effects, and the evidence that CBD may mitigate the effects of THC in animal models of anxiety.

A significant portion of the literature dedicated to cannabis use and mental health focuses on the relationship between cannabis use and schizophrenia and psychosis. A number of studies suggest that acute cannabis exposure may induce temporary psychosis. Additionally, chronic cannabis use may trigger psychosis and schizophrenia in individuals with a predisposition or genetic susceptibility to mental illness. This appears to occur in a dose-dependent manner, such that heavy cannabis use, longer duration, greater potency, and early onset of use may be more closely aligned with disease trajectory, often significantly advancing the first psychotic episode and development of schizophrenia. Additionally, lifetime cannabis use has been associated with higher schizotypy scores, and cannabis may exacerbate pre-existing symptoms of psychosis and schizophrenia. Furthermore, individuals with psychosis may be more vulnerable to brain volume loss, which has been suggested as a result of cannabis exposure.

Regarding specific circumstances for cannabis use disorder, more specifically with respect to elderly patients (education and counseling), CCSMH 2020 guidelines recommend to counsel patients on the potential long-term effects of frequent cannabis use, including respiratory problems, precancerous epithelial changes, and cognitive impairment, as well as the risk of exacerbation of mental health conditions with CUD, especially when high THC strains are used.

### The genetic basis of the comorbidity between cannabis use and major depression [^3263f6b4]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

While the prevalence of major depression is elevated among cannabis users, the role of genetics in this pattern of comorbidity is not clear. This study aimed to estimate the heritability of cannabis use and major depression, quantify the genetic overlap between these two traits and localize regions of the genome that segregate in families with cannabis use and major depression.

Design

Family-based univariate and bivariate genetic analysis.

Setting

San Antonio, Texas, USA.

Participants

Genetics of Brain Structure and Function study (GOBS) participants: 1284 Mexican Americans from 75 large multi-generation families and an additional 57 genetically unrelated spouses.

Measurements

Phenotypes of life-time history of cannabis use and major depression, measured using the semistructured MINI-Plus interview. Genotypes measured using ~1 M single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on Illumina BeadChips. A subselection of these SNPs were used to build multi-point identity-by-descent matrices for linkage analysis.

Findings

Both cannabis use [h² = 0.614, P = 1.00 × 10⁻⁶, standard error (SE) = 0.151] and major depression (h² = 0.349, P = 1.06 × 10⁻⁵, SE = 0.100) are heritable traits, and there is significant genetic correlation between the two (ρ_g = 0.424, P = 0.0364, SE = 0.195). Genome-wide linkage scans identify a significant univariate linkage peak for major depression on chromosome 22 [logarithm of the odds (LOD) = 3.144 at 2 centimorgans (cM)], with a suggestive peak for cannabis use on chromosome 21 (LOD = 2.123 at 37 cM). A significant pleiotropic linkage peak influencing both cannabis use and major depression was identified on chromosome 11 using a bivariate model (LOD = 3.229 at 112 cM). Follow-up of this pleiotropic signal identified a SNP 20 kb upstream of NCAM1 (rs7932341) that shows significant bivariate association (P = 3.10 × 10–5). However, this SNP is rare (seven minor allele carriers) and does not drive the linkage signal observed.

Conclusions

There appears to be a significant genetic overlap between cannabis use and major depression among Mexican Americans, a pleiotropy that appears to be localized to a region on chromosome 11q23 that has been linked previously to these phenotypes.

### Clearing up the smoke: physical and mental health considerations regarding cannabis use in adolescents with cystic fibrosis [^1d06ea7a]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Medium credibility.

3.4 Suicide

Suicide is the second leading cause of death in youth ages 10–19. Compared with healthy controls, youth with chronic physical health conditions have a 28% increase in suicidal thoughts, 134% increased risk of suicidal planning, and 363% increased risk of attempting suicide. Logan et. al.screened 18 youth with CF, ages 8–17, with the Children's Depression Inventory, and four patients (22%) reported a history of suicidal ideation. According to the CF Foundation, among the 252 deaths in 2020, 11 individuals (4.4%) died by suicide or drug overdose. There is minimal data examining suicide ideation or attempts among adolescents with CF and comorbid cannabis use. However, it is known that cannabis is independently associated with increased suicidal ideation. Among 281,650 participants in the 2008–2019 National Surveys of Drug Use and Health, cannabis use was associated with a higher prevalence of past‐year suicidal ideation, suicide planning, and suicide attempts, even after controlling for major depressive disorder. Another meta‐analysis conducted among adolescents and young adults with cannabis use showed the pooled OR for suicide attempt as 3.46 (95% CI: 153–7.84).

3.5 Psychosis

There appears to be no evidence to indicate a relationship between CF and psychosis. However, corticosteroids and glucocorticoids, commonly used in CF exacerbations, can induce psychosis. In addition, cannabis use is strongly associated with development of psychosis in a dose–response fashion. The OR for development of schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders, in heavy users of cannabis, as compared with nonusers is 3.90 (95% CI: 2.84–5.34). Clinicians should assess if there are possible drug interactions with current medications (e.g. CFTR modulators) and CBD.

### Self-reported depressive symptomatology in community samples of polysubstance misusers who report ecstasy use: a meta-analysis [^1f0c5f03]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2005). Low credibility.

National drugs information strategies convey the message that use of Ecstasy is associated with an increase in both the incidence and severity of major depressive disorder. However, very little primary research supports this. Unlike apparent deficits in higher cognitive functions, most published studies have found no difference in self-reported depressive symptomatology between Ecstasy users and controls. To investigate this further, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies investigating depressive symptomatology in recreational users of Ecstasy. According to selection criteria, we identified 25 relevant studies. A statistically significant effect size (ES) of 0.31 (95% confidence interval 0.17–0.37, p < 0.001) was calculated. Significance remained after examining the small number of studies that controlled for cannabis use (n = 9, p < 0.001) but, in general, drug histories were poorly reported. There was an association between ES and lifetime Ecstasy exposure (p < 0.001), but not for other use parameters or abstention (p > 0.05). These data indicate that there is an association between Ecstasy use and depressive symptomatology, but this is small and unlikely to be clinically relevant. In addition, the self-report scales used may be heavily confounded by the somatic effects of substance misuse. Public health strategies derived from psychopharmacological investigations should acknowledge the potential negative effects of substance misuse but qualify the difficulties in interpreting research studies.

### Cannabis use and mental health-related quality of life among individuals with depressive disorders [^9af3bf90]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance among individuals with depressive disorders. This study aimed to evaluate whether among individuals with depressive disorders, higher frequency of cannabis use would be associated with poorer Quality of Life (QoL), based on a large nationally representative US sample. Individuals with depressive disorders (N = 3416) were divided into categories according to no use (N = 3096), occasional use (less than weekly, N = 176) and regular (at least weekly, N = 144) use of cannabis in the past 12 months. QoL was assessed using the Short-Form 12 (SF-12) questionnaire. Women who used cannabis regularly had a significantly lower SF-12 Mental Component Summary score (MCS) compared to non-users, with a mean difference of 0.4 Standard Deviations (SDs). Comparison of subscale scores showed no significant differences. No significant difference was noted when comparing women who used cannabis occasionally to non-users. No differences were found among men when comparing MCS and mental subscale scores of both regular and occasional users to non-users. Our findings highlight the importance of taking gender and the frequency of cannabis use into account, when assessing functional and emotional aspects of cannabis use among individuals with depressive disorders.

### Cannabis controversies: how genetics can inform the study of comorbidity [^f35a6be6]. Addiction (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

To review three key and controversial comorbidities of cannabis use-other illicit drug use, psychosis and depression, as well as suicide, from a genetically informed perspective.

Design

Selective review.

Results

Genetic factors play a critical role in the association between cannabis use, particularly early-onset use and use of other illicit drugs, psychosis and depression, as well as suicide, albeit via differing mechanisms. For other illicit drugs, while there is strong evidence for shared genetic influences, residual association that is attributable to causal or person-specific environmental factors cannot be ruled out. For depression, common genetic influences are solely responsible for the association with cannabis use but for suicidal attempt, evidence for person-specific factors persists. Finally, even though rates of cannabis use are inordinately high in those with psychotic disorders, there is no evidence of shared genetic etiologies underlying this comorbidity. Instead, there is limited evidence that adolescent cannabis use might moderate the extent to which diathesis influences psychosis.

Conclusions

Overlapping genetic influences underlie the association between early-onset cannabis use and other illicit drug use as well as depression and suicide. For psychosis, mechanisms other than shared genetic influences might be at play.

### Associations between primary care recorded cannabis use and mental ill health in the UK: a population-based retrospective cohort study using UK primary care data [^a2b3b5fe]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cannabis use is a global public health issue associated with increased risks of developing mental health disorders, especially in young people. We aimed to investigate the relationships between cannabis exposure and risks of receiving mental illness diagnoses or treatment as outcomes.

Methods

A population based, retrospective, open cohort study using patients recorded in 'IQVIA medical research data', a UK primary care database. Read codes were used to confirm patients with recorded exposure to cannabis use who were matched up to two unexposed patients. We examined the risk of developing three categories of mental ill health: depression, anxiety or serious mental illness (SMI).

Results

At study entry, the exposed cohort had an increased likelihood of having experienced mental ill health [odds ratio (OR) 4.13; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.99–4.27] and mental ill health-related prescription (OR 2.95; 95% CI 2.86–3.05) compared to the unexposed group. During the study period we found that exposure to cannabis was associated with an increased risk of developing any mental disorder [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 2.73; 95% CI 2.59–2.88], also noted when examining by subtype of disorder: anxiety (aHR 2.46; 95% CI 2.29–2.64), depression (aHR 2.34; 95% CI 2.20–2.49) and SMI (aHR 6.41; 95% CI 5.42–7.57). These results remained robust in sensitivity analyses.

Conclusion

These findings point to the potential need for a public health approach to the management of people misusing cannabis. However, there is a gross under-recording of cannabis use in GP records, as seen by the prevalence of recorded cannabis exposure substantially lower than self-reported survey records.

### The association between cannabis and depression: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^1053e013]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Search results

Overall, 1,599 titles were initially screened across PubMed (1372), MedLine (222), and ProQuest (5). From the ancestor search of the Lev-Ran articles, we screened an additional 969 articles. After duplicates were removed (n = 249) there were 2,319 articles that were title screened. We excluded 2,123 articles based on title screening, leaving 94 articles for abstract/full-text screen. The most common reasons for exclusion were review articles, included only special populations (i.e. Veterans (Gunn et al.), LGBT (London-Nadeau et al.)), study design (i.e. cross-sectional (Hawke et al,)), or did not look at depression separately from other mental health outcomes (Spineli & Pandis). In the end, 22 studies were included in the meta-analysis, which included the 14 original articles from the Lev-Ran meta-analysis. Summaries of the included studies can be found in Tables 1 and 2. Study selection is visualized in the PRISMA diagram (Figure 1).

### Association of cannabis with long-term clinical symptoms in anxiety and mood disorders: a systematic review of prospective studies [^a4ad9c3a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To systematically review studies examining the longitudinal associations between cannabis use and symptomatic outcomes among individuals with an anxiety or mood disorder at baseline.

Data Sources

A search of the literature up to May 2017 was conducted using several databases. Search terms related to the exposure (ie, cannabis) and outcome (ie, symptoms) variables of interest. There were no search restrictions.

Study Selection

In total, 10,191 citations were screened. Key inclusion criteria related to (1) cohort-based longitudinal study design using adults who met criteria for a mood or anxiety disorder at baseline, (2) an independent variable focusing on at least baseline cannabis use, and (3) a dependent variable focusing on the symptomatic course and/or outcomes in anxiety and mood disorders (AMD).

Data Extraction

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Methodological characteristics and key findings were extracted from each study, and quality assessments were conducted for each study.

Results

Twelve studies (with a total of 11,959 individuals) met inclusion criteria related to posttraumatic stress disorder (n = 4), panic disorder (n = 1), bipolar disorder (n = 5), and depressive disorder (n = 2). Across 11 studies, "recent" cannabis use (ie, any/greater frequency of use during the last 6 months) was associated with higher symptomatic levels over time relative to comparison groups (ie, no/lesser frequency of use). Ten of these studies further suggested that cannabis use was associated with less symptomatic improvement from treatment (eg, medication, psychotherapy for AMD).

Conclusions

Recent cannabis use was associated with negative long-term symptomatic and treatment outcomes across AMD. The findings should be interpreted with caution, considering the observational designs across studies and the biases associated with the samples (eg, inpatients) and sources of cannabis consumed (ie, unregulated sources). Nonetheless, clinicians can use the insight gained to inform their own and their patients' knowledge concerning potential risks of cannabis with regard to symptoms of AMD.

### Cannabis abuse as a risk factor for depressive symptoms [^b123bb73]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

This study sought to estimate the degree to which cannabis abuse is a risk factor for depressive symptoms rather than an effort to self-medicate depression.

Method

Participants (N = 1,920) in the 1980 Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) study who were reassessed between 1994 and 1996 as part of a follow-up study provided the data. The analysis focused on two cohorts: those who reported no depressive symptoms at baseline (N = 849) and those with no diagnosis of cannabis abuse at baseline (N = 1,837). Symptoms of depression, cannabis abuse, and other psychiatric disorders were assessed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule.

Results

In participants with no baseline depressive symptoms, those with a diagnosis of cannabis abuse at baseline were four times more likely than those with no cannabis abuse diagnosis to have depressive symptoms at the follow-up assessment, after adjusting for age, gender, antisocial symptoms, and other baseline covariates. In particular, these participants were more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation and anhedonia during the follow-up period. Among the participants who had no diagnosis of cannabis abuse at baseline, depressive symptoms at baseline failed to significantly predict cannabis abuse at the follow-up assessment.

Conclusions

Further research is needed to identify characteristics of individuals who abuse cannabis that account for their higher risk of depression to estimate the degree of impairment resulting from their depression.

### Cannabis use and risk of psychotic or affective mental health outcomes: a systematic review [^c0cc0aa2]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

Whether cannabis can cause psychotic or affective symptoms that persist beyond transient intoxication is unclear. We systematically reviewed the evidence pertaining to cannabis use and occurrence of psychotic or affective mental health outcomes.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Knowledge, ISI Proceedings, ZETOC, BIOSIS, LILACS, and MEDCARIB from their inception to September, 2006, searched reference lists of studies selected for inclusion, and contacted experts. Studies were included if longitudinal and population based. 35 studies from 4804 references were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were done independently and in duplicate.

Findings

There was an increased risk of any psychotic outcome in individuals who had ever used cannabis (pooled adjusted odds ratio = 1.41, 95% CI 1.20–1.65). Findings were consistent with a dose-response effect, with greater risk in people who used cannabis most frequently (2.09, 1.54–2.84). Results of analyses restricted to studies of more clinically relevant psychotic disorders were similar. Depression, suicidal thoughts, and anxiety outcomes were examined separately. Findings for these outcomes were less consistent, and fewer attempts were made to address non-causal explanations, than for psychosis. A substantial confounding effect was present for both psychotic and affective outcomes.

Interpretation

The evidence is consistent with the view that cannabis increases risk of psychotic outcomes independently of confounding and transient intoxication effects, although evidence for affective outcomes is less strong. The uncertainty about whether cannabis causes psychosis is unlikely to be resolved by further longitudinal studies such as those reviewed here. However, we conclude that there is now sufficient evidence to warn young people that using cannabis could increase their risk of developing a psychotic illness later in life.

### Treatment of cannabis use among people with psychotic or depressive disorders: a systematic review [^35c29fec]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

This article systematically reviews the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for pharmacologic and psychological approaches to the treatment of cannabis use among individuals with psychotic or depressive disorders.

Data Sources

A systematic literature search was conducted using the PubMed and PsychINFO databases from inception to December 2008. Individual searches in cannabis use (search terms: marijuana, cannabis, marijuana abuse, cannabis abuse, marijuana usage, cannabis usage), mental disorders (search terms: mood disorders, affective disorders, anxiety disorders, anxiety, depressive disorder, depression, psychotic disorders, psychosis, mental disorders), and pharmacotherapy (search terms: medication, drug therapy, pharmacotherapy, psychopharmacology, clinical trials, drug trial, treatment trial) were conducted and limited to humans, adolescents and adults.

Study Selection

A search combining the individual cannabis use, mental disorder and pharmacotherapy searches produced 1,713 articles (PubMed = 1,398; PsychINFO = 315). Combining the cannabis use and mental disorder searches while limiting them to English articles and RCTs produced a total of 286 articles (PubMed = 228; PsychINFO = 58). From this literature, there were 7 RCTs conducted among mental health clients that reported cannabis use outcomes using pharmacologic or psychological interventions.

Data Synthesis

While few RCTs have been conducted, there is evidence that pharmacologic and psychological interventions are effective for reducing cannabis use in the short-term among people with psychotic disorders or depression.

Conclusions

Although it is difficult to make evidence-based treatment recommendations due to the paucity of research in this area, available studies indicate that effectively treating the mental health disorder with standard pharmacotherapy may be associated with a reduction in cannabis use and that longer or more intensive psychological interventions rather than brief interventions may be required, particularly among heavier users of cannabis and those with more chronic mental disorders. Specific recommendations regarding the type and length of specific psychological treatments cannot be made at this time, although motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioral therapy approaches appear most promising.

### Clinical practice guideline: assessment and treatment of adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders and problematic substance use (excluding tobacco) [^85ec69c1]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Psychiatric comorbidities in adolescents and young adults with SUD/PSU commonly include conduct problems, ADHD (both diagnosed and undiagnosed), mood disorders, and trauma-related symptoms, with additional evidence for obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorder, and learning and language disorders. There is a complex and bidirectional relationship between mental health disorders and SUD/PSU, with co-occurring conditions presenting before the onset of SUD/PSU or developing later, and such comorbidity is associated with greater symptom severity and functional impairment, worse treatment engagement and outcomes, higher relapse rates, and elevated suicide risk compared to SUD/PSU alone. Surveys and prospective studies suggest that mood, anxiety, conduct disorders, and ADHD often precede and increase the risk of SUD/PSUs; longitudinal surveys show PTSD increases the risk of developing opioid use disorder and is associated with higher OUD severity. Increasing longitudinal and prospective data show an association between regular cannabis use in adolescence and young adulthood and depression, suicidal ideation/attempts, and anxiety; a narrative review concluded that antidepressant medicines are less effective for adolescents with depression/anxiety who frequently use cannabis, and reduced cannabis use among youth with both substance use and depression predicted earlier improvement in depression symptoms. Problematic alcohol use and alcohol use disorder (AUD) predict mood disorders in men, and SUD/PSUs can trigger new-onset psychiatric symptoms, with use of one substance often leading to problematic use of other substances.

### Pharmacotherapies for cannabis use disorder [^b6f043b8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Globally, cannabis use is prevalent and widespread. There are currently no pharmacotherapies approved for the treatment of cannabis use disorder (a problematic pattern of cannabis use that leads to clinically significant impairment or distress). This is the second update of a Cochrane Review first published in the Cochrane Library in Issue 12, 2014.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapies as compared with each other, placebo or no pharmacotherapy (supportive care) for reducing symptoms of cannabis withdrawal and promoting cessation or reduction of cannabis use.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO in May 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of medications to treat cannabis withdrawal and/or to promote cessation or reduction of cannabis use, in comparison with other medications, placebo or no medication in people diagnosed as cannabis dependent or who are likely to be dependent.

Outcomes

Critical outcomes were: 1) abstinence at the end of treatment; 2) intensity of withdrawal including craving; 3) nature, incidence and frequency of adverse events (AE) and 4) severe AE (SAE); 5) withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects and whether the planned medication regimen was modified in response to adverse effects; 6) completion of scheduled treatment. Important outcomes were: 1) cannabis use at the end of treatment; 2) number of participants engaged in further treatment; 3) economic outcomes.

Risk Of Bias

We assessed the risk of bias in results included in meta-analyses using the risk of bias 2 (RoB 2) tool.

Synthesis Methods

We synthesised results for each outcome using random-effect meta-analysis where possible. Where this was not possible due to the nature of the data, we reported results narratively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Included Studies

We included 37 RCTs (3201 participants). Most were undertaken in the USA (29), Australia (4), Israel (2), Canada (1) and the United Kingdom (1), mainly recruiting adults (mean age 22–41 years), with four studies only including young people (mean age 17–21 years). In 32 studies, most of the participants were male (56–92%). Five studies targeted participants with comorbidities (depression (2), bipolar disorder (1), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (1)). Eleven studies received study medicines from the manufacturing company and none were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Thirty-six studies compared active medications and placebo; one study compared four active medications. Medications were diverse, as were the outcomes reported, which limited the potential for synthesis.

Synthesis Of Results

Abstinence at end of treatment was no more likely with Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) preparations (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.52; 4 studies, 290 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or N-acetylcysteine (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.88; 2 studies, 270 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and may be no more likely with cannabidiol (RR 2.23, 95% CI 0.54 to 9.32; 1 study, 68 participants; low-certainty evidence) or with anticonvulsant and mood stabilisers (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.92; 1 study, 29 participants; very low-certainty evidence), when compared with placebo, but the evidence is uncertain. AE and SAE. There was probably little to no difference in the likelihood of AEs in participants treated with THC preparations (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 5 studies, 507 participants), cannabidiol (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.25; 2 studies, 57 participants), N-acetylcysteine (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.07; 2 studies, 418 participants), PF-04457845 (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.11; 2 studies, 298 participants) (all moderate-certainty evidence) and there may be little to no difference in participants treated with anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.13; 4 studies, 331 participants) or oxytocin (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.47; 1 study, 16 participants) (both low-certainty evidence), compared with placebo. SAE may be no more likely with THC preparations (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.25 to 3.9; 7 studies, 584 participants), N-acetylcysteine (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.33; 2 studies, 418 participants), PF-04457845 (RR 4.83, 95% CI 0.23 to 99.48; 2 studies, 298 participants), compared with placebo (all low-certainty evidence). Withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects was more likely with anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers (RR 2.88, 95% CI 1.05 to 7.86; 5 studies, 257 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is uncertain. There may be little to no difference in the likelihood of withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects with THC preparations (RR 1.77, 95%CI 0.4 to 7.85; 5 studies, 507 participants), N-acetylcysteine (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.03 to 12.53; 2 studies, 418 participants) compared with placebo (both low-certainty evidence). We found that completion of treatment was probably not more likely with cannabidiol (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.17; 2 studies, 92 participants), anticonvulsant and mood stabilisers (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.03; 6 studies, 407 participants), N-acetylcysteine (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.23; 2 studies, 418 participants), or PF-04457845 (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.07; 2 studies, 298 participants) (all moderate-certainty evidence) and there may be little to no difference in participants treated with THC (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.32; 7 studies, 582 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is incomplete evidence for all the clinically-important pharmacotherapies investigated and, for half of their outcomes, the quality of the evidence was low (44%) or very low (11%). Given the limited evidence of efficacy, those pharmacotherapies should still be considered experimental for treating cannabis use disorder. The greater withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects seen with anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers may limit their therapeutic value.

### Mapping the exposome of mental health: exposome-wide association study of mental health outcomes among UK biobank participants [^b0c50399]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although cannabis use was not among the top exposures, it was consistently identified across major psychiatric diagnoses and symptom dimensions. A substantial body of evidence suggests cannabis use is both a risk factor and a comorbid condition that worsens outcomes among individuals with psychiatric disorders. For instance, cannabis contributes to the development of psychotic disorders (Di Forti et al; Pries et al.) and is often used by individuals with psychosis (Khokhar, Dwiel, Henricks, Doucette & Green). Similarly, a recent study has shown that cannabis use is bidirectionally associated with both anxiety and depression (Radhakrishnan et al.). Furthermore, a meta-analysis by Gobbi et al. found that cannabis use during adolescence moderately increases the risk of developing depression in young adulthood, whereas the evidence linking cannabis use to anxiety remains less conclusive. In bipolar manic disorders, cannabis use increases the risk of relapse and intensifies manic episodes (Gibbs et al.). It is important to note that the odds ratios for the associations between cannabis use and mental health outcomes in our study were relatively lower than those reported in the literature (Jefsen, Erlangsen, Nordentoft, & Hjorthøj). This may be partially attributable to characteristics of the UKB cohort, particularly the older age group of participants, who are past the stage when cannabis is typically most harmful. Additionally, cannabis potency during the recruitment period (2006–2010) was lower compared to more recent strains with higher THC concentrations, potentially contributing to the lower magnitude of observed associations (Freeman et al; Potter, Hammond, Tuffnell, Walker & Di Forti).

### Cannabis use disorder ED visits and hospitalizations and 5-year mortality… [^cf920e5b]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A single study of 6445 individuals treated for CUD in Denmark reported a 4. 7 standardized mortality ratio relative to the general population. 13 However, the study only included 142 deaths in the CUD group, captured a very young cohort, and did not account for comorbid substance use disorders. 13 CUDs in youths with mood disorders have been found to be associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. 6 A larger number of studies have examined the association between differing levels of cannabis use and mortality, with some evidence suggesting that more frequent cannabis use may be associated with increased risk of death. A study of 121 895 participants in the United Kingdom biobank found that self-reported "heavy cannabis use" was associated with a 1. 49-fold increase in all-cause mortality and a
2. 67-fold increase in cardiovascular mortality in females relative to never.

To address these gaps we completed a population-level study in Ontario, Canada's most populous province, where medical cannabis has been widely available since 2015 and nonmedical cannabis was legalized in October 2018. 10 We examined whether individuals with hospital-based care for CUD were at increased risk of all-cause mortality compared with the general population or individuals with hospital-based care for another substance. We examined differences in cause-specific mortality between individual hospital-based CUD care and the general population. In this longitudinal population-based cohort study of 11. 6 million people, we found that individuals with hospital-based care for CUD were at a 6-fold elevated risk of death compared with individuals of the same age and sex.

There continued to be a 3-fold increased risk of death when trying to isolate the effect of CUD by accounting for further differences in sociodemographic and comorbid mental and substance use disorders and other chronic health conditions. Individuals with hospital-based CUD care had a slightly lower risk of death within 5 years than individuals with alcohol use disorder and about half the risk of death of individuals with hospital-based care for stimulants or opioids. We found that hospital-based CUD care was associated with slightly lower risk of death than hospital-based OUD care and a much lower risk than hospital-based StUD or OUD care However, frequent cannabis use and the use of higher-potency cannabis, the principal determinants of developing a CUD, are both increasing rapidly globally.

### Canadian guidelines on cannabis use disorder among older adults [^044c3e2b]. Canadian Geriatrics Journal (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for cannabis use disorder, more specifically with respect to elderly patients (clinical assessment), CCSMH 2020 guidelines recommend to elicit symptoms and signs of cannabis withdrawal, recognizing that a rapid reduction or abrupt discontinuation of cannabis use may also be associated with withdrawal symptoms.

### Impact of adverse childhood experiences on the symptom severity of different mental disorders: a cross-diagnostic study [^ed700e56]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

It must be noted that the effects of ACEs are not specific to schizophrenia. SUDs are among the most commonly occurring disorders in the USA. Some evidence has suggested that sexual abuse, physical abuse, and emotional abusewere associated with SUDs. In patients with SUD, severe sexual and physical abuse experiences were significantly associated with lifetime heroin use, whereas lifetime cocaine use appeared to be associated only with severe physical abuse.

ACEs are also associated with the development of emotional disorders. Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been associated with changes in biological stress systems. ACEs enhanced the risk for MDD and may lead to permanent changes in biological stress regulation systems, including cortisol levels, and cognitive functions. Childhood sexual abuse and physical abuse were related to high levels of depression in adults. Emotional abuse and neglect and physical and sexual abuse were related to depressive symptoms in female samples. In addition, patients with bipolar disorder had a higher prevalence of ACEs; they also had poorer response to treatment, higher numbers of psychiatric hospitalisations, and lower premorbid functioning levels.

Some evidence suggests that ACEs may not only cause the emergence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but also influence individuals to show disease progression, increase in intensity and / or frequency, and changes in content. ACEs have been associated with severe symptoms, higher suicide probability, and resistance to treatmentin patients with OCD. ACEs, specifically emotional abuse and neglect, significantly increase the odds of having OCD.

Some studies have shown that ACEs also increased the incidence of smoking behaviour. Substance abuse seems to mediate ACEs and multiple mental disorders, and the abuse of substances with psychoactive properties, such as alcohol, amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, and hallucinogens, has been associated with a greater risk for psychotic experiences in the general population. There is a significant interaction between childhood sexual abuse and cannabis use, and this may contribute to the development of schizophrenia. Prior studies have found that mood and anxiety disorders (eg, MDD) usually precede the onset of SUDs, and mood and anxiety disorders partially mediate the relationship between ACEs and lifetime diagnoses of SUDs. People who have experienced abuse tend to become depressed more frequently and, thus, may more often use cannabis to alleviate depressive symptoms or more likely develop dysfunctional coping strategies such as self-medication to reduce trauma-related stress.

### A large-scale genome-wide association study meta-analysis of cannabis use disorder [^1467c938]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

Cannabis use disorder is a psychiatric illness that is genetically associated with many negative outcomes (including increased risk of psychiatric disorders and respiratory illnesses). Lifetime cannabis use and cannabis use disorder show at least partially divergent genetic influences and associations with relevant traits. Given increasingly permissive cannabis laws and positive perceptions of its safety, the recognition that cannabis use disorder is a serious psychiatric illness should spur prevention and treatment efforts.

### Self-medication with alcohol or drugs for mood and anxiety disorders: a narrative review of the epidemiological literature [^3be9947c]. Depression and Anxiety (2018). Low credibility.

3.4 The self‐medication hypothesis for MDs

An additional body of literature has assessed the temporal onset of MD and SUD without directly assessing SM, and found evidence for both causal pathways (Crum et al. 2013; Feingold et al. 2015; Fergusson et al. 2009; Kessler et al. 1997; Kuo et al. 2006; Lazareck et al. 2012; Liang et al. 2011; Martins et al. 2012; Wolitzky‐Taylor et al. 2012). Data from Australia showed that those with MD were at a higher risk of incident harmful or dependent drug use (Liang et al. 2011). However, the alternate hypothesis to test whether those with drug use dependence were at a higher risk of developing incident MD was not assessed. In a sample of adolescents from the United States. major depression predicted later onset of AUD, but AUD did not predicted the onset of major depression (Wolitzky‐Taylor et al. 2012). Data from the NCS showed that, in general, depression, dysthymia, and mania more commonly occurred before the onset of alcohol abuse or dependence than after (Kessler et al. 1997). Using longitudinal data from waves 1 and 2 of the NESARC, specific findings about opioid use showed support for both the pathways from MD to opioid use and the reverse (Martins et al. 2012). Using the NESARC data again, different authors found that baseline major depressive disorder predicted the initiation of cannabis use, but no significant association was found for bipolar disorder and incident cannabis use. Furthermore, daily cannabis use was not significantly associated with incident major depression or bipolar disorder (Feingold et al. 2015). A study including three different geographic communities from the USA and Puerto Rico showed that the age of onset for alcohol abuse/dependence disorders and depressive disorders was evenly distributed, with about 50% of depressive disorders occurring before and 50% occurring after the onset of alcohol abuse/dependence (Swendsen et al. 1998). Using data from young adults of age 17–25 years in New Zealand, one study concluded that the strongest pathway existed for baseline alcohol abuse and dependence followed by incident major depression (Fergusson et al. 2009). Finally, using data from a large population‐based registry in Virginia, Kuo et al. 2006, found significant evidence for the pathway of baseline major depression, followed by the onset of alcohol dependence, and no significant evidence for the reverse pathway (Kuo et al. 2006). While all of the above studies measured the temporal association between SUD and MD, none measured self‐reported SM to cope with symptoms of MD.

### Cannabis use, depression and self-harm: phenotypic and genetic relationships [^c0941e92]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The use of cannabis has previously been linked to both depression and self-harm; however, the role of genetics in this relationship is unclear. This study aimed to estimate the phenotypic and genetic associations between cannabis use and depression and self-harm.

Design

Cross-sectional data collected through UK Biobank were used to test the phenotypic association between cannabis use, depression and self-harm. UK Biobank genetic data were then combined with consortia genome-wide association study summary statistics to further test the genetic relationships between these traits using LD score regression, polygenic risk scoring and Mendelian randomization methods.

Setting

United Kingdom, with additional international consortia data.

Participants

A total of 126291 British adults aged between 40 and 70 years, recruited into UK Biobank.

Measurements

Phenotypic outcomes were life-time history of cannabis use (including initial and continued cannabis use), depression (including single-episode and recurrent depression) and self-harm. Genome-wide genetic data were used and assessment centre, batch and the first six principal components were included as key covariates when handling genetic data.

Findings

In UK Biobank, cannabis use is associated with an increased likelihood of depression [odds ratio (OR) = 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.59–1.70] and self-harm (OR = 2.85, 95% CI = 2.69–3.01). The strength of this phenotypic association is stronger when more severe trait definitions of cannabis use and depression are considered. Using consortia genome-wide summary statistics, significant genetic correlations are seen between cannabis use and depression [rg = 0.289, standard error (SE) = 0.036]. Polygenic risk scores for cannabis use and depression explain a small but significant proportion of variance in cannabis use, depression and self-harm within a UK Biobank target sample. However, two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses were not significant.

Conclusions

Cannabis use appeared to be both phenotypically and genetically associated with depression and self-harm. Limitations in statistical power mean that conclusions could not be made on the direction of causality between these traits.

### The endocannabinoid system as a putative target for the development of novel drugs for the treatment of psychiatric illnesses [^2b6fe09a]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

While many advocacy and patient-oriented groups have argued for the use of whole cannabis as a therapeutic approach, there are several key issues that should be addressed. First, cannabis is a complex plant with varying chemical compositions across different strains or chemovars, most of which have largely unknown biological actions. More so, the interactions that could occur through the co-exposure to these molecules represent an unknown that makes the medical community generally wary of this approach. Typical medications come in standardized dosing and formulations for consistency across time and patients, and currently this is virtually impossible to do with cannabis. Second, approximately 19% of individuals who use cannabis develop a cannabis use disorder (CUD) (Hasin,) and therefore this risk must be factored into any therapeutic approach when considering the benefit v. the potential harms. To date, the few studies that have looked at therapeutic effect of cannabis itself have not found robust outcomes associated with cannabis, and as such the overwhelming view is that the potential harms associated with cannabis itself may likely outweigh its potential to provide therapeutic benefit. Third, chronic use of cannabis is known to be associated with alteration of components of the eCB system (Ceccarini et al.). This indicates that there is potential for excess use of cannabis to compromise normative eCB function, which in turn could ultimately make a disease process worse if the pathology of that disease already involves dysfunction of the eCB system. Fourth, cannabis use exhibits clear relationships with either the development or worsening of psychiatric conditions (De Aquino et al.), particularly schizophrenia and possibly depression (Sideli, Quigley, La Cascia, & Murray). While the nature of these relationships is still not entirely clear (Hill,), these risks contribute to the potential harms of utilizing cannabis itself as a therapeutic approach. Thus, the notion that cannabis will become a therapeutic tool that is accepted by the broad medical community seems highly unlikely given the adverse effects and risks for harm described above. Contrastingly, there is a wide-spread recognition that there is a biological basis by which cannabis benefits many individuals, which has led to the perspective that there may be differential ways to target the eCB system independent of cannabis, which could still harness the therapeutic potential of the eCB system, without the potential risks and harms associated with cannabis itself. As such, the aim of this review is to provide an up-to-date discussion of pharmacological approaches targeting the eCB system and the current state of knowledge of how these approaches are being tested for certain psychiatric conditions, with a focus on substance use disorders, trauma related disorders, and autism.

### Major depressive disorder, suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and cannabis involvement in discordant twins: a retrospective cohort study [^e46bc6ce]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

After exclusions for missing data in all three sample sets, 13 986 twin individuals (6181 monozygotic and 7805 dizygotic, including opposite-sex) from Australian datasets acquired between 1992 and 2009 were available for analysis for cannabis use and MDD or suicidal thoughts and behaviours. Monozygotic and same-sex dizygotic twin pairs were selected from this sample. Cannabis use was higher in samples 2 (3741 [59·8%] of 6255) and 3 (2275 [69·0%] of 3299) than in sample 1 (1345 [30·4%] of 4432; table 1). Mean age at onset of cannabis use was higher in sample 1 (21·1 years) but similar in sample 2 (18·9 years) and sample 3 (17·9 years; appendix pp 11–12). Within cannabis users, early and frequent use were correlated (r = 0·46; appendix p 13), with 44% of early users also reporting frequent use of cannabis and 49% of frequent users also reporting use from a young age. The prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviours (without temporal ordering) was lower in sample 1 (1102 [24·9%] of 4432) than in sample 2 (1644 [26·3%] of 6255) and sample 3 (865 [26.2%] of 3299); sample 1 had the lowest prevalence of MDD (901 [20·3%] of 4432) and sample 2 had the highest (1773 [28·3%] of 6255). Similar to cannabis, the age at onset of both suicidal ideation and suicide attempt was higher in sample 1 (24·5 years) than in samples 2 (20·2 years) and sample 3 (20·1 years). MDD and suicidal ideation (r = 0·55) as well as suicide attempt (r = 0·52) were moderately correlated. Nearly all individuals (541 [99·5%] of 544) who reported suicide attempt also reported ideation.

### Comorbidity and coaggregation of major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder and cannabis use disorder in a controlled family study [^80f8d7f4]. JAMA Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Cannabis use disorder (CUD) is increasing in the US. Clarification of the potential mechanisms underlying the comorbidity between mood disorders and CUD may help prevent CUD.

Objective

To examine co-occurrence and familial aggregation of CUD and mood disorder subtypes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this cross-sectional, community-based study in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area, semistructured diagnostic interviews and family history reports assessed lifetime DSM-IV disorders in probands and relatives. Familial aggregation and coaggregation of CUD with mood disorders were estimated via mixed-effects models, adjusting for age, sex, recruitment source, and comorbid mood, anxiety, and other substance use disorders. A total of 586 adult probands (186 with bipolar disorder; 55 with CUD) and 698 first-degree relatives (91 with bipolar disorder; 68 with CUD) were recruited from a community screening of the greater Washington, DC, metropolitan area from May 2004 to August 2020. Inclusion criteria were ability to speak English, and availability and consent to contact at least 2 living first-degree relatives.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Lifetime CUD in first-degree relatives.

Results

Of 586 probands, 395 (67.4%) were female; among 698 relatives, 437 (62.6%) were female. The mean (SD) age was 47.5 (15.2) years for probands and 49.6 (18.0) years for relatives. In the proband group, 82 participants (14.0%) self-identified as African American or Black, 467 (79.7%) as White, and 37 (6.3%) as American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, more than one race, or another race or ethnicity or declined to respond. In the relative group, 53 participants (7.6%) self-identified as African American or Black, 594 (85.1%) as White, and 51 (7.3%) as American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, more than one race, or another race or ethnicity or declined to respond. These groups were combined to protect privacy owing to small numbers. CUD in probands (55 [9.4%]) was associated with an increase in CUD in relatives (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.64; 95% CI, 1.20–5.79; P = 0.02). Bipolar disorder II (BP-II) in probands (72 [12.3%]) was also associated with increased risk of CUD in relatives (aOR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.06–6.23; P = 0.04). However, bipolar disorder I (114 [19.5%]) and major depressive disorder (192 [32.8%]) in probands were not significantly associated with CUD in relatives. Among relatives, CUD was associated with BP-II (aOR, 4.50; 95% CI, 1.72–11.77; P = 0.002), major depressive disorder (aOR, 3.64; 95% CI, 1.78–7.45; P < .001), and mean (SD) age (42.7 [12.8] years with CUD vs 50.3 [18.3] years without CUD; aOR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96–1.00; P = 0.02). Familial coaggregation of BP-II with CUD was attenuated by the inclusion of comorbid anxiety disorders. Further, rates of CUD were highest in relatives with both a familial and individual history of BP-II (no familial or individual history of BP-II: 41 [7.2%]; familial history but no individual history of BP-II: 13 [19.1%]; individual history but no familial history of BP-II: 10 [22.2%]; familial and individual history of BP-II: 4 [28.6%]; Fisher exact test, P < .001). The onset of mood disorder subtypes preceded CUD in probands and relatives in most cases.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings confirmed a familial aggregation of CUD. The increase in risk of CUD among relatives of probands with BP-II suggests that CUD may share a common underlying diathesis with BP-II. Taken together with the temporal precedence of depression and mania with respect to CUD onset, these findings highlight a potential role for BP-II intervention as CUD prevention.
