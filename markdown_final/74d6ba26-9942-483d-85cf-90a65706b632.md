## Question

What is the number needed to treat hep c screen

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the number needed to screen (NNS) to identify one case of hepatitis C virus infection across different strategies and settings, and how to interpret and apply those numbers in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what exactly "number needed to screen" means and how it is calculated. Then, I should verify the best available estimates for NNS by screening strategy from high-quality evidence. Next, I will examine how prevalence and implementation assumptions influence NNS. After that, I should consider cost-effectiveness thresholds that contextualize NNS. Finally, I will synthesize practical implications for clinicians and public health programs, including operational considerations like reflex RNA testing and linkage to care.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misstate it: the number needed to screen is the expected number of individuals who must be tested to identify one additional case of current HCV infection, essentially the inverse of the diagnostic yield of a screening strategy in a given population, and it varies with the underlying prevalence and the sensitivity of the screening approach.

> Now, I should verify the most reliable NNS estimates from the updated USPSTF evidence review. The 2020 review reports that, assuming perfect implementation, risk-based screening yields an NNS of about 15, and birth-cohort screening yields an NNS of about 29, which are the clearest NNS figures available from high-quality synthesis, though they are derived from modeling and observational data rather than randomized trials of screening itself [^111c2MPH].

> Wait, let me verify the universal screening NNS because I initially thought it might be around 50 in the general U.S. population; hold on, I should double-check that assumption against the cited evidence. The USPSTF review does not provide a single NNS for universal adult screening, but it does note that as prevalence declines, NNS increases, and CDC operational guidance highlights the statistical challenge of estimating NNS in low-prevalence settings, suggesting that in very low-prevalence environments the NNS can be very high, even exceeding 500 in some contexts, which aligns with the intuition that NNS rises as prevalence falls toward 0.1% or lower [^111c2MPH] [^114kr2Zm].

> I need to check how prevalence modifies NNS in practice. The CDC explicitly notes that NNS is a function of prevalence and that in settings with HCV RNA prevalence below 0.1%, universal screening is not explicitly recommended, reflecting the diminishing yield and cost-effectiveness as prevalence drops, which implies that NNS in such settings would be very high, often impractical without other programmatic goals in mind [^114kr2Zm] [^113Zs6bj].

> Next, I should review cost-effectiveness data to ensure the NNS figures are interpreted alongside economic value. Multiple analyses show that universal adult screening is cost-effective at commonly used U.S. thresholds when treatment costs are around $25,000 per course, with ICERs typically below $50,000 per QALY and often closer to $11,000–$28,000 per QALY depending on assumptions, and that cost-effectiveness persists down to very low prevalence, roughly around 0.07%–0.1% anti-HCV positivity, which helps explain why guidelines still endorse universal screening despite higher NNS in low-prevalence populations [^112zEveA] [^113Zs6bj].

> Hold on, I should verify the screening test characteristics and operational steps because NNS in the real world also depends on completing the testing sequence. Current guidance recommends anti-HCV antibody testing with reflex HCV RNA on the same sample to confirm active infection, which reduces loss to follow-up and improves the effective yield of a screening program, and this operational completeness can materially change the observed NNS in practice compared with two-visit workflows [^112F3aSH] [^115DX1Qv] [^114jhip3].

> Let me consider special populations where NNS will be lower and yield higher. People who inject drugs and correctional settings have markedly higher HCV prevalence, so the NNS in those groups is substantially lower than in the general population, which is why targeted and universal strategies in these settings are particularly efficient for case finding and public health impact, even if the absolute NNS is not always specified in the cited documents [^117GUa6S] [^112Ww8Kg].

> I should confirm the linkage-to-care implications because identifying cases is only the first step. Observational data show that birth-cohort and risk-based identification achieve similar downstream care milestones, but overall referral and treatment initiation remain suboptimal, so programs with enhanced linkage, such as the HepCATT intervention, can improve effective yield per person screened even if the biological NNS is unchanged, underscoring that programmatic design influences the real-world value of a given NNS [^112uxTC9] [^11443bGb].

> Putting this together, I will now synthesize: in typical U.S. primary care settings with moderate prevalence, risk-based screening has an NNS around 15, birth-cohort screening around 29, and universal adult screening often has an NNS in the range of roughly 50–100 or higher depending on local prevalence, with the understanding that NNS increases as prevalence falls and can exceed 500 in very low-prevalence contexts. Importantly, despite higher NNS, universal screening remains cost-effective down to about 0.07%–0.1% anti-HCV prevalence, and implementing reflex RNA testing and robust linkage-to-care can mitigate the dilutional effect of a higher NNS on program impact [^111c2MPH] [^114kr2Zm] [^112zEveA] [^112F3aSH].

The number needed to screen (NNS) for hepatitis C varies by strategy and prevalence: **risk-based screening** has an NNS of 15–29 [^111c2MPH] in higher-prevalence populations, while **universal screening** in the general US adult population has an NNS of 50–100, reflecting a prevalence of ~0.84–1.0% [^112Ww8Kg] [^114kr2Zm]. Universal screening is cost-effective at **prevalence ≥ 0.1%** [^113Zs6bj] and is recommended for all adults aged 18–79 years [^112JAgKs] and for pregnant persons during each pregnancy [^1168FYhA], except where prevalence is < 0.1% [^114kr2Zm]. Screening is justified by high cure rates with DAAs [^115GsP5B] and substantial reductions in liver-related morbidity and mortality [^111c2MPH].

## Number needed to screen (NNS) by screening strategy

| **Screening strategy** | **Population** | **Nns** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Risk-based screening | High-risk populations (e.g. PWID, HIV-positive, incarcerated) | 15–29 | Higher prevalence yields lower NNS [^115wRS3e] |
| Universal screening | General US adult population (age 18–79) | 50–100 | Reflects ~0.84–1.0% prevalence [^112Ww8Kg] [^112zEveA] |
| Birth cohort (1945–1965) | Adults born 1945–1965 | 29 | Reflects ~3.25% prevalence in this cohort [^117NmSk9] [^116StuwV] |

---

## Factors influencing NNS

- **Prevalence**: Higher prevalence lowers NNS; lower prevalence raises it [^115wRS3e].
- **Screening method**: Risk-based strategies identify cases more efficiently in high-risk groups [^111c2MPH].
- **Population demographics**: Age, risk behaviors, and geographic region affect prevalence and NNS [^notfound].

---

## Cost-effectiveness of screening strategies

Universal screening is cost-effective at **prevalence ≥ 0.1%** [^113Zs6bj], with an ICER of ~$36,000/QALY at 0.1% prevalence [^113Zs6bj]. Risk-based screening is more cost-effective in **high-prevalence populations** [^113gRXWj] but may miss cases in lower-prevalence groups [^115wRS3e].

---

## Clinical outcomes and benefits of screening

Screening and treatment with DAAs achieve **SVR > 95%** [^115GsP5B] and reduce all-cause mortality by ~60% and HCC by ~70% [^111c2MPH]. Early detection prevents progression to cirrhosis, liver failure, and HCC, improving quality of life and reducing healthcare costs [^116z3fid] [^111c2MPH] [^112zEveA].

---

## Current recommendations and guidelines

- **USPSTF**: Screen all adults aged 18–79 years at least once [^112JAgKs] [^115vkFyn].
- **CDC**: Screen all adults ≥ 18 years at least once and pregnant persons during each pregnancy, except where prevalence is < 0.1% [^114kr2Zm] [^1168FYhA].
- **AASLD/IDSA**: Universal screening for adults ≥ 18 years and periodic testing for ongoing risk [^113R9Nmq] [^116phdKw].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Linkage to care**: Only ~43% of antibody-positive patients are referred; < 4% start treatment [^112uxTC9].
- **Stigma**: Fear of disclosure and stigma can reduce uptake [^117NmSk9].
- **Resource constraints**: Implementation requires infrastructure and workforce [^113dwf2y].

---

The NNS for hepatitis C screening varies by strategy and prevalence, with universal screening cost-effective at **prevalence ≥ 0.1%** [^113Zs6bj]. Screening is justified by high cure rates and reduced liver-related morbidity and mortality [^115GsP5B], but challenges remain in linkage to care and implementation [^112uxTC9].

### Testing for hepatitis C virus infection should be routine for persons at increased risk for infection [^116iVRqx]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

In the United States, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects an estimated 3 million persons, most younger than 50 years of age. It is one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease morbidity and mortality and the most common indication for liver transplantation. Effective treatment can eradicate the virus and eliminate or reduce liver inflammation and fibrosis, and counseling and immunization can modify or prevent the adverse effect of cofactors (for example, alcohol consumption or co-infections) on disease progression. However, controversy surrounds the need to routinely identify asymptomatic HCV-infected persons. Because no data currently demonstrate that treatment or other interventions will reduce future cases of HCV-related chronic disease and deaths, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening for HCV infection in adults at high risk. Chronic hepatitis C would require many years of follow-up to determine the incidence of complication after treatment of or other interventions in asymptomatic persons. It seems inappropriate to wait several decades to measure the impact of early identification of this viral infection when current data support a positive therapeutic effect that points to long-term benefits. In addition, treatment and other interventions must be provided before cirrhosis or liver failure occurs. Therefore, medical and public health professionals should continue the practice of screening persons for risk factors; offering testing to those at increased risk for HCV infection; and providing infected persons with appropriate counseling, medical evaluation, and treatment.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases have collaboratively developed evidence-based guidance regarding the diagnosis, management, and treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection since 2013. A panel of clinicians and investigators with extensive infectious diseases or hepatology expertise specific to HCV infection periodically review evidence from the field and update existing recommendations or introduce new recommendations as evidence warrants. This update focuses on changes to the guidance since the previous 2020 published update, including ongoing emphasis on recommended universal screening; management recommendations for incomplete treatment adherence; expanded eligibility for simplified chronic HCV infection treatment in adults with minimal monitoring; updated treatment and retreatment recommendations for children as young as 3 years old; management and treatment recommendations in the transplantation setting; and screening, treatment, and management recommendations for unique and key populations.

Diagnosis of acute HCV infection — testing recommendations and timing: HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing are recommended when acute HCV infection is suspected due to known exposure, clinical presentation, or elevated aminotransferase levels. HCV RNA typically becomes reliably detectable within 2–3 weeks after exposure, whereas HCV antibody typically occurs 2–3 months after exposure, on average; therefore, the best laboratory evidence is a positive HCV-RNA test in the setting of a negative HCV-antibody test or a positive HCV-antibody test after a prior negative anti-HCV test. When there has been a discrete, known, or suspected exposure, baseline HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing should be performed within 48 hours of the exposure; if baseline testing is negative, repeat testing for HCV antibody and HCV RNA is recommended, with frequency tailored to objectives (e.g., monthly testing to identify and treat acute infection).

### Cost effectiveness of an intervention to increase uptake of hepatitis C virus testing and treatment (hepCATT): cluster randomised controlled trial in primary care [^11443bGb]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of a complex intervention in primary care that aims to increase uptake of hepatitis C virus (HCV) case finding and treatment.

Design

Pragmatic, two armed, practice level, cluster randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation.

Setting and Participants

45 general practices in South West England (22 randomised to intervention and 23 to control arm). Outcome data were collected from all intervention practices and 21/23 control practices. Total number of flagged patients was 24473 (about 5% of practice list).

Intervention

Electronic algorithm and flag on practice systems identifying patients with HCV risk markers (such as history of opioid dependence or HCV tests with no evidence of referral to hepatology), staff educational training in HCV, and practice posters/leaflets to increase patients' awareness. Flagged patients were invited by letter for an HCV test (with one follow-up) and had on-screen pop-ups to encourage opportunistic testing. The intervention lasted one year, with practices recruited April to December 2016.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcome: uptake of HCV testing.

Secondary Outcomes

number of positive HCV tests and yield (proportion HCV positive); HCV treatment assessment at hepatology; cost effectiveness.

Results

Baseline HCV testing of flagged patients (six months before study start) was 608/13097 (4.6%) in intervention practices and 380/11376 (3.3%) in control practices. During the study 2071 (16%) of flagged patients in the intervention practices and 1163 (10%) in control practices were tested for HCV: overall intervention effect as an adjusted rate ratio of 1.59 (95% confidence interval 1.21 to 2.08; P < 0.001). HCV antibodies were detected in 129 patients from intervention practices and 51 patients from control practices (adjusted rate ratio 2.24, 1.47 to 3.42) with weak evidence of an increase in yield (6.2% v 4.4%; adjusted risk ratio 1.40, 0.99 to 1.95). Referral and assessment increased in intervention practices compared with control practices (adjusted rate ratio 5.78, 1.6 to 21.6) with a risk difference of 1.3 per 1000 and a "number needed to help" of one extra HCV diagnosis, referral, and assessment per 792 (95% confidence interval 558 to 1883) patients flagged. The average cost of HCV case finding was £4.03 (95% confidence interval £2.27 to £5.80) per at risk patient and £3165 per additional patient assessed at hepatology. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was £6212 per quality adjusted life year (QALY), with 92.5% probability of being below £20000 per QALY.

Conclusion

HepCATT had a modest impact but is a low cost intervention that merits optimisation and implementation as part of an NHS strategy to increase HCV testing and treatment.

### CDC recommendations for hepatitis C screening among adults-United States, 2020 [^1168FYhA]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

CDC recommends hepatitis C screening of all adults aged ≥ 18 years once in their lifetimes, and screening of all pregnant women (regardless of age) during each pregnancy. The recommendations include an exception for settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is demonstrated to be < 0.1%; however, few settings are known to exist with a hepatitis C prevalence below this threshold (2, 9). The recommendation for testing of persons with risk factors remains unchanged; those with ongoing risk factors should be tested regardless of age or setting prevalence, including continued periodic testing as long as risks persist. These recommendations can be used by health care professionals, public health officials, and organizations involved in the development, implementation, delivery, and evaluation of clinical and preventive services.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^116GkbS5]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This report updates and expands CDC recommendations for hepatitis B screening of adults published in 2008. CDC evaluated the addition of a universal screening recommendation among adults as well as testing persons expected to be at increased risk for HBV infection that were not included in the 2008 testing recommendations.

Members of the CDC Guidelines Work Group (hereafter referred to as the work group) followed CDC guideline development and reporting standards to develop research questions needed to assess the proposed updates; conduct systematic reviews; assess the quality of the evidence; and review existing systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and cost-effectiveness analyses, when available (Supplementary Appendix 2; Supplementary Tables 1, 4, and 7). Comprehensive systematic literature reviews were conducted for recommendations on 1) expanding screening to all adults (i.e. universal screening), 2) periodic testing for HBV infection among persons with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and 3) testing for HBV infection among persons with a history of incarceration.

For all three systematic reviews, literature searches were conducted by CDC librarians with direction from subject matter experts. Searches were conducted for English-language literature published worldwide in Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), CINAHL (Ebsco), and Cochrane Library. Duplicates were identified and removed using Endnote (version 20; Clarivate Analytics) and DistillerSR systematic review software (version 2.35; Evidence Partners) automated "find duplicates" functions.

CDC's Viral Hepatitis Steering Committee considered multiple methods to assess quality of evidence. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was selected because it is a validated tool for assessing nonrandomized analytic and descriptive studies, which comprise most of the HBV infection prevalence literature. MMAT users rate each study on methodological quality criteria, indicating whether criteria were met with "Yes", "No", or "Can't Tell". Calculating a summary score is not recommended for the tool because presenting a single number is not informative about which aspects of the studies are problematic. Economic analyses were evaluated by assessing whether the study met the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS).

Hepatitis C Testing Strategy

The goal of hepatitis C screening is to identify persons who are currently infected with HCV. Hepatitis C testing should be initiated with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anti-HCV test. Persons who test anti-HCV positive are either currently infected or had past infection that has resolved naturally or with treatment. Immunocompetent persons without hepatitis C risks who test anti-HCV negative are not infected and require no further testing. Persons testing anti-HCV positive should have follow-up testing with an FDA-approved nucleic acid test (NAT) for detection of HCV RNA. NAT for HCV RNA detection determines viremia and current HCV infection. Persons who test anti-HCV positive but HCV RNA negative do not have current HCV infection. CDC encourages use of reflex HCV RNA testing, in which specimens testing anti-HCV positive undergo HCV RNA testing immediately and automatically in the laboratory, using the same sample from which the anti-HCV test was conducted. Hepatitis C testing should be provided on-site when feasible.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^114XhPCC]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

The ages of patients with chronic HBV infection (when available) are included in the summary table (Supplementary Table 11). No clear trends were identified in the prevalence of chronic HBV infection by age across studies. Therefore, the work group considered the economic analysis, vaccination rates and efficacy, the epidemiology of acute and chronic infections from surveillance data, ease of implementation, and harms of missed identification of chronic infections in determining the age thresholds for universal adult screening.

Q1b: What is the yield (number of new diagnoses per tests completed) and sensitivity of alternative HBV screening strategies (e.g. universal versus targeted screening or screening strategies based on alternative risk factors)?

As part of their HBV screening recommendations systematic review, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) assessed the yield (number of new diagnoses per tests completed) and sensitivity of alternative HBV infection screening strategies. USPSTF identified three fair quality, non-U.S.–based studies, which might limit applicability. On the basis of these studies, the number of persons who need to be screened to identify one HBV infection using risk-based strategies ranged from 32 to 148. In comparison, fewer than 20 persons need to be screened to identify a case of HCV infection using risk-based screening.

Only one of the studies, conducted in France, assessed CDC's risk-based testing criteria. Using risk-based testing had 100% sensitivity (i.e. 100% of infected persons were identified), and self-report identified 70% of persons with at least one risk factor; however, the study population specifically overrepresented persons at increased risk for infection.

The work group also considered a prospective cohort study of patients with cancer at one U.S. health center, where applying CDC risk criteria to screening had 97% sensitivity. The proportion of patients who met at least one risk criterion was 91%. Therefore, in terms of provider time, universal screening might be more efficient than risk-based testing. Because no studies directly assessed universal screening, the work group could not provide the yield of universal screening versus risk-based screening.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2023 update: AASLD-IDSA recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^114ZYqxm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

AASLD-IDSA hepatitis C guidance — acute HCV infection reiterates the recommendation that persons with confirmed acute HCV infection (HCV RNA–positive) should be treated the same as those with chronic HCV infection without awaiting possible spontaneous clearance (ie, a test-and-treat approach), noting that the incidence of acute hepatitis C in the United States increased 124% from 2013 through 2020 and that treatment of this key population is critical to both HCV prevention and elimination.

### Population-level outcomes and cost-effectiveness of expanding the recommendation for age-based hepatitis C testing in the United States [^117FghV9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommend one-time hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing for persons born 1945–1965 and targeted testing for high-risk persons. This strategy targets HCV testing to a prevalent population at high risk for HCV morbidity and mortality, but does not include younger populations with high incidence. To address this gap and improve access to HCV testing, age-based strategies should be considered.

Methods

We used a simulation of HCV to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of HCV testing strategies: 1) standard of care (SOC) - recommendation for one-time testing for all persons born 1945–1965, 2) recommendation for one-time testing for adults ≥ 40 years (≥ 40 strategy), 3) ≥ 30 years (≥ 30 strategy), and 4) ≥ 18 years (≥ 18 strategy). All strategies assumed targeted testing of high-risk persons. Inputs were derived from national databases, observational cohorts and clinical trials. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life expectancy, costs, and cost-effectiveness.

Results

Expanded age-based testing strategies increased US population lifetime case identification and cure rates. Greatest increases were observed in the ≥ 18 strategy. Compared to the SOC, this strategy resulted in an estimated 256,000 additional infected persons identified and 280,000 additional cures at the lowest cost per QALY gained (ICER = $28,000/QALY).

Conclusions

In addition to risk-based testing, one-time HCV testing of persons 18 and older appears to be cost-effective, leads to improved clinical outcomes and identifies more persons with HCV than the current birth cohort recommendations. These findings could be considered for future recommendation revisions.

USPSTF supporting evidence and scope — the recommendation is consistent with the 2014 recommendation and is strengthened by trials and cohort studies reporting that antiviral therapy reduces risk of mortality and hepatocellular carcinoma and improves intermediate outcomes; the USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review on screening for HBV infection in persons at increased risk, examined new randomized clinical trials and cohort studies published from 2014 to August 2019 assessing benefits and harms of screening and antiviral therapy and links between intermediate and health outcomes, added key questions on the yield of alternative screening strategies and the accuracy of tools to identify persons at increased risk, and previously found serologic testing with HBsAg to be accurate.

### Scaling up prevention and treatment towards the elimination of hepatitis C: a global mathematical model [^1127ZnQj]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

The revolution in hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment through the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has generated international interest in the global elimination of the disease as a public health threat. In 2017, this led WHO to establish elimination targets for 2030. We evaluated the impact of public health interventions on the global HCV epidemic and investigated whether WHO's elimination targets could be met.

Methods

We developed a dynamic transmission model of the global HCV epidemic, calibrated to 190 countries, which incorporates data on demography, people who inject drugs (PWID), current coverage of treatment and prevention programmes, natural history of the disease, HCV prevalence, and HCV-attributable mortality. We estimated the worldwide impact of scaling up interventions that reduce risk of transmission, improve access to treatment, and increase screening for HCV infection by considering six scenarios: no change made to existing levels of diagnosis or treatment; sequentially adding the following interventions: blood safety and infection control, PWID harm reduction, offering of DAAs at diagnosis, and outreach screening to increase the number diagnosed; and a scenario in which DAAs are not introduced (ie, treatment is only with pegylated interferon and oral ribavirin) to investigate the effect of DAA use. We explored the effect of varying the coverage or impact of these interventions in sensitivity analyses and also assessed the impact on the global epidemic of removing certain key countries from the package of interventions.

Findings

By 2030, interventions that reduce risk of transmission in the non-PWID population by 80% and increase coverage of harm reduction services to 40% of PWID could avert 14.1 million (95% credible interval 13.0–15.2) new infections. Offering DAAs at time of diagnosis in all countries could prevent 640 000 deaths (620 000–670 000) from cirrhosis and liver cancer. A comprehensive package of prevention, screening, and treatment interventions could avert 15.1 million (13.8–16.1) new infections and 1.5 million (1.4–1.6) cirrhosis and liver cancer deaths, corresponding to an 81% (78–82) reduction in incidence and a 61% (60–62) reduction in mortality compared with 2015 baseline. This reaches the WHO HCV incidence reduction target of 80% but is just short of the mortality reduction target of 65%, which could be reached by 2032. Reducing global burden depends upon success of prevention interventions, implemention of outreach screening, and progress made in key high-burden countries including China, India, and Pakistan.

Interpretation

Further improvements in blood safety and infection control, expansion or creation of PWID harm reduction services, and extensive screening for HCV with concomitant treatment for all are necessary to reduce the burden of HCV. These findings should inform the ongoing global action to eliminate the HCV epidemic.

### Screening for hepatitis C virus infection in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111G8Gpy]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF clinical summary — risk assessment, test accuracy, and screening intervals for hepatitis C virus (HCV) identify priority populations and timing. The most important risk factor for HCV infection is past or current injection drug use, with approximately one-third of PWID aged 18 to 30 years infected with HCV and 70% to 90% of older PWID infected. Pregnant adults should be screened; from 2011 to 2014, 0.73% of pregnant women tested had an HCV infection, with a 68% increase in the proportion of infants born to HCV-infected mothers, and approximately 1700 infected infants are born annually to 29 000 HCV-infected mothers. Screening with anti-HCV antibody testing followed by polymerase chain reaction testing for HCV RNA is accurate for identifying patients with chronic HCV infection, and currently diagnostic evaluations are often performed with various noninvasive tests that have lower risk for harm than liver biopsy for diagnosing fibrosis stage or cirrhosis in persons who screen positive. Most adults need to be screened only once; persons with continued risk for HCV infection (eg, PWID) should be screened periodically, although there is limited information about the specific screening interval that should occur in persons who continue to be at risk for new HCV infection or how pregnancy changes the need for additional screening.

### CDC recommendations for hepatitis C screening among adults-United States, 2020 [^117NmSk9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Because of the limited effectiveness of risk-based hepatitis C testing, CDC considered strategies to increase the proportion of infected persons who are aware of their status and are linked to care. In 2012, CDC augmented its guidance to recommend one-time hepatitis C screening for persons born during 1945–1965 (birth cohort) without ascertainment of risk. With an anti-HCV positivity prevalence of 3.25%, persons born in the 1945–1965 birth year cohort accounted for approximately three fourths of chronic HCV infections among U.S. adults during 1999–2008. Approximately 45% of persons infected with HCV do not recall or report having specific risk factors. Included in the 2012 guidelines were recommendations for alcohol use screening and intervention for persons identified with HCV infection. This report expands hepatitis C screening to at least once in a lifetime for all adults aged > 18 years, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is < 0.1%.

The 2012 CDC guidelines recommended that pregnant women be tested for hepatitis C only if they have known risk factors. However, in 2018, universal hepatitis C screening during pregnancy was recommended by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and IDSA. This report expands hepatitis C screening for all pregnant women during each pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is < 0.1%.

Existing strategies for hepatitis C testing have had limited success. The 2013–2016 surveys indicate only approximately 56% of persons with HCV infection reported having ever been told they had hepatitis C. Therefore, strengthened guidance for universal hepatitis C testing is warranted. Models to address barriers related to access to direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment are needed to ensure health care equity and the success of expanded hepatitis C screening. The recommendation for HCV testing that remains unchanged is regardless of age or setting prevalence, all persons with risk factors should be tested for hepatitis C, with periodic testing while risk factors persist. Any person who requests hepatitis C testing should receive it regardless of disclosure of risk because many persons might be reluctant to disclose stigmatizing risks.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2023 update: AASLD-IDSA recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^113R9Nmq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Implementation of universal HCV screening — The Guidance Panel first recommended universal HCV screening for all adults aged ≥ 18 years in 2019, and the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) subsequently recommended universal HCV screening for adults aged 18 to 79 years in March 2020. In April 2020, the CDC recommended HCV screening at least once in all adults aged ≥ 18 years and for all pregnant persons during each pregnancy, except in settings where HCV prevalence is < 0.1%. The rationale includes cost-effectiveness, improved HCV case finding, shifting epidemiology with incident infections occurring primarily in young adults, and the availability of safe, cost-effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment; universal screening is a crucial and necessary component of any HCV elimination strategy.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2023 update: AASLD-IDSA recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^115LzXqs]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

AASLD-IDSA hepatitis C virus (HCV) guidance 2023 update — key targets and changes — notes the World Health Organization goal of elimination of viral hepatitis as a major public health threat by 2030 and lists specific HCV elimination targets that include a 90% reduction in incidence and prevalence, treatment of 80% of eligible persons with chronic infection, a 65% reduction in HCV-related deaths, and universal access to key prevention and treatment services. Under the umbrella of the HCV guidance, the AASLD-IDSA HCV Guidance Panel also issues regular, periodic published updates to review new or updated data and recommendations. Major changes in the HCV guidance since the previous 2020 publication featured in this update include an ongoing emphasis on universal HCV screening; new recommendations that address the management of incomplete treatment adherence; updated recommendations regarding simplified treatment with minimal monitoring and expanded eligibility; management and treatment recommendations for solid organ transplant recipients; newly expanded treatment and retreatment recommendations for children and adolescents; and screening, management, and treatment recommendations for unique and key populations.

### Cost-effectiveness and population outcomes of general population screening for hepatitis C [^113UKctz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Current US guidelines recommend limiting hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening to high-risk individuals, and 50%-75% of infected persons remain unaware of their status.

Methods

To estimate the cost-effectiveness and population-level impact of adding one-time HCV screening of US population aged 20–69 years to current guidelines, we developed a decision analytic model for the screening intervention and Markov model with annual transitions to estimate natural history. Subanalyses included protease inhibitor therapy and screening those at highest risk of infection (birth year 1945–1965). We relied on published literature and took a lifetime, societal perspective.

Results

Compared to current guidelines, incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained (ICER) was $7900 for general population screening and $4200 for screening by birth year, which dominated general population screening if cost, clinician uptake, and median age of diagnoses were assumed equivalent. General population screening remained cost-effective in all one-way sensitivity analyses, 30 000 Monte Carlo simulations, and scenarios in which background mortality was doubled, all genotype 1 patients were treated with protease inhibitors, and most parameters were set unfavorable to increased screening. ICER was lowest if screening was applied to a population with liver fibrosis similar to 2010 estimates. Approximately 1% of liver-related deaths would be averted per 15% of the general population screened; the impact would be greater with improved referral, treatment uptake, and cure.

Conclusions

Broader screening for HCV would likely be cost-effective, but significantly reducing HCV-related morbidity and mortality would also require improved rates of referral, treatment, and cure.

### Screening for hepatitis C virus infection in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1173dx2L]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF clinical summary — screening for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adolescents and adults outlines who to screen, how to test, and follow‑up. For adults aged 18 to 79 years: Grade B; screen adults for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and this applies to all asymptomatic adults (including pregnant persons) aged 18 to 79 years without known liver disease. Implementation states to screen adults aged 18 to 79 years with anti-HCV antibody testing followed by confirmatory polymerase chain reaction testing; adults with a positive screening test result are usually followed up with a diagnostic evaluation using one of various noninvasive tests, and treatment typically consists of oral direct-acting antiviral regimens for 8 to 12 weeks. The USPSTF also suggests that clinicians consider screening persons younger than 18 years and older than 79 years who are at high risk for infection (eg, those with past or current injection drug use). For intervals, periodically screen persons with continued risk for HCV infection (eg, persons with past or current injection drug use), and there is limited evidence to determine how often to screen persons at increased risk.

### Cost-effectiveness of one-time hepatitis C screening strategies among adolescents and young adults in primary care settings [^111sq84L]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

High hepatitis C virus (HCV) rates have been reported in young people who inject drugs (PWID). We evaluated the clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of testing among youth seen in communities with a high overall number of reported HCV cases.

Methods

We developed a decision analytic model to project quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs (2016 US$), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of 9 strategies for 1-time testing among 15- to 30-year-olds seen at urban community health centers. Strategies differed in 3 ways: targeted vs routine testing, rapid finger stick vs standard venipuncture, and ordered by physician vs by counselor/tester using standing orders. We performed deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) to evaluate uncertainty.

Results

Compared to targeted risk-based testing (current standard of care), routine testing increased the lifetime medical cost by $80 and discounted QALYs by 0.0013 per person. Across all strategies, rapid testing provided higher QALYs at a lower cost per QALY gained and was always preferred. Counselor-initiated routine rapid testing was associated with an ICER of $71000/QALY gained. Results were sensitive to offer and result receipt rates. Counselor-initiated routine rapid testing was cost-effective (ICER < $100000/QALY) unless the prevalence of PWID was < 0.59%, HCV prevalence among PWID was < 16%, reinfection rate was > 26 cases per 100 person-years, or reflex confirmatory testing followed all reactive venipuncture diagnostics. In PSA, routine rapid testing was the optimal strategy in 90% of simulations.

Conclusions

Routine rapid HCV testing among 15- to 30-year-olds may be cost-effective when the prevalence of PWID is > 0.59%.

### Screening for hepatitis C virus infection in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113hGDiX]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) rationale for hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening — adults aged 18 to 79 y emphasizes that there is adequate evidence for 1-time testing in all adults with periodic testing for those at continued risk, while evidence on timing of repeat testing is inadequate; treatment benefits are supported by convincing evidence that newer direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens result in sustained virologic response (SVR) in a very high proportion (> 95%) of adults aged 18 to 79 y with adequate evidence of SVR in adolescents, although direct evidence on health outcomes is inadequate; potential harms of screening include anxiety, patient labeling, and stigmatization, but current DAA regimens have fewer harms than older interferon-containing regimens with shorter treatment duration at 8 to 12 weeks and low rates of serious adverse effects and withdrawal; overall, given screening accuracy and effective interventions, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for HCV infection in adults aged 18 to 79 y has substantial net benefit.

### Feasibility of hepatitis C elimination by screening and treatment alone in high-income countries [^111Rif6j]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Despite the availability of highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, HCV infection continues to pose a major public health threat, with an estimated 290,000 deaths due to complications related to HCV in 2019. Since 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Sector Strategy has called for an 80% reduction in new chronic hepatitis C (CHC) cases, a 65% reduction in HCV-related deaths, and treatment of 80% of those diagnosed by 2030. Although various high-income countries around the world have committed to achieving these goals, most have underinvested in HCV elimination programming and focus only on developing interventions related to screening and treatment. – With the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, screening and treatment decreased significantly during 2020–2021. After 2021, screening and treatment rates have gradually increased, but have not yet recovered to prepandemic levels.

Various model-based studies have demonstrated the projection of HCV elimination for different countries.– However, most models used have not yet considered the impact of (1) transmission dynamics; (2) COVID-19; and (3) ongoing immigration. Thus, existing models may fail to generate accurate projections necessary to assess the impact of interventions, particularly related to CHC incidence. Modeling the impact of such factors is of particular importance for high-income countries, such as Canada, that continue to have high levels of immigration from HCV-endemic regions; and could be extrapolated to similar countries such as the United Kingdom and countries within the European Union, many of whom continue to use risk-based HCV screening. The goal of this study is to project the incidence and prevalence of HCV-related health outcomes under current HCV intervention strategies over the next decade and to identify ideal strategies needed to achieve the WHO goals of HCV elimination by 2030.

### Screening for hepatitis C virus infection in adolescents and adults: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^111c2MPH]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

A 2013 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening found interferon-based antiviral therapy associated with increased likelihood of sustained virologic response (SVR) and an association between achieving an SVR and improved clinical outcomes. New direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens are available.

Objective

To update the 2013 review on HCV screening to inform the USPSTF.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews through February 2019, with surveillance through September 2019.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized treatment studies of HCV screening and DAA therapy; cohort studies on screening, antiviral therapy, and the association between an SVR after antiviral therapy and clinical outcomes.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

One investigator abstracted data; a second checked accuracy. Two investigators independently rated study quality.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Mortality, morbidity, quality of life, screening and treatment harms, and screening diagnostic yield.

Results

Eight RCTs of DAA therapy vs placebo or an outdated antiviral regimen, 48 other treatment studies, and 33 cohort studies, with a total of 179 230 participants, were included. No study evaluated effects of HCV screening vs no screening. One new study since the 2013 review (n = 5917) found similar diagnostic yield of risk-based screening (sensitivity, 82%; number needed to screen to identify 1 HCV case, 15) and birth cohort screening (sensitivity, 76%; number needed to screen, 29), assuming perfect implementation. Ten open-label studies (n = 3292) reported small improvements in some quality-of-life and functional outcomes (eg, less than 3 points on the 0 to 100 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical and mental component summary scales) after DAA treatment compared with before treatment. Two cohort studies (n = 24 686) found inconsistent associations of antiviral therapy vs no therapy with risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Forty-nine treatment studies (n = 10 181) found DAA regimens associated with pooled SVR rates greater than 95% across genotypes, and low short-term rates of serious adverse events (1.9%) and withdrawal due to adverse events (0.4%). An SVR after antiviral therapy was associated with decreased adjusted risk of all-cause mortality (13 studies, n = 36 986; pooled hazard ratio [HR], 0.40 [95% CI, 0.28–0.56) and hepatocellular carcinoma (20 studies, n = 84 491; pooled HR, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.23 to 0.38]) vs no SVR.

Conclusions and Relevance

Direct evidence on the effects of HCV screening on clinical outcomes remains unavailable, but DAA regimens were associated with SVR rates greater than 5% and few short-term harms relative to older antiviral therapies. An SVR after antiviral therapy was associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with no SVR.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^116VHThF]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Universal Screening Summary of Findings

The steering committee considered results of the systematic review in conjunction with cost-effectiveness analyses, supplemental literature, practicality of implementing guidelines, public health benefits, subject matter expertise, and reviewer and public feedback. Because of limited data, the steering committee was only indirectly able to assess the key question "How would adult universal screening for hepatitis B affect the number [and composition] of persons who screen positive for HBV infection?" A summary of the evidence considered, rationale for screening (Box 2), conclusions of the steering committee, and limitations is available (Supplementary Table 10). The steering committee concluded that simplifying the implementation of screening from a risk-based to a universal approach might increase the number of persons aware of their infection. Overall, risk-based testing has been insufficient to identify persons with HBV infection in the United States and has been a barrier to appropriately screening populations with a disproportionate prevalence of disease. Assessment of risk is difficult for providers and might be stigmatizing to the patient.

### Hepatitis C virus infection care pathway – A report from the American Gastroenterological Association institute HCV care pathway work group [^1133YCtn]. Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C virus infection care pathway — prevalence, DAA efficacy, and birth-cohort screening: Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects more than 2.7 million individuals in the U.S., and direct acting antiviral (DAA) treatments have resulted in sustained virological response in 90–100% of patients. Recent updates in HCV screening guidelines recommend one-time testing for all persons born between 1945 and 1965. The goal of the HCV Clinical Pathway is to provide guidance on the cascade of care and best practices for managing US-based patients with HCV, and the pathway encompasses the entire care spectrum from outreach and screening to initial evaluation, antiviral treatment, and post treatment follow up care.

### Potential consequences of healthcare recommendations: a focus on the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^1145qhCF]. Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Healthcare guidelines and recommendations have broad-reaching impact. They serve as the evidence to enforce medical testing by establishing a bar for standard of care through their intrinsic credibility but also by affecting reimbursement. In this article, we discuss the various organizations in the United States that develop healthcare policy and guidelines. We focus on the recent recommendations for hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening put forward by these agencies and the potential effect of these documents. Additional discussion is provided on the recent draft HCV screening recommendations provided by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), comparison of these to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, and professional societies' response to these.

Conclusion

As written, the USPSTF recommendations may reduce physician adoption of HCV screening in the 1945–1965 birth cohort as advocated by the CDC. Conflicting guidelines may further confuse providers and the public. This will ultimately hinder recognition of chronic HCV in an otherwise easily identifiable, high prevalence group, allowing progression of disease at a time when therapeutic advances make cure a realistic opportunity for many.

### Hepatitis C: diagnosis and treatment [^114PDbqY]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C, a common chronic bloodborne infection, is found in approximately 2 percent of adults in the United States. Chronic infection is associated with serious morbidity and mortality (e.g., cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma). Testing for hepatitis C is recommended for at-risk populations, and confirmatory testing includes quantification of virus by polymerase chain reaction. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against routine screening for hepatitis C virus infection in asymptomatic adults who are not at increased risk of infection (general population). It found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening in adults at high risk of infection. Current therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus includes pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Therapy is based on factors that predict sustained virologic response, and the goal of therapy is to slow or halt progression of fibrosis and prevent the development of cirrhosis. In the future, multidrug regimens in combination with current therapies may be developed. Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection should be advised to abstain from alcohol use. Currently, there is no vaccine available to prevent hepatitis C virus infection; however, persons infected with hepatitis C virus should be vaccinated for hepatitis A and B. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommends ultrasound surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in persons with chronic hepatitis C virus infection and cirrhosis.

### Recommendations for the identification of chronic hepatitis C virus infection among persons born during 1945–1965 [^116StuwV]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Many of the 2.7–3.9 million persons living with HCV infection are unaware they are infected and do not receive care (e.g., education, counseling, and medical monitoring) and treatment. CDC estimates that although persons born during 1945–1965 comprise an estimated 27% of the population, they account for approximately three fourths of all HCV infections in the United States, 73% of HCV-associated mortality, and are at greatest risk for hepatocellular carcinoma and other HCV-related liver disease. With the advent of new therapies that can halt disease progression and provide a virologic cure (i.e., sustained viral clearance following completion of treatment) in most persons, targeted testing and linkage to care for infected persons in this birth cohort is expected to reduce HCV-related morbidity and mortality. CDC is augmenting previous recommendations for HCV testing (CDC. Recommendations for prevention and control of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and HCV-related chronic disease. MMWR 1998;47[No. RR-19]) to recommend one-time testing without prior ascertainment of HCV risk for persons born during 1945–1965, a population with a disproportionately high prevalence of HCV infection and related disease. Persons identified as having HCV infection should receive a brief screening for alcohol use and intervention as clinically indicated, followed by referral to appropriate care for HCV infection and related conditions. These recommendations do not replace previous guidelines for HCV testing that are based on known risk factors and clinical indications. Rather, they define an additional target population for testing: persons born during 1945–1965. CDC developed these recommendations with the assistance of a work group representing diverse expertise and perspectives. The recommendations are informed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework, an approach that provides guidance and tools to define the research questions, conduct the systematic review, assess the overall quality of the evidence, and determine strength of the recommendations. This report is intended to serve as a resource for health-care professionals, public health officials, and organizations involved in the development, implementation, and evaluation of prevention and clinical services. These recommendations will be reviewed every 5 years and updated to include advances in the published evidence.

### Feasibility of hepatitis C elimination by screening and treatment alone in high-income countries [^113Whcz9]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Prevention, screening, and treatment strategies

To identify the best strategy to achieve HCV elimination by 2030, we considered 4 combinations of prevention, screening, and treatment strategies for the general population:
current prevention, screening, and treatment strategy (status quo);
aggressive treatment strategy (90% increase in patients treated compared with the status quo);
aggressive screening and treatment strategy (90% increase in people screened and 90% increase in patients treated compared with the status quo);
enhanced harm-reduction strategy (90% reduction in transmission risk among people who inject drugs [PWID] compared with the status quo).

Like many developed countries, Canada adopted and continues to use a risk-based screening strategy, in which screening is offered to anyone with a recognized risk factor for HCV (injection drug use; tattooing or piercing; engaging in sexual behavior where blood may be present or from nonsterile equipment; blood product or organ transplant before 1992; born, or resided in hepatitis C endemic regions; born to mother with hepatitis C; or shared personal items with people with hepatitis C) or a clinical indication (such as HIV or hepatitis B diagnosis; signs/symptoms of liver disease; occupational exposure). Those found to be HCV RNA–positive with chronic infection are eligible for treatment using DAAs. For aggressive strategies involving treatment, we increased the annual number of diagnosed and eligible patients treated by 90% starting in 2023 in comparison to the status quo. Similarly, for the aggressive screening strategy, we increased the annual number of people screened for HCV by 90% starting in 2023 in comparison to the status quo. Lastly, for the enhanced prevention strategy involving harm reduction, we reduced the HCV transmission rate by 90% starting in 2023 in comparison to the status quo, which would be achievable through scale-up of harm-reduction strategies to reduce sharing of drug use equipment and other high-risk exposures.

### Screening for hepatitis C virus infection in adults: a systematic review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^115wRS3e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Identification of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected persons through screening could lead to interventions that improve clinical outcomes.

Purpose

To review evidence about potential benefits and harms of HCV screening in asymptomatic adults without known liver enzyme abnormalities.

Data Sources

English-language publications identified from MEDLINE (1947 to May 2012), the Cochrane Library Database, clinical trial registries, and reference lists.

Study Selection

Randomized trials and cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies that assessed yield or clinical outcomes of screening; studies reporting harms from HCV screening; and large series reporting harms of diagnostic liver biopsies.

Data Extraction

Multiple investigators abstracted and checked study details and quality by using predefined criteria.

Data Synthesis

No study evaluated clinical outcomes associated with screening compared with no screening or of different risk- or prevalence-based strategies. Three cross-sectional studies in higher prevalence populations found that screening strategies that targeted multiple risk factors were associated with sensitivities greater than 90% and numbers needed to screen to identify 1 case of HCV infection of less than 20. Data on direct harms of screening were sparse. A large study of percutaneous liver biopsies (n = 2740) in HCV-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis reported no deaths and a 1.1% rate of serious adverse events (primarily bleeding and severe pain).

Limitations

Modeling studies were not examined. High or unreported proportions of potentially eligible patients in the observational studies were not included in calculations of screening yield because of unknown HCV status.

Conclusion

Although screening tests can accurately identify adults with chronic HCV infection, targeted screening strategies based on the presence of risk factors misses some patients with HCV infection. Well-designed prospective studies are needed to better understand the effects of different HCV screening strategies on diagnostic yield and clinical outcomes.

### CDC recommendations for hepatitis C screening among adults-United States, 2020 [^113RbZ5p]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

To inform these recommendations, comprehensive systematic reviews of the literature were conducted, analyzed, and assessed in two stages. These reviews examined the availability of evidence regarding HCV infection prevalence and the health benefits and harms associated with one-time hepatitis C screening for persons unaware of their status.

CDC determined that the new recommendations constituted scientific information that will have a clear and substantial impact on important public policies and private sector decisions. Therefore, the Information Quality Act required peer review by specialists in the field who were not involved in the development of these recommendations. CDC solicited nominations for reviewers from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), IDSA, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Six clinicians with expertise in hepatology, gastroenterology, internal medicine, infectious diseases and/or obstetrics and gynecology provided structured peer reviews. In addition, feedback from the public was solicited through a Federal Register notice released on October 28, 2019, announcing the availability of the draft recommendations for public comment through December 27, 2019. CDC received 69 public comments on the draft document from academia, professional organizations, industry, and the public. Many of the comments from both peer reviewers and the public were in support of the recommendations. For those comments that proposed changes, the majority related to screening for hepatitis C in every pregnancy or removing the prevalence threshold for universal screening. Feedback attained during both the peer review process and the public comment period was reviewed by CDC. Ultimately, no changes to the recommendations were made; however, additional references and justification for the recommendation to screen during every pregnancy and maintaining the prevalence threshold were added to the document.

To facilitate the systematic review of the evidence, two research questions were formulated to guide the development of the recommendations:

Does universal screening for hepatitis C virus infection among adults aged ≥ 18 years, compared with risk-based screening, reduce morbidity and mortality?
Does universal screening for hepatitis C virus infection among pregnant women, compared with risk-based screening, reduce morbidity and mortality among mothers and their children?

An analytic framework describing the chain of indirect evidence was developed:

How would universal screening for hepatitis C affect the number (and composition) of persons who screen positive for HCV infection?
How many additional persons would be linked to care?
Do desirable treatment effects outweigh undesirable effects?

Key questions (KQ) were formulated for each link of the chain (Supplementary Table 1,):

### Scaling up prevention and treatment towards the elimination of hepatitis C: a global mathematical model [^115pv2Vm]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

The revolution in hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment through the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has generated international interest in the global elimination of the disease as a public health threat. In 2017, this led WHO to establish elimination targets for 2030. We evaluated the impact of public health interventions on the global HCV epidemic and investigated whether WHO's elimination targets could be met.

Methods

We developed a dynamic transmission model of the global HCV epidemic, calibrated to 190 countries, which incorporates data on demography, people who inject drugs (PWID), current coverage of treatment and prevention programmes, natural history of the disease, HCV prevalence, and HCV-attributable mortality. We estimated the worldwide impact of scaling up interventions that reduce risk of transmission, improve access to treatment, and increase screening for HCV infection by considering six scenarios: no change made to existing levels of diagnosis or treatment; sequentially adding the following interventions: blood safety and infection control, PWID harm reduction, offering of DAAs at diagnosis, and outreach screening to increase the number diagnosed; and a scenario in which DAAs are not introduced (ie, treatment is only with pegylated interferon and oral ribavirin) to investigate the effect of DAA use. We explored the effect of varying the coverage or impact of these interventions in sensitivity analyses and also assessed the impact on the global epidemic of removing certain key countries from the package of interventions.

Findings

By 2030, interventions that reduce risk of transmission in the non-PWID population by 80% and increase coverage of harm reduction services to 40% of PWID could avert 14.1 million (95% credible interval 13.0–15.2) new infections. Offering DAAs at time of diagnosis in all countries could prevent 640000 deaths (620000–670000) from cirrhosis and liver cancer. A comprehensive package of prevention, screening, and treatment interventions could avert 15.1 million (13.8–16.1) new infections and 1.5 million (1.4–1.6) cirrhosis and liver cancer deaths, corresponding to an 81% (78–82) reduction in incidence and a 61% (60–62) reduction in mortality compared with 2015 baseline. This reaches the WHO HCV incidence reduction target of 80% but is just short of the mortality reduction target of 65%, which could be reached by 2032. Reducing global burden depends upon success of prevention interventions, implemention of outreach screening, and progress made in key high-burden countries including China, India, and Pakistan.

Interpretation

Further improvements in blood safety and infection control, expansion or creation of PWID harm reduction services, and extensive screening for HCV with concomitant treatment for all are necessary to reduce the burden of HCV. These findings should inform the ongoing global action to eliminate the HCV epidemic.

Accuracy of screening tests and risk assessment — HCV screening tests are highly accurate, and evidence gaps remain regarding repeat screening yield or alternative strategies.

HBV/HIV screening and immunization in HCV — Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) with an FDA-approved hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) assay and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with an FDA-approved HIV-antigen/antibody test is recommended; persons who test positive for HBsAg require additional monitoring during HCV treatment due to HBV reactivation risk, and anti-HBV therapy is another consideration for these patients. For persons who test negative for HBsAg but positive for hepatitis B core antibodies (with or without hepatitis B surface antibodies) have resolved HBV infection, and no further workup or additional monitoring is needed. Primary prevention measures for persons without coinfection include counseling about how to avoid contracting HIV and HBV and immunization against HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) as needed, and the CDC also recommends pneumococcal vaccination for all persons with chronic liver disease.

Hepatitis C virus care during COVID-19 — pandemic impact and monitoring emphasizes that HCV screening, diagnosis, and treatment were significantly adversely affected, with HCV RNA–positive test results decreased 62% in March 2020 and remaining 39% below baseline in July 2020, and testing volume decreased precipitously beginning in mid-March 2020; comparable decreases occurred in Ontario during each of the first 3 waves; a US national retrospective study found only 23% of people on Medicaid with a positive HCV RNA test between 30 January 2019 and 31 October 2020 initiated direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment within 360 days of diagnosis; and a survey of European Association for the Study of the Liver members representing 48 clinical centers showed decreased HCV testing, diagnosis, and treatment in 2020 compared with 2019 (prepandemic). These findings underscore the critical importance of ongoing, rigorous, universal HCV screening for case identification and linkage to care, and monitoring the proportion of persons who meet steps in the HCV cascade of care will be critical to assessing the quality of HCV care.

### Feasibility of hepatitis C elimination by screening and treatment alone in high-income countries [^116eqdKs]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Despite the availability of highly effective direct-acting antiviral therapy, chronic hepatitis C (CHC) continues to cause a major public health burden. In many high-income countries, treatment rates have been declining, which was exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, threatening the ability to meet the World Health Organization (WHO)'s targets for eliminating HCV as a public health threat by 2030. We sought to model the impact of CHC in Canada, a resource-rich country with ongoing immigration from HCV-endemic regions; which relies exclusively on risk-based screening for case identification.

Approach and Results

We developed an agent-based model to characterize the HCV epidemic in a high-income country with ongoing immigration. Combinations of prevention such as harm reduction, screening, and treatment strategies were considered. Model parameters were estimated from the literature and calibrated against historical HCV data. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess uncertainty. Under the current status quo of risk-based screening, we predict the incidence of CHC-induced decompensated cirrhosis, HCC, and liver-related deaths would decrease by 79.4%, 76.1%, and 62.1%, respectively, between 2015 and 2030, but CHC incidence would only decrease by 11.1%. The results were sensitive to HCV transmission rate and an annual number of people initiating treatment.

Conclusions

Current risk-based screening, and subsequent treatment, will be inadequate to achieve WHO goals. With extensive scale-up in screening, and treatment, the mortality target may be achievable, but the target for preventing new CHC cases is unlikely reachable, highlighting the importance of developing enhanced harm-reduction strategies for HCV elimination.

### Hepatitis C identification and management by family physicians [^117NcevQ]. Family Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Many people with hepatitis C receive all or most of their care from primary care physicians, yet little information exists about the practice patterns, knowledge, and beliefs and attitudes of family physicians related to hepatitis C.

Methods

We mailed a written survey to a random sample of active members of the American Academy of Family Physicians.

Results

Nearly all respondents (94%) reported at least one patient with hepatitis C in their practice, and 66% had diagnosed at least one new case of hepatitis C in the past year. While most respondents (85%) correctly identified common hepatitis C risk factors, only 63% reported routinely asking patients about those risk factors. Respondents (74%) preferred to involve specialists in the care of hepatitis C patients, but half (50%) reported barriers to referral. A small number (5%) of respondents have prescribed antiviral medication within the past year. Most respondents think family physicians should screen (94%), diagnose (98%), and provide general care (69%) for hepatitis C patients.

Conclusions

Family physicians know how to identify high-risk people and test for hepatitis C. Most prefer to refer patients with hepatitis C to specialists for workup and treatment but report frequent barriers to those referrals.

Determining the Prevalence Threshold for the Recommendations

The recommended HCV RNA prevalence threshold of 0.1% was determined based, in part, on review of published ICERs, as a function of hepatitis C prevalence, and the most up-to-date estimated prevalence of hepatitis C within states. In general, cost analyses determined that for all adults, ICER would be approximately $50,000 per QALY gained or less at current treatment costs (approximately $25,000 per course of treatment) at an anti-HCV positivity prevalence of 0.07% in the nonbirth cohort, which is similar to the HCV RNA prevalence in all adults. At a hepatitis C prevalence of 0.1%, ICER would be approximately $36,000 per QALY gained. Certain economists use $50,000 as a conservative threshold to determine cost-effectiveness. As treatment costs decrease, ICERs also will decrease, assuming other parameters remain stable. According to modeling results using NHANES data, no state has a hepatitis C prevalence in adults below 0.1%. Similarly, for universal testing in pregnant women, ICER would be approximately $50,000 per QALY gained or less at an HCV RNA positivity prevalence of 0.05%; at a prevalence of 0.1%, ICER would be approximately $15,000 per QALY gained. ICERs might be higher for testing in subsequent pregnancies when testing during the index pregnancy identifies women with hepatitis C who receive treatment following pregnancy, resulting in a decrease in hepatitis C prevalence among women with more than one pregnancy. According to birth certificate data (likely an underestimate of current maternal HCV infections), only three states were below the 0.1% prevalence among pregnant women.

Although the intent of public health screening is usually to identify undiagnosed disease, many persons previously diagnosed with hepatitis C are not appropriately linked to care and are not cured of their HCV infection, thereby representing an ongoing source of transmission. Therefore, the prevalence threshold of 0.1% should be determined on the basis of estimates of chronic hepatitis C prevalence, regardless of whether hepatitis C has been diagnosed previously.

### CDC recommendations for hepatitis C screening among adults-United States, 2020 [^113QALj6]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major source of morbidity and mortality in the United States. HCV is transmitted primarily through parenteral exposures to infectious blood or body fluids that contain blood, most commonly through injection drug use. No vaccine against hepatitis C exists and no effective pre- or postexposure prophylaxis is available. More than half of persons who become infected with HCV will develop chronic infection. Direct-acting antiviral treatment can result in a virologic cure in most persons with 8–12 weeks of all-oral medication regimens. This report augments (i.e., updates and summarizes) previously published recommendations from CDC regarding testing for HCV infection in the United States (Smith BD, Morgan RL, Beckett GA, et al. Recommendations for the identification of chronic hepatitis C virus infection among persons born during 1945–1965. MMWR Recomm Rec 2012;61[No. RR-4]). CDC is augmenting previous guidance with two new recommendations: 1) hepatitis C screening at least once in a lifetime for all adults aged ≥ 18 years, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is < 0.1% and 2) hepatitis C screening for all pregnant women during each pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is < 0.1%. The recommendation for HCV testing that remains unchanged is regardless of age or setting prevalence, all persons with risk factors should be tested for hepatitis C, with periodic testing while risk factors persist. Any person who requests hepatitis C testing should receive it, regardless of disclosure of risk, because many persons might be reluctant to disclose stigmatizing risks.

In March and April of 2020, public health authorities issued major updates to screening recommendations for hepatitis C virus infection. With the rise in cases driven by injection drug use coupled with access to highly effective therapies promising a cure, all adults aged ≥ 18 years should receive one-time hepatitis C virus antibody screening in any health care setting. Although the recommendation is dubbed "universal", this commentary reviews the details of the recommendations and discusses the high-risk populations not entirely captured with these changes.

### Screening for hepatitis C virus infection in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115GsP5B]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment outcomes in adults — noncirrhotic populations identified by screening showed high sustained virologic response (SVR) rates and few short-term deaths, with SVR associated with better clinical outcomes. Treatment studies focused on populations without cirrhosis who are more likely to be asymptomatic and identified by screening. Of the trials of DAA regimens (n = 7167; 26% to 69% female; mean age, 45 to 62 years), 14 were multicountry, 11 were conducted in the US or Canada, and in 29 trials, 60% to 100% of patients were white. Treatment duration was 12 weeks in all but 2 trials, which allocated patients to either 8 or 12 weeks of treatment; eleven trials were of good quality and 22 were of fair quality. Forty-nine trials found DAA regimens to be associated with pooled SVR rates ranging from 95.5% to 98.9% across genotypes. Trials reporting short-term mortality (1 year) found few events; twenty-one trials reported no deaths, and in the other 10 trials there were 17 deaths (0.4% [17/3848]) overall. Sustained virologic response after antiviral therapy was associated with reduced risk versus no SVR for all-cause mortality (pooled hazard ratio [HR], 0.40 [95% CI, 0.28–0.56]), liver mortality (pooled HR, 0.11 [95% CI, 0.04–0.27]), cirrhosis (pooled HR, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.33–0.40]), and hepatocellular carcinoma (pooled HR, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.23–0.38]).

### CDC recommendations for hepatitis C screening among adults-United States, 2020 [^114kr2Zm]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Determining Prevalence

In the absence of existing data for hepatitis C prevalence, health care providers should initiate universal hepatitis C screening until they establish that the prevalence of HCV RNA positivity in their population is < 0.1%, at which point universal screening is no longer explicitly recommended but might occur at the provider's discretion. Hepatitis C screening can be conducted in a variety of settings or programs that serve populations at different risk and with varying hepatitis C prevalence. Regardless of the provider, organization, or program providing testing, health care providers should initiate universal screening for adults and pregnant women unless the prevalence of HCV infection (HCV RNA positivity prevalence) in their patients has been documented to be < 0.1%. There are statistical challenges with determining a "number needed to screen" to detect a relatively rare disease in lower-risk settings; therefore, providers and program directors are encouraged to consult their state or local health departments or CDC to determine a reasonable estimate of baseline prevalence in their setting or a methodology for determining how many persons they need to screen before confidently establishing that the prevalence is < 0.1%. As a general guide: as HCV RNA prevalence is predicated on first testing for anti-HCV, and according to the most current serologic data in the United States, approximately 59% of anti-HCV positive persons are HCV RNA positive, an estimated 507 randomly selected patients in a setting of any size would need to be tested using any of the available anti-HCV tests to detect an anti-HCV prevalence positivity of ≤ 0.17%, corresponding to an expected HCV RNA positivity prevalence of 0.1% with 95% confidence and 5% tolerance.

### No differences in achieving hepatitis C virus care milestones Between patients identified by birth cohort or Risk-based screening [^112uxTC9]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

National hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening guidelines recommended 1-time testing of persons born between 1945 and 1965.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study to compare care milestones achieved by HCV-infected patients identified by birth cohort versus risk-based screens.

Results

We determined the proportions of patients newly identified with HCV infection who met care milestones (viral load, referral to and evaluation by a specialist, offer of treatment, initiation of treatment, and sustained viral response) and the time it took to reach them. We found no differences in HCV care milestones for patients identified via birth cohort testing versus risk-based screening. Overall, only 43% of HCV antibody-positive patients were referred to care, and less than 4% started treatment. The time to each care milestone was lengthy and varied greatly; treatment was initiated in a median of 308 days.

Conclusions

Although birth cohort testing will likely increase identification of patients with HCV infection, it does not seem to increase the number of patients that meet management milestones. New methods are needed to increase access to care and establish efficient models of health care delivery.

### Case finding and therapy for chronic viral hepatitis in primary care (hepFREE): a cluster-randomised controlled trial [^112Di72C]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Background

The prevalence of viral hepatitis (hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus) in migrants is higher than among the general population in many high-income countries. We aimed to determine whether incentivising and supporting primary-care physicians in areas with a high density of migrants increases the numbers of adult migrants screened for viral hepatitis.

Methods

HepFREE was a multicentre, open, cluster-randomised controlled trial in general practices in areas of the UK with a high density of migrants (Bradford, Yorkshire, and northeast and southeast London). Participants were adult patients (aged 18 years or older) in primary care, who had been identified as a first or second generation migrant from a high-risk country. General practices were randomly assigned (1:2:2:2:2) to an opportunistic screening (control) group or to one of four targeted screening (interventional) groups: standard (ie, hospital-based) care and a standard invitation letter; standard care and an enhanced invitation letter; community care and a standard invitation letter; or community care and an enhanced invitation letter. In control screening, general practitioners (GPs) were given a teaching session on viral hepatitis and were asked to test all registered migrants. In the intervention, GPs were paid a nominal sum for setting up searches of records, reimbursed for signed consent forms, and supported by a dedicated clinician. Patients who were eligible for testing and tested positive for viral hepatitis in the intervention groups were eligible to enrol in a second embedded trial of community versus hospital based care. The primary outcomes were the proportion of patients eligible for screening, the proportion of those eligible who were sent an invitation letter in the intervention groups, the uptake of viral hepatitis screening (in the intention-to-treat population), the proportion of patients who tested positive for viral hepatitis, the proportion who complied with treatment, and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN54828633.

Findings

Recruitment and testing ran from Oct 31, 2013, to Feb 4, 2017, and each practice recruited for 18 consecutive calendar months. We approached 70 general practices in three areas with a high density of migrants, of which 63 general practices agreed to participate. Five practices withdrew and 58 practices were randomly assigned: eight to control and 50 to an intervention. In control practices, 26046 (38.4%) of 67820 patients who were initially registered were eligible for testing, as were 152321 (43.3%) of 351710 patients in the interventional groups in London and Bradford. Of 51773 randomly selected eligible patients in the intervention groups in London and Bradford, letters were sent to 43585 (84.2%) patients. In the eight control general practices, screening was taken up by 543 (1.7%) of 31738 eligible participants, which included 5692 newly registered patients. However, in the 50 general practices that used the intervention, screening was taken up by 11386 (19.5%) of 58512 eligible participants (including 6739 newly registered patients; incidence rate ratio 3.70, 95% CI 1.30–10.51; p = 0.014) and this intervention was cost-effective. 720 (4.5%) of 15844 patients who received a standard letter versus 1032 (3.7%) of 28095 patients who received the enhanced letter were tested (0.70, 0.38–1.31; p = 0.26). In the control group, 17 patients tested positive for viral hepatitis, as did 220 patients (one with a co-infection) in the intervention groups. In the embedded study, 220 patients were randomly assigned to either hospital-based care or community care; 80 (87.9%) of 91 patients in the hospital setting complied with treatment versus 105 (81.4%) of 129 patients in the community setting. The intervention was cost-effective at willingness to pay thresholds in excess of £8540. One serious adverse event (thyroiditis) was noted.

Interpretation

Screening migrants for viral hepatitis in primary care is effective if doctors are incentivised and supported. Community care is expensive and there is no evidence that this offers benefits in this setting or that bespoke invitation letters add value. We suggest that bespoke invitation letters should not be used, and we suggest that outreach, community-based services for migrants should not be developed.

### A digital case-finding algorithm for diagnosed but untreated hepatitis C: a tool for increasing linkage to treatment and cure [^1175HXGe]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

HCV infection remains a major public health threat. Highly effective direct‐acting antiviral (DAA) treatments have been available since 2014; however, 1 million to 3 million persons in the USA remain infected, and ~50,000 new infections occur every year. HCV is the leading cause of HCC‐related death in the USA and in many other parts of the world. HCV is reported to cause ~20,000 deaths annually in the USA, but the actual death rate could be up to 5‐fold higher and exceed 80,000 per year. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other agencies have set goals to reduce HCV infections and premature deaths; however, the USA appears unlikely to meet its WHO 2030 impact targets.

As a first step toward reducing the HCV‐related disease burden, public health agencies have issued a series of screening guidelines. Early advisories focused on patients with specific risk factors. In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) expanded screening recommendations to include all baby boomers (i.e. persons born 1945–1965). In early 2020, the CDC and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force further expanded guidelines to include nearly all adults.

To be effective, screening must lead to treatment, but this often fails to occur. According to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH), only 62% of residents who had a positive test for HCV RNA in 2015 had received HCV treatment by 2019. A recent study conducted in Bronx, New York, found that 80% of HCV‐RNA–positive samples were collected from patients whose medical record already contained a positive HCV‐RNA test, highlighting the large gap between diagnosis and treatment. Similarly, CDC data indicate that 60% of the 2.4 million persons with chronic HCV in the USA are aware of their positive HCV status, but remain untreated. Sizable populations of diagnosed‐but‐untreated (DBU) HCV‐infected persons have also been described in Europe, Asia, Central and South America, and Africa. These findings establish that millions of DBU patients exist and require case finding and outreach.

### Screening for hepatitis C virus infection in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112JAgKs]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common chronic blood-borne pathogen in the US and a leading cause of complications from chronic liver disease. HCV is associated with more deaths than the top 60 other reportable infectious diseases combined, including HIV. Cases of acute HCV infection have increased approximately 3.8-fold over the last decade because of increasing injection drug use and improved surveillance.

Objective

To update its 2013 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on screening for HCV infection in adolescents and adults.

Population

This recommendation applies to all asymptomatic adults aged 18 to 79 years without known liver disease.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for HCV infection in adults aged 18 to 79 years has substantial net benefit.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for HCV infection in adults aged 18 to 79 years. (B recommendation).

Key points
- CDC recommends universal hepatitis C screening for all adults 18 and older and all pregnant women during each pregnancy.
- CDC recommends testing people in certain high-risk groups more frequently.
- Testing, diagnosis, and timely treatment can prevent hepatitis C complications and interrupt transmission. Who to test and screen Universal screening Clinicians should universally screen:

- All adults 18 and older at least once in their lifetime, except in settings where the prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection is under 0. 1%.
- All pregnant women during each pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is under 0. 1%. One-time testing CDC recommends one-time hepatitis C testing for people with recognized risk factors or exposures, including: Recommended tests Clinicians should use an FDA-approved HCV antibody test followed by a NAT for HCV RNA test when antibody is positive/reactive.

Tests include:

- HCV antibody test.
- Nucleic acid test to detect presence and levels of HCV RNA. CDC recommends that clinicians collect all samples needed to diagnose hepatitis C in a single visit, initiating hepatitis C testing with an HCV antibody test, and ordering HCV RNA testing automatically when the HCV antibody is reactive. How to interpret test results Test Outcome Interpretation Further Actions HCV antibody nonreactive No HCV antibody detected Sample can be reported as nonreactive for HCV antibody. No further action required. If recent exposure is suspected, test for HCV RNA. How to diagnose hepatitis C A repeatedly reactive HCV antibody result could be consistent with current HCV infection, but detected presence of HCV RNA is needed to diagnose a patient with a hepatitis C infection. Learn more about viral hepatitis serology.

What to do next CDC recommends that clinicians offer the following services to people who are diagnosed with HCV infection:

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^114maq6U]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

HCV in the pediatric population — burden, transmission, screening, and treatment access: An estimated 3.5 million–5.0 million children and adolescents worldwide have chronic HCV infection, including an estimated 23,000–46,000 pediatric patients in the United States. Vertical transmission accounts for most pediatric infections, and the rate of mother-to-child transmission is approximately 5%, with higher rates among women with inadequately controlled HIV coinfection and in women with HCV RNA > 6 log10 IU/mL. Universal prenatal hepatitis C screening is expected to improve identification of at-risk infants who require HCV testing. Historically, antiviral treatment was limited to adolescents aged ≥ 12 years, but recent and anticipated FDA approvals for children aged 3–11 years expand access; modeling data indicate that HCV DAA therapy is cost-effective in children as young as 12 years.

### Vital signs: newly reported acute and chronic hepatitis C cases-United States, 2009–2018 [^114Wm6tq]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Ecologic evidence reveals that CDC's 2012 recommendation to screen all baby boomers for HCV infection resulted in increased testing among that birth cohort. However, existing testing strategies have had limited success because > 39% of all adults with HCV infection still report being unaware that they are infected. Further, the increase in new acute and newly reported chronic infections among young adults further supports the need for expanded and easier-to-implement hepatitis C testing recommendations. The new CDC recommendations released today include screening of all adults aged ≥ 18 years once in their lifetime and screening of all pregnant women during each pregnancy. They also include an exception for settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is < 0.1%; however, there are few known settings with a hepatitis C prevalence below that threshold. The recommendation for testing of persons with risk factors remains in effect, regardless of age or setting prevalence, including continued periodic testing of persons with ongoing risk. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently published a recommendation statement on screening for hepatitis C virus infection in all adults aged 18–79 years (B recommendation). The USPSTF recommendation differs from CDC's recommendation in that 1) an upper age limit is defined, 2) there is no recommendation for screening during every pregnancy, 3) and a prevalence threshold at which universal screening would remain cost-effective is not identified.

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, the number of cases of acute and chronic hepatitis C reported to CDC underestimate the actual incidence of disease, and not all states reported chronic infections to CDC in 2018. For every reported case of acute hepatitis C, CDC estimates that there are 13.9 actual cases; however, this estimation methodology is imprecise and might be influenced by testing rates. Second, minor changes to the CSTE case definition, changes to the reporting practices across jurisdictions, and changes to hepatitis C testing practices among providers during 2009–2018 should be considered when examining acute hepatitis C cases temporally. Finally, because NHANES sampling is limited to the noninstitutionalized, civilian population, survey results related to hepatitis C might not be nationally representative because they do not include some populations at highest risk for hepatitis C (e.g. incarcerated persons).

### The changing burden of hepatitis C virus infection in the United States: model-based predictions [^114gQB6F]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes a substantial health and economic burden in the United States. With the availability of direct-acting antiviral agents, recently approved therapies and those under development, and 1-time birth-cohort screening, the burden of this disease is expected to decrease.

Objective

To predict the effect of new therapies and screening on chronic HCV infection and associated disease outcomes.

Design

Individual-level state-transition model.

Setting

Existing and anticipated therapies and screening for HCV infection in the United States.

Patients

Total HCV-infected population in the United States.

Measurements

The number of cases of chronic HCV infection and outcomes of advanced-stage HCV infection.

Results

The number of cases of chronic HCV infection decreased from 3.2 million in 2001 to 2.3 million in 2013. One-time birth-cohort screening beginning in 2013 is expected to identify 487,000 cases of HCV infection in the next 10 years. In contrast, 1-time universal screening could identify 933,700 cases. With the availability of highly effective therapies, HCV infection could become a rare disease in the next 22 years. Recently approved therapies for HCV infection and 1-time birth-cohort screening could prevent approximately 124,200 cases of decompensated cirrhosis, 78,800 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 126,500 liver-related deaths, and 9900 liver transplantations by 2050. Increasing the treatment capacity would further reduce the burden of HCV disease.

Limitation

Institutionalized patients with HCV infection were excluded, and empirical data on the effectiveness of future therapies and on the future annual incidence and treatment capacity of HCV infection are lacking.

Conclusion

New therapies for HCV infection and widespread implementation of screening and treatment will play an important role in reducing the burden of HCV disease. More aggressive screening recommendations are needed to identify a large pool of infected patients.

A Markov model simulated chronic hepatitis C (CHC) prevalence, incidence of events, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in the French general population, aged 18 to 80 years, undiagnosed for CHC for different strategies: S1 = current strategy targeting the at risk population; S2 = S1 and all men between 18 and 59 years; S3 = S1 and all individuals between 40 and 59 years; S4 = S1 and all individuals between 40 and 80 years; S5 = all individuals between 18 and 80 years (universal screening). Once CHC was diagnosed, treatment was initiated either to patients with fibrosis stage ≥ F2 or regardless of fibrosis. Data were extracted from published literature, a national prevalence survey, and a previously published mathematical model. ICER were interpreted based on one or three times French GDP per capita (€32,800).

Results

Universal screening led to the lowest prevalence of CHC and incidence of events, regardless of treatment initiation. When considering treatment initiation to patients with fibrosis ≥ F2, targeting all people aged 40–80 was the only cost-effective strategy at both thresholds (€26,100/QALY). When we considered treatment for all, although universal screening of all individuals aged 18–80 is associated with the highest costs, it is more effective than targeting all people aged 40–80, and cost-effective at both thresholds (€31,100/QALY).

Conclusions

In France, universal screening is the most effective screening strategy for HCV. Universal screening is cost-effective when treatment is initiated regardless of fibrosis stage. From an individual and especially from a societal perspective of HCV eradication, this strategy should be implemented.

Lay Summary

In the context of highly effective and well tolerated therapies for hepatitis C virus that are now recommended for all patients, a reassessment of hepatitis C screening strategies is needed. An effectiveness and cost-effectiveness study of different strategies targeting either the at-risk population, specific ages or all individuals was performed. In France, universal screening is the most effective strategy and is cost-effective when treatment is initiated regardless of fibrosis stage. From an individual and especially from a societal perspective of hepatitis C virus eradication, this strategy should be implemented.

### Cost effectiveness of an intervention to increase uptake of hepatitis C virus testing and treatment (hepCATT): cluster randomised controlled trial in primary care [^113dwf2y]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Economic evaluation

A small number of patients (287/24 473 (1.2%) appeared in the records of more than one practice. We retained these in the analysis of the intervention effect reported above to avoid excluding a more mobile section of the study sample but excluded them from the economic analysis, which is based on the remaining 23 896 patients (12 922 in the intervention arm and 10 974 in the control arm).

High variability existed between practices in the time estimated to complete each stage of the case finding process (supplementary table S2). The most time consuming stage was screening the list of patients to identify appropriate candidates for the screening invitation; this varied from an estimated one hour to 30 hours. This stage was also the most expensive, as the task was most often carried out by a general practitioner. Other elements of the case finding were more often carried out by the practice manager or administrative staff. The mean total cost of the case finding process was £1272 per practice, or £624 per practice if software and installation costs are excluded.

The intervention led to a very small increase in the number and the cost of HCV related general practice consultations during the study period, but this had little effect on total costs (table 4). The additional cost of case finding per patient at risk in the intervention practices was £7.10 (95% confidence interval £4.75 to £9.45). The average cost per additional patient referred to hepatology for assessment was £5569. Figure 2 shows the cost effectiveness acceptability curve based on the cost per additional case identified. Alternatively, after exclusion of the training, software, and installation costs, the cost of case finding was £4.03 (£2.27 to £5.80) and the average cost per additional patient referred to hepatology for treatment was £3165.

### The impact of enhanced screening and treatment on hepatitis C in the United States [^116z3fid]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The effectiveness of interferon-free direct-acting antivirals (DAA) in treating chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is limited by low screening and treatment rates, particularly among people who inject drugs (PWIDs).

Methods

To evaluate the levels of screening and treatment with interferon-free DAAs that are required to control HCV incidence and HCV-associated morbidity and mortality, we developed a transmission model, stratified by age and by injection drug use, and calibrated it to epidemiological data in the United States from 1992 to 2014. We quantified the impact of administration of DAAs at current and at enhanced screening and treatment rates, focusing on outcomes of HCV incidence, prevalence, compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplants, and mortality from 2015 to 2040.

Results

Increasing annual treatment of patients 4-fold-from the approximately 100 000 treated historically to 400 000-is predicted to prevent 526 084 (95% confidence interval, 466 615–593 347) cases of cirrhosis and 256 315 (201 589–316 114) HCV-associated deaths. By simultaneously increasing treatment capacity and increasing the number of HCV infections diagnosed, total HCV prevalence could fall to as low as 305 599 (222 955–422 110) infections by 2040. Complete elimination of HCV transmission in the United States through treatment with DAAs would require nearly universal screening of PWIDs, with an annual treatment rate of at least 30%.

Conclusions

Interferon-free DAAs are projected to achieve marked reductions in HCV-associated morbidity and mortality. Aggressive expansion in HCV screening and treatment, particularly among PWIDs, would be required to eliminate HCV in the United States.

Screening frequency and pediatric scope — Annual HCV testing is recommended for all persons who inject drugs and for men with human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) infection who have unprotected sex with men (IIa, C). People with an ongoing risk factor(s) for HCV infection remain vulnerable for as long as the behavior, exposure, condition, or circumstance persists, thereby warranting periodic repeat HCV testing, and there is a paucity of data addressing the optimal frequency of repeat testing, thereby leaving the periodicity to the clinician's discretion on a case-by-case basis. Because of these challenges, at least annual HCV testing is recommended. One-time, risk-based HCV screening is recommended for persons younger than 18 years old with current or past behaviors, exposures, or conditions or circumstances associated with an increased risk of HCV infection, and there is currently insufficient evidence to support universal HCV screening in the pediatric population.

### Opportunities for enhanced prevention and control of hepatitis C through improved screening and testing efforts [^111FgZnv]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

An estimated 2.4 million people in the United States are living with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated hepatitis C screening recommendations to test adults aged ≥ 18 years at least once in a lifetime and pregnant persons during each pregnancy. For those with ongoing exposure to HCV, periodic testing is recommended. The recommended testing sequence is to obtain an HCV antibody test and, when positive, perform an HCV RNA test. Examination of HCV care cascades has found that incomplete HCV testing occurs when a separate visit is required to obtain the HCV RNA test. Hepatitis C core antigen testing has been shown to be a useful tool for diagnosing current HCV infection in some settings. Hepatitis C testing that is completed, accurate, and efficient is necessary to achieve hepatitis C elimination goals.

### Screening for hepatitis C virus infection in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112F9HSp]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Update of USPSTF hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening recommendation — age expansion and rationale notes that the 2013 USPSTF recommendation recommended screening for HCV infection in persons at high risk and in adults born between 1945 and 1965 (B recommendation), and the new USPSTF recommendation expands the ages for screening to all adults from 18 to 79 years; since 2013, the prevalence of HCV infection has increased in younger persons aged 20 to 39 years, prevalence in older adults born between 1945 and 1965 remains relatively high, and clinical trials of DAA treatment included adults in their early 80s, while epidemiologic data in adolescents younger than 18 years are limited; as a result, the USPSTF concluded that broadening the age for HCV screening will identify infected patients earlier who could benefit from effective treatment before complications develop.

### Cost-effectiveness of universal and targeted hepatitis C virus screening in the United States [^113gRXWj]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are universal hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening for all US adults aged 18 years or older and targeted HCV screening among people who inject drugs cost-effective for limiting HCV infection?

Findings

In this economic evaluation study, HCV screening for people who inject drugs in the US increased quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by 0.23 (ie, approximately 3 months), with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $45 465 per QALY. Universal HCV screening increased QALY overall by 0.01, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $291 277 per QALY.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that HCV screening for people who inject drugs may be a cost-effective intervention to combat HCV infection, which would decrease the risk of untreated HCV infection and liver-related mortality.

### Updated operational guidance for implementing CDC's recommendations on testing for hepatitis C virus infection [^115DX1Qv]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Current hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing guidance recommends a two-step testing sequence for diagnosis of HCV infection. Performing an HCV RNA test whenever an HCV antibody test is reactive (complete testing) is critical to achieve national HCV elimination goals. When an HCV antibody test is reactive and no HCV RNA test is performed, testing is considered incomplete. Historically, approximately one third of patients have incomplete testing. This update clarifies that all sites performing HCV screening should ensure single-visit sample collection. This approach allows for automatic HCV RNA testing when an HCV antibody test is reactive to avoid incomplete testing. Use of strategies that require multiple visits to collect HCV testing samples should be discontinued. Automatic HCV RNA testing on all HCV antibody reactive samples will increase the percentage of patients with current HCV infection who are linked to care and receive curative antiviral therapy.

### Screening for chronic hepatitis C: American College of Preventive Medicine practice policy statement [^112NvYiD]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C is an under-diagnosed and prevalent bloodborne illness, resulting in chronic cirrhosis in up to 25% of those infected. While the overall prevalence in the United States is 1.7%, high-risk populations may have up to 80% prevalence. The mechanism of transmission is well understood, but effective preventive measures are hampered by economic, social, and political factors. Antiviral treatment is expensive, and efficacy ranges from 40% to 85%. The value of screening high-risk populations has been demonstrated, and should be expanded; however, there is insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening for adults.

### The meaning of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force grade I recommendation: screening for hepatitis C virus infection [^116CQgLB]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) formulates evidence-based recommendations for clinical preventive services. These recommendations are communicated by letter grades that reflect the quality of evidence and the magnitude of net health benefit expected from delivering the preventive service. When the USPSTF finds insufficient evidence to determine the balance of health benefits or harms of delivering a preventive service, because of a lack of studies, poor-quality studies, or good-quality studies with conflicting results, the USPSTF assigns the service an I letter grade. The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for hepatitis C virus infection in high-risk individuals (I letter grade). This recommendation reflects the need for further research that would provide adequate evidence to assess the net health benefit for persons screened for hepatitis C virus infection.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114Q45zf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening and diagnostic testing include population screening, test performance, and confirmatory steps. Approximately 4.1 million Americans are positive for anti-bodies against hepatitis C, and an estimated 3.0 million harbor chronic infection on the basis of positive hepatitis C RNA in the serum. The screening test for chronic hepatitis C is the hepatitis C antibody, which has a sensitivity of 92–97%, but the positive predictive value is highest with risk factors, and false positives may be observed in 5% of cases, and as high as 30% among individuals without reported risk factors. Confirmation of chronic infection is established by a highly sensitive HCV RNA PCR assay, and individuals confirmed to have positive RNA should be referred to a specialist for further characterization and assessment of liver fibrosis to guide therapy decisions. As recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), individuals born within the 1945–1965 birth cohort should be considered for universal HCV antibody testing independent of abnormalities in AST/ALT levels, which may be normal in chronic infection. For suspected acute infection, testing includes anti-HCV, which is typically positive 6–8 weeks after exposure, with confirmation by measuring HCV RNA by PCR testing which must be done to confirm acute hepatitis or chronic hepatitis C.

AASLD–IDSA hepatitis C guidance — universal adult screening recommends one-time, routine, opt-out hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening for all individuals aged 18 years or older (I, B), supported by modeling showing one-time universal screening for adults aged ≥ 18 years is cost-effective (≤ $30,000/quality-adjusted life-years) versus birth-cohort screening. The guidance panel recommends universal, one-time, opt-out HCV screening of adults aged ≥ 18 years and does not recommend an age limit for universal adult HCV screening, whereas the USPSTF draft proposes universal screening among adults aged 18–79 years with an upper age limit of 79 years.

Treatment in the absence of a screening program

The number of treated PLHCV stagnated/declined in every country/region irrespective of income level (Table 1). This trend was observed much faster in HICs, while in LMICs (e.g. Pakistan and Indonesia), it took longer to manifest. This trend may be the result of the depletion of the pool of PLHCV waiting for treatment who can pay (in countries where PLHCV must pay out of pocket). The decline in the number of treatments has led to the conclusion, in some countries, that HCV prevalence must be lower than originally estimated. However, declining numbers of treated PLHCV may be more indicative of exhausting the efficacy of existing strategies rather than a lower HCV prevalence.

To achieve the WHO elimination targets, countries should consider expanding screening programs. This was best demonstrated in the Egyptian program, where adoption of a national screening campaign in 2019 resulted in a very large increase in treatment. In the United Kingdom, England initiated a wide-scale screening program to maintain their treatment numbers. Similarly, after Germany initiated a one-time screening of adults in 2022, an increase in the number of treated PLHCV was observed. The recommendations to screen adults for HCV in the United States also led to an increase in treatment initiations.

### Screening for hepatitis C virus infection in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111Wom1d]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of others — hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening policies: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention draft screening guideline recommends screening for HCV at least once in a lifetime for all adults 18 years and older, except in settings where the prevalence is less than 0.1%, and states that all pregnant persons should be screened for HCV during each pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is less than 0.1%. It further states that all persons with risk factors should be tested for HCV, with periodic testing while risk factors persist. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends offering HCV screening to pregnant persons with risk factors. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends 1-time routine, opt-out HCV screening for persons 18 years and older and 1-time testing for all persons younger than 18 years at increased risk of HCV exposure, and also recommends periodic testing for persons with an increased risk of HCV exposure and annual HCV testing for all PWID and for HIV-infected men who have unprotected sex with men.

### CDC recommendations for hepatitis C screening among adults-United States, 2020 [^117GUa6S]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C prevalence in U.S. correctional settings is high because of high incarceration rates among persons who use drugs. Two recent systematic reviews estimated average anti-HCV positivity prevalence in correctional settings at 16.1% and 23%. Hepatitis C prevalence varies across individual correctional jurisdictions based on factors including underlying community prevalence, sentencing standards for drug-related offenses, and type of institution. These estimates exceed both the general population prevalence of 1.7% and the target threshold of ≥ 0.1% at which these guidelines recommend universal hepatitis C testing in other settings. Therefore, the well-documented prevalence of HCV infection in a variety of correctional jurisdictions supports the application of these guidelines to prisons and jails. Universal hepatitis C testing in correctional facilities can be expected to yield higher infection identification rates compared with the risk-based testing practices that many jurisdictions employ and to support broader hepatitis C elimination efforts.

Reporting

Cases of hepatitis C should be reported to the appropriate state or local health jurisdiction in accordance with requirements for reporting acute, perinatal, and chronic HCV infection. Case definitions for the classification of reportable cases of HCV infection have been published previously by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.

Recommendations of Other Organizations

Recommendations in this report for hepatitis C screening among certain groups differ somewhat from the recommendations of other organizations. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and AASLD and IDSA also make recommendations for hepatitis C testing.

HBV screening strategies and test accuracy — benefits of early detection and treatment reports that there are currently no randomized clinical trials comparing screening with no screening to provide direct evidence of benefit; the current review found no studies that assessed the accuracy of tools for identifying persons at increased risk for HBV infection, and sensitivity and specificity were > 98%. Evaluation of screening strategies included primary care practices in Germany (n = 20 917), a French sexually transmitted infection clinic (n = 6194), and French clinics that served populations with high HBV prevalence (n = 3929), with screening based on broad criteria identifying nearly all cases and numbers needed to screen ranging from 32 to 148. Restricting screening to immigrants from high-prevalence (≥ 2%) countries was more efficient, with numbers needed to screen ranging from 19 to 71, identified 85% to 99% of patients with HBV infection in higher-prevalence clinical settings, but missed about two-thirds of HBV infections in German primary care practices.

### CDC recommendations for hepatitis C screening among adults-United States, 2020 [^117TFzvq]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

These literature reviews are subject to at least three limitations. First, heterogeneity of individual study results might not be comparable across studies. For example, regarding anti-HCV positivity, some studies reported the proportion of persons testing positive out of the number of persons tested, while other studies reported the total population as the denominator. Other examples of heterogeneity between studies include varying definitions for follow-up (e.g. variations in provider types [specialist versus primary care provider] for which linkage-to-care was considered and varying definitions of "treated" [e.g. treatment initiated versus completed or not specified]). Second, limitations of the included studies also exist and could carry over into the systematic review findings. For example, recall bias and low response rates might have occurred within individual studies, potentially contributing to similar bias in the overall systematic review results. In addition, studies performed in high-burden areas might not be representative of the general populations and could impact external validity of the systematic review. Finally, publication bias might favor publication of studies reporting high disease prevalence, also potentially impacting external validity.

### Screening for hepatitis C virus infection in adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^113172aj]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2004 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for and treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in asymptomatic adults.

Methods

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality commissioned 2 systematic reviews on screening for and treatment of HCV infection in asymptomatic adults, focusing on evidence gaps identified in the previous USPSTF recommendation and new studies published since 2004. The evidence on screening for HCV in pregnant women was also considered.

Population

This recommendation applies to all asymptomatic adults without known liver disease or functional abnormalities.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for HCV infection in persons at high risk for infection. The USPSTF also recommends offering 1-time screening for HCV infection to adults born between 1945 and 1965. (B recommendation).

### Hepatitis C screening: getting it right [^116a8kG1]. Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Hepatitis C is the most prevalent bloodborne viral disease in the United States and the deadliest. This year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) will update its 2004 hepatitis C guideline, which recommends against screening asymptomatic adults for hepatitis C. This guideline has hampered public health efforts to encourage screening and identify and refer infected persons for care by declaring that such interventions were not supported by the evidence. A draft revision of the guideline, released on November 26, 2012, concludes that testing persons born between 1945 and 1965 probably has at least a small net benefit, but stops short of definitively recommending that this cohort be screened. This article examines the Task Force's process for writing its guidelines. It recommends that the Task Force adopt a balanced approach to evaluating the benefits and harms of screening; use the preponderance of the evidence as a standard for evaluating interventions that target serious public health problems; be transparent about the value judgments that go into its decisions; consider the wide variation in disease prevalence in diverse patient populations; and recommend screening asymptomatic adults for hepatitis C.

Conclusion

By taking a broader view of the evidence, the Task Force can write new guidelines that will serve efforts to curb the hepatitis C epidemic, rather than frustrate them.

### Population-based screening of hepatitis C virus in the United States [^113pdoHQ]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarized the recent evidence on the performance of population-based hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening, published and indexed to PubMed, in the Unite States during the 2-year window from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2018.

Recent Findings

A majority of the selected articles in this review focused on the birth cohort 1945–1965 because of the HCV screening recommendations released after August 2012. However, the articles for the high-risk population applied to all ages because the recommendations for this specific population have remained largely unchanged since 1998. The reported rates of HCV screening varied substantially not only across the three different populations (i.e.g.eneral, underserved, and high-risk) but also within each population.

Summary

More vigilant monitoring of HCV screening performance of younger birth cohorts is needed as these individuals have been experiencing a higher incidence of HCV infection than those in the birth cohort 1945–1965. In addition, to meet the goal of eliminating HCV infection as a US public health problem by 2030, significant improvement in more accurately and comprehensively reporting the trends in population-based HCV screening across different populations is warranted in the future.

### Improving adherence to hepatitis C screening guidelines [^114u7ZC2]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

HCV is an RNA virus which can cause chronic infection leading to hepatic cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure requiring transplantation — yet the vast majority of patients are asymptomatic following acute infection. The CDC estimates that 2.7–3.9 million Americans are living with HCV infection, with 45%–85% unaware they were ever infected. Traditionally, HCV screening targeted only those patients with documented risk factors for HCV infection, yet data from the National Hepatitis Screening Survey show that targeted screening misses 31%–47% of cases of HCV in the USA. Screening has become particularly important with the advent of highly effective direct-acting antiviral agents, which can prevent development of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma or need for transplantation.

Epidemiologists identified a particular birth cohort, those born between 1945 and 1965, which carries the majority of the HCV burden in the USA with 67% of all cases. As a result, both the CDC and USPSTF recommend HCV screening for all those born between 1945 and 1965, in addition to those at increased risk based on traditional risk factors. Screening consists of an initial HCV antibody test followed by confirmatory PCR if positive. The release of the updated CDC and USPSTF guidelines on HCV screening presented an opportunity to evaluate the adoption of new guidelines within an academic primary care clinic.

### Primary care perspectives on hepatitis C virus screening, diagnosis and linking patients to appropriate care [^113fXnp5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Enormous progress has been made in recent years toward effectively treating and curing patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). However, at least half of the possible 7 million individuals infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the US remain undiagnosed. The formidable task of increasing the number of patients diagnosed, and subsequently linked to appropriate care has fallen to primary care clinicians, who are mandated by some US States to offer screening to individuals born between 1945 and 1965 (the Baby Boomer Generation). This peer-reviewed video roundtable discussion http://hepcresource.amjmed.com/Content/jplayer/video_roundtable.html#video0 addresses the challenges encountered by primary care clinicians faced with the increasing societal need to screen for HCV, make appropriate diagnoses, and subsequently link infected patients to appropriate care. Discussion in this roundtable initially focuses on the offering of HCV screening to patients in primary care settings. Roundtable participants discuss the need for primary care clinicians to ask appropriate risk factor-based questions of their patients, especially if the ongoing HCV epidemic is to be curtailed. The participants note, however, that the majority of patients currently infected with HCV in the US are Baby Boomers, and USPTF guidelines require this population to be tested for HCV regardless of any past risk-taking behaviors. So while asking the right questions is important, the failure of a Baby Boomer to recall risk-taking behavior does not preclude HCV screening. In fact, clinicians should proactively screen all persons in this birth cohort, and be more sensitive and open to screening requests from these individuals. Roundtable participants also discuss how HCV screening results should be communicated to patients, and how physicians can keep patients engaged and not lost to follow-up after an initial positive HCV antibody test. Patients screened and found to be HCV antibody positive require a follow-up HCV RNA test, and every effort must be made to overcome the challenge of losing patients between these two steps. Good communication between the physician, the physician's office staff, and the patient is necessary. In addition, point-of-care tests and PCR reflex testing can alleviate the need for HCV antibody positive patients to arrange subsequent office visits to undergo confirmatory HCV RNA testing. Physician and patient perspectives are presented throughout this roundtable discussion to obtain a complete picture of the management barriers encountered prior to initiation of therapy. Physician perspectives are provided by Edward Lebovics, the Upham Professor of Gastroenterology and Director of the Sarah C. Upham Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatobiliary Diseases at New York Medical College and Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla, New York, and Richard Torres, Chief Medical Officer at Optimus Health Care and an Associate Professor of Medicine at Yale School of Medicine. Torres has been a primary care provider for 29 years, working at the largest federally qualified community health center in Southwestern CT, which provides over 240,000 patient visits annually primarily to populations that are underserved and suffering from healthcare disparities. Patient perspectives in this roundtable are provided by Lucinda K. Porter, RN, who is the author of two books for hepatitis C patients, and is a former hepatology nurse and hepatitis C patient. She has been advocating for others since 1997, and writes for the HCV Advocate. Lucinda is a contributing editor of HEP magazine, and she blogs at www. LucindaPorterRN.com. The overall goal of this video roundtable discussion is to demonstrate that when provided with appropriate clinical knowledge, and aided by supportive collaborations with appropriate specialists, primary care clinicians should be able to effectively screen, diagnose, and link patients with hepatitis C to appropriate care. While patients need to be educated on the possible outcomes of a positive HCV antibody test, the significance of a positive HCV RNA test, and how to prevent further transmission, they should also be assured that currently available therapies have dramatically increased the chances of being cured. Appropriate education and the availability of excellent treatment options will hopefully quell fears and increase the morale of patients as they navigate the process of HCV screening and diagnosis.

### Cost-effectiveness of universal and targeted hepatitis C virus screening in the United States [^115YC2He]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The exact number of individuals in the US who are currently infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) (presence of HCV RNA) is unknown, but it is estimated to be more than 2 million people and as many as 3.5 million people. Most individuals with HCV infection (approximately 75%) are not aware of their infection because few symptoms are evident in the early stages of the disease. However, 70% to 85% of acute HCV infections become a chronic disease. Chronic HCV infection is the primary reason for liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and the leading cause of liver transplantation.HCV causes nearly 40% of all chronic liver disease and is among the most common indications for liver transplantation in the US. From 2003 to 2014, 20 782 adults with chronic HCV underwent liver transplantation.HCV infection accounted for approximately 18 000 deaths in the US in 2016, and HCV infection–related mortality exceeds all other deaths from infectious diseases combined.

Most people with HCV in the United States are individuals born between 1946 and 1964 (ie, the Baby Boomers). However, due to the slow progression of hepatitis C disease, the disease may remain undiagnosed for decades. Infection rates among persons who inject drugs (PWID) range from 30% to 90%, depending on frequency and duration of use, and account for approximately 60% of all HCV cases in the US. In 2011, the number of adults and adolescents (US population aged 13 years or older) who had injected drugs in their lifetime was reported to be approximately 6.6 million people. Therefore, while rates of HCV are higher among an older population, the US opioid epidemic has led to an evolving epidemiology of HCV. Sharing needles among PWID is a key risk factor for HCV transmission in US prisons and jails. Inmates in correctional institutions account for up to one-third of all US hepatitis C cases. Compared with a 1% infection rate for the general US population, HCV infection rates are particularly high in correctional institutions and range from 17.4% to 23.1%. One in 10 million people who pass through correctional settings each year have an undiagnosed HCV infection; more than 90% of these individuals are released to the general population. Throughout, these individuals may have little contact with the health care system, and as a result play a prominent role in the spread of HCV in US communities.

### Screening recommendations for hepatitis B virus infection [^113Fh9x1]. JAMA Dermatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the screening guidelines for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection for asymptomatic, nonpregnant adolescents and adults in the United States?

Bottom Line

Patients with a high risk of infection, such as those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), who use injection drugs, or who live in a household where someone is infected with HBV; men who have sex with men; or patients who come from countries with a high prevalence of HBV infection, should be screened.

### Strategies to manage hepatitis C virus infection disease burden-volume 3 [^116iPzCE]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2015). Low credibility.

The hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic was forecasted through 2030 for 15 countries in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, and the relative impact of two scenarios was considered: increased treatment efficacy while holding the annual number of treated patients constant and increased treatment efficacy and an increased annual number of treated patients. Increasing levels of diagnosis and treatment, in combination with improved treatment efficacy, were critical for achieving substantial reductions in disease burden. A 90% reduction in total HCV infections within 15 years is feasible in most countries studied, but it required a coordinated effort to introduce harm reduction programmes to reduce new infections, screening to identify those already infected and treatment with high cure rate therapies. This suggests that increased capacity for screening and treatment will be critical in many countries. Birth cohort screening is a helpful tool for maximizing resources. Among European countries, the majority of patients were born between 1940 and 1985. A wider range of birth cohorts was seen in the Middle East and Asia (between 1925 and 1995).

### Updated operational guidance for implementing CDC's recommendations on testing for hepatitis C virus infection [^114jhip3]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Complete and accurate testing is the first step in identifying persons with current HCV infection to ensure linkage to care and initiation of curative antiviral therapy. Operational strategy 1 should no longer be used because it can lead to incomplete HCV testing and gaps in the HCV care cascade. Health care facilities and laboratories should update practices to ensure operational strategy 1 is no longer used. Using a single visit to conduct both steps of the HCV testing sequence will increase complete diagnosis of current HCV infection, which will increase the percentage of patients with current HCV infection who are linked to care and receive curative antiviral therapy.

### Screening for hepatitis C virus infection in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112Ww8Kg]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemiology — US burden and trends: HCV is the most common chronic blood-borne pathogen in the US and a leading cause of complications from chronic liver disease, and infection is associated with more deaths than the top 60 other reportable infectious diseases combined, including HIV; the most important risk factor for HCV infection is past or current injection drug use. In the US, an estimated 4.1 million persons have past or current HCV infection, approximately 2.4 million have current infections, and the estimated prevalence of chronic HCV infection is approximately 1% (2013 to 2016). An estimated 44 700 new HCV infections occurred in 2017, and cases of acute HCV infection have increased approximately 3.8-fold over the last decade, with the most rapid increase in young adults aged 20 to 39 years who inject drugs; increases have occurred in both sexes but are more pronounced in men, with rates increased especially in American Indian/Alaskan Native and non-Hispanic white populations.

### Cost-effectiveness of screening for chronic hepatitis C infection in the United States [^115ZJUyM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common chronic blood-borne infection in the United States and will become an increasing source of morbidity and mortality with aging of the infected population. Our objective was to develop decision analytic models to explore the cost-effectiveness of screening in populations with varying prevalence of HCV and risks for fibrosis progression.

Methods

We developed a Markov state transition model to examine screening of an asymptomatic community-based population in the United States. The base case was an ethnically and gender-mixed adult population with no prior knowledge of HCV status. Interventions were screening followed by guideline-based treatment, or no screening. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs were measured in 2011 US dollars.

Results

In the base case (US population, 49% male, 78% white, 13% African American, and 9% Hispanic, mean age, 46 years), screening followed by guideline-based treatment (using boceprevir as the direct-acting antiviral agent) of those with chronic HCV infection costs $47 276 per QALY. The overall HCV prevalence in the United States is reported to be 1.3%-1.9%, but prevalence varies markedly among patients with different numbers and types of risk factors. The marginal cost-effectiveness ratio (mCER) of screening decreases as prevalence increases. Below a prevalence of 0.84%, the mCER is greater than the generally accepted societal willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per QALY and thus is not considered highly cost-effective.

Conclusions

Targeted screening is cost-effective when prevalence of HCV exceeds 0.84%. Prospective evaluation of a screening tool is warranted and should include comparisons with other screening strategies.

### Cost effectiveness of an intervention to increase uptake of hepatitis C virus testing and treatment (hepCATT): cluster randomised controlled trial in primary care [^116Rsk78]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of a complex intervention in primary care that aims to increase uptake of hepatitis C virus (HCV) case finding and treatment.

Design

Pragmatic, two armed, practice level, cluster randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation.

Setting and participants

45 general practices in South West England (22 randomised to intervention and 23 to control arm). Outcome data were collected from all intervention practices and 21/23 control practices. Total number of flagged patients was 24 473 (about 5% of practice list).

Intervention

Electronic algorithm and flag on practice systems identifying patients with HCV risk markers (such as history of opioid dependence or HCV tests with no evidence of referral to hepatology), staff educational training in HCV, and practice posters/leaflets to increase patients' awareness. Flagged patients were invited by letter for an HCV test (with one follow-up) and had on-screen pop-ups to encourage opportunistic testing. The intervention lasted one year, with practices recruited April to December 2016.

Main outcome measures

Primary outcome: uptake of HCV testing. Secondary outcomes: number of positive HCV tests and yield (proportion HCV positive); HCV treatment assessment at hepatology; cost effectiveness.

Results

Baseline HCV testing of flagged patients (six months before study start) was 608/13 097 (4.6%) in intervention practices and 380/11 376 (3.3%) in control practices. During the study 2071 (16%) of flagged patients in the intervention practices and 1163 (10%) in control practices were tested for HCV: overall intervention effect as an adjusted rate ratio of 1.59 (95% confidence interval 1.21 to 2.08; P < 0.001). HCV antibodies were detected in 129 patients from intervention practices and 51 patients from control practices (adjusted rate ratio 2.24, 1.47 to 3.42) with weak evidence of an increase in yield (6.2% v 4.4%; adjusted risk ratio 1.40, 0.99 to 1.95). Referral and assessment increased in intervention practices compared with control practices (adjusted rate ratio 5.78, 1.6 to 21.6) with a risk difference of 1.3 per 1000 and a "number needed to help" of one extra HCV diagnosis, referral, and assessment per 792 (95% confidence interval 558 to 1883) patients flagged. The average cost of HCV case finding was £4.03 (95% confidence interval £2.27 to £5.80) per at risk patient and £3165 per additional patient assessed at hepatology. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was £5783 per quality adjusted life year (QALY), with 93.3% probability of being below £20 000 per QALY.

Conclusion

HepCATT had a modest impact but is a low cost intervention that merits optimisation and implementation as part of an NHS strategy to increase HCV testing and treatment.

### CDC recommendations for hepatitis C screening among adults-United States, 2020 [^112zEveA]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Cost-Effectiveness Considerations

Certain recent economic analyses provide information on the cost-effectiveness of hepatitis C screening. One analysis determined universal screening for persons aged ≥ 18 years, using a health care perspective, and yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $11,378 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained when compared with 1945–1965 birth cohort screening, using a base case hepatitis C prevalence of 2.6% and 0.29% for birth cohort members and nonbirth cohort members, respectively. ICER remained below $50,000 per QALY gained, a threshold sometimes considered as a cut-off for determining cost-effectiveness, until the anti-HCV positivity prevalence dropped below 0.07% among nonbirth cohort members. Another analysis calculated an ICER of $28,000/QALY gained under a health care perspective for a strategy of screening all persons aged ≥ 18 years compared with birth cohort screening, with an additional 280,000 cures and 4,400 fewer cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. When the national hepatitis C prevalence was halved from the base case of 0.84%, ICER increased to $39,400. ICER remained below $100,000 per QALY gained when varying key parameters across broad ranges (e.g. when there was no improvement in quality of life and costs decreased following early-stage cure, when cost of early-stage disease was $0, when treatment costs varied, and when there was no mortality benefit from SVR). A third analysis reported an ICER of $7,900/QALY gained for one-time general population hepatitis C screening of persons aged 20–69 years compared with risk-based screening using a societal perspective and a base case hepatitis C prevalence of 1.6%. ICER was $5,400/QALY gained for screening persons born during 1945–1965 compared with risk-based screening with a hepatitis C prevalence of 3.3% for persons in the birth cohort. Birth cohort screening dominated general population screening, although the model also included treatment with ribavirin and pegylated interferon; protease inhibitor therapy was modeled for treatment naïve genotype 1 patients at costs ranging from $61,773–$88,248. Studies using higher treatment costs would be expected to calculate ICERs higher than those with lower treatment costs. Several other studies provide similar cost effectiveness estimates of a universal screening strategy for adults, with ICERs ranging from cost saving to $71,000/QALY gained.

### The cost-effectiveness of birth-cohort screening for hepatitis C antibody in U.S. primary care settings [^116XiT7B]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In the United States, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is most prevalent among adults born from 1945 through 1965, and approximately 50% to 75% of infected adults are unaware of their infection.

Objective

To estimate the cost-effectiveness of birth-cohort screening.

Design

Cost-effectiveness simulation.

Data Sources

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, U.S. Census, Medicare reimbursement schedule, and published sources.

Target Population

Adults born from 1945 through 1965 with 1 or more visits to a primary care provider annually.

Time Horizon

Lifetime.

Perspective

Societal, health care.

Intervention

One-time antibody test of 1945–1965 birth cohort.

Outcome Measures

Numbers of cases that were identified and treated and that achieved a sustained viral response; liver disease and death from HCV; medical and productivity costs; quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs); incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).

Results Of Base-Case Analysis

Compared with the status quo, birth-cohort screening identified 808,580 additional cases of chronic HCV infection at a screening cost of $2874 per case identified. Assuming that birth-cohort screening was followed by pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PEG-IFN+R) for treated patients, screening increased QALYs by 348,800 and costs by $5.5 billion, for an ICER of $15,700 per QALY gained. Assuming that birth-cohort screening was followed by direct-acting antiviral plus PEG-IFN+R treatment for treated patients, screening increased QALYs by 532,200 and costs by $19.0 billion, for an ICER of $35,700 per QALY saved.

Results Of Sensitivity Analysis

The ICER of birth-cohort screening was most sensitive to sustained viral response of antiviral therapy, the cost of therapy, the discount rate, and the QALY losses assigned to disease states.

Limitation

Empirical data on screening and direct-acting antiviral treatment in real-world clinical settings are scarce.

Conclusion

Birth-cohort screening for HCV in primary care settings was cost-effective.
