## Question

Draft a plan for ureteroscopy for a left UPJ stone, including discussion of risk and expectation for a ureteral stent.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to draft a step-by-step plan for ureteroscopy of a left ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) stone, including a clear discussion of risks and expectations for a ureteral stent. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about preoperative confirmation of diagnosis and anatomic/functional assessment. Then, I should plan the intraoperative strategy, including access, lithotripsy approach, and injury prevention. Next, I need to construct a decision framework for stent placement and duration. After that, I should review stent-related symptoms, mitigation strategies, and removal logistics. Finally, I must outline risk disclosure, postoperative imaging and follow-up, and documentation elements that affect informed consent and shared decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and anatomy; for a left UPJ stone, I need to verify stone size, exact UPJ location, and degree of hydronephrosis on a non-contrast CT, and I should check renal function with serum creatinine/eGFR to stratify risk and anticipate stent needs if there is renal insufficiency or solitary kidney, since these influence perioperative planning and postoperative drainage decisions [^112tt3gH]. Wait, let me verify functional obstruction too; if preoperative imaging or symptoms suggest concurrent UPJ obstruction, a diuretic renogram is appropriate to assess drainage and guide whether simple ureteroscopy is sufficient or whether adjunctive UPJ management will be necessary now or staged later [^114HVPuw].

> I should now identify high-risk features that will shape both intraoperative caution and postoperative stenting thresholds; solitary kidney, preexisting renal insufficiency, larger or impacted UPJ stones, significant preoperative hydronephrosis, and the need for ureteral dilation or prolonged operative time all increase the risk of edema, obstruction, or injury — and thus heighten the likelihood that a stent will be indicated [^112tt3gH] [^113E4gfA] [^114x7juE]. Hold on, I should also confirm bleeding risk and anticoagulation status; if continuous anticoagulation cannot be interrupted, ureteroscopy remains a first-line option, but I need to individualize stent use given higher bleeding and edema risk in such contexts [^114TfmUt].

> Next, I will counsel on procedure selection; for a proximal ureteral or UPJ stone, ureteroscopy generally achieves a higher single-procedure stone-free rate than shock wave lithotripsy, though with somewhat higher complication rates, so in most patients URS is a reasonable first-line choice after discussing trade-offs and patient preferences, anesthesia expectations, and the possibility of adjunctive stenting [^115ioCYk]. I need to ensure the patient understands that in specific populations — such as those with severe obesity or when antithrombotic therapy must be continued — flexible ureteroscopy is favored given access and safety considerations, while acknowledging that SWL may still be appropriate for selected small stones depending on goals and local expertise [^111DKj4c] [^114HuFnn].

> For the intraoperative approach, I will use a flexible ureteroscope to traverse the ureter and UPJ, aiming for direct visualization and controlled lithotripsy of the left UPJ stone; when feasible, I should also consider ultrasound guidance to limit radiation without sacrificing efficacy, particularly if fluoroscopy would otherwise be extensive [^11315YL8] [^112f1Dpr]. Let me think about access; a 12/14 Fr ureteral access sheath can facilitate repeated scope passage and lower intrarenal pressures during flexible URS, which may be advantageous for efficiency and safety, but — wait, I initially thought a UAS automatically requires a postoperative stent; I should correct that — UAS placement increases the threshold for stenting because of ureteral manipulation or dilation, yet stenting after UAS is not universally mandatory and should still be individualized based on observed ureteral trauma, edema, and procedural complexity [^112tt3gH] [^111VYmsi]. For lithotripsy, holmium:YAG settings should be tailored to stone hardness and desired fragmentation strategy, and if available, intraoperative digital fragment measurement can help decide whether to extract fragments or allow spontaneous passage [^112tt3gH] [^112b8Gdc].

> I will now examine risk mitigation; mechanically, I need to minimize insertion force, maintain coaxial instrument alignment, and avoid excessive torque to reduce the risks of mucosal injury or avulsion, and thermally, I should keep the laser fiber on stone surface and maintain irrigation to avoid ureteral wall burns that predispose to stricture [^111kArWH]. But wait, what if I encounter a perforation or deep mucosal injury; I should terminate further manipulation, place a stent to ensure drainage and healing, and tailor stent dwell toward the higher end of the range when injury is significant, aligning with AUA urotrauma guidance that emphasizes stenting and/or percutaneous nephrostomy for endoscopic ureteral injuries [^113E4gfA] [^116cURWP].

> Now I need a clear decision algorithm for postoperative stenting; I should confirm that stenting is mandatory when there is an intraoperative ureteral injury, solitary kidney, preexisting renal insufficiency, or a large residual fragment burden that risks obstruction, and in these settings longer dwell times are often appropriate to secure drainage and healing [^112tt3gH] [^113E4gfA]. Hold on, I should verify special UPJ contexts; if a concurrent UPJ obstruction is treated or suspected, a longer dwell, often about 4 weeks after UPJ repair, is customary, whereas without formal UPJ repair, duration should still reflect the degree of edema and manipulation at the UPJ [^112kyTaT] [^113pA2so]. I also need to consider strong but contextual indications such as ureteral or UPJ dilation, impacted stones, marked preoperative hydronephrosis, or prolonged operative time, all of which nudge toward a stent for 1–2 weeks to mitigate edema-related obstruction [^112tt3gH] [^113E4gfA] [^113pA2so].

> For uncomplicated cases, I should double-check whether stent omission is acceptable; in small, non-impacted proximal stones treated atraumatically with short operative times and no dilation, stent omission can be reasonable with informed consent, though I must counsel that some data suggest a modest increase in unplanned visits without a stent, while other trials and reviews show similar complication rates overall and fewer irritative symptoms when stents are omitted [^113yWEWz] [^115WvfNM] [^113NPCLy] [^113faXKm]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; in proximal/UPJ stones specifically, a recent randomized trial showed higher short-term pain and irritative symptoms with stents but no difference in emergency visits, so the choice should be individualized and documented, with a low threshold to stent if any trauma, edema, or questionable drainage is observed [^113yWEWz].

> Next, I should review stent expectations and symptom mitigation; patients should be counseled about common stent-related symptoms such as urinary urgency, frequency, dysuria, hematuria, and flank pain with voiding due to reflux, which can transiently impair quality of life, and I need to prepare strategies to minimize these effects [^1159iAZT]. Let me verify pharmacologic mitigation; alpha-blockers such as tamsulosin and antimuscarinics such as solifenacin can have a synergistic effect for irritative symptoms, while NSAIDs are effective for stent-related pain and around stent removal episodes, and these measures should be discussed up front [^114wob3M].

> I should now plan stent duration; for straightforward cases without injury or dilation, shorter durations around 3–7 days are often reasonable in AUA-informed practice, whereas EAU-oriented protocols often aim for 7–14 days depending on complexity and symptoms, and when ureteral injury or UPJ repair is present, 4–6 weeks is typical to support healing — though I need to emphasize that consensus is variable and should be individualized [^113pA2so] [^112kyTaT]. Let me reconsider complication trade-offs by dwell time; current meta-analyses show no significant difference in overall post-procedure-related events between shorter and longer dwell times, but shorter dwell may see more flank pain and hematuria, whereas longer dwell may see more fever and dysuria, underscoring the need to tailor to the clinical scenario and patient tolerance [^111PWunk] [^113pA2so].

> For stent removal logistics, I need to ensure a pragmatic and comfortable plan; routine cystoscopic removal under topical anesthesia is standard, with flexible cystoscopy offering good tolerability and efficiency in many settings, and string-attached stents can be considered for highly motivated, low-risk patients to facilitate office removal without another anesthetic, provided the patient understands precautions [^1157LB39] [^114wob3M]. Hold on, I should verify cost and access considerations; when flexible cystoscopy is not available, rigid ureteroscopic removal under topical anesthesia remains a safe alternative in experienced hands, though patient comfort and urethral caliber should be considered [^1157LB39].

> Before proceeding, I will disclose and document risks; intraoperative complications include mucosal injury, perforation, rare avulsion, and infection or sepsis, with ureteral injury risks rising with impacted stones, dilation, or prolonged time, and these events often necessitate stenting and sometimes secondary interventions, which must be anticipated in consent [^111kArWH] [^113E4gfA] [^112tt3gH]. I should confirm longer-term risks too; ureteral stricture after URS is uncommon overall but more likely after impacted stones or perforation, and patients should understand residual fragment risks that may prompt a secondary procedure despite optimal intraoperative management [^113E4gfA].

> For postoperative care and imaging follow-up, I will arrange analgesia, hydrate, and counsel on activity as tolerated, with clear return precautions for fever, uncontrolled pain, and urinary retention; importantly, I should schedule imaging at about 4 weeks to assess stone-free status and drainage because real-world data show that postoperative imaging alters management in roughly a third of patients, including unplanned second procedures in about 10 percent, particularly when preoperative hydronephrosis was present [^117FKJ94]. Let me double-check surveillance intensity; a selective imaging strategy is reasonable — closer surveillance after complicated URS or if there was an impacted stone, perforation, or dilation, potentially with functional testing such as MAG-3 renography at 3 months to exclude obstruction if intraoperative concerns existed [^113E4gfA].

> In consent and documentation, I need to explicitly capture the rationale for URS over alternatives, the stent decision and expected duration, counseling on stent symptoms and mitigation strategies, the possibility of unplanned visits even with a stent, and the follow-up imaging plan with contingency for additional interventions if residual fragments or obstruction are identified [^117FKJ94]. I should also inform patients that if small, asymptomatic renal stones are encountered during URS for the UPJ stone, concurrent removal may reduce long-term relapse events and emergency visits, though it can extend operative time modestly, and this possibility should be discussed preoperatively to align expectations [^113xz5h6].

> Finally, let me ensure internal consistency; preoperative assessment clarifies anatomy and function, intraoperative technique minimizes injury and optimizes stone clearance, stent decisions are individualized based on injury, risk, and edema, durations are tailored to healing needs and symptoms, and follow-up imaging is planned to catch residual disease early so we can intervene promptly if needed, all grounded in current AUA and EAU guidance and contemporary evidence [^117Lh2jo].

Ureteroscopy for a left UPJ stone is minimally invasive with **high stone-free rates** [^117Lh2jo], but it carries risks of ureteral injury [^111kArWH], bleeding, infection, and a need for secondary procedures [^115ioCYk]. Ureteral stents are commonly placed postoperatively to prevent obstruction and facilitate healing [^114x7juE], but they **can cause discomfort** and urinary symptoms [^113faXKm], and they require removal [^113QYLBN]. Stent placement is indicated for ureteral injury [^116cURWP], significant edema, a large stone burden, a solitary kidney, or renal insufficiency [^114x7juE]; when placed, stents are typically left for 1–2 weeks [^111PWunk] [^113pA2so]. Patients should be counseled on stent-related symptoms [^113QYLBN] and the need for follow-up imaging to confirm stone clearance and ureteral patency [^117FKJ94] [^113E4gfA].

---

## Preoperative evaluation and preparation

Preoperative assessment includes imaging with **non-contrast CT** to confirm stone size, location, and anatomy; diuretic renography is considered if UPJ obstruction is suspected [^114HVPuw]. Laboratory evaluation should include CBC, renal function, coagulation profile, and urine culture. Patients must be counseled on the procedure, risks, benefits, alternatives, and potential stent-related symptoms. General anesthesia is **standard** [^115pYg1L].

---

## Intraoperative technique

- **Patient positioning**: Lithotomy position.

- **Ureteral access**: Cystoscopic insertion of a guidewire into the renal pelvis.

- **Ureteroscopy**: Advance a flexible ureteroscope to the UPJ under direct visualization [^114exjbU].

- **Stone fragmentation**: Use holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy to fragment the stone [^112tt3gH].

- **Stone extraction**: Remove fragments with a basket or allow spontaneous passage.

- **Ureteral stent placement**: Place a double-J stent if indicated (see below) [^113NPCLy].

---

## Indications for ureteral stent placement

- **Ureteral injury**: Mucosal injury, perforation, or avulsion [^116cURWP].

- **Significant edema**: Ureteral swelling causing obstruction [^114x7juE].

- **Large stone burden**: Multiple or large fragments [^114x7juE].

- **Solitary kidney or renal insufficiency**: To ensure drainage [^114x7juE].

- **Prolonged operative time**: Increased risk of edema or injury [^114x7juE].

---

## Risks and complications of ureteroscopy

- **Ureteral injury**: Mucosal injury, perforation, or avulsion [^111kArWH].

- **Bleeding**: Hematuria or rare significant bleeding [^117Lh2jo].

- **Infection**: UTI or sepsis [^111EFo8j].

- **Residual fragments**: May require secondary procedures [^115ioCYk].

- **Anesthesia-related risks**: Standard surgical risks.

## Risks and complications of ureteral stent placement

Stent-related symptoms, such as pain, dysuria, frequency, urgency, and hematuria, are **common** [^113QYLBN] [^1159iAZT]. Infectious complications include UTI or bacteriuria [^113tUdWb]. Device-related issues, such as migration or encrustation, may necessitate additional procedures [^111VYmsi]. A forgotten stent can cause **significant morbidity** if not removed promptly [^1118PveB].

---

## Postoperative care and follow-up

Postoperative management includes pain control; NSAIDs and optional alpha-blockers can help with stent-related symptoms [^114wob3M]. Antibiotics are prescribed as a short course only when indicated. If a stent is placed, **removal typically occurs 1–2 weeks** postoperatively [^111PWunk] [^113pA2so]. Follow-up imaging with ultrasound or CT is obtained to confirm stone clearance and ureteral patency [^113E4gfA] [^117FKJ94].

---

## Patient expectations

Patients can expect high success, with **stone-free rates exceeding 90%** [^112tt3gH] [^117Lh2jo] [^111EFo8j]. Stent-related urinary symptoms are common but temporary [^113faXKm]. Secondary procedures may be needed if residual fragments remain [^113xz5h6]. Recovery is typically **rapid**, with return to normal activities within a few days [^112f1Dpr].

---

Ureteroscopy for a left UPJ stone is **effective and safe** [^117Lh2jo]. Stents help prevent obstruction and aid healing [^114x7juE], and patients should be informed about stent symptoms [^113QYLBN] and the need for follow-up [^117FKJ94].

### Iatrogenic upper urinary tract injuries during ureteroscopy for urolithiasis: A comprehensive review on incidence, mechanisms and preventative strategies [^111kArWH]. Nature Reviews Urology (2025). Low credibility.

The incidence of urolithiasis is increasing globally, with a prevalence of 13% in North America and 9% in Europe. Ureteroscopy is a minimally invasive approach for treating conditions affecting the upper urinary tract, including urolithiasis, for which its efficacy and safety are well recognized. However, there is a risk of complications associated with ureteroscopy, including iatrogenic mechanical ureteric injuries.

These injuries are multifactorial in nature, with ureteroscopes and auxiliary endoscopic equipment having an important role, in addition to patient and stone factors. Excessive friction and insertion forces during ureteroscope and ureteric access sheath insertion, apparatus malfunction, or thermal injuries during laser lithotripsy might cause injury to the upper urinary tract. Ureteric avulsion is a serious event, which necessitates further intervention, such as ureteric reimplantation or nephrectomy.

Ureteric mucosal injuries can be managed with a period of ureteric stenting, although stent-related symptoms can be challenging for patients. The ability of endoscopic equipment to injure the ureter is an area that requires further study to reduce incidence and minimize patient morbidity. In this article, we review the operative mechanisms that contribute to iatrogenic mechanical ureteric injuries and discuss preventative strategies.

### Efficacy and safety of Ho:YAG laser lithotripsy for ureteroscopic removal of proximal and distal ureteral calculi [^112tt3gH]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Routine postoperative ureteral stenting after ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy remains a topic of debate. Stent-related morbidities, such as bladder irritation and mild back discomfort during urination, can negatively impact postoperative quality of life. Conversely, ureteral stenting can help prevent postoperative urinary sepsis by avoiding sudden ureteral obstruction caused by calculus fragments, blood clots, or ureteral mucosal edema. Clear indications for stenting include ureteral injury/stricture, solitary kidney, renal insufficiency, or a large residual stone burden.

Several prospective randomized controlled trials comparing non-stented versus stented ureteroscopic lithotripsy reported the same result. Ureteral stenting after uncomplicated ureteric procedures is not routine at our institution. However, a transient ureteral stent is placed in all patients who have ureteral dilatation through the insertion of an access sheath or present with large and/or impacted calculi, irrespective of location. This practice explains the high postoperative stenting rates (87.7% vs. 83.8%, respectively).

Ureteroscopic removal and laser lithotripsy have proven safe even in cases where shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) is likely to fail or is contraindicated. Major complications are uncommon during these procedures. Minor intraoperative or postoperative complications occur in a range from 0 to 13% and consist primarily of pain or urinary tract infection. Ho:YAG laser-related complications are as low as 1%. There were no major complications observed in this series. Further, there was…

### Quality of life impact and recovery after ureteroscopy and stent insertion: Insights from daily surveys in STENTS [^113QYLBN]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

All participants in the nested STENTS cohort were administered several questionnaires to assess pain, urinary symptoms, and how these symptoms impact their life, such as interference and bother. The questionnaires included:

- **The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) short form**: Widely used in pain studies, assessed pain intensity and pain interference.
- **Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS)**: Measured pain intensity and pain interference, allowing for comparison of scores to population norms.
- **The Urinary Score of the Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire (USSQ)**: Developed for a one-month recall period, assessed urinary symptoms and bother.
- **Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network Symptom Index (LURN SI-10)**: Assessed urinary symptoms and bother.

We intentionally administered questionnaires assessing the same construct to determine potential differences in the measured experience. Although the USSQ covers various domains besides urinary symptoms, our focus was on accurately characterizing pain intensity and pain interference, comparing to population norms, and our desire for a comprehensive body map that includes genitalia. After consultations with a multidisciplinary team, including experts in pain medicine, pain psychology, and psychometricians experienced in patient measure development, specific pain instruments widely used in the broader medical community were incorporated.

### Risks and benefits of postoperative double-J stent placement after ureteroscopy: Results from the Clinical Research Office of Endourological Society ureteroscopy global study [^114x7juE]. Journal of Endourology (2017). Low credibility.

Double-J stent placement after stone removal by ureteroscopy (URS) is common and recommended in many cases but debatable in others. In this study, the risks and benefits of postoperative double-J stent placement in URS stone treatment procedures undertaken in clinical practice are examined.

The Clinical Research Office of Endourological Society (CROES) URS is a prospective, observational, international multicenter study, in which patients are candidates for URS as primary treatment or after failure of prior treatment for ureteral and renal stones. Baseline, intraoperative, and postoperative data were collected. Predictors and outcomes of postoperative stent placement were analyzed by inverse probability-weighted regression adjustment of the relationship between a double-J stent placement and outcomes, including complications, readmission (including retreatment), and length of hospital stay.

Significant predictors of postoperative double-J stent placement in URS treatment of ureteral stones were intraoperative complications, impacted stones, operation time, stone burden, age, presence of a solitary kidney, and stone-free rate. In renal stone treatment, the predictors identified included operation time, age, preoperative stent placement, anticoagulant use, presence of a solitary kidney, and intraoperative complications. In both ureteral and renal stone treatment groups, postoperative placement of a double-J stent resulted in significantly fewer postoperative complications (p < 0.001) compared with patients who did not receive a stent.

### Imaging after ureteroscopy: Practice patterns, patient adherence and impact on subsequent management in an urban academic hospital system [^117FKJ94]. Urology (2023). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate practice patterns of post-ureteroscopy (URS) imaging, assess predictors of imaging order, type and completion, and analyze the impact on patient management.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of patients who underwent URS for nephrolithiasis at a single institution between May 2020 and May 2021. Patient demographic, clinical, and operative characteristics were reviewed, including surgeons' years in practice. Post-URS imaging studies conducted less than 6 months post-operative were reviewed. Changes in patient management were defined as the ordering of additional imaging tests or subsequent unplanned surgery. Patient, provider, and surgical variables were compared between those who had imaging ordered and those who did not.

- **Results**: A total of 289 patients underwent URS, with 234 (81.0%) having post-operative imaging ordered; 147 (62.8%) completed them. Baseline demographics, stone, and surgical variables were similar among those who did and did not have imaging ordered and among those who completed imaging and those who did not. Pre-operative hydronephrosis was associated with the ordering of post-operative imaging (OR = 4.08, P = 0.01). Urologists with less than 5 years of practice were more likely to order post-operative imaging compared to those with more than 5 years of experience (< 5: 90.6%, 15+: 53.7%; P < 0.001). Management changed for 52 of 147 (35.4%) patients who completed imaging; additional imaging was ordered for 38 patients (25.9%), and a second, unplanned surgery was performed for 14 (9.5%).

- **Conclusion**: The main predictive factor of ordering post-URS imaging was surgeons' years in practice.

### Optimal stenting duration following ureteroscopy and nephrolithotomy: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111PWunk]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed and reported in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement guidelines. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from inception to October 2023 for trials that compared varying stenting durations in individuals who had undergone either ureteroscopy or nephrolithotomy procedures.

Our search strategy was: ("stent duration" OR "stenting duration" OR stenting OR "stent dwell time") AND (ureteroscop* OR "ureteroscopic surgery" OR nephrolithotomy OR "percutaneous nephrolithotomy" OR PNL OR PCNL OR nephrolithiasis OR lithotripsy) AND ("unplanned visit" OR ED OR "ED visit" OR "clinic visit" OR "emergency department visit" OR "post-procedure related events" OR PRE OR PREs).

The references from all included studies, previous systematic reviews, and meta-analyses were also searched manually for any additional studies. The prospective meta-analysis protocol was registered on PROSPERO under protocol CRD42023465684.

- **Eligibility criteria for study selection**: We included: (1) Randomized trials (RCTs) or non-randomized cohorts (non-RCTs); (2) comparing the duration for which the ureteral stent was retained in each patient following ureteroscopy or nephrolithotomy procedures; (3) in adult patients (≥ 18 years old). In addition, studies were included only if they reported any of the clinical outcomes of interest.

### Ureteral stent versus no ureteral stent for ureteroscopy in the management of renal and ureteral calculi [^113NPCLy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Ureteroscopy combined with laser stone fragmentation and basketing is a common approach for managing renal and ureteral stones. This procedure is associated with some degree of ureteral trauma, which may lead to swelling, ureteral obstruction, and flank pain, potentially necessitating subsequent interventions such as hospital admission or secondary ureteral stent placement. To prevent such issues, urologists often place temporary ureteral stents prophylactically, but the value of doing so remains unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of postoperative ureteral stent placement after uncomplicated ureteroscopy.

- **Search methods**: We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science), trials registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings, up to 01 February 2019. We applied no restrictions on publication language or status.

- **Selection criteria**: We included trials in which researchers randomized participants undergoing uncomplicated ureteroscopy to placement of a ureteral stent versus no ureteral stent.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and rated the certainty of evidence (CoE) according to the GRADE approach.

- **Main results**: Stenting may slightly reduce the number of unplanned return visits (16 trials with 1970 participants; very low CoE), but we are very uncertain of this finding.

### Concomitant percutaneous nephrolithotomy and transperitoneal laparoscopic pyeloplasty for ureteropelvic junction obstruction complicated by stones [^112kyTaT]. Journal of Endourology (2008). Low credibility.

Ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction and stones can coexist. There is therapeutic controversy regarding their ideal management. We present our experience of combining percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) with laparoscopic pyeloplasty (LP) in patients with UPJ obstruction and multiple secondary calculi, either in the same session or a staged manner.

- **Patients and method**: From November 2006 to April 2008, ten patients underwent PNL with LP at our institution. Two of these patients had re-obstruction and stones after PNL and endopyelotomy. All patients had multiple calyceal and pelvic calculi (> 10) with sizes ranging from 3 to 24 mm. The mean age of patients was 33 years (range: 17–55). PNL was performed in a standard manner and was followed by laparoscopic pyeloplasty.

- **Result**: Complete stone clearance was achieved in all patients by PNL. The procedure was staged in two cases due to the presence of infected hydronephrosis. Nine patients underwent dismembered pyeloplasty, and in one, Fengerplasty was performed. Reduction of a baggy pelvis was required in three cases. Mean operative time was 3.9 hours (range: 3–5). Postoperatively, the nephrostomy was kept for an average of 2 days (range: 1–3), and the drain was removed after an average of 3.5 days (range: 3–5). Mean hospital stay was 5.2 days (range: 5–7). None of the patients required a blood transfusion. The stent was removed after four weeks. At six months, patients were stone-free on ultrasound and showed good drainage on a renal scan. One-year follow-up is available for five patients, which shows a stone-free status and good drainage across the UPJ.

- **Conclusion**: Concomitant PNL and laparoscopic pyeloplasty are feasible and effective for managing UPJ obstruction complicated by stones.

### Optimal stenting duration following ureteroscopy and nephrolithotomy: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113pA2so]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

In this meta-analysis, we focused on PREs rate and a spectrum of complications such as flank pain, hematuria, fever, LUTS, dysuria, and abdominal pain. It was noteworthy that the differences in PREs rate across varying stent durations were not statistically significant, as well as LUTS and abdominal pain. Conversely, shorter stent durations correlated with an elevated incidence of flank pain and more frequent hematuria. In contrast, patients with longer stent placements experienced higher rates of fever and dysuria.

The elucidation of this meta-analysis poses substantial clinical connotations, given the established protocols by esteemed entities like the International Alliance of Urolithiasis (IAU), the EAU, and the AUA. The discourse on the ideal stent duration post-ureteroscopy is multifaceted and contentious, primarily due to the variable recommendations posited by these authorities. The IAU has not yet provided definitive directives on stent duration, thus necessitating individualized patient assessment. EAU, for instance, suggests stent durations around 7–14 days based on procedural complexity and postoperative complications. Nevertheless, AUA guidelines recommend considering factors such as stone burden and the presence of edema or injury during surgery, with a suggestion of shorter durations for stent placements, generally between 3 and 7 days, based on a balance of minimizing complications and ensuring healing. This variation underscores the imperative for an exhaustive, systematic evaluation to forge robust, evidence-backed guidelines.

### Outcomes of stenting after uncomplicated ureteroscopy: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1173UXqU]. BMJ (2007). Low credibility.

To investigate the potential beneficial and adverse effects of routine ureteric stent placement after ureteroscopy, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted. The data sources included the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2006 issue 2), Embase, and Medline (1966 to 31 March 2006), without language restrictions.

All randomized controlled trials that reported various outcomes with or without stenting after ureteroscopy were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed quality. Meta-analyses used both fixed and random effects models, with dichotomous data reported as relative risk and continuous data as a weighted mean difference with 95% confidence intervals.

Nine randomized controlled trials, reporting on 831 participants, were identified. The incidence of lower urinary tract symptoms was significantly higher in participants who had a stent inserted (relative risk 2.25, 95% confidence interval 1.14 to 4.43, for dysuria; 2.00, 1.11 to 3.62, for frequency or urgency) after ureteroscopy. There was no significant difference in postoperative requirement for analgesia, urinary tract infections, stone-free rate, and ureteric strictures between the two groups. Due to marked heterogeneity, formal pooling of data was not possible for some outcomes such as flank pain. A pooled analysis showed a reduced likelihood of unplanned medical visits or admission to hospital in the group with stents (0.53, 0.17 to 1.60), although this difference was not significant. None of the trials reported on health-related quality of life outcomes.

From the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to investigate and compare the outcomes of ureteroscopy and serial D-J stenting therapy for pregnant females with urolithiasis. To determine the efficacy and safety of the two treatments, we analyzed the available information in as much detail as possible. This meta‑analysis featured 25 studies with a total of 920 cases of urolithiasis during pregnancy.

This meta‑analysis contained studies selected from several countries. Most studies originated from Asia (15 studies), followed by Africa (four studies), Europe (three studies), and America, including North and South America (three studies). Thus, this review represents a population of different ethnicities.

Our analysis showed that operative success rates were almost the same for internal ureteral stents and URS (97% vs. 99%, P = 0.280). Internal ureteral stents were associated with more complications than URS (45% vs. 1%, P < 0.001). However, most complications were minor or could be adequately managed (serious complication rates were < 1% in the two groups, P = 1.000), and there was no statistical difference in the normal delivery rate between the two treatments (99% vs. 99%, P = 0.989).

In summary, both ureteroscopy and internal ureteral stents are safe and effective for pregnancy with symptomatic urolithiasis.

### EAU guidelines on urolithiasis [^117Lh2jo]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for nephrolithiasis, particularly in relation to the choice of procedure for ureteral stones, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend informing patients that ureteroscopy has a better chance of achieving stone-free status with a single procedure but also possesses higher complication rates compared to shockwave lithotripsy.

### Selective postoperative imaging after ureteroscopy [^113E4gfA]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

To evaluate the need for routine follow-up imaging after ureteroscopy, we performed a retrospective chart review of patients undergoing ureteroscopy for urolithiasis. Selective imaging was conducted in the initial postoperative phase (1–3 weeks after removal of the ureteral stent) if the procedure was classified as complicated. This classification included the presence of an impacted stone, the need for balloon dilation, intraoperative ureteral perforation, or postoperative pain after stent removal. Uncomplicated ureteroscopy was followed by repeat imaging if the patient developed recurrent renal colic or as surveillance for new stone growth at 6–12 months of follow-up.

A total of 267 ureteroscopic procedures were performed on 253 patients. Data from 214 of 253 patients (84.6%) who had undergone noncontrast-enhanced computed tomography imaging one month or more after surgery were analyzed. The mean follow-up was 14.5 months (range 1–66 months). The incidence of stricture was 1.4% (3/214). In the selective imaging (complicated ureteroscopy) group, the incidence was 5.3% (3/56), while in the uncomplicated ureteroscopy group, it was 0% (0/158). Ureteral stricture developed in 3 of 11 patients with stone impaction (27.2%, P = 0.002), 2 of 14 patients undergoing ureteral balloon dilation (10.4%, P = 0.0052), and in 1 of 6 patients with an intraoperative mucosal perforation (16.6%, P = 0.0326). Persistent postoperative pain after stent removal was not predictive of stricture formation (3.6%, P = 0.139).

The results of our study indicate that selective imaging, as determined…

### Surgical management of stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society guideline, part I [^113cZtek]. The Journal of Urology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for nephrolithiasis, specifically in the context of choosing the appropriate procedure for ureteral stones, the AUA/ES 2016 guidelines recommend offering ureteroscopy as the first-line therapy for patients with mid or distal ureteral stones who require intervention and are not candidates for, or have failed medical expulsive therapy. Shock-wave lithotripsy should be offered to patients who decline ureteroscopy.

### Management of ureteric stones [^114AeEvY]. European Urology (2004). Low credibility.

The contemporary management of ureteric stones is reviewed, and evidence-based recommendations about treatment are made. Stones measuring less than 4 mm in diameter have a high chance of spontaneous passage. The main debate for the optimum treatment of larger stones centers around the choice of shock wave lithotripsy or endoscopic management combined with laser fragmentation.

Treatment recommendations should be based on patient preference, published evidence, local audit (surgeon expertise and availability of equipment), and cost.

Artificial neural networks could become a useful tool for predicting treatment outcomes for ureteric stones, and further research is needed to clarify this potential. ESWL is less effective than ureteroscopy, but it may prevent the need for more invasive treatment in a substantial proportion of patients. It should only be considered as initial treatment in patients with stones less than 10 mm in size.

The routine use of stents should be avoided as both fragmentation and stone-free rates are noticeably lower. For larger stones, initial laser ureteroscopy serves better for both proximal or distal calculi and is more cost-efficient. Provided that no contraindications for general anesthesia exist, laser ureterolithotripsy should be regarded as an excellent first-line treatment modality for ureteric stones, especially in cases of greater stone burden.

In skilled hands, the outcome for endoscopic management of ureteric stones at all sites is better than ESWL and is cheaper, although equipment, expertise, and experience are required to achieve this superior outcome.

### Success of laparoscopic robot-assisted approaches to ureteropelvic junction obstruction based on preoperative renal function [^112NxzqV]. Journal of Endourology (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to address the lack of literature examining risk factors for failure after robot-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty for ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) in children. The goal was to compare the success rates of robot-assisted pyeloplasty between UPJO kidneys with preoperative renal function of 30% or higher.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients who underwent a robot-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty for UPJO at a single institution from June 2009 to September 2013, performed by four surgeons. A procedure was considered a failure if it required a second surgery for UPJO, showed no improvement in symptoms with no enhancement on postoperative mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG)-3 scan, or displayed a reduction in renal function of the obstructed kidney to 30% or less preoperatively, as determined via the Fisher exact test.

- **Results**: A total of 116 patients were included in the study. The mean follow-up duration was 507 days after the surgical procedure, with a failure rate of 8% (8 patients). Most failures (5 out of 8) occurred in kidneys with preoperative function equal to or greater than 30%, resulting in a success rate of 97% for robot-assisted pyeloplasty in this group. This was a significant improvement compared to the 58% success rate observed in kidneys with preoperative function below 30%.

### Emergency ureteroscopic removal of ureteral calculi after first colic attack: Is there any advantage [^111FSqVj]. Urology (2011). Low credibility.

To comparatively evaluate the efficacy of ureteroscopic stone treatment immediately after the first colic attack and in an electively planned manner, a study was conducted involving 145 patients. These patients underwent semirigid ureteroscopic removal of obstructive ureteral calculi using two different approaches: 69 patients in group 1 and 76 patients in group 2.

- **Methods**: The 69 patients in group 1 were treated with appropriate medical therapy for a period of seven days or more for colic pain. They subsequently underwent semirigid ureteroscopy or pneumatic lithotripsy in a planned manner. The 76 patients in group 2 underwent semirigid ureteroscopy after the first colic attack. Stone-free status, auxiliary procedures, and complications were evaluated between the two groups using the Mann-Whitney U test; for qualitative data, Fisher's exact test was used.

- **Results**: Among the 145 patients who underwent semirigid ureteroscopy, the mean stone size was 11.80 ± 3.95 mm in group 1 and 8.32 ± 2.08 mm in group 2. No major complications occurred during or after the procedure. The stone-free rate was 87% in group 1 and 90.7% in group 2. The mean readmission rate to the emergency department for the management of a colic attack was 3.03 ± 2.84 in group 1; no patient in group 2 required readmission.

- **Conclusion**: Ureteroscopic stone removal immediately after the first colic attack in cases of obstructive ureteral stones proved to be safe and effective. It offers the advantages of both immediate stone fragmentation and relief from acute onset colic pain, which causes extreme discomfort.

### EAU guidelines on urolithiasis [^113QoeUi]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

With regard to surgical interventions for nephrolithiasis, particularly concerning surgical stone removal, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend offering laparoscopic or open surgical stone removal in rare cases. This is advised when shockwave lithotripsy, retrograde or antegrade ureteroscopy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy have failed or are unlikely to be successful.

### Minimally invasive treatment of ureteropelvic junction obstruction: Optimizing outcomes with concomitant cost reduction [^114jaKcq]. Journal of Endourology (2006). Low credibility.

With the seemingly exponential increase in the use of minimally invasive techniques in urology, cost-benefit comparisons will continue to play a major part in establishing services and in improving those that already exist. The management of ureteropelvic junction obstruction is a focus of significant attention. An effective way of optimizing the economy of management is to understand the implications in terms of the success of each mode of treatment. Subsequently, costing models should be developed and applied in large-scale multicenter studies with the aid of health economists. The long-term benefits can then be assessed by also including the patient's perceived quality of life.

Economic assessment will not be enough to promote cost-effective practices. The take-up of any techniques will always be influenced not only by patient preference and surgeon expertise but also, perhaps ironically, by the way hospitals and surgeons are remunerated. In addition, the impact of the time taken to train a surgeon to carry out laparoscopic dismembered pyeloplasty competently may play a significant role. Until these issues are resolved, definitive recommendations for the treatment of ureteropelvic junction obstruction will continue to be made on an individual basis.

### Routine stenting after ureteroscopy for distal ureteral calculi is unnecessary: Results of a randomized controlled trial [^113Lf4jK]. Journal of Endourology (2003). Low credibility.

Insertion of a ureteral stent is routinely done after ureteroscopy. Recently, several authors have questioned routine stenting after ureteroscopy for distal ureteral stones. We report our results of a randomized study comparing ureteroscopy with and without placement of stents for distal ureteral stones.

- **Patients and methods**: A total of 48 patients undergoing ureteroscopy for distal ureteral stones were randomized to a stented group (N = 26) or a nonstented group (N = 22). Ureteroscopy was carried out with a Wolf 8.5F semirigid endoscope, and the Swiss Lithoclast was used as the source of energy. Any stent was removed at 3 weeks. Patients were assessed for success, operative time, postoperative pain score, analgesic requirement, stent-related symptoms, and risk of ureteral stricture formation. Baseline variables were not significantly different in the two groups.

- **Results**: There was no significant difference in the two treatment groups with regard to the need for ureteral dilation, use of intracorporeal lithotripsy, or occurrence of intraoperative and postoperative complications. A successful outcome was achieved in 100% of both groups. The mean pain score on day 0 was 5.23 ± 0.95 out of 10 in the stented group and 4.82 ± 0.96 in the nonstented group; this difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, the analgesic requirement in the two treatment groups was not significantly different. However, patients with stents had significantly more pain, including flank pain with voiding (P = 0.01), urgency (P = 0.04), and dysuria (P < 0.01).

### EAU guidelines on urolithiasis [^116n7mRa]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for nephrolithiasis, specifically in the choice of procedure for renal stones, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend offering flexible ureteroscopy, even for stones greater than 2 cm, or shockwave lithotripsy if percutaneous nephrolithotomy is not an option. It is recognized that there is a higher risk of requiring a follow-up procedure and the placement of a ureteral stent.

### What are the benefits and harms of ureteroscopy compared with shock-wave lithotripsy in the treatment of upper ureteral stones? A systematic review [^1122gTUv]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) and ureteroscopy (URS), with or without intracorporeal lithotripsy, are the most common treatments for upper ureteric stones. With advances in technology, it is unclear which treatment is most effective and/or safest.

The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate literature reporting the benefits and harms of SWL and URS in the management of upper ureteric stones. Databases including Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from January 2000 to November 2014. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomized controlled trials, and nonrandomized studies comparing any subtype or variation of URS and SWL were included.

- **Primary benefit outcome**: Stone-free rate (SFR).
- **Primary harm outcome**: Complications.
- **Secondary outcomes**: Retreatment rate and the need for secondary and/or adjunctive procedures.

The Cochrane risk of bias tool assessed RCTs, and an extended version assessed nonrandomized studies. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation was used to assess the quality of evidence.

In the evidence synthesis, 5,380 abstracts and 387 full-text articles were screened. Forty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria, with 19 (39.6%) being RCTs. No studies involving children met the inclusion criteria. URS and SWL were compared in 22 studies, which included 4 RCTs, 1 quasi-randomized controlled trial, and 17 nonrandomized studies. Meta-analyses were deemed inappropriate due to heterogeneity at the time of writing. SFR favored URS in 9 out of 22 studies. Retreatment rates were high.

### Removal of small, asymptomatic kidney stones and incidence of relapse [^113xz5h6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The benefits of removing small (≤ 6 mm), asymptomatic kidney stones endoscopically are unknown. Guidelines leave such decisions to the urologist and the patient. A prospective study involving older, non-endoscopic technology and some retrospective studies favor observation. However, published data indicate that about half of small renal stones left in place at the time that larger stones were removed caused other symptomatic events within five years after surgery.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicenter, randomized controlled trial in which, during the endoscopic removal of ureteral or contralateral kidney stones, remaining small, asymptomatic stones were removed in 38 patients (treatment group) and were not removed in 35 patients (control group). The primary outcome was relapse as measured by future emergency department visits, surgeries, or growth of secondary stones.

- **Results**: After a mean follow-up of 4.2 years, the treatment group had a longer time to relapse than the control group (P < 0.001 by log-rank test). The restricted mean (± SE) time to relapse was 75% longer in the treatment group than in the control group (1631.6 ± 72.8 days vs. 934.2 ± 121.8 days). The risk of relapse was 82% lower in the treatment group than the control group (hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% confidence interval, 0.07 to 0.44), with 16% of patients in the treatment group having a relapse as compared to 63% of those in the control group. Treatment added a median of 25.6 minutes (interquartile range, 18.5 to 35.2) to the surgery time.

### The role of routine ureteral stenting following uncomplicated ureteroscopic treatment for upper ureteral and renal stones: A randomized control trial [^113yWEWz]. Journal of Endourology (2023). High credibility.

Ureteral stenting following uncomplicated ureteroscopy (URS) is common practice. Several studies have proven the safety of omitting routine stent placement following distal ureteral stone treatment. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the utility of stent placement for proximal URS. We designed a prospective, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the role of ureteral stent placement following URS for proximal ureteral and renal stones.

Seventy-two patients with proximal ureteral or renal stones measuring up to 1.5 cm were prospectively randomized into stented (37) or unstented (35) groups. The surgeon was blinded to the treatment group until after stone treatment. Patients tracked postoperative pain medications and completed validated pain questionnaires on postoperative days 0, 3, 7, and 28. Stents were removed on postoperative day 7. Postoperative follow-up imaging was obtained at 4 weeks.

No statistical differences were observed between the two groups in terms of demographics or stone characteristics. The operative time was longer in the stented group (p < 0.03). Patients in the stented group experienced more irritative urinary symptoms (p < 0.0001) and pain (p < 0.0001), missed more days of work (p < 0.01), and used more narcotics (p < 0.0005) during the first week, but no differences were observed at 30 days. Emergency room visits and overall complication rates were similar between the two groups. Three non-stented patients required stent placement. Two stented patients required early stent removal.

### Ultrasound guided ureteroscopy for the definitive management of ureteral stones: A randomized, controlled trial [^112f1Dpr]. The Journal of Urology (2014). High credibility.

Ureteroscopy is central to the surgical management of ureteral stones. Fluoroscopy is conventionally used for intraoperative guidance, although there is a growing effort to decrease the exposure of patients and staff to ionizing radiation. We developed a radiation-free approach to ureteroscopy using ultrasound guidance to manage ureteral stones, and to our knowledge, we present the first randomized trial to study its safety and efficacy.

This single-center, randomized clinical trial from 2011 to 2013 enlisted patients who presented with symptomatic ureteral stones 8 mm or less without a significant ipsilateral stone burden. Patients were randomly assigned to ultrasound or fluoroscopic guided ureteroscopy after temporizing ureteral stent placement. Intraoperative ultrasound guidance was performed using real-time imaging with the transducer placed at the patient's flank to visualize the collecting system of the ipsilateral kidney. We compared operative time, stone size, stone-free status, and complication rates between the two groups.

A total of 50 patients were enrolled in the study, with 25 per arm. There was no difference in stone size (5.9 vs. 5.7 mm), patient age (56 vs. 52 years), or body mass index (31 vs. 30 kg/m²) in the test group compared to controls. The ultrasound guidance cohort showed no significant difference in the stone-free rate (86% vs. 86%) or the complication rate (8% vs. 16%) compared to controls. Operative time was no longer in the ultrasound guidance cohort.

In this feasibility study, we found that ureteral stones may be managed using ultrasound guidance without compromising safety or effectiveness compared to conventional fluoroscopic methods.

### Surgical approaches for treatment of ureteropelvic junction obstruction - a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113Mjuhs]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Several surgical techniques have been developed for the treatment of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), each yielding unique advantages and potential limitations. Although robot-assisted pyeloplasty (RP) and laparoscopic pyeloplasty (LP) are allegedly superior, these claims are based on pairwise meta-analyses that failed to evaluate all available techniques simultaneously. In contrast, our study provides a comprehensive overview of open pyeloplasty (OP), endoscopic pyeloplasty (EP), LP, and RP, comparing their performance with respect to crucial clinical outcomes.

Our results indicate that RP is the technique with the highest rates of operative success, the lowest overall complication rates, the shortest hospital stay, as well as the lowest re-operation rates and transfusion rates. On the other hand, EP yields the lowest rates of urinary leakage and the shortest operating times. Robot-assisted surgery is known for its minimally invasive nature, which correlates with less postoperative pain and earlier recovery, likely contributing to shorter hospital stays. In addition, robot-assisted surgery allows for high precision movements with articulated arms and provides magnified 3-D vision for the surgeon. This might explain the high operative success rates of RP. Low transfusion rates of RP are a consequence of the minimally invasive nature of robotic surgery, which allows immediate and precise reaction to local bleeding.

The reason for the short operating time in EP is probably that kidney access requires more time during abdominal surgery than in this endoscopic procedure. Furthermore, EP is less complex, even though the percutaneous approach involves a short flank incision and sewing techniques, both of which are of low complexity.

### Ureteral stenting after ureteroscopy for distal ureteral calculi: A multi-institutional prospective randomized controlled study assessing pain, outcomes and complications [^1159iAZT]. The Journal of Urology (2001). High credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare postoperative pain, stone-free rates, and complications after ureteroscopic treatment of distal ureteral calculi, with or without the use of ureteral stents. A total of 113 patients with distal ureteral calculi, amenable to ureteroscopic treatment, were prospectively randomized into stented (53) and unstented (60) groups. Stones were managed using semirigid ureteroscopes with or without distal ureteral dilation and/or intracorporeal lithotripsy. Preoperative and postoperative pain questionnaires were obtained from each patient. Patients with stents had them removed 3 to 10 days postoperatively. Radiographic follow-up was conducted postoperatively to assess stone-free rates and evidence of obstruction.

Six patients randomized to the unstented group were withdrawn from the study after significant intraoperative ureteral trauma was recognized, including three ureteral perforations, that required ureteral stent placement. This left 53 patients with stents and 54 without for analysis. Patients with stents experienced statistically significantly more postoperative flank pain (p = 0.005) and bladder pain (p < 0.05 in all cases). The overall mean stone size in the study was 6.6 mm. There were four (7.4%) patients without stents who required postoperative readmission to the hospital.

### Optimal stenting duration following ureteroscopy and nephrolithotomy: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ukc8r]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

The optimal duration for ureteral stent placement following ureteroscopy remains unclear, with no consensus on its impact on patient outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the ideal stent duration by comparing post-procedure-related events (PREs) and complications.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Google Scholar identified studies comparing different durations of ureteral stenting after ureteroscopy. The primary outcome was the occurrence of PREs, while secondary outcomes focused on associated complications.

- **Results**: Four studies were included, encompassing 1,762 patients with stents removed within ≤ 5 days and 2,231 patients with stents removed after ≥ 6 days. The incidence of PREs did not significantly differ between the two groups (OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 0.22–7.25; p = 0.79; I² = 98%). Patients with stent durations ≥ 6 days had higher rates of flank pain and hematuria. In contrast, fever and dysuria were more prevalent in patients with stents removed within 5 days.

- **Conclusion**: Although no significant difference was observed in overall PRE rates, the distinct patterns of complications based on stent duration highlight the complexity of determining optimal stent placement time in clinical practice.

### Stent encrustation or fragmentation? A case report of post stent removal encrustation in postpartum woman and literature review [^116UxHM5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

John S. Lam suggested stopping further proceedings to avoid damaging the ureter if the patient complains of pain or the stent does not move easily. They considered that a slight coating was capable of locking the distal coils together to prevent uncoiling. Forced stent removal can result in ureteral injury or even ureteral avulsion. It is accepted that removing a severely encrusted ureteral stent could be a difficult problem for most urologists. Although numerous articles showed tips and tricks for solving this problem, it needs to be addressed with more than one approach, including ESWL, ureteroscopy, percutaneous nephrolithotomy, and open surgery. Any associated stone burden must be addressed during the operative session.

Due to various complications caused by long-term stent indwelling, surgical management with ureteroscopy is an accepted reasonable alternative for pregnant women nowadays. It is reported that ureteroscopy has been shown to be both feasible and safe during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, with similar stone-free rates to non-pregnant patients. A recent meta-analysis has demonstrated no difference in the incidence of ureteric injury or UTI in pregnant patients compared with non-pregnant patients. Moreover, the post-procedural ureteral stent indwelling time is much shorter than delaying definitive stone management until after delivery. If there are any contraindications to ureteroscopy and long-term ureteral stent indwelling must be performed instead, a reasonable follow-up strategy should be developed.

### Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) versus ureteroscopic management for ureteric calculi [^115ioCYk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). High credibility.

Ureteral stones frequently cause renal colic and, if left untreated, can lead to obstructive uropathy. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and ureteroscopy, with or without intracorporeal lithotripsy, are the most common interventions used to treat ureteral stones. ESWL treatment is less invasive than ureteroscopy but has some limitations, such as a high retreatment rate, and is not available in all centers. Recent advances in ureteroscopy have increased success rates and reduced complication rates.

- **Objectives**: To examine evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the outcomes of ESWL or ureteroscopy in the treatment of ureteric calculi.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2011), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2011), EMBASE (1980 to March 2011), CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Google Scholar, reference lists of articles, and abstracts from conference proceedings, all without language restriction.

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs that compared ESWL with ureteroscopic retrieval of ureteric stones were included in this review. Study participants were adults with ureteric stones requiring intervention. Published and unpublished sources were considered for inclusion.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three authors independently assessed study quality, risk of bias, and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean differences (MD) for continuous data, both with 95% confidence intervals.

### Impact of intraoperative digital stone measurement on surgeon decision making in ureteroscopy [^112b8Gdc]. Urology (2025). Low credibility.

To assess the clinical use of a novel software capable of accurately measuring stone fragments in real time and its impact on intraoperative decision-making, adult patients undergoing flexible ureteroscopy and holmium laser lithotripsy for renal stones were prospectively enrolled. Intraoperative measurements of fragments were performed live and reported to surgeons upon request during surgery. After each case, surgeons were surveyed about the reasons for taking measurements and how the measurements impacted their intraoperative decisions.

Among 106 patients undergoing ureteroscopy, surgeons took an average of 2.4 intraoperative measurements per case. The software was deployed successfully in all cases. Surgeons' most frequent reason for taking intraoperative measurements was to determine whether post-lithotripsy fragments were extractable (52%), but they also requested measurements to assess stone size (30%) and extractability (34%) before lithotripsy. Based on stone measurements, surgeons changed intraoperative plans in 28% of cases and instead continued lithotripsy (11%), extracted fragments (14%), or left fragments behind for passage (3%). Surgeons rated the ability to take intraoperative measurements as "very helpful" (61%) or "somewhat helpful" (38%). The time burden of taking measurements affected procedural efficiency in 3% of cases.

The ability to take stone measurements during flexible ureteroscopy changed surgeons' intraoperative stone management decisions in 28% of cases. Integrating digital measurement tools may improve surgical decision-making and outcomes.

### Does omission of ureteral stents increase risk of unplanned return visit? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115WvfNM]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Post-ureteroscopy ureteral stent omission remains controversial. Although omission is associated with reduced postoperative discomfort, there is concern for early obstruction. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of trials to compare the risk of unplanned visits with versus without a stent following ureteroscopy for nephrolithiasis.

Randomized controlled trials and observational studies comparing post-ureteroscopic stent omission versus placement, and reporting unplanned visits within 30 days, were identified via a search of MEDLINE® (1946 to 2015), CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, 1898 to 2015), Embase® (1947 to 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov (1997 to 2015), AUA (American Urological Association) Annual Meeting abstracts (2011 to 2015), and reference lists of included articles, as last updated in October 2015. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Odds ratios (ORs), risk ratios (RRs), and weighted mean differences were calculated as appropriate for each outcome.

Of the initial 1,992 studies, 17 with a total of 1,943 participants met inclusion criteria. Unstented patients were significantly more likely to have an unplanned medical visit compared to those who received a post-ureteroscopy stent (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.15–2.30). Unstented patients had shorter operative time (weighted mean difference -3.19 minutes, 95% CI -5.64 to -0.74) and were less likely to experience dysuria (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.25–0.62). They were also less likely to experience postoperative infection (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.59–1.33) and pain.

### Prestenting improves ureteroscopic stone-free rates [^113NfgSi]. Journal of Endourology (2007). Low credibility.

Although the use of stents after ureteroscopy has been studied extensively, relatively little has been published about stent placement before complicated ureteroscopic procedures. In this study, we examined our experience with stent placement before ureteroscopic management of renal and ureteral stone disease.

A total of 90 patients underwent ureteroscopic surgery on 115 renal units by a single surgeon from 2001 to 2006. All patients had documented follow-up with imaging either by CT or intravenous urography (IVU) with tomography. Patients were classified into two groups depending on whether they had a stent placed before ureteroscopy. Baseline characteristics, operative indications for stent placement, stone-free rates, and complications were compared between groups.

Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. The majority of patients received stents before stone management because of technical considerations during surgery (17/36, 47%) or infection (13/36, 37%). Strict stone-free rates after ureteroscopic treatment were 47% in the 79 procedures without previous stents, compared to 67% in the 36 procedures with prestenting (P < 0.05). Including small fragments (2 mm or smaller), stone-free rates improved to 54% vs. 78%, respectively (P < 0.02). Complications were not significantly different in the two groups (P = 0.70).

Although routine stent placement is not necessary before all ureteroscopic procedures, we demonstrate that it is associated with good stone-free rates and few complications.

### Routine ureteral stenting after ureteroscopy for ureteral lithiasis: Is it really necessary [^116DmuXB]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of routine ureteral stenting after ureteroscopic stone removal. Of 295 consecutive patients who underwent rigid ureteroscopic stone removal, 133 in group 1 and 162 in group 2 were randomized to receive and not receive a stent, respectively, after the procedure. Operative time, stone size, stone location, success rate, postoperative pain, and complications were analyzed in each group.

There were no statistically significant differences in the two groups regarding stone size, stone location, success rate, postoperative pain, or complications. However, in group 1, operative time was significantly longer than in group 2 (chi-square test, p = 0.019). The hospital charge per patient when placing and not placing a stent after ureteroscopy for stone removal was $9,900.95 and $3,661.78, respectively. Female patients with a stent without a suture required an extra charge for stent removal in the operating room, while no men had a stent with a suture.

Routine catheter placement after ureteroscopic stone removal increased operative time and did not seem to improve patient outcomes. The cost was 30% that without a stent.

### A prospective and randomized comparison of rigid ureteroscopic to flexible cystoscopic retrieval of ureteral stents [^111h64t1]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Ureteral stents are frequently used in minimally invasive procedures for upper urinary tract diseases. They may alleviate temporary postoperative obstruction in the ureter resulting from trauma and swelling. Stents can also serve as a means of passive preoperative ureteral dilation. Conventionally, indwelling ureteral stents present for an extended period are retrieved using a rigid cystoscope and grasping forceps in adults under topical anesthesia as outpatients. This procedure can be painful and may cause urethral injury in men. Recently, flexible cystoscopy has become an accepted alternative for stent retrieval; however, the flexible cystoscope is associated with higher costs and may not be readily available in developing countries.

Some reports describe experiences of using a rigid ureteroscope to retrieve ureteral stents, particularly in occasional situations such as migrated or retained stents. However, no study has been published comparing the outcomes of using a flexible cystoscope versus a rigid ureteroscope for ureteral stent removal. In this prospective and randomized clinical trial, we intend to investigate this issue.

### Outcomes of ureteroscopy and internal ureteral stent for pregnancy with urolithiasis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1161fAVM]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

To investigate the outcomes of internal ureteral stents compared to ureteroscopy (URS) for pregnant women with urolithiasis, relevant studies published from January 1980 to June 2022 were identified through systematic literature searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. A total of 499 studies were initially identified. We included pregnant women in any stage of gestation who underwent double-J (D-J) stent insertion only or ureteroscopy for the treatment of urolithiasis, provided the number of participants exceeded ten. This systematic review was registered on the PROSPERO website (Reference: CRD42020195607).

A total of 25 studies were identified, comprising 131 cases undergoing serial stenting and 789 cases undergoing URS. The pooled operative success rate was 97% for D-J stent insertion and 99% for URS. Only a few patients passed stones spontaneously after serial D-J stenting. The pooled stone-free rate (SFR) in URS operations was about 91%. For internal ureteral stent therapy, the rate of normal fertility outcomes was 99%, although the pooled incidence of complications was approximately 45%. For the group receiving URS treatment, the rate of normal fertility outcomes was 99%, and the pooled incidence of complications was approximately 1%. However, the pooled rate of premature birth and abortion was similar between the two groups (< 1%); the rate of serious complications was also similar between the two groups.

### Routine ureteral stenting is not necessary after ureteroscopy and ureteropyeloscopy: A randomized trial [^1175ALAK]. Journal of Endourology (2002). Low credibility.

Retrospective studies have suggested that routine stenting can be avoided following ureteroscopy. We prospectively analyzed the need for routine ureteral stent placement in patients undergoing ureteroscopic procedures.

- **Patients and methods**: Fifty-five consecutive patients (60 renal units) were randomized into either a stent or a no-stent group following ureteroscopy with either a 7.5F semirigid or a 7.5F flexible ureteroscope for treatment of calculi (holmium laser or pneumatic lithotripsy) or transitional-cell carcinoma (holmium laser). Intraoperative variables assessed included total stone burden, the need for ureteral dilation, and overall operative times. All patients were evaluated by questionnaire on postoperative days 0, 1, and 6 with regard to pain, frequency, urgency, dysuria, and hematuria.

- **Results**: Of the 60 renal units treated, 38 received ureteral stents (mean 5.2 days), and 22 were treated without a stent. All 10 patients requiring ureteral balloon dilation had stents placed and were removed from the analysis. There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to age, sex, or stone burden. Operative time was decreased in the no-stent group (43 minutes vs. 55 minutes; P = 0.013). Flank discomfort was significantly less common in the no-stent group on days 0, 1, and 6 (P = 0.004, P = 0.003, P < 0.001, respectively), as was the incidence of suprapubic pain on day 6 (P = 0.002). There was no difference in urinary frequency, urgency, or dysuria between the groups on postoperative day 1, but all these symptoms were significant.

### Role of ureteral stenting after uncomplicated ureteroscopy for distal ureteral stones: A randomized, controlled trial [^113faXKm]. The Journal of Urology (2008). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the differences in outcomes between ureteral stenting and non-stenting following uncomplicated ureteroscopy for distal ureteral stones. A total of 220 patients who underwent successful ureteroscopy for distal ureteral stones were randomized into two equal groups according to the postoperative placement of a ureteral stent (Cook Ireland, National Technological Park, Ireland).

- **Group allocation**: Patients were divided into group 1, without a stent, and group 2, with a stent.

- **Outcome measures**: These included flank pain and dysuria at 48 hours and one week, early postoperative complications, analgesia need, rehospitalization, return to normal physical activity, stone-free rate, stone recurrence, and late postoperative complications. Patients were followed for an average of 25 ± 9 months (range 12 to 49 months).

- **Results** indicated that early postoperative complications, including low-grade fever, hematuria, and urinary tract infection, were observed in 22 patients (20%) in group 1 and 19 patients (19%) in group 2, a difference that was not statistically significant. No differences were noted in mean initial hospitalization time or time to return to normal physical activity between the two groups.

After 48 hours and one week, flank pain was similar in both groups; however, dysuria was significantly less in the non-stented group. The amount of analgesics required in the recovery room did not differ, but stented patients required more analgesia after hospital discharge while the stent remained in the ureter. Both groups achieved a 100% stone-free rate at four weeks. Further results regarding late postoperative sequelae were not detailed.

### The effect of ureteral stent placement on post-ureteroscopy complications: a meta-analysis [^113tUdWb]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

To determine, by systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials examining ureteral stent placement after ureteroscopy, whether the presence or absence of a stent was associated with postoperative complications, the following methods were used:

- **Methods**: All randomized clinical trials of ureteral stent placement after ureteroscopy were identified with PubMed. The primary outcome was the occurrence of a urologic complication, defined as secondary procedure, emergency department evaluation, or hospital admission. The complication rates were compared between the stented (treatment) and unstented (control) arms of each trial as a risk difference, pooled as a weighted average across all studies, using both fixed and random-effects models.

- **Results**: Ten trials were identified, with a total of 891 subjects. Patients undergoing ureteral stent placement after ureteroscopy had a 4% lower occurrence of urologic complications (95% confidence interval -10.1%, 1.8%). This difference, however, failed to reach statistical significance after accounting for heterogeneity in the data (P = 0.175).

- **Conclusions**: There is a slightly lower absolute risk of complication associated with the placement of a ureteral stent after ureteroscopy. However, meta-analysis of the present literature does not detect a significant difference in outcome between patients who undergo ureteral stent placement after ureteroscopy and those who do not.

### Impact of ureteral stenting in ureteroscopy [^114wob3M]. Current Opinion in Urology (2016). Low credibility.

We review new therapies and biomaterials designed to reduce ureteral stent symptoms in patients undergoing ureteroscopy.

- **Recent findings**: Pharmacologically, alpha-blockers and antimuscarinics have been shown to have a synergistic effect and be more effective than either medication alone in reducing stent-related symptoms. Prestenting patients prior to ureteroscopy has been beneficial for patients with renal stones, offering a better stone-free rate and reduced complications, but not for ureteral stones. Stenting after the use of a ureteral access sheath reduced complications and unscheduled emergency visits. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories have been shown to prevent pain after stent removal. Surveys showed that patients preferred to remove their own stents via dangle strings at home or undergo cystoscopic removal in the operating room with some type of anesthesia. New materials such as gel-based or biodegradable ureteral stents are being developed to deal with stent-related pain, encrustation, and infection. Antirefluxing stents eliminate vesicoureteric reflux in patients during voiding and may reduce symptoms of back and flank pain. Ureteral stents are involved in many procedures in urology, particularly kidney stone treatments.

- **Summary**: Advances in materials and medications will help improve the patient experience for those who receive a ureteral stent.

### Failure in double-J stent inserting in laparoscopic pyeloplasty of ureteropelvic junction obstruction: The clinical features and outcomes [^112QjK3v]. BMC Urology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnosing coexisting UPJO and UVJO or other distal obstructions can be challenging. The retrograde placement of a DJ tube by cystoscopy can be used to determine if there is distal obstruction, which aligns more closely with open surgery outcomes. For laparoscopy, it is easier to identify the obstruction's location. For patients with UPJO and UVJO, procedures on both the UPJ and UVJ are generally not recommended due to the distribution of ureteral vessels. According to Campbell Urology Surgery, UVJO may self-heal. Therefore, performing an UPJO operation first and monitoring the UVJO condition in children is feasible. In our center, we prefer to treat UPJO initially. Cystoscopy and retrograde stenting necessitate position adjustment, which was not chosen. EUP is used for children who fail to place DJ tubes, as it may alleviate symptoms and provide buffer time for potential self-healing if the nephrostomy tube cannot be removed at discharge.

The postoperative complication rate in the EUP group was significantly higher than in the DJ group (P = 0.02). Chu et al. suggested that the negative effects of the EUP approach mainly include urine leakage, damage to the renal parenchyma, skin site infection, and delayed wound healing. In the study, three patients experienced urine leakage: one in the DJ group and two in the EUP group. Additionally, two patients had postoperative skin infections around the stoma, leading to delayed wound healing. However, the DJ stent was related to higher risks.

### Surgical approaches for treatment of ureteropelvic junction obstruction - a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115NeQD4]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

This study was registered a priori at PROSPERO (CRD42018085917). The systematic literature search using EMBASE, MEDLINE, and COCHRANE libraries was performed in January 2018 and was unrestricted with respect to publication language and date. In addition, publication lists of reviews and included articles, as well as conference proceedings, were searched. Furthermore, we searched a registry for clinical trials to identify potentially unpublished studies. The full search strategy is available in the Additional File 1.

- **Criteria for study inclusion and exclusion**: We included retrospective and prospective studies comparing at least two of the following surgical approaches for the treatment of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO): open pyeloplasty (OP), laparoscopic pyeloplasty (LP), robotic pyeloplasty (RP), and endopyelotomy (EP).

- **Required outcomes for study inclusion**: Studies had to assess at least one of the following outcomes:
	- **Operative outcomes**: operative success, operating time, suturing time
	- **Blood and transfusion metrics**: estimated blood loss, transfusion rate
	- **Conversion and re-operation considerations**: conversion rate, re-operation rate
	- **Complication and mortality related**: intra- and postoperative complications, urinary leakage, deaths
	- **Recovery and functional outcomes**: length of hospital stay, time to return to normal activities, renal function, pain, analgesia requirement
	- **Other metrics**: survival time, costs

	No minimum follow-up time was required for study inclusion.

- **Statistically evaluated outcomes**:
	- Operative success was examined as the total number of successes as defined by the authors.
	- Rates of transfusion, conversion, re-operation, intra- and postoperative complications, and urinary leakage were evaluated as total numbers as well.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Reviews and meta-analyses were excluded, as well as studies focusing on certain outcomes that were not relevant to the main research objectives.

### New concepts in the treatment of ureteral calculi [^112niEtZ]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

The management of patients with ureteral stones remains under debate in several areas. The ability to predict spontaneous passage has improved but remains imprecise, while the range of therapeutic options continues to widen. Excellent results can be obtained by both shockwave lithotripsy and ureteroscopic methods, with relatively minimal complications. Routine ureteral stenting is not warranted whichever treatment is chosen. In the future, directly comparative studies should be designed to incorporate quality-of-life parameters rather than just stone-free status to improve our understanding of the effect of treatment decisions on patients.

### Ureteric stent versus percutaneous nephrostomy for acute ureteral obstruction - clinical outcome and quality of life: a bi-center prospective study [^116unY92]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Over a two-year period, 75 consecutive patients presented to the emergency room of two hospitals with an obstructing ureteral stone necessitating drainage. They were asked to participate in this study by an on-call urologist involved in the study. The estimated recruitment rate was 42%. This is an Institutional Review Board approved, bi-center, prospective study comparing the impact on the quality of life (QoL) of percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) and retrograde ureteral catheterization.

Patients were offered renal drainage when definitive therapy was not immediately available or was contraindicated, and when a two-stage procedure was considered a safer approach. Entry criteria included an obstructing ureteral stone with either fever (over 38°C), acute renal failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≤ 60 ml/min), or intractable pain. Diagnosis of the obstructing ureteral stone was made by either a non-contrast CT or a combination of renal ultrasound and abdominal X-ray. Exclusion criteria were age under 18 years, pregnant women, and patients with contraindications to either form of drainage (e.g. uncorrected coagulopathy excluding percutaneous drainage, hemodynamic instability precluding anesthesia required for double-J stent [DJS] placement, or abnormalities of the urinary tract).

Patients received either a DJS or a PCN according to the surgeon's preference. Practical issues such as the availability of an operating room or the interventional radiologist often dictated the choice of drainage, particularly in patients with fever, as it is our policy to reduce time to drainage to the minimum in this high-risk group.

### Seamless post-operative removal of JJ stents in the paediatric population: Securing the JJ stent to the tip of the urethral balloon catheter avoids a further operation [^116KXitK]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020). Low credibility.

In children, the removal of a post-procedural JJ stent typically necessitates a further cystoscopy under general anaesthesia. This study describes a technique of securing the distal end of the ureteric stent to the tip of a balloon catheter at the conclusion of the primary procedure. Once post-operative oedema has subsided, the stent can be seamlessly removed in tandem with the balloon catheter. This procedure can be conducted by nursing staff in the ward, without the need for general anaesthesia or sedation. Our experience with the first 10 successive patients, aged 1.6 to 16.3 years, demonstrates that this technique is safe, easy to learn, and well-tolerated.

### Outcomes of ureteroscopy and internal ureteral stent for pregnancy with urolithiasis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ctYSB]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

Following the failure of initial conservative treatment, the insertion of a D-J stent might be a safe choice. Serial stenting for pregnancy with urolithiasis is commonly used in clinics, although there are not many relevant studies. After scanning articles over the past 30 years, only six related articles were included in this meta-analysis.

Historically, serial stenting was considered the gold standard of surgical treatment for pregnancy with urolithiasis as it was less invasive and could be performed under local anaesthesia. This amount of anaesthetic and the reduced level of surgical trauma is considered to be safer for the fetus. Our meta-analysis also indicated that this treatment relieves obstruction and pain while maintaining the pregnancy. However, there are still some negative opinions.

- **Safety and tolerability**: On the one hand, serial stenting may be poorly tolerated by some pregnant women as it can cause pain and reduce the quality of life.
- **Temporary measure and complications**: On the other hand, insertion of a D-J stent is a temporary measure; such stents require regular replacement. Furthermore, the increased concentration of calcium and urate in urine during pregnancy can lead to a tendency for encrustation. As such, these invasive operations need to be performed more frequently. However, an increased frequency of such invasive operations also leads to an increase in complications, including UTI and stent migration; there is also an increase in cost.

Our meta-analysis demonstrated that the pooled ORs of complications after serial stenting was 45%.

### Ureteral stenting and urinary stone management: A systematic review [^111VYmsi]. The Journal of Urology (2008).

Ureteral stents are widely used in many urological procedures. A comprehensive evaluation of recent literature provides an update on materials, stent designs, indications for stent placement, and complications associated with stents. This includes managing stent-related problems.

A thorough literature search on ureteral stents was conducted, reviewing articles published in English from 2000 to 2006.

Following uncomplicated ureteroscopy or shock wave lithotripsy, routine stenting does not appear to affect the stone-free rate. However, stent-related morbidity is common. Patients at greatest risk for complications include those undergoing bilateral stentless ureteroscopy, those with recent or recurrent urinary tract infections, and pregnant patients. Indwelling stent placement should be considered for these individuals. Technological advancements in stent materials and designs aim to decrease stent-related morbidity, such as pain, discomfort, bladder irritability, infection, and encrustation. Changes in stent design and materials show great promise, with initial evaluations suggesting improvements in patient comfort and reduced encrustation. Forgotten stents can lead to significant morbidity due to severe encrustation, but most cases can be managed endoscopically, often requiring multiple procedures.

Stenting is not mandatory after uncomplicated simple ureteroscopy and shock wave lithotripsy. Patients with stents tend to experience significantly more morbidity when compared to those without.

### Outcomes of ureteroscopy and internal ureteral stent for pregnancy with urolithiasis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11798i9D]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

Although internal ureteral stents may cause minor complications, both ureteroscopy and internal ureteral stents showed fewer adverse effects on fertility results in pregnant women with symptomatic urolithiasis. Evidence suggests that URS therapy may have a greater advantage for pregnant women with urinary stones when the condition permits. As it has been proven to be safe and effective, internal ureteral stents can be considered in emergency or other special situations.

### Surgical management of stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society guideline, part I [^111yjKAT]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

This guideline is intended to provide a clinical framework for the surgical management of patients with kidney and/or ureteral stones. The summary presented herein represents part I of the two-part series dedicated to surgical management of stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society guideline. Please refer to part II for an in-depth discussion of patients presenting with ureteral or renal stones.

- **Materials and methods**: A systematic review of the literature (search dates 1/1/1985 to 5/31/2015) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed studies relevant to the surgical management of stones. The review yielded an evidence base of 1,911 articles after the application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. These publications were used to create the guideline statements. Evidence-based statements of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendation were developed based on benefits and risks/burdens to patients. Additional directives are provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions when insufficient evidence existed.

- **Results**: The panel identified 12 adult Index Patients to represent the most common cases seen in clinical practice. Three additional Index Patients were also created to describe pediatric and pregnant patients with such stones. With these patients in mind, guideline statements were developed to aid the clinician in identifying optimal management.

- **Conclusions**: Proper treatment selection, which is directed by patient- and stone-specific factors, remains the greatest predictor of successful treatment outcomes. This guideline is intended for use in clinical practice to assist in decision-making processes.

### Efficacy analysis of self-help position therapy after holmium laser lithotripsy via flexible ureteroscopy [^115pYg1L]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Perioperative and surgical procedure

All enrollees received a preoperative plain abdominal radiograph of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB), along with unenhanced computed tomography (CT), to assess hydronephrosis and the size, location, and number of stones. The same imaging regimen was used for all patients. Stone size was determined by measuring the longest diameter on the preoperative radiologic images. For multiple stones, the sum of the longest diameters was used.

Patients were placed in a lithotomy position after general anesthesia. A semirigid ureteroscope (8–9.8 F; Richard Wolf GmbH, Knittlingen, Germany) was retrogradely inserted into the upper urinary tract with the assistance of a Zebra guidewire (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) to check the ureter and simplify the placement of a 12/14F ureteral access sheath (UAS; Cook Medical, Limerick, Ireland). A 7.5F fiberoptic FURS (P5; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted into the renal pelvis via the UAS to search for and fragment stones (≤ 2 mm). Fragmentation was performed using a 200 µm holmium laser fiber at an energy setting of 12–20 W, based on the visually determined hardness of stones. Routinely, a 4.7F double-J stent (Bard Peripheral Vascular, Tempe, AZ, USA) was placed after lithotripsy. If the UAS could not be positioned due to ureter straitness, a 6F double-J stent (Bard Peripheral Vascular) was implanted for two weeks before lithotripsy.

A kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) examination was performed on postoperative day 1. If residual fragments were found, patients in the position group were instructed accordingly.

### Forgotten ureteral stents: A systematic review of literature [^1118PveB]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Management**: There are currently no formal guidelines but several treatment algorithms in the management of forgotten ureteral stents (FUS). Single-session removal is often discouraged, and it is better to stage the procedures to avoid long intraoperative times and resultant complications.

	With improvements in surgical position and techniques, removing fractured or encrusted FUS in a single endourologic session could be achieved with reasonable operating time and acceptable morbidity. At an experienced center, combined endourological procedures can achieve safe and successful management even in the pediatric group. A complex situation often involves the kidney, ureter, and bladder, necessitating multimodal endoscopic procedures or even more invasive surgery that may be performed either simultaneously, sequentially, or separately. Each treatment modality has its advantages and disadvantages; therefore, a treatment strategy should be devised individually.

	The strategy is mainly based on the volume and site of encrustation, the direction of migration, the site of fracture, kidney function, and other urinary comorbidities. It is recommended to address the distal ends first to facilitate subsequent procedures such as ESWL and PCNL and to facilitate placing a ureteral access catheter or a parallel stent.

	SCSR or semi-rigid ureteroscopes alone could be performed for distal ends with no or minimal encrustation and simply downward migrated FUS. Although severe or circular encrustation completely encasing the distal end can be managed by SCSR and EnCL, the semi-rigid ureteroscope combined…

### Management of ureteropelvic junction obstruction in adults [^114HVPuw]. Nature Reviews Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is characterized by impaired flow of urine from the renal pelvis to the ureter. Untreated disease can result in renal impairment, making effective management crucial. A combination of CT imaging and diuretic renography is typically used for diagnosis. CT is the investigation of choice for obtaining anatomical information about UPJO and can help to identify potential causes. Diuretic renography is best for providing functional information about UPJO.

A variety of open and minimally invasive surgical techniques are available for the treatment of UPJO. Traditionally, open pyeloplasty has been the standard of care, but minimally invasive surgical techniques have become increasingly popular. Endopyelotomy has a lower success rate than other modalities (42–90% depending on the approach), but is associated with reduced pain and shorter convalescence. Laparoscopic pyeloplasty and robot-assisted pyeloplasty have similar success rates to open pyeloplasty (> 90%), with the additional advantages of significantly reduced morbidity and shorter convalescence. More long-term outcome data for minimally invasive surgical techniques are awaited.
