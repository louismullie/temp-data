## Question

Which of these publics does NOT feature in Grunig and Hunt's (1984) situational theory of publics?

Answer Choices:
A. Latent
B. Dormant
C. Aware
D. Active

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which of the following publics does NOT appear in Grunig and Hunt's (1984) situational theory of publics: latent, dormant, aware, or active. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core framework of the situational theory and confirm the canonical categories. Then, I should verify each option against those categories. Finally, I will identify the outlier and double-check for any terminological confusion before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the canonical framework. Grunig and Hunt's situational theory classifies publics along two dimensions: problem recognition and level of involvement, yielding four publics: nonpublic, latent public, aware public, and active public. Wait, let me verify the exact labels — yes, the standard typology is nonpublic, latent, aware, and active, with no mention of a "dormant" category in that framework [^notfound].

> Now, I will examine each option against those four. Latent public is explicitly included, referring to a group that faces a problem but does not yet recognize it, so Option A is part of the theory. Aware public is also included, denoting recognition of the problem but low involvement, so Option C is correct. Active public is included as well, indicating both recognition of the problem and high involvement, so Option D is correct. Hold on, I should verify the outlier: "dormant" does not appear in Grunig and Hunt's original typology, which instead uses "nonpublic" for those with neither problem recognition nor involvement, making "dormant" the term that does not belong here [^notfound].

> But wait, what if "dormant" is sometimes used synonymously with "latent" in other contexts? Hmm, wait a minute, that would be a different theoretical usage; in Grunig and Hunt's specific model, "latent" is a defined category and "dormant" is not, so the correct answer remains that "dormant" is the term not featured in their 1984 framework [^notfound].

> Final answer: B. Dormant.

---

The correct answer is **B. Dormant**. Grunig and Hunt's (1984) situational theory of publics identifies three publics based on problem recognition and level of involvement: **latent**, **aware**, and **active**. "Dormant" is not a category in their framework, so it is the correct choice.

## Grunig and Hunt's situational theory of publics

Grunig and Hunt's situational theory of publics is a foundational model in public relations that categorizes publics based on two key variables:

- **Problem recognition**: The extent to which individuals recognize the existence of a problem or issue.
- **Level of involvement**: The degree to which individuals are personally affected by or interested in the issue.

Based on these variables, the theory identifies three distinct types of publics:

| **Public type** | **Problem recognition** | **Level of involvement** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Latent | Low | High | Individuals face a problem but do not yet recognize it. |
| Aware | High | Low | Individuals recognize a problem but are not personally involved or motivated to act. |
| Active | High | High | Individuals recognize a problem and are personally involved, leading to active communication and behavior. |

---

## Analysis of answer choices

- **A. Latent**: This is a valid category in Grunig and Hunt's theory. Latent publics are those who face a problem but have not yet recognized it.
- **B. Dormant**: This term does not appear in Grunig and Hunt's original framework. It is not a recognized category in their situational theory of publics.
- **C. Aware**: This is a valid category. Aware publics recognize a problem but are not personally involved or motivated to act.
- **D. Active**: This is a valid category. Active publics recognize a problem and are personally involved, leading to active communication and behavior.

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **B. Dormant**, as it is not a category included in Grunig and Hunt's (1984) situational theory of publics. The theory recognizes three publics: latent, aware, and active.

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: a randomized controlled trial [^90ea54aa]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D (D) supplements are indispensable for its world-wide deficiency. Controversy continues on ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3) relative potency as well as on dosing-schedule and sex role in raising 25-hydroxy D (25(OH)D) level, the best indicator of D status.

Methods

We randomized 279 adults to daily D2, D3, D2/D3, or placebo; 2-weekly D2 or D3; or 4-weekly D2 or D3 (250,000 IU over/140 days). Randomization sequence, stratified by body-mass-index (BMI) and sex, was concealed from study coordinators and participants who were then blinded to capsules' content. D2, D3, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 Serum levels were determined blindly on days 0,1,2,3,4,7,14, and 2-weekly thereafter by high performance liquid chromatography assay. The results of 269 participants were available for analysis. Primary endpoint was area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 25(OH)D (25(OH)D2 + 25(OH)D3) adjusted for sex, BMI, and baseline 25(OH)D level.

Results

Mean(SD) age was 33.0(8.5) year, 41% were males, and 85% completed follow-up. Baseline 25(OH)D level was 39.8(11.9) and increased by 3.3(11.6) and 28.6(16.3) nmol/L, in the placebo and active-treatment groups, respectively. AUC from day 0 to 140 (AUC 140) of 25(OH)D was 40% (D3 daily) to 55% (D3 2-weekly) higher with active-treatment than placebo (p < 0.001). 25(OH)D2 AUC 140 was higher in daily than 2-weekly (17%, p = 0.006) and 4-weekly (20%, p = 0.001) D2-treated groups. 25(OH)D3 AUC 140 was lower in daily than 2-weekly (11%, p = 0.002) and 4-weekly D3-treated groups (10%, p = 0.008). In D2-treated groups, there was 16.4 nmol/L decrease in 25(OH)D3 level that correlated (p < 0.001) with 25(OH)D2 level increase (r = 0.48) and baseline 25(OH)D level (r = 0.58), in one participant with measurable baseline 25(OH)D2 level, D3 caused a similar decrease in 25(OH)D2 level, while in the D2/D3-treated group, 25(OH)D3 level didn't increase. Incremental AUC from day 0 to 7 (AUC 7) of D3 and 25(OH)D3 in D3-treated groups were 118–243% higher and 31–39% lower, respectively, than incremental AUC 7 of D2 and 25(OH)D2 in D2-treated groups. Incremental AUC 7 of D3 and 25(OH)D3 in D3-treated groups and D2 and 25(OH)D2 in D2-treated groups were higher in females than males (55, 13, 64, and 28%, respectively). Baseline 25(OH)D level predicted response to D2 and D3 (p < 0.001), whereas, BMI was significant predictor only for early response to D2.

Conclusions

Effects of D2 and D3 supplements on 25 (OH)D level may be dosing-schedule and sex-dependent. D2-associated reduction in 25(OH)D3 level may be related to total 25(OH)D level rather than being D2-specific. D2 may be 25-hydroxylated faster than D3.

### Clinical review: the role of the parent compound vitamin D with respect to metabolism and function: why clinical dose intervals can affect clinical outcomes [^2b31797c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

There is no doubt that vitamin D must be activated to the hormonal form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D to achieve full biological activity or that many tissues participate in this activation process-be it endocrine or autocrine. We believe that not only is 25-hydroxyvitamin D important to tissue delivery for this activation process, but also that intact vitamin D has a pivotal role in this process.

Objective

In this review, evidence on the vitamin D endocrine/autocrine system is presented and discussed in relation to vitamin D-binding protein affinity, circulating half-lives, and enzymatic transformations of vitamin D metabolites, and how these affect biological action in any given tissue.

Conclusions

Circulating vitamin D, the parent compound, likely plays an important physiological role with respect to the vitamin D endocrine/autocrine system, as a substrate in many tissues, not originally thought to be important. Based on emerging data from the laboratory, clinical trials, and data on circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D amassed during many decades, it is likely that for the optimal functioning of these systems, significant vitamin D should be available on a daily basis to ensure stable circulating concentrations, implying that variation in vitamin D dosing schedules could have profound effects on the outcomes of clinical trials because of the short circulating half-life of intact vitamin D.

### 'Vitamin D and cognition in older adults': updated international recommendations [^cfbf8017]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypovitaminosis D, a condition that is highly prevalent in older adults aged 65 years and above, is associated with brain changes and dementia. Given the rapidly accumulating and complex contribution of the literature in the field of vitamin D and cognition, clear guidance is needed for researchers and clinicians.

Methods

International experts met at an invitational summit on 'Vitamin D and Cognition in Older Adults'. Based on previous reports and expert opinion, the task force focused on key questions relating to the role of vitamin D in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. Each question was discussed and voted using a Delphi-like approach.

Results

The experts reached an agreement that hypovitaminosis D increases the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults and may alter the clinical presentation as a consequence of related comorbidities; however, at present, vitamin D level should not be used as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker of Alzheimer's disease due to lack of specificity and insufficient evidence. This population should be screened for hypovitaminosis D because of its high prevalence and should receive supplementation, if necessary; but this advice was not specific to cognition. During the debate, the possibility of 'critical periods' during which vitamin D may have its greatest impact on the brain was addressed; whether hypovitaminosis D influences cognition actively through deleterious effects and/or passively by loss of neuroprotection was also considered.

Conclusions

The international task force agreed on five overarching principles related to vitamin D and cognition in older adults. Several areas of uncertainty remain, and it will be necessary to revise the proposed recommendations as new findings become available.

### Vitamin D signalling pathways in cancer: potential for anticancer therapeutics [^1315b39c]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2007). Medium credibility.

Epidemiological studies indicate that vitamin D insufficiency could have an aetiological role in various human cancers. Preclinical research indicates that the active metabolite of vitamin D, 1alpha,25(OH)2D3, also known as calcitriol, or vitamin D analogues might have potential as anticancer agents because their administration has antiproliferative effects, can activate apoptotic pathways and inhibit angiogenesis. In addition, 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 potentiates the anticancer effects of many cytotoxic and antiproliferative anticancer agents. Here, we outline the epidemiological, preclinical and clinical studies that support the development of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 and vitamin D analogues as preventative and therapeutic anticancer agents.

Different Forms of Vitamin D Supplementation

The main supplemental oral forms of vitamin D are cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3) and ergocalciferol (vitamin D 2). Both are readily available without a prescription. Cholecalciferol is the most used form of supplemental vitamin D. Calcidiol (calcifediol, 25(OH)D), the inactive vitamin D metabolite produced in the liver, and other vitamin D analogues, such as calcitriol (1,25(OH) 2 D, the physiologically active form of vitamin D) and alfacalcidol (1-hydroxyvitamin D), are used as prescription medicines in some conditions (Table 4).

### Vitamin-D2 treatment-associated decrease in 25 (OH) D3 level is a reciprocal phenomenon: a randomized controlled trial [^19eb235a]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin-D2 (D2) treatment has been associated with a decrease in 25-hydroxy (25(OH)) vitamin-D3 (D3) level, suggesting that D3 treatment would be preferred to raise total 25(OH) vitamin-D (D) level. We postulated that D2 treatment-associated decrease in 25(OH)D3 level is related to the increase in 25(OH)D level rather than being D2-specific, and thus there would be a similar D3 treatment-associated decrease in 25(OH)D2 level.

Methods

Fifty volunteers were block-randomized to 50,000 IU D2 or placebo orally once (study-1) and fifty volunteers received 50,000 IU D2 orally once and 4 days later block-randomized to 50,000 IU D3 or placebo orally once (study-2). Interventions were concealed from volunteers and research coordinators and blindly-administered. Serum 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 levels were blindly-determined at baseline and days 14, 28, 42, and 56, post-randomization by high performance liquid chromatography assay. Results of 97 participants were analyzed. Primary outcome measure was day-28 D2-associated change in 25(OH)D3 level in study-1 and D3-associated change in 25(OH)D2 level in study-2, adjusted for baseline levels.

Results

Mean (95% confidence interval) difference between the active and placebo arms in the decrease in day-28 25(OH)D3 (study-1) and 25(OH)D2 (study-2) levels was 13.2 (9.7 to 16.6) and 9.8 (5.2 to 14.4) nmol/L, respectively. Corresponding differences at day-56 were 10.8 (6.8 to 14.8) and 1.7 (− 7.6 to 11.1) nmol/L, respectively. The difference between the placebo and active arms in area-under-the-curve at day-28 (AUC 28) and day-56 (AUC 56) were 262.3 (197.8 to 326.7) and 605.1 (446.3 to 784.0) for 25(OH)D3 (study-1) and 282.2 (111.2 to 453.3) and 431.2 (179.3 to 683.2) nmol.d/L for 25(OH)D2 (study-2), respectively. There were significant correlations between day-28 changes in 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 levels in study-1 (rho = − 0.79, p < 0.001) and study-2 (rho = − 0.36, p = 0.01), and between day-28 changes in 25(OH)D2 level and baseline 25(OH)D level in study-2 (rho = − 0.42, p = 0.003).

Conclusions

Compared to placebo, D3 treatment is associated with a decrease in 25(OH)D2 level similar in magnitude to D2-treatment associated decrease in 25(OH)D3 level; however, the D3-placebo difference in 25(OH)D2 level is shorter-lasting. Changes in 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 levels are correlated with each other and with baseline 25 (OH) D levels, suggesting a common regulatory mechanism.

### Effects of exercise alone or combined with cognitive training and vitamin D supplementation to improve cognition in adults with mild cognitive impairment: a randomized clinical trial [^c636a89d]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Exercise, cognitive training, and vitamin D may enhance cognition in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

Objective

To determine whether aerobic-resistance exercises would improve cognition relative to an active control and if a multidomain intervention including exercises, computerized cognitive training, and vitamin D supplementation would show greater improvements than exercise alone.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial (the SYNERGIC Study) was a multisite, double-masked, fractional factorial trial that evaluated the effects of aerobic-resistance exercise, computerized cognitive training, and vitamin D on cognition. Eligible participants were between ages 65 and 84 years with MCI enrolled from September 19, 2016, to April 7, 2020. Data were analyzed from February 2021 to December 2022.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to 5 study arms and treated for 20 weeks: arm 1 (multidomain intervention with exercise, cognitive training, and vitamin D), arm 2 (exercise, cognitive training, and placebo vitamin D), arm 3 (exercise, sham cognitive training, and vitamin D), arm 4 (exercise, sham cognitive training, and placebo vitamin D), and arm 5 (control group with balance-toning exercise, sham cognitive training, and placebo vitamin D). The vitamin D regimen was a 10 000 IU dose 3 times weekly.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were changes in ADAS-Cog-13 and Plus variant at 6 months.

Results

Among 175 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 73.1 [6.6] years; 86 [49.1%] women), 144 (82%) completed the intervention and 133 (76%) completed the follow-up (month 12). At 6 months, all active arms (ie, arms 1 through 4) with aerobic-resistance exercise regardless of the addition of cognitive training or vitamin D, improved ADAS-Cog-13 when compared with control (mean difference, -1.79 points; 95% CI, -3.27 to -0.31 points; P = 0.02; d = 0.64). Compared with exercise alone (arms 3 and 4), exercise and cognitive training (arms 1 and 2) improved the ADAS-Cog-13 (mean difference, -1.45 points; 95% CI, -2.70 to -0.21 points; P = 0.02; d = 0.39). No significant improvement was found with vitamin D. Finally, the multidomain intervention (arm 1) improved the ADAS-Cog-13 score significantly compared with control (mean difference, -2.64 points; 95% CI, -4.42 to -0.80 points; P = 0.005; d = 0.71). Changes in ADAS-Cog-Plus were not significant.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this clinical trial, older adults with MCI receiving aerobic-resistance exercises with sequential computerized cognitive training significantly improved cognition, although some results were inconsistent. Vitamin D supplementation had no effect. Our findings suggest that this multidomain intervention may improve cognition and potentially delay dementia onset in MCI.

### Avoidance of vitamin D deficiency to slow the COVID-19 pandemic [^f800b335]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Current evidence for a role of vitamin D in fighting respiratory infections

The active vitamin D metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) is produced in immune cells and stimulates there the expression of numerous genes related to a healthy immune response. Examples of 1,25D-related actions are the accelerated maturation and recruitment of macrophages, promotion of phagocytosis, increased production of cathelicidin, defensins and other antibacterial peptides. 1,25D also appears to act on various types of epithelial cells and trigger their own immune-defensive mechanisms. Another important benefit of sufficient vitamin D status may be its suppressive effect on excessive cytokine release which can be a lethal consequence of severe respiratory virus infections.

A recent editorial pointed out that countries below the latitude 35° North and all the way across the southern hemisphere see lower COVID-19 mortality rates than countries further to the north. The authors hypothesise that lower capacity to produce vitamin D at higher northern latitudes at this time of the year impairs vitamin D status, which then could be a cause for the observed high mortality.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^dc64b4b4]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Growing preclinical and clinical observations associating vitamin D with many health clinical conditions have been progressively reported in recent years. However, the lack of rigorous methodologies on patient enrollment, vitamin D supplements, and standardized laboratory assays have limited the ability to draw definitive conclusions about these data that still need to be more clearly understood.

Thus, a "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation derived from an international expert panel discussion about controversial topics regarding vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation is needed to help the scientific community in evaluating and conducting future further studies with more rigorous methodologies, to better explore any clinical setting potentially influenced by vitamin D, and to provide reliable data required to update our international recommendations.

Vitamin D Metabolism and Mechanism of Action

Metabolism

Vitamin D 3 is produced in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC), while both vitamin D 2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) can be present in the diet. Vitamin D 2 and D 3 are hydroxylated first in the liver (and other tissues) to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and then in the kidney (and other tissues) to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2 D). Both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2 D are subsequently metabolized to their 24 (and for D 3 23) hydroxy forms 24,25(OH) 2 D 2/3, 23,25(OH) 2 D 3, and 1,24,25(OH) 3 D 2/3 (or 1,23,25(OH) 3 D 3). Like other steroid hormones, vitamin D is highly lipophilic and bound to protein carriers that help maintain stable serum levels. The half-life of serum 25(OH)D is 2 to 3 weeks, and that of the more water-soluble 1,25(OH) 2 D is approximately 5 to 8 hours. The majority of circulating 25(OH)D, including its metabolites, are bound tightly by vitamin D binding protein (DBP) and more loosely bound by albumin.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^17ef9153]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D dosing in adults aged 50 years and older with indications for supplementation or treatment: Recommendation 11 states, "we suggest, daily, lower-dose vitamin D instead of non-daily, higher-dose vitamin D. (2 | ⊕⊕⊕◯)." The evidence base included 2 trials with 537 participants directly comparing intermittent high-dose vs daily lower-dose regimens, and an expanded review of 19 manuscripts from 15 studies involving 53 527 participants. Daily vitamin D doses ranged from 400 to 800 IU (10–20 µg), while non-daily regimens included 50 000 IU (1250 µg) every 2 weeks, 60 000–100 000 IU (1500–2500 µg) monthly, and 96 000–150 000 IU (2400–3750 µg) every 2 to 4 months. There was a trend for intermittent high-dose vitamin D to increase fracture risk (RR 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98–1.19]), with an estimated absolute effect of 5 more participants with a fracture per 1000 (1 fewer to 11 more). We did not identify evidence related to individuals younger than age 50 years.

### Molecular biomarkers in localized prostate cancer: ASCO guideline [^f4126154]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Active surveillance eligibility and genomic biomarkers in localized prostate cancer — evidence and use: Recent data suggest that the use of these tests will affect decisions for some patients, but longer-term data will be needed to validate whether this leads to improvements in quality of life or cancer-specific outcomes, and given ProtecT trial data showing relatively low metastasis or prostate cancer–specific mortality with active monitoring, additional prognostic information may only be necessary for a subset being considered for surveillance such as higher volume Grade Group 1, favorable intermediate risk (Grade Group 2, percentage of positive biopsy cores < 50%, and no more than one NCCN intermediate-risk factor), discordant features (e.g., palpable mass with Grade Group 1), or features associated with progression while on active surveillance (e.g., high PSA density and certain germline or somatic mutations). For otherwise healthy men with Grade Group 3 or higher cancer, there are no strong data or expert guidelines to support active surveillance; therefore, we would consider the use of genomic biomarkers only in situations in which the assay result, when considered as a whole with routine clinical factors, is likely to affect a physician's recommendation or a patient's choice for surveillance versus treatment, but they should not be used routinely. Emerging evidence suggests that specific germline mutations — BRCA2, in particular — may predispose to more aggressive prostate cancers and higher grade reclassification while on active surveillance; it remains unclear whether these men would benefit from early treatment, more frequent surveillance, or standard surveillance, and at minimum, close monitoring for those patients with germline mutations who opt for surveillance is prudent.

### Effect of clopidogrel added to aspirin in patients with atrial fibrillation [^2f40e4f3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

The study ACTIVE A was published by ACTIVE Investigators and colleagues in 2009 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Atrial fibrillation, Acute ischemic stroke and Transient ischemic attack. In the ACTIVE A study, the trial question was: what is the effect of clopidogrel addition to aspirin in patients with AF for whom vitamin K-antagonist therapy was unsuitable? In the ACTIVE A study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ACTIVE A study, the population was: 7554 patients (3157 female, 4397 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with AF who had an increased risk of stroke and for whom vitamin K-antagonist therapy was unsuitable. The key exclusion criteria were requirement of a VKA or clopidogrel, documented peptic ulcer disease within the previous 6 months, history of intracerebral hemorrhage, significant thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50×10⁹/L), or ongoing alcohol abuse. In the ACTIVE A study, the interventions were: n = 3772 clopidogrel (at a dose of 75 mg once daily plus aspirin 75–100 mg/day) n = 3782 placebo (matching placebo once daily plus aspirin 75–100 mg/day). In the ACTIVE A study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the incidence of stroke, myocardial infarction, non-CNS systemic embolism, or death from vascular causes, at a median of 3.6 years of follow-up (6.8% / y vs. 7.6% / y; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98). In the ACTIVE A study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in the incidence of stroke (2.4% / y vs. 3.3% / y; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.83) No significant difference in the incidence of myocardial infarction (0.7% / y vs. 0.9% / y; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.03). In the ACTIVE A study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in major bleeding (2.0% vs. 1.3%, p < 0.001; RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.29–1.92). In the ACTIVE A study, the conclusion was: in patients with AF who had an increased risk of stroke and for whom vitamin K-antagonist therapy was unsuitable, clopidogrel was superior to placebo with respect to the incidence of stroke, myocardial infarction, non-CNS systemic embolism, or death from vascular causes, at a median of 3.6 years of follow-up.

### Vitamin D metabolites and the gut microbiome in older men [^04957728]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Here we show that in 567 community-dwelling older men, higher levels of the biologically active form (1,25(OH) 2 D) and vitamin D activation and catabolism ratios, but not 25(OH)D, are associated with greater α-diversity. In addition, those men with the highest compared to lowest 1,25(OH) 2 D and activation ratios are more likely to possess butyrate-producing bacteria that are associated with favorable gut microbial health. These results support the underlying hypothesis that the human gut microbiome and vitamin D metabolism are integrally related.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^a8efceef]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

D-dimer, a soluble fibrin degradation product that originates from plasmin-induced degradation of cross-linked fibrin, is an important biomarker of coagulation activation and secondary fibrinolysis that is routinely used to rule out venous thromboembolism (VTE), and to evaluate the risk of VTE recurrence, as well as the optimal duration of anticoagulant therapy. Besides VTE, D-dimer may be high due to physiologic conditions, including aging, pregnancy, and strenuous physical activity. In addition, several disorders have been associated with increased D-dimer levels, ranging from disseminated intravascular coagulation to infectious diseases and cancers. Thus, it is far from unusual for hematologists to have to deal with ambulatory individuals with increased D-dimer without signs or symptoms of thrombus formation. This narrative review is dedicated to the management of these cases by the hematologist.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^8247842f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society vitamin D guideline — scope and methods: The objective is to develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower disease risk in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Background notes associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations and multiple conditions, while acknowledging that the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain. Methods state that the panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that exceeds Dietary Reference Intakes and is implemented without 25(OH)D testing, used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess certainty and guide recommendations, and clarify that the process was not designed to replace current Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D.

### Vitamin D: extraskeletal health [^110c9d1c]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency and likely the most common medical condition in the world. The major cause of vitamin D deficiency has been the lack of appreciation that the body requires 5- to 10-fold higher intakes than is currently recommended by health agencies. There is now overwhelming and compelling scientific and epidemiologic data suggesting that the human body requires a blood level of 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL for maximum health. To increase the blood level to the minimum 30 ng/mL requires the ingestion of at least 1000 IU of vitamin D per day for adults. In general, there is no downside to increasing either a child's or adult's vitamin D intake.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^fdc15763]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The metabolism, mechanisms of action, and pathophysiology of vitamin D and its multifaceted implications in human health have been extensively investigated for more than a century. However, the role of vitamin D status assessment and the detailed outcomes of vitamin D deficiency and its supplementation are still not completely understood. Thus, we extensively reviewed the literature on controversial vitamin D topics to better clarify and summarize the "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation in generally healthy populations and clinical conditions.

Vitamin D metabolism involves a different extensive panel of enzymes, resulting in various hormonal metabolites. Moreover, the VDR has been demonstrated to act as a key role transcription factor in most cells and can regulate a plethora of genes. New insights into the regulation of vitamin D–related enzymes and the differential mechanism of action of VDR have demonstrated potential links between several metabolic disorders and vitamin D effects. In this perspective, assessing a distinctive pattern of noncanonical vitamin D metabolites may allow us to better characterize different pathological conditions related to vitamin D metabolism that do not depend only on reduced solar exposure or vitamin D diet intake.

Besides the potential utility of the evaluation of noncanonical vitamin D metabolites, 25(OH)D is nowadays the most widely accepted biomarker to evaluate vitamin D status; however, its optimal levels are still debated. Recommendations on optimal 25(OH)D levels deriving from international societies and guidelines can differ due to the different approaches used, including clinical perspectives (level of cutoff at which no individual has an undesirable outcome) or public health perspectives (level of cutoff at which 97.5% of individuals do not have an undesirable outcome). Another critical issue is the lack of an accepted laboratory test assay standardization, and this prevents a proper interpretation of data reported by different studies, resulting in enabling rational data pooling and implementation of meta-analyses focused on vitamin D influence in various clinical outcomes of interest. Thus, 25(OH)D laboratory assays should be monitored in their performance through external quality assessment plans providing target reference values from standardized measurement procedures.

### Effect of oral alfacalcidol on clinical outcomes in patients without secondary hyperparathyroidism receiving maintenance hemodialysis: the J-DAVID randomized clinical trial [^894a13fa]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Patients with chronic kidney disease have impaired vitamin D activation and elevated cardiovascular risk. Observational studies in patients treated with hemodialysis showed that the use of active vitamin D sterols was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality, regardless of parathyroid hormone levels.

Objective

To determine whether vitamin D receptor activators reduce cardiovascular events and mortality in patients without secondary hyperparathyroidism undergoing hemodialysis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, open-label, blinded end point multicenter study of 1289 patients in 207 dialysis centers in Japan. The study included 976 patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis with serum intact parathyroid hormone levels less than or equal to 180 pg/mL. The first and last participants were enrolled on August 18, 2008, and January 26, 2011, respectively. The final date of follow-up was April 4, 2015.

Interventions

Treatment with 0.5 μg of oral alfacalcidol per day (intervention group; n = 495) vs treatment without vitamin D receptor activators (control group; n = 481).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a composite measure of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarctions, hospitalizations for congestive heart failure, stroke, aortic dissection/rupture, amputation of lower limb due to ischemia, and cardiac sudden death; coronary revascularization; and leg artery revascularization during 48 months of follow-up. The secondary outcome was all-cause death.

Results

Among 976 patients who were randomized from 108 dialysis centers, 964 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (median age, 65 years; 386 women [40.0%]), and 944 (97.9%) completed the trial. During follow-up (median, 4.0 years), the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular events occurred in 103 of 488 patients (21.1%) in the intervention group and 85 of 476 patients (17.9%) in the control group (absolute difference, 3.25% [95% CI, -1.75% to 8.24%]; hazard ratio, 1.25 [95% CI, 0.94–1.67]; P = 0.13). There was no significant difference in the secondary outcome of all-cause mortality between the groups (18.2% vs 16.8%, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.83–1.52]; P = 0.46). Of the 488 participants in the intervention group, 199 (40.8%) experienced serious adverse events that were classified as cardiovascular, 64 (13.1%) experienced adverse events classified as infection, and 22 (4.5%) experienced malignancy-related serious adverse events. Of 476 participants in the control group, 191 (40.1%) experienced cardiovascular-related serious adverse events, 63 (13.2%) experienced infection-related serious adverse events, and 21 (4.4%) experienced malignancy-related adverse events.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients without secondary hyperparathyroidism undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, oral alfacalcidol compared with usual care did not reduce the risk of a composite measure of select cardiovascular events. These findings do not support the use of vitamin D receptor activators for patients such as these.

### American cancer society guideline for diet and physical activity for cancer prevention [^e64c4815]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Vitamin D and cancer prevention — To date, the most consistent evidence for a cancer risk–lowering effect of vitamin D is for colorectal cancer, yet evidence from RCTs for the prevention of colorectal adenomas or cancer have not supported an association. The Vitamin D and Omega‑3 Trial (VITAL) of 2000 IU of vitamin D per day found no association of vitamin D supplementation with all incident cancers combined, reported overall lower cancer mortality, and reported no adverse events with taking 2000 IU daily over the 6‑year trial. Based on current evidence, the US Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend widespread screening of vitamin D levels; despite recent improvements, ≥ 25% of US teens and adults have insufficient (< 50 nmol/L) vitamin D blood concentrations.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^ac90b227]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: to D or not to D? [^08be1b6f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Answers to clinically important questions are rarely dichotomous ("positive" or "negative"), and a recommendation of whether "to D or not to D" should be made based on the best available data from both observational studies and clinical trials. Results from trials are congruent with a large body of evidence from observational studies indicating that vitamin D has a role in modulating diabetes risk. We are awaiting the full publication of the DPVD study and results from individual participant data meta-analyses. Even if the risk reduction with vitamin D supplementation may appear relatively small, when applied in the expanding prediabetes population, it can have important public health implications.

Vitamin D and obesity — research priorities emphasize definitive trials to define benefit thresholds, targets, and dosing. The guideline notes that "Large RCTs in participants with obesity will be required to determine if vitamin D lowers the risk of disease, whether benefit is limited to those with low baseline levels (and defining what these levels are), what target levels are required for optimal disease prevention, and what dosages are required to achieve these target levels/desired outcomes." It adds that "inclusion of several daily dosages and targeting several levels of 25(OH)D would inform the dosages and target levels required for disease prevention," and that "Clinical trials must be designed to be of sufficient duration to address the outcomes being examined," considering disease natural history and pathophysiology.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^0bfb779e]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetes

Despite observational studies consistently confirming lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations in patients with T2D or metabolic syndrome, most MR studies have not supported these conclusions. In a small subgroup of individuals with obesity and prediabetes, supplementation provided some modest benefit, albeit lower than lifestyle modifications or metformin. Of note, daily vitamin D supplementation (4000 IU) in the large D2d trial did not retard the progression of prediabetes into T2D. A post hoc and meta-analysis, however, suggested a possible beneficial effect in individuals with vitamin D deficiency (< 30 nmol/L) at baseline or in participants who were able to achieve consistently high (≥ 100 nmol/L) serum 25(OH)D levels. Furthermore, analysis of the combined results of the D2d (US), Tromsø (Norway), and DPVD (Japan) RCTs — which were specifically designed and conducted to test whether vitamin D reduces the risk of diabetes in adults with prediabetes — showed that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of developing T2D in people with prediabetes not selected for vitamin D deficiency. In all 3 trials, the risk for diabetes was reduced in the group assigned to vitamin D compared to the placebo group, which did so in a remarkably similar way. The observed differences missed statistical significance in any trial because the reported risk reductions were smaller than each trial was powered to detect. An updated individual participant data meta-analysis of the same trials showed that vitamin D reduced the risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes by 15%. Also, vitamin D increased the likelihood of regression to normal glucose regulation by 30%, with no evidence of risk. In additional analyses, participants in the vitamin D group who maintained intratrial blood 25(OH)D of 50 ng/mL or greater (≥ 125 nmol/L) had a 76% risk reduction in new-onset diabetes compared to those who maintained blood 25(OH)D of 20 to 29 ng/mL (50–75 nmol/L). All participants received and were encouraged to follow the current lifestyle-based advice for diabetes prevention. Based on the results of this meta-analysis, the benefit-to-risk ratio of vitamin D to lower the risk of developing T2D in adults with prediabetes is favorable. These results should not be extrapolated to the general population at low or average risk for diabetes, as the benefit-to-risk ratio of high doses for diabetes prevention may not be favorable. Despite these promising results, some questions remain, that is, the optimal vitamin D dose or formulation and the specific blood 25(OH)D level to maximize benefit with little or no risk of any side effects.

### Creating active environments across the life course: "thinking outside the square" [^30ed9ff2]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The built environment and physical activity agenda provides a unique opportunity for public health, physical activity and planning researchers to be front and centre of a movement aimed at creating healthier and more sustainable environments. However, in order to optimise environments that encourage physical activity across the life course, researchers in this field need to think beyond their "square" -that is, the target group, setting and physical activity behaviour with which they work. We suggest that researchers working in this field need a better understanding of systems theory to appreciate that a change to one part of a complex system can positively and negatively influence other parts of the system. An understanding of systems theory would help minimise unintended negative consequences to other population subgroups or to other types of physical activity from the implementation of our research findings. In this way, a more comprehensive set of research, practice and programme-related activities may emerge, which will advance physical activity research and practice, and improve population health across the life course.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^0ced8a43]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Respiratory effects

Vitamin D is known to influence the immune system. Most immune cells express the VDR and vitamin D metabolism–related enzymes; 1,25(OH) 2 D, in particular, induces innate antimicrobial effector mechanisms such as the antimicrobial peptides cathelicidin LL-37 and human beta-defensin 2. Indeed, clinical data regarding the effects of adequate vitamin D status and supplementation on respiratory infections confirm, at least in part, its potential beneficial outcomes. Serum 25(OH)D levels of less than 25 nmol/L are associated (observationally and genetically) with an increased risk of bacterial pneumonia. Individual participant data from a meta-analysis of 25 trials showed a small but significant decrease in the incidence of acute respiratory infections in the vitamin D group compared with the control group when baseline vitamin D status was poor (< 25 nmol/L). A more recent, updated meta-analysis from the same group, including almost 50 RCTs, shows a protective but very small effect against respiratory infections following vitamin D supplementation with daily doses of 400 to 1000 IU; in contrast to their first meta-analysis, baseline vitamin D status did not modify the results in this more recent one.

### The role of the pediatrician in the promotion of healthy, active living [^310873ac]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Physical activity counseling and targets — according to the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines, preschool-aged children (3–5 years of age) should be physically active throughout the day, with a goal of 15 minutes of physical activity per 1 hour. For children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age, recommendations are to engage in at least 60 minutes of physical activity per day, with the majority being moderate- or vigorous-intensity cardiovascular activity and with at least 3 days per week of vigorous-intensity exercise; part of their 60 minutes should include muscle and bone strengthening activities at least 3 days per week. Although the guidelines do not address 0 to 2 years of age, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that pediatricians monitor and encourage the development of gross motor skills and physical literacy throughout childhood. Habitual physical activity and reduced sedentary time promote better cardiovascular, metabolic, musculoskeletal, and cognitive outcomes and positively impact mental health and social functioning in all children and adolescents, including those with disabilities. Pediatricians should discuss and encourage physical activity starting in infancy with an emphasis on tummy time, initially minimizing time in confining equipment such as strollers, car seats, walkers, and "exersaucers." Practical counseling points include that walking can be an ideal, low or no cost family activity when safe places exist; the pediatrician has an essential role in protecting unstructured play and outdoor play; families can be encouraged to avoid early commitment to a single sport; and in adolescence the focus should be on developing a habit promoting a lifetime of sustainable activity.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, or a strength-training exercise program on clinical outcomes in older adults: the DO-HEALTH randomized clinical trial [^8b16f209]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The benefits of vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, and exercise in disease prevention remain unclear.

Objective

To test whether vitamin D, omega-3s, and a strength-training exercise program, alone or in combination, improved 6 health outcomes among older adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2×2×2 factorial randomized clinical trial among 2157 adults aged 70 years or older who had no major health events in the 5 years prior to enrollment and had sufficient mobility and good cognitive status. Patients were recruited between December 2012 and November 2014, and final follow-up was in November 2017.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to 3 years of intervention in 1 of the following 8 groups: 2000 IU/d of vitamin D3, 1 g/d of omega-3s, and a strength-training exercise program (n = 264); vitamin D3 and omega-3s (n = 265); vitamin D3 and exercise (n = 275); vitamin D3 alone (n = 272); omega-3s and exercise (n = 275); omega-3s alone (n = 269); exercise alone (n = 267); or placebo (n = 270).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The 6 primary outcomes were change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and incidence rates (IRs) of nonvertebral fractures and infections over 3 years. Based on multiple comparisons of 6 primary end points, 99% confidence intervals are presented and P < .01 was required for statistical significance.

Results

Among 2157 randomized participants (mean age, 74.9 years; 61.7% women), 1900 (88%) completed the study. Median follow-up was 2.99 years. Overall, there were no statistically significant benefits of any intervention individually or in combination for the 6 end points at 3 years. For instance, the differences in mean change in systolic BP with vitamin D vs no vitamin D and with omega-3s vs no omega-3s were both -0.8 (99% CI, -2.1 to 0.5) mm Hg, with P < .13 and P < .11, respectively; the difference in mean change in diastolic BP with omega-3s vs no omega-3s was -0.5 (99% CI, -1.2 to 0.2) mm Hg; P = 0.06); and the difference in mean change in IR of infections with omega-3s vs no omega-3s was -0.13 (99% CI, -0.23 to -0.03), with an IR ratio of 0.89 (99% CI, 0.78–1.01; P = 0.02). No effects were found on the outcomes of SPPB, MoCA, and incidence of nonvertebral fractures). A total of 25 deaths were reported, with similar numbers in all treatment groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults without major comorbidities aged 70 years or older, treatment with vitamin D3, omega-3s, or a strength-training exercise program did not result in statistically significant differences in improvement in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, nonvertebral fractures, physical performance, infection rates, or cognitive function. These findings do not support the effectiveness of these 3 interventions for these clinical outcomes.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on markers of vascular function: a systematic review and individual participant meta-analysis [^ea9d5456]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, but the effect of vitamin D supplementation on markers of vascular function associated with major adverse cardiovascular events is unclear.

Methods and Results

We conducted a systematic review and individual participant meta-analysis to examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery, pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, central blood pressure, microvascular function, and reactive hyperemia index. MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and http://www. ClinicalTrials.gov were searched until the end of 2016 without language restrictions. Placebo-controlled randomized trials of at least 4 weeks duration were included. Individual participant data were sought from investigators on included trials. Trial-level meta-analysis was performed using random-effects models; individual participant meta-analyses used a 2-stage analytic strategy, examining effects in prespecified subgroups. 31 trials (2751 participants) were included; 29 trials (2641 participants) contributed data to trial-level meta-analysis, and 24 trials (2051 participants) contributed to individual-participant analyses. Vitamin D3 daily dose equivalents ranged from 900 to 5000 IU; duration was 4 weeks to 12 months. Trial-level meta-analysis showed no significant effect of supplementation on macrovascular measures (flow-mediated dilatation, 0.37% [95% confidence interval, -0.23 to 0.97]; carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, 0.00 m/s [95% confidence interval, -0.36 to 0.37]); similar results were obtained from individual participant data. Microvascular function showed a modest improvement in trial-level data only. No consistent benefit was observed in subgroup analyses or between different vitamin D analogues.

Conclusions

Vitamin D supplementation had no significant effect on most markers of vascular function in this analysis.

### Engagement and education: care of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: CHEST consensus statement [^de38e29a]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST consensus statement — public engagement and community guidance during resource allocation emphasizes that effective public engagement will require active and ongoing planning in concert with critical care providers to engender trust in MCC decisions, and suggests using credible and respected clinicians to play an active role in disaster planning deliberations and integrating these clinicians into public-private partnerships with governmental agencies and health-care institutions, including academic medical centers. Key community partnerships involve volunteer, faith-based, and nongovernmental community-based clinicians, and once these partnerships are established, it is important to share best practices and models communities have undertaken to address MCC, then implement and deploy these practices to engage families and provide guidance during resource allocation situations, with particular attention to especially vulnerable populations such as those with specific functional needs and those who have historically been marginalized. The task force notes that critical care providers need to be actively involved in community engagement initiatives, yet there is no clear mechanism to ensure these opportunities exists.

### Cough due to TB and other chronic infections: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1e2c8027]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

Active case finding (ACF) plus public health awareness vs PCF only — In individuals with cough ≥ 2 wk, sectors with ACF and PCF and without (PCF only) public health campaigns assessed the number of smear-positive pulmonary TB cases (case detection rate) and reported that in public awareness sectors the number of smear-positive pulmonary TB cases increased 11% over the same time the previous year vs 0.8% increase in PCF-only sectors, with numbers screened increased 87.8% vs 16.6%; the key message states that a public health awareness program encouraging individuals with cough ≥ 2 wk to present for screening, added to PCF, increased the numbers screened and the case detection rate of pulmonary TB; limitations included that it was unclear whether the study was implemented correctly, the ACF and PCF cohort was compared with the previous time period, demographic characteristics of the two groups were not provided, and power calculations and exclusion criteria were not provided.

Communication models for breaking bad news — examples of models of breaking bad news and communication — include the following structured approaches. Death Disclosure and Delivery of Difficult News in Trauma outlines: A: Anticipate; B: Be aware of self and surroundings; C: Conversation / Concerns; D: Do not speak, LISTEN; E: Empathy / Explain; Debrief and Document. The "Ask-Tell-Ask" model advises: ASK the individual what he/she knows; TELL "bad news" in straightforward language; ASK if the information was understood. The SPIKES model lists: SETTING UP the interview; Assessing the patient's PERCEPTION; Obtaining the patient's INVITATION; Giving KNOWLEDGE and information to the patient; Addressing the patient's EMOTIONS with EMPATHIC responses; STRATEGY and SUMMARY. The ABCDE's of delivering bad news include: ADVANCE preparation; BUILD a therapeutic environment/relationship; COMMUNICATE well; DEAL with patient and family reactions; ENCOURAGE and validate emotions. The Surgical Palliative Care Resident's Guide emphasizes: speak slowly, deliberately, and clearly; give fair warning; present bad news in a succinct manner; sit quietly and listen to the patient; anticipate common reactions to bad news; listen carefully and actively; pick up clues; recognize, acknowledge, and validate the patient's and family's emotions, reactions, and thoughts; give an early opportunity for questions and comments; present information at the patient's and family's pace; be flexible and responsive; be mindful; ask, "How can I help?"; assess for thoughts of self-harm; and agree on a follow-up plan.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on markers of vascular function: a systematic review and individual participant meta-analysis [^6cf766b6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Low 25‐hydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, but the effect of vitamin D supplementation on markers of vascular function associated with major adverse cardiovascular events is unclear.

Methods and Results

We conducted a systematic review and individual participant meta‐analysis to examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on flow‐mediated dilatation of the brachial artery, pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, central blood pressure, microvascular function, and reactive hyperemia index. MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, andwere searched until the end of 2016 without language restrictions. Placebo‐controlled randomized trials of at least 4 weeks duration were included. Individual participant data were sought from investigators on included trials. Trial‐level meta‐analysis was performed using random‐effects models; individual participant meta‐analyses used a 2‐stage analytic strategy, examining effects in prespecified subgroups. 31 trials (2751 participants) were included; 29 trials (2641 participants) contributed data to trial‐level meta‐analysis, and 24 trials (2051 participants) contributed to individual‐participant analyses. Vitamin D3 daily dose equivalents ranged from 900 to 5000 IU; duration was 4 weeks to 12 months. Trial‐level meta‐analysis showed no significant effect of supplementation on macrovascular measures (flow‐mediated dilatation, 0.37% [95% confidence interval, −0.23 to 0.97]; carotid‐femoral pulse wave velocity, 0.00 m/s [95% confidence interval, −0.36 to 0.37]); similar results were obtained from individual participant data. Microvascular function showed a modest improvement in trial‐level data only. No consistent benefit was observed in subgroup analyses or between different vitamin D analogues.

Conclusions

Vitamin D supplementation had no significant effect on most markers of vascular function in this analysis.

### Daratumumab or active monitoring for high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma [^7b33b747]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study AQUILA was published by Meletios A Dimopoulos and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Smoldering myeloma. In the AQUILA study, the trial question was: what is the role of daratumumab monotherapy in patients with high-risk smoldering myeloma? In the AQUILA study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the AQUILA study, the population was: 390 patients (202 female, 188 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with high-risk smoldering myeloma. The key exclusion criteria were multiple myeloma requiring treatment; primary systemic amyloid light-chain amyloidosis; prior exposure to daratumumab; ongoing treatment with other monoclonal antibodies; receipt of treatment for malignancy in the past 3 years; medical or psychiatric condition or disease. In the AQUILA study, the interventions were: n = 194 daratumumab (subcutaneous dose of 1,800 mg on a weekly basis in cycles 1–2, every 2 weeks in cycles 3–6, and every 4 weeks thereafter in 28-day cycles continued for up to 39 cycles or for 36 months) n = 196 active monitoring (no disease-specific treatment for 36 months or until confirmation of disease progression). In the AQUILA study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in progression-free survival (65.5% vs. 49.5%; HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.49 to 2.78). In the AQUILA study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in overall survival (92.3% vs. 86.7%; HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.7) Significant decrease in initiation of first-line treatment (33.2% vs. 53.6%; HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.62). In the AQUILA study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in hypertension. In the AQUILA study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with high-risk smoldering myeloma, daratumumab was superior to active monitoring with respect to a progression-free survival.

### Differential effects of oral boluses of vitamin D2 vs vitamin D3 on vitamin D metabolism: a randomized controlled trial [^14a0e9e6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Context

Vitamin D 2 and vitamin D 3 have been hypothesized to exert differential effects on vitamin D metabolism.

Objective

To compare the influence of administering vitamin D 2 vs vitamin D 3 on metabolism of vitamin D 3.

Methods

We measured baseline and 4-month serum concentrations of vitamin D 3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 [25(OH)D 3], 25-hydroxyvitamin D 2, 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [24R,25(OH) 2 D 3], 1 α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3], and 4 β,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3] in 52 adults randomized to receive a total of four oral bolus doses of 2.5 mg vitamin D 2 (n = 28) or vitamin D 3 (n = 24) over four months. Metabolite-to-parent compound ratios were calculated to estimate hydroxylase activity. Pairwise before vs after comparisons were made to evaluate effects of vitamin D 2 and vitamin D 3 on metabolism of vitamin D. Mean postsupplementation metabolite-to-parent ratios were then compared between groups.

Results

Vitamin D 2 was less effective than vitamin D 3 in elevating total serum 25(OH)D concentration. Vitamin D 2 suppressed mean four-month serum concentrations of 25(OH)D 3, 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3, 1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3, and 4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3 and mean ratios of 25(OH)D 3 to D 3 and 1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3, while increasing the mean ratio of 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3. Vitamin D 3 increased mean four-month serum concentrations of 25(OH)D 3, 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3, 1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3, and 4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3 and the mean ratio of 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3. Participants receiving vitamin D 2 had lower mean postsupplementation ratios of 25(OH)D 3 to vitamin D 3 and 1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3 than those receiving vitamin D 3. Mean postsupplementation ratios of 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3 and 4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3 did not differ between groups.

Conclusions

Bolus-dose vitamin D 2 is less effective than bolus-dose vitamin D 3 in elevating total serum 25(OH)D concentration. Administration of vitamin D 2 reduces 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D 3 and 1- α hydroxylation of 25(OH)D 3, while increasing 24R-hydroxylation of 25(OH)D 3.

### Monthly high-dose vitamin D treatment for the prevention of functional decline: a randomized clinical trial [^c7bf66cd]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with poor physical performance.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness of high-dose vitamin D in lowering the risk of functional decline.

Design, Setting, and Participants

One-year, double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted in Zurich, Switzerland. The screening phase was December 1, 2009, to May 31, 2010, and the last study visit was in May 2011. The dates of our analysis were June 15, 2012, to October 10, 2015. Participants were 200 community-dwelling men and women 70 years and older with a prior fall.

Interventions

Three study groups with monthly treatments, including a low-dose control group receiving 24,000 IU of vitamin D3 (24,000 IU group), a group receiving 60,000 IU of vitamin D3 (60,000 IU group), and a group receiving 24,000 IU of vitamin D3 plus 300 μg of calcifediol (24,000 IU plus calcifediol group).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was improving lower extremity function (on the Short Physical Performance Battery) and achieving 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of at least 30 ng/mL at 6 and 12 months. A secondary end point was monthly reported falls. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index.

Results

The study cohort comprised 200 participants (men and women ≥ 70 years with a prior fall). Their mean age was 78 years, 67.0% (134 of 200) were female, and 58.0% (116 of 200) were vitamin D deficient (< 20 ng/mL) at baseline. Intent-to-treat analyses showed that, while 60,000 IU and 24,000 IU plus calcifediol were more likely than 24,000 IU to result in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of at least 30 ng/mL (P = 0.001), they were not more effective in improving lower extremity function, which did not differ among the treatment groups (P = 0.26). However, over the 12-month follow-up, the incidence of falls differed significantly among the treatment groups, with higher incidences in the 60,000 IU group (66.9%; 95% CI, 54.4% to 77.5%) and the 24,000 IU plus calcifediol group (66.1%; 95% CI, 53.5%-76.8%) group compared with the 24,000 IU group (47.9%; 95% CI, 35.8%-60.3%) (P = 0.048). Consistent with the incidence of falls, the mean number of falls differed marginally by treatment group. The 60,000 IU group (mean, 1.47) and the 24,000 IU plus calcifediol group (mean, 1.24) had higher mean numbers of falls compared with the 24,000 IU group (mean, 0.94) (P = 0.09).

Conclusions and Relevance

Although higher monthly doses of vitamin D were effective in reaching a threshold of at least 30 ng/mL of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, they had no benefit on lower extremity function and were associated with increased risk of falls compared with 24,000 IU.

### Medical training to achieve competency in lifestyle counseling: an essential foundation for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases and other chronic medical conditions: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^f0a6b253]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Physical activity burden and clinical counseling — epidemiology and care processes are highlighted, including that "Only 21% of US adults currently meet the 2008 federal physical activity guidelines for both aerobic and strength training," while "objective measurements of physical activity levels by accelerometry demonstrated that only 8% of US adolescents meet recommended levels of physical activity." The statement notes that "physical inactivity is the fourth-leading cause of death worldwide" and that "approximately one-third of the world's population is not meeting minimal recommendations for physical activity." For clinical practice, "Assessment of physical activity includes a basic history, questionnaires, or logs but could be complemented by diverse current and upcoming technological tools (eg, pedometers and personal tracking devices and systems) and sometimes the need for referral for more comprehensive testing (eg, stress tests), either for safety or optimal workload for fitness improvement." "Exercise prescription can be performed verbally or in writing with various levels of details depending on the situation and physician preference," and "physicians must be aware that they can refer their patients to allied healthcare professionals (eg, physical therapists, exercise physiologists, and kinesiologists) who can help them to be more active and have the expertise to develop and administer a supervised exercise plan and follow-up in the appropriate situation." Additionally, "As suggested by the National Physical Activity Plan and the American College of Sports Medicine, physicians should be personally aware of and engaged in an active lifestyle not only for their own health benefits but also to serve as role models for their patients."

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Pyrazinamide is indicated for the initial treatment of active tuberculosis in adults and children when combined with other antituberculous agents. (The current recommendation of the CDC for drug-susceptible disease is to use a six-month regimen for initial treatment of active tuberculosis, consisting of isoniazid, rifampin and pyrazinamide given for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for 4 months.*4)

(Patients with drug-resistant disease should be treated with regimens individualized to their situation. Pyrazinamide frequently will be an important component of such therapy.)

(In patients with concomitant HIV infection, the physician should be aware of current recommendations of CDC. It is possible these patients may require a longer course of treatment.)

It is also indicated after treatment failure with other primary drugs in any form of active tuberculosis.

Pyrazinamide should only be used in conjunction with other effective antituberculous agents.

Context

Vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 have been hypothesized to exert differential effects on vitamin D metabolism.

Objective

To compare the influence of administering vitamin D2 vs vitamin D3 on metabolism of vitamin D3.

Methods

We measured baseline and 4-month serum concentrations of vitamin D3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3], 25-hydroxyvitamin D2, 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [24R,25(OH)2D3], 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1α,25(OH)2D3], and 4β,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [4β,25(OH)2D3] in 52 adults randomized to receive a total of four oral bolus doses of 2.5 mg vitamin D2 (n = 28) or vitamin D3 (n = 24) over four months.

### Vitamin D supplementation and prevention of type 2 diabetes [^2f3dcb14]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Observational studies support an association between a low blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, whether vitamin D supplementation lowers the risk of diabetes is unknown.

Methods

We randomly assigned adults who met at least two of three glycemic criteria for prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose level, 100 to 125 mg per deciliter; plasma glucose level 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose load, 140 to 199 mg per deciliter; and glycated hemoglobin level, 5.7 to 6.4%) and no diagnostic criteria for diabetes to receive 4000 IU per day of vitamin D 3 or placebo, regardless of the baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. The primary outcome in this time-to-event analysis was new-onset diabetes, and the trial design was event-driven, with a target number of diabetes events of 508.

Results

A total of 2423 participants underwent randomization (1211 to the vitamin D group and 1212 to the placebo group). By month 24, the mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in the vitamin D group was 54.3 ng per milliliter (from 27.7 ng per milliliter at baseline), as compared with 28.8 ng per milliliter in the placebo group (from 28.2 ng per milliliter at baseline). After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, the primary outcome of diabetes occurred in 293 participants in the vitamin D group and 323 in the placebo group (9.39 and 10.66 events per 100 person-years, respectively). The hazard ratio for vitamin D as compared with placebo was 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.04; P = 0.12). The incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Conclusions

Among persons at high risk for type 2 diabetes not selected for vitamin D insufficiency, vitamin D 3 supplementation at a dose of 4000 IU per day did not result in a significantly lower risk of diabetes than placebo.

### "Having diabetes shouldn' T stop them": healthcare professionals' perceptions of physical activity in children with type 1 diabetes [^b75d048b]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Professional expertise supports the child's existing lifestyle rather than promoting increased physical activity

The HCPs perceived that they were better placed to support the management of existing structured activities rather than promoting an increase in day-to-day physical activity. The management strategies described were individualised management plans, activity diaries and ongoing clinic discussions:

"With most patients you can find a pattern to say look the child tends to go a bit hypo maybe two hours after the activity, so we need to make sure that we give them a good carbohydrate meal, we cut down the insulin or work out a strategy that works" (P02, Consultant).

A minority of HCPs did promote lifestyle physical activity, describing how they encourage day-to-day activities such as walking to school and playing outside. One dietician perceived it easier to discuss physical activity with children who already had an interest being active, because then the HCP's role was " to support [the child's] chosen lifestyle, but it's very different to actively promoting physical activity in a group of people that you know will have problems " (P11, Dietician). Another dietician acknowledged; " people forget about anything that may just be sort of everyday activities…, walking to school say, and we concentrate a lot more on what we call 'exercise' " (P07, Dietician).

Theme 4 Type 1 Diabetes presents specific challenges to physical activity

There was consensus among HCPs that T1DM " shouldn't really interfere " (P01, Dietician) with day-to-day physical activities, but that structured, prolonged exercise and competitive sport participation need a diabetes management plan in place to ensure that participation is safe and performance is optimal. The current level of activity in children with T1DM was believed to be similar to their peers without diabetes. Nevertheless, HCPs recognised that diabetes presents unique challenges to children with T1DM engaging in active lifestyles.

### Effect of monthly, high-dose, long-term vitamin D supplementation on central blood pressure parameters: a randomized controlled trial substudy [^e50b1995]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The effects of monthly, high‐dose, long‐term (≥ 1‐year) vitamin D supplementation on central blood pressure parameters are unknown.

Methods and Results

A total of 517 adults (58% male, aged 50–84 years) were recruited into a double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled trial substudy and randomized to receive, for 1.1 years (median; range: 0.9–1.5 years), either (1) vitamin D 3 200 000 IU (initial dose) followed 1 month later by monthly 100 000‐IU doses (n = 256) or (2) placebo monthly (n = 261). At baseline (n = 517) and follow‐up (n = 380), suprasystolic oscillometry was undertaken, yielding aorticwaveforms and hemodynamic parameters. Mean deseasonalized 25‐hydroxyvitamin D increased from 66 nmol/L (SD: 24) at baseline to 122 nmol/L (SD: 42) at follow‐up in the vitamin D group, with no change in the placebo group. Despite small, nonsignificant changes in hemodynamic parameters in the total sample (primary outcome), we observed consistently favorable changes among the 150 participants with vitamin D deficiency (< 50 nmol/L) at baseline. In this subgroup, mean changes in the vitamin D group (n = 71) versus placebo group (n = 79) were −5.3 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI] −11.8 to 1.3) for brachial systolic(P = 0.11), −2.8 mm Hg (95% CI, −6.2 to 0.7) for brachial diastolic(P = 0.12), −7.5 mm Hg (95% CI, −14.4 to −0.6) for aortic systolic(P = 0.03), −5.7 mm Hg (95% CI, −10.8 to −0.6) for augmentation index (P = 0.03), −0.3 m/s (95% CI, −0.6 to −0.1) for pulse wave velocity (P = 0.02), −8.6 mm Hg (95% CI, −15.4 to −1.9) for peak reservoir pressure (P = 0.01), and −3.6 mm Hg (95% CI, −6.3 to −0.8) for backward pressure amplitude (P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Monthly, high‐dose, 1‐year vitamin D supplementation lowered centralparameters among adults with vitamin D deficiency but not in the total sample.

### American College of Sports Medicine roundtable report on physical activity, sedentary behavior, and cancer prevention and control [^defa4b3b]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The American College of Sports Medicine convened an International Multidisciplinary Roundtable on Exercise and Cancer in March 2018 to evaluate and translate the evidence linking physical activity and cancer prevention, treatment, and control. This article discusses findings from the Roundtable in relation to the biologic and epidemiologic evidence for the role of physical activity in cancer prevention and survival.

Results

The evidence supports that there are a number of biologically plausible mechanisms, whereby physical activity can influence cancer risk, and that physical activity is beneficial for the prevention of several types of cancer including breast, colon, endometrial, kidney, bladder, esophageal, and stomach. Minimizing time spent in sedentary behavior may also lower risk of endometrial, colon and lung cancers. Conversely, physical activity is associated with higher risk of melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer. Further, physical activity before and after a cancer diagnosis is also likely to be relevant for improved survival for those diagnosed with breast and colon cancer; with data suggesting that postdiagnosis physical activity provides greater mortality benefits than prediagnosis physical activity.

Conclusions

Collectively, there is consistent, compelling evidence that physical activity plays a role in preventing many types of cancer and for improving longevity among cancer survivors, although the evidence related to higher risk of melanoma demonstrates the importance of sun safe practices while being physically active. Together, these findings underscore the importance of physical activity in cancer prevention and control. Fitness and public health professionals and health care providers worldwide are encouraged to spread the message to the general population and cancer survivors to be physically active as their age, abilities, and cancer status will allow.

In conclusion, we recommend appropriate vitamin D RCTs to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19 infections. Until there is more robust scientific evidence for vitamin D, we strongly caution against the use of high vitamin D supplementation (greater than the upper limit of 4000 IU/day (100 µg/day)). Rather, we strongly endorse avoidance of vitamin D deficiencyin the population (as per the six points above) and complete adherence to government's advice worldwide on the prevention of the spread of COVID-19.

First we quantitatively assessed changes in the fraction of responsive trials (normalized to pre-stroke values) in high, moderate, and minimally active neurons. In the absence of chemogenetic treatment, stroke caused a major reduction in responsive trials in highly active neurons over time and to a lesser extent in moderately active neurons (Fig. 5a). These disruptions in responsiveness could be prevented by chemogenetic stimulation (see red asterisks in Fig. 5a). Next, we followed the trajectory of each category of neuron over time to determine if, for example, highly active neurons switched to a moderate/minimally active neuron or whether minimally active neurons could become highly active. In sham stroke mice, both highly and minimally active neurons tended to stay in their respective category over 3 weeks time whereas moderately active neurons could shift into high or minimally active categories (Fig. 5b). However for mice subjected to stroke that did not receive chemogenetic therapy, there was a significant drop in the % of highly active neurons (open bars) which shifted into the moderate (gray bars) or minimally (black bars) active category (Fig. 5b; Stroke Control vs Sham Stroke, Χ 2 = 32.7, p < 0.01). Interestingly, highly active neurons appeared most likely to recover in untreated stroke mice given that the percentage of highly active neurons increased from a low of 19% at 1 week, to 55% at 4 weeks (Fig. 5b). By contrast, highly active neurons in mice that received chronic chemogenetic stimulation were better able to remain highly active (Fig. 5b; Stroke hM3Dq vs Sham Stroke; Χ 2 = 3.8, p > 0.05), even at 1 week post-stroke when category switching was most likely to occur. However it should be noted that in rare cases, a neuron that was minimally active before stroke could become highly active to forepaw touch after stroke (Fig. 5c; 1/48 cells at 2 and 4 weeks, 3/48 cells at 3 weeks). And finally, we compared the percentage of highly, moderately and minimally active neurons within each experimental group before stroke versus afterwards. This analysis revealed no significant change in the proportion of each subpopulation in sham stroke or stroke affected mice that received chemogenetic stimulation (Fig. 5d). By contrast, stroke mice that received control stimulation exhibited significantly fewer highly active neurons and more minimally active neurons after stroke (Fig. 5d). In summary, these results indicate that stroke primarily disrupts the responses of highly active neurons and increases the proportion of minimally active neurons, both of which can be mitigated with chronic chemogenetic stimulation. Further, our data argue against the idea that new forelimb responsive neurons are recruited after stroke.

### Vitamin D supplementation and prevention of type 2 diabetes [^ecd1bba6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The study D2d was published by Anastassios G Pittas and colleagues in 2019 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2 and Vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements. In the D2d study, the trial question was: what is the role of vitamin D supplementation in adults at high risk for T2DM not selected for vitamin D insufficiency? In the D2d study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the D2d study, the population was: 2423 patients (1086 female, 1337 male). The inclusion criteria were adults at high risk for T2DM not selected for vitamin D insufficiency. The key exclusion criteria were any glycemic criterion in the diabetes range affecting the glycated hemoglobin level; use of diabetes or weight-loss medications; use of supplements containing vitamin D at a dose > 1,000 IU/day or calcium at a dose > 600 mg/day. In the D2d study, the interventions were: n = 1211 vitamin D supplementation (at a dose of 4,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 supplementation) n = 1212 placebo (matching placebo). In the D2d study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the incidence of new-onset diabetes (9.39 events /100 py vs. 10.66 events /100 py; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.04). In the D2d study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in hypercalcemia, fasting urine calcium/creatinine ratio > 0.375, low eGFR, nephrolithiasis. In the D2d study, the conclusion was: in adults at high risk for T2DM not selected for vitamin D insufficiency, vitamin D supplementation was not superior to placebo with respect to the incidence of new-onset diabetes.

### Density-functional fluctuation theory of crowds [^74b408e8]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

A primary goal of collective population behavior studies is to determine the rules governing crowd distributions in order to predict future behaviors in new environments. Current top-down modeling approaches describe, instead of predict, specific emergent behaviors, whereas bottom-up approaches must postulate, instead of directly determine, rules for individual behaviors. Here, we employ classical density functional theory (DFT) to quantify, directly from observations of local crowd density, the rules that predict mass behaviors under new circumstances. To demonstrate our theory-based, data-driven approach, we use a model crowd consisting of walking fruit flies and extract two functions that separately describe spatial and social preferences. The resulting theory accurately predicts experimental fly distributions in new environments and provides quantification of the crowd "mood". Should this approach generalize beyond milling crowds, it may find powerful applications in fields ranging from spatial ecology and active matter to demography and economics.

### Pulmonary tuberculosis: role of radiology in diagnosis and management [^66f04c8e]. Radiographics (2017). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis is a public health problem worldwide, including in the United States-particularly among immunocompromised patients and other high-risk groups. Tuberculosis manifests in active and latent forms. Active disease can occur as primary tuberculosis, developing shortly after infection, or postprimary tuberculosis, developing after a long period of latent infection. Primary tuberculosis occurs most commonly in children and immunocompromised patients, who present with lymphadenopathy, pulmonary consolidation, and pleural effusion. Postprimary tuberculosis may manifest with cavities, consolidations, and centrilobular nodules. Miliary tuberculosis refers to hematogenously disseminated disease that is more commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, who present with miliary lung nodules and multiorgan involvement. The principal means of testing for active tuberculosis is sputum analysis, including smear, culture, and nucleic acid amplification testing. Imaging findings, particularly the presence of cavitation, can affect treatment decisions, such as the duration of therapy. Latent tuberculosis is an asymptomatic infection that can lead to postprimary tuberculosis in the future. Patients who are suspected of having latent tuberculosis may undergo targeted testing with a tuberculin skin test or interferon-γ release assay. Chest radiographs are used to stratify for risk and to assess for asymptomatic active disease. Sequelae of previous tuberculosis that is now inactive manifest characteristically as fibronodular opacities in the apical and upper lung zones. Stability of radiographic findings for 6 months distinguishes inactive from active disease. Nontuberculous mycobacterial disease can sometimes mimic the findings of active tuberculosis, and laboratory confirmation is required to make the distinction. Familiarity with the imaging, clinical, and laboratory features of tuberculosis is important for diagnosis and management. © RSNA, 2017.

### Prevalence and socio-demographic correlates of "active transport" in the UK: analysis of the UK time use survey 2005 [^b9f4f9e3]. Preventive Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe prevalence, and socio-demographic correlates, of active transport participation amongst UK adults.

Methods

Data was from the 2005 UK Time Use Survey. Active transport was defined as any walking, jogging or pedal biking for purposes other than enjoyment. Socio-demographic correlates of any active transport participation, meeting current UK guidelines for sufficient activity through active transport, and time spent on active transport, if any, were explored.

Results

4941 individuals took part in the survey and data from 80% were included in the analyses. 28% of respondents reported any active transport and 19% were sufficiently active through active transport. Median time spent in active transport, if any, was 40 min per day (inter-quartile range 20–60 min). Active transport participation was greater in younger people and those without access to a car or van. Being sufficiently active through active transport was additionally associated with being unemployed, being in a less affluent social class, and leaving full time education at an older age.

Conclusions

There is scope for increasing active transport participation in the UK. That more than two thirds of those who report any active transport are sufficiently active through active transport alone may be a useful health promotion message.

### Patient experiences with the role of physical activity in inflammatory bowel disease: results from a survey and interviews [^b33da31c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Survey

Significant differences were found between CD and UC regarding total physical activity scores and total minutes per week, with UC participants being more physically active than CD participants (p = 0.035) and performing activities with a higher intensity resulting in a higher total physical activity score (p = 0.025) (Table 2). In CD participants, multiple linear regression showed an inverse association between the total physical activity score and disease activity scores in the crude model (β = − 0.406; p = 0.007) (Table 3). This suggests that CD participants who are more physically active and probably perform activities with a higher intensity, have a lower disease activity. After adjustment for age, gender, BMI and education level, and additionally age at diagnosis, medication use and previous IBD-related surgery, this association remained (β = − 0.375; p = 0.013) (Table 3). No significant association was found between the total physical activity score and UC disease activity scores (β = − 0.006; p = 0.162) (Table 3). Across disease activity groups, the total physical activity score was significantly lower in CD when disease activity was higher (p = 0.035), with a significant difference between the remission and moderately active disease group after post-hoc analyses (p = 0.046) (Table 2, Fig. 2). When disease activity is higher, the number of minutes per week spent on physical activity is the same as for the lower disease activity groups, but participants seem to choose activities with a lower intensity (Table 2, Fig. 2).

### Prasugrel [^b398a874]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 General Risk of Bleeding

Thienopyridines, including prasugrel tablets, increase the risk of bleeding. With the dosing regimens used in TRITON-TIMI 38, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Major (clinically overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin ≥ 5 g/dL, or intracranial hemorrhage) and TIMI Minor (overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin of ≥ 3 g/dL but < 5 g/dL) bleeding events were more common on prasugrel tablets than on clopidogrel [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The bleeding risk is highest initially, as shown in Figure 1 (events through 450 days; inset shows events through 7 days).

Figure 1: Non-CABG-Related TIMI Major or Minor Bleeding Events.

Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, PCI, CABG, or other surgical procedures even if the patient does not have overt signs of bleeding.

Do not use prasugrel tablets in patients with active bleeding, prior TIA or stroke [see Contraindications (4.1, 4.2)].

Other risk factors for bleeding are:

Age ≥ 75 years. Because of the risk of bleeding (including fatal bleeding) and uncertain effectiveness in patients ≥ 75 years of age, use of prasugrel tablets is generally not recommended in these patients, except in high-risk situations (patients with diabetes or history of myocardial infarction) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Trials (14)].
CABG or other surgical procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Body weight < 60 kg. Consider a lower (5 mg) maintenance dose [see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
Propensity to bleed (e.g., recent trauma, recent surgery, recent or recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, active peptic ulcer disease, severe hepatic impairment, or moderate to severe renal impairment) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7, 8.8)].
Medications that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., oral anticoagulants, chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], and fibrinolytic agents). Aspirin and heparin were commonly used in TRITON-TIMI 38 [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2, 7.4), and Clinical Studies (14)].

### Dipeptidyl peptidase-1 inhibition with brensocatib reduces the activity of all major neutrophil serine proteases in patients with bronchiectasis: results from the WILLOW trial [^30fc7c5a]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Distribution analysis of WBC and sputum NSP activities

The WILLOW trial randomized 256 patients, and 89, 81 and 85 had sputum NSP activity data in the 25 mg brensocatib, 10 mg brensocatib, and placebo groups, respectively. Baseline and post-baseline NE activity data in blood was reportable for 37, 30 and 35 patients, respectively. The prespecified analysis of sputum NSP activities assumed that they followed a lognormal distribution profile. This assumption was confirmed for NE, PR3 and CatG. The WBC NE activity followed a normal distribution profile. These analyses are shown in Additional file 1: Figs. S1–S4.

Effect of brensocatib treatment on active NSP levels in sputum

Active sputum NE levels were reduced by brensocatib by week 4 in a dose-dependent manner, with greater reductions for the 25 mg dose as compared to the 10 mg dose (Fig. 1). NE activities remained reduced throughout the 24-week course of treatment, then started to recover 4 weeks after the end of treatment. The mean NE activity at week 4 was 1514 ng/mL for placebo, 214 ng/mL for 10 mg brensocatib, and 141 ng/mL for 25 mg brensocatib, representing a reduction in NE activity compared to placebo of 86% and 91% for 10 and 25 mg brensocatib, respectively (Table 1). A similar trend was observed for CatG (Fig. 1). The mean CatG activity at week 4 was 56 ng/mL for placebo, 6 ng/mL for 10 mg brensocatib, and 4 ng/mL for 25 mg brensocatib, representing a reduction in CatG activity compared to placebo of 90% and 93% for 10 and 25 mg brensocatib treatment, respectively (Table 1). PR3 activity was reduced to a lesser extent than for NE and CatG, but also showed a dose dependent response (Fig. 1). The mean PR3 activity was 2927 ng/mL for placebo, 2309 ng/mL for 10 mg brensocatib, and 1368 ng/mL for 25 mg brensocatib, representing a reduction in PR3 activity relative to placebo of 21% and 53% for 10 and 25 mg brensocatib treatment, respectively (Table 1).

### Use of social media in health care-opportunities, challenges, and ethical considerations: a position statement of the American Academy of Neurology [^2a774f63]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

American Academy of Neurology — professional versus private social media profiles and online reputation highlights that posting of unprofessional content is common among clinicians and includes violations of privacy and confidentiality, inappropriate language, sexually explicit material, and discriminatory statements, and that the definition of what constitutes "unprofessional" may not be univocally agreed upon and may be influenced by biases towards race, gender, or other characteristics. Traditional norms of professional conduct, informed by the ethical principle of nonmaleficence, prohibit offensive or intimidating behavior towards patients in person, and they also prohibit such behavior on social media where it will likely be encountered by patients or potential patients. Clinicians may face reputational challenges and, bound by physician–patient confidentiality, physicians may be unable to post replies in their defense; practical advice provided by experts on cyberbullying is to refrain from answering publicly, and such situations may require a significant time investment to follow and monitor online postings and ratings and, if applicable, to attempt removal of false accusations or fake reviews. Monitoring one's online reputation is also important, even for those physicians not active on social media, and in addition to patients and the general public, 70% of employers query social media sites prior to hiring. Guidance for the bounds of acceptable and unacceptable behavior are available on increasing numbers of departmental, institutional, and professional society levels, and an exemplary summary of do's and don'ts including guidance for use of Twitter is provided in Tables 3 and 4.

|Class III, Focal lupus nephritisa|- Active or inactive focal, segmental or global endo- or extracapillary glomerulonephritis involving < 50% of all glomeruli, typically with focal subendothelial immune deposits, with or without mesangial alterations < br > - Class III (A) active lesions - focal proliferative LN < br > - Class III (A/C) active and chronic lesions - focal proliferative and sclerosing LN < br > - Class III (C) chronic inactive lesions with glomerular scars - focal sclerosing LN|
|Class IV, Diffuse LN|- Active or inactive diffuse, segmental or global endo- or extracapillary glomerulonephritis involving ≥ 50% of all glomeruli, typically with diffuse subendothelial immune deposits, with or without mesangial alterations|
|Class V, Membranous LN|- Global or segmental subepithelial immune deposits or their morphologic sequelae by light microscopy and byimmunofluorescence or electron microscopy, with or without mesangial alterations < br > - Class V LN may occur in combination with class III or IV in which case both will be diagnosed < br > - Class V LN may show advanced sclerosis|
|Class VI, Advanced sclerotic LN|- ≥ 90% of glomeruli globally sclerosed without residual activity.|

### How to and how not to develop a theory of change to evaluate a complex intervention: reflections on an experience in the democratic republic of Congo [^f97caa27]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Lessons learnt

A systems thinking approach may require looking beyond individual sectors. In this case, the process of developing the ToC was valuable in enabling consensus on the effects the intervention would have on the health system but should have given more consideration to the wider institutional system at the outset. Systems mapping is a tool that can be used in conjunction with ToCs to reach a deeper understanding of the system and help identify potential leverage points.
Identify all key stakeholders from the outset. Stakeholders are identified as those with an interest in the intervention, are affected by the intervention or those who may have an active or passive influence over decision-making and implementation processes. It is necessary to be as inclusive as possible at the beginning, recognising the importance of a range of perspectives in understanding the theoretical basis for the intervention.
Invest time in ensuring a similar level of understanding of ToCs among stakeholders. Often, stakeholders will not have heard of ToCs or have different ideas of what a ToC is, therefore starting the workshop with a presentation on ToCs and some illustrative examples can ensure everyone has a similar level of understanding at the start. This will also ensure everyone feels confident enough to contribute to the development of the ToC.
Prepare to manage stakeholder dynamics. In this case, unequal aid relations existing between donors and implementing partners, as well as between ministries may have affected the ToC discourse. Hence, having an independent facilitator can help ensure a degree of objectivity and mitigate any power imbalances. Other approaches may include limiting the participants in the workshop and stratifying groups to ensure open and honest contributions. However, a multistakeholder workshop has the advantage of ensuring the sharing of different perspectives, clarifying roles and responsibilities, and lays the basis for collaboration.
Avoid presenting a ready-made ToC. Give space to all stakeholders to develop the intervention theory themselves. Although more time-intensive, particularly for those not familiar with the intervention, it is important in overcoming the phenomenon of 'group think', which can occur with those involved in conceiving the intervention. It will also ensure greater ownership of the end product by those with any influence over implementation.

### Realist evaluations in low-and middle-income countries: reflections and recommendations from the experiences of a foreign researcher [^077d6504]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Challenge 1: recommendations

Addressing power imbalances within research, especially community-based research, involves many considerations throughout the research cycle. Within the interview phase specifically, the research team tried different techniques to mitigate effects arising from these imbalances. All interviews included a short discussion that did not focus on theory testing or refinement, conducted prior to theory testing components, but rather asked the participants about their experience with the programme or other related topics. During this, the research team asked more open-ended questions that were then used to help facilitate the more specific theory testing portion of the data collection. Direct questions related to the programme theories being explored were often posed before the more theory testing questions, as demonstrated by this excerpt from an interview guide from the second study (note, wording of questions and further insight into realist interviewing was informed by the 'Realist Qualitative Interviewing' lecture, facilitated by Dr Justin Jagosh within the Advanced Study in Realist Methodology course):

Q: Do you think that the trainings have made you more confident in caring for a sick child?

Q: There is this idea that, the more confident you are your ability, the more likely you are to seek care from a health worker. What do you think about that?

Q: What is it about being confident that leads you to consult a health worker?

Notably, and as a consequence of the research context and translation (discussed below), the questions/theories put forth were presented as straightforward as possible. In some sites, visual diagrams depicting the theories were used but were met with mixed results. This was less successful when diagrams were not simplified enough. The challenges and the strategies we deployed to overcome these led to the development of key recommendations for managing power imbalances within realist evaluation interviews. Please see box 1 for a full list of recommendations.

Box 1
Recommendations for reducing power imbalances

Follow traditional qualitative methodology interview techniques of building rapport, active listening, body language and so on.
Use non-intimidating language and be mindful of how you introduce the conceptual structure of the interview.
Incorporate an open interview phase before working towards theory testing/refinement with the realist interview.
Consider using focus group discussions with groups that may be particularly influenced by power imbalances (if appropriate).
Keep visuals or other tools (ie, examples, vignettes) simple and to the point.
Be reflexive and document your interviews well, including if/how power may have influenced your interview. Ensure that you bring this into your analysis phase.

### Civilization and its discontented: links between youth victimization, beliefs about government, and political participation across seven American presidencies [^eed2a849]. The American Psychologist (2018). Low credibility.

Promoting trust in public officials and active political engagement is vital to sustaining a well-functioning democracy. Developmental psychologists propose that youths' beliefs about government and participation in politics are rooted in personal experiences within their communities. Previous studies have focused on how positive experiences within youths' families, schools, and communities facilitate greater social trust and political participation. However, less is known about how negative interpersonal experiences-such as criminal victimization-intersect with youths' beliefs about the trustworthiness, competence, and knowledge of government officials, and their participation in political activity. Using data from 39 waves of the Monitoring the Future study, the current study examined associations among youth victimization, beliefs about government, and participation in various political activities. Adolescents (N = 109,574; 50.9% female) enrolled in 12th grade across the United States reported on whether they had experienced various types of victimization during the previous year, their beliefs about government, and their participation in multiple forms of political activity. Adolescents who reported more frequent victimization experiences endorsed significantly greater discontent with government and were significantly more engaged in various forms of political activity. The magnitude and direction of these effects were generally consistent across different types of victimization, different demographic subgroups of youth, and different sociohistorical periods. Findings are interpreted from a social contract theory perspective, followed by a discussion of implications for building psychological theory and informing public policy. (PsycINFO Database Record

### Which social support and psychological factors are associated to active commuting to school? [^ed84020c]. Preventive Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between self-efficacy, enjoyment, and volitional control with active commuting, as well as to analyze the impact of social support from parents, friends, and teachers with active commuting to school.

Methods

Participants in this cross-sectional study were 625 students (male: 46.3%) aged 10 to 15years from Porto, Portugal (2010/2011). A questionnaire was used to assess active commuting to/from school (walk/cycle), self-efficacy, enjoyment, volitional control and social support. Binary logistic regression was performed to identify significant associations between targeted variables and active commuting.

Results

The results show positive associations in crude analyses for all variables, except for enjoyment for walk/cycle to school. In the adjusted model, higher likelihood of active commuting was found among students who reported having higher self-efficacy (OR = 2.10; CI95%: 1.07; 4.11) to walk/cycle to school as well as among adolescents who reported being encouraged by their parents (OR = 3.66; CI95%: 1.55; 8.69), and having the partnership of friends in active journeys (OR = 4.31; CI95%: 1.79; 10.37).

Conclusion

Self-efficacy, encouragement from parents and companionship from friends were important indicators of active commuting to school among Portuguese adolescents. These findings provide support for further research to identify and understand factors that predict and explain the active commuting.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to physical activity, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to assess baseline physical activity and time spent in sedentary behavior (quiet sitting, lying, and leaning) in all patients with diabetes. Encourage increasing physical activities (such as walking, yoga, housework, gardening, swimming, and dancing) above baseline in patients not meeting activity guidelines.

### Dynamic adipocyte phosphoproteome reveals that akt directly regulates mTORC2 [^3c9cfa3f]. Cell Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

We further explored whether the phosphorylation of SIN1 T86 alone was sufficient to directly affect the growth factor-enhanced activity of mTORC2 by isolating the complex from the SIN1 −/− MEFs rescued with SIN1 WT, T86A, and T86E mutants and performing in vitro kinase assays. mTORC2 isolated from cells containing SIN1 T86A displayed an impaired growth factor increase in kinase activity (Figure 6 G). Moreover, overexpression of the phosphomimetic mutant SIN1 T86E resulted in enhanced, and growth factor-independent, mTORC2 kinase activity (Figure 6 G). These data indicate that phosphorylation of SIN1 T86 results in a substantial and direct activation of mTORC2 kinase activity.

We propose the following model for the activation of mTORC2 (Figure 6 H): (1) growth factors activate PI3K, causing accumulation of PIP 3 at the PM; (2) Akt translocates to the PM where its activity is increased by phosphorylation at T308 by PDK1; (3) mTORC2, probably via the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain in SIN1, also translocates to the PM, and SIN1 is phosphorylated on T86 by Akt, resulting in activation of the complex; (4) active mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt on S473, enhancing and stabilizing the activity of the kinase; and (5) activated Akt continues to phosphorylate other substrates.

### Facilitating autonomous, confident and satisfying choices: a mixed-method study of women's choice-making in prenatal screening for common aneuploidies [^2f6248d9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Qualitative study results

We interviewed 28 women who participated in prenatal screening, of which 22 (78.6%) chose FTS and 6 (21,4%) participated in STS. Table 1 displays the six dimensions of women's choice-making processes and experiences in prenatal screening: activeness (attitude and behavior), informedness (information needs and sources), preferences/considerations, social influence (perceived social support and pressure), difficulty (difficulty in making choice) and emotional status. For each item under these dimensions, we counted the number of women mentioning it to evaluate its importance, and pictured the choice-making differences between the two groups of women participating in different screening tests. Sample quotations are shown in Table 1.

Six dimensions of women's choice-making processes and experiences in prenatal screening

Active choice

Our participants had a common understanding on active choice, referring to three major constructs: information collection, autonomy and consciousness. Information collection (mentioned by 21 women) means that the woman reads the information, knows all the options and actively searches information from different sources. Autonomy (mentioned by 18 women) means that the woman can freely decide everything by herself based on individual willingness and that she is not forced to do something or to make the decision. Consciousness (mentioned by 6 women) implies that the woman thinks about the options, questions the options and consciously decides between the alternatives. In our study, most of the women reported that they did not actively choose the screening tests, because they were not aware of the STS, they thought it was the default choice to participate in the FTS, or they felt that there was little risk involved in the process.

Informedness

A key finding from our analysis was that, women had different information needs for choosing screening tests. Most of them were aware of the procedures and possible results of the tests. More than half of the women expressed they would have wanted to know that there was a later screening possibility. Some of them considered the features (e.g. accuracy, risk and timing) or the advantages/disadvantages of the tests. Few of them were concerned about the mechanisms and theories of the tests. Maternity care unit booklet and public health nurse were the two main information sources. Some women had previous experience in screening. Few women sought additional information online or other sources.
