## Question

DOES sglt2 cause weight loss in diabetics

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether SGLT2 inhibitors cause weight loss in people with diabetes, by what mechanism, how much on average, how durable it is, what modifies the effect, how it translates to outcomes, and how guidelines position this class relative to other therapies, including in combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists, in people with type 2 diabetes and related populations, including safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic basis so I don't jump to conclusions: SGLT2 inhibitors block renal proximal tubular SGLT2, reduce glucose reabsorption, and increase urinary glucose excretion by roughly 60–90 g/day (about 240–320 kcal/day), creating an insulin-independent negative energy balance that should, in principle, reduce body weight over time; I should verify that this caloric deficit is consistently demonstrated across the class, and indeed it is across clinical pharmacology studies and reviews [^112zE1tW] [^115Mek7U] [^117GcHGc].

> Next, I should quantify the average magnitude from the highest-credibility evidence; a 2022 meta-analysis of 116 randomized trials (n≈98,497) shows a placebo-subtracted mean weight loss of about −1.79 kg across SGLT inhibitors, robust across subgroups, which aligns with individual RCTs showing ~2 kg losses at 24–52 weeks; for example, dapagliflozin as add-on to metformin/sulfonylurea produced −2.1 kg at 24 weeks, and empagliflozin added to basal-bolus insulin sustained about −2.2 to −2.5 kg at 52 weeks; dose-ranging data with tofogliflozin also demonstrate dose-dependent reductions around 2–3 kg over 12 weeks, supporting a class-consistent ~2–3% body-weight decrease in most patients, although I should double-check that confidence intervals overlap and they do [^111PCtRR] [^113CmCJC] [^111zazhE] [^1151DtsB].

> Hold on, let me verify durability and the nature of the lost weight, because early diuresis can confound interpretation; extension data show weight reductions are generally maintained up to 76–104 weeks, but there is a plateau between 24 and 52 weeks consistent with compensatory adaptations, while body-composition studies using DEXA and MRI confirm losses are predominantly in fat mass, including reductions in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue rather than just water, which reassures me that the effect is metabolically meaningful despite the plateau phenomenon that likely reflects increased energy intake and improved antilipolytic insulin action over time [^1133anL7] [^115LhiNY] [^114W37GU] [^1117viNy] [^113E5SUq] [^1172FaW7].

> I will now examine sources of heterogeneity; let me think about baseline adiposity first, because absolute kilogram loss is often larger at higher BMI, and indeed CANVAS post hoc analyses show mean percent reductions of −1.72% at 3 months and −2.77% at 12 months with greater absolute losses in those with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m², with similar findings for empagliflozin stratified by baseline weight; next, I need to check renal function, since reduced eGFR diminishes filtered glucose and blunts glycemic efficacy, and trials in moderate CKD show minimal A1c change but preserved, albeit attenuated, weight/BP reductions; finally, I should confirm that higher baseline HbA1c and longer diabetes duration can amplify early weight loss, which is suggested in earlier clinical pharmacology summaries [^116jcAVZ] [^113G6th5] [^114tsbQo] [^1133anL7].

> But wait, what is the clinical significance of a 2–3 kg loss; modest losses of this magnitude still yield meaningful cardiometabolic benefits, including better glycemia, lower blood pressure, and small lipid improvements in RCTs, and across CVOT syntheses, each 1 kg between-group difference in weight associates with roughly a 5.9% relative risk reduction in heart failure events; meta-regression also links SGLT2i-associated weight reductions with systolic BP improvements, suggesting weight contributes to, but does not fully explain, the hemodynamic benefits [^113CmCJC] [^1124GxXe] [^116AwRrk].

> Let me now consider combination strategies; mechanistically, I should confirm that pairing SGLT2 inhibitors (caloric loss via glucosuria) with GLP-1 receptor agonists (appetite suppression and delayed gastric emptying) can counter compensatory hyperphagia and enhance weight loss, which is exactly what is observed in trials where dapagliflozin plus weekly exenatide produced about 4.1 kg loss at 24 weeks in individuals with obesity without diabetes, larger than expected from simple additivity; in type 1 diabetes, retrospective data suggest greater weight loss with SGLT2i+GLP-1 RA versus either alone, but hold on, I should verify safety here because SGLT2 use in T1D raises euglycemic ketoacidosis risk, so this approach warrants caution outside research or carefully selected contexts [^1114D98i] [^111Yev6F] [^115sJN1Z] [^111dUUZ7].

> I need to acknowledge limitations and correct a common misconception; at first glance one might think the 300 kcal/day deficit should yield ~10 kg/year of loss, but the observed loss is much less due to compensatory increases in caloric intake and metabolic adaptations, so the average 2–5 kg seen in practice and trials makes physiologic sense; also, I initially thought SGLT2 inhibitors might be approved for obesity treatment because of their weight effects — wait, that's not correct, they are not FDA-approved for obesity, and dedicated anti-obesity agents like semaglutide 2.4 mg achieve > 10% loss on average; individual variability is substantial and early response often predicts longer-term outcomes, though that predictive evidence is strongest for GLP-1 agents and should be extrapolated to SGLT2i with caution [^1172FaW7] [^115foJxT] [^114syMK1] [^113bU4Z9] [^1142z7yK].

> Next, I should review safety so we don't overlook monitoring; I need to ensure we watch for volume depletion and hypotension, genital mycotic and urinary tract infections, and the rare risk of euglycemic ketoacidosis especially when insulin is used or in type 1 diabetes contexts, balancing these against consistent hemodynamic and adiposity benefits seen in pooled empagliflozin analyses and extension studies [^115LhiNY] [^111dUUZ7].

> Now, let me synthesize guideline positioning; the BMJ 2021 guidance recommends SGLT2 inhibitors, often ahead of GLP-1 RAs, when the therapeutic priority is reducing cardiovascular and renal events, with weight loss considered an added advantage; ADA 2025 standards elevate weight management as a primary target in type 2 diabetes and support using agents with weight-lowering effects, while the ESC 2023 guidelines emphasize GLP-1 RAs for weight reduction specifically, acknowledging SGLT2 inhibitors' multifactorial benefits with modest weight loss, so the choice should be individualized by cardiorenal risk and weight goals [^113yfLWv] [^117RJxxH] [^111mJg9j] [^112PGrSi] [^1154Rhy8].

> Bottom line, after double-checking the mechanistic and trial data: SGLT2 inhibitors consistently produce modest, clinically relevant weight loss averaging about 2–3 kg (roughly 2–3% of body weight) over 24–52 weeks, largely from fat mass, with maintenance over 1–2 years before plateau, heterogeneity by BMI, glycemia, and renal function, and meaningful contributions to blood pressure and heart failure risk reduction, especially when aligned with diet, activity, and in some cases combined with GLP-1 receptor agonists to mitigate compensatory intake and enhance loss [^111PCtRR] [^114W37GU] [^1133anL7] [^1124GxXe].

---

Yes, SGLT2 inhibitors cause weight loss [^111PCtRR] in diabetics by promoting glycosuria and caloric loss [^1172FaW7], with modest, sustained weight loss of about 2–3 kg over 24–52 weeks [^112zE1tW] and up to 4–5 kg with longer use [^1133anL7] [^117SMwTy]. Weight loss is mainly from fat mass [^114W37GU], including visceral fat [^115LhiNY], and is consistent across agents and baseline BMI [^1124p9JD]. The effect is attenuated by compensatory appetite [^112zE1tW], but is durable and clinically meaningful, especially when combined with lifestyle or GLP-1 RAs [^1114D98i] [^113rUUei].

---

## Mechanism of weight loss

SGLT2 inhibitors block renal glucose reabsorption, increasing urinary glucose excretion (UGE) [^117GcHGc] and creating a caloric deficit of ~240–320 kcal/day [^1172FaW7], which drives weight loss [^112zE1tW] [^114XpE19]. Initial weight loss reflects fluid loss from osmotic diuresis [^112zE1tW], whereas longer-term loss is predominantly fat mass [^114W37GU].

---

## Clinical evidence of weight loss

Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses demonstrate consistent weight loss with SGLT2 inhibitors in T2D:

- **Meta-analysis of 43 RCTs**: Mean weight reduction of −1.88 kg (95% CI: −2.11 to −1.66) [^112zE1tW] vs comparators over 4–208 weeks [^111PCtRR].
- **Empagliflozin**: Sustained ~2 kg weight loss over 76 weeks; reductions in visceral and subcutaneous fat [^115LhiNY].
- **Dapagliflozin**: Sustained weight loss up to 2 years [^1133anL7]; ~2% reduction across BMI categories in DECLARE-TIMI 58 [^1124p9JD].
- **Canagliflozin**: Greater weight loss in higher BMI groups; ~2.77% reduction at 12 months in CANVAS [^116jcAVZ].

---

## Magnitude and duration of weight loss

Weight loss is modest and sustained [^111PCtRR], typically 2–3 kg over 24–52 weeks [^112zE1tW], and generally plateaus by 6–12 months [^113E5SUq]; longer-term use may yield 4–5 kg in patients with higher BMI [^117SMwTy] [^1133anL7].

| **SGLT2 inhibitor** | **Weight loss (kg)** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Empagliflozin | ~2 kg | 76 weeks [^115LhiNY] |
| Dapagliflozin | 2–3 kg | 24–104 weeks [^1133anL7] [^113CmCJC] |
| Canagliflozin | ~2.77% | 12 months [^116jcAVZ] |
| Ertugliflozin | 3–4% | 26–104 weeks [^1124GxXe] |

---

## Factors influencing weight loss

Several factors modulate the weight-loss response to SGLT2 inhibitors:

- **Baseline BMI**: Higher BMI associates with greater absolute weight loss [^116jcAVZ] [^1133anL7].
- **Renal function**: Reduced eGFR attenuates glycemic efficacy [^113G6th5] but weight loss persists [^114tsbQo].
- **Compensatory appetite**: Increased intake partially offsets caloric loss, limiting weight loss [^112zE1tW] [^115foJxT].
- **Concomitant medications**: Insulin or sulfonylureas [^1133anL7] may blunt weight loss via weight gain.

---

## Comparison with other antidiabetic medications

Compared with other drug classes, SGLT2 inhibitors have a favorable weight profile:

- **GLP-1 receptor agonists**: Greater weight loss (4–6 kg) but injectable [^113bU4Z9] [^116xb97X].
- **DPP-4 inhibitors**: Weight neutral [^114RZuNy].
- **Insulin/sulfonylureas**: Associated with weight gain [^1133anL7].

---

## Clinical significance and patient outcomes

Weight loss with SGLT2 inhibitors is clinically meaningful and improves glycemic control [^111zazhE], insulin sensitivity [^112zE1tW], and cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, lipids) [^116AwRrk]. It is especially valuable for overweight or obese patients and those at cardiovascular risk [^113yfLWv] [^111mJg9j].

---

## Safety considerations

SGLT2 inhibitors are generally safe [^112zE1tW], with a low risk of hypoglycemia [^114RZuNy]; common adverse events include genital mycotic infections and mild volume depletion [^115Mek7U].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines support SGLT2 inhibitors for T2D — particularly in patients with cardiovascular or renal disease — and recognize their weight-loss benefit.

---

SGLT2 inhibitors cause weight loss in diabetics via glycosuria-driven caloric loss [^1172FaW7], yielding modest, durable reductions in fat mass [^114W37GU]. The effect is consistent across agents and BMI [^1124p9JD], attenuated by compensatory intake [^112zE1tW], and clinically meaningful, with greater loss in higher-BMI patients [^117SMwTy] and when combined with lifestyle or GLP-1 RAs [^113rUUei] [^113bU4Z9].

### SGLT2 inhibitors and the clinical implications of associated weight loss in type 2 diabetes: A narrative review [^1124GxXe]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility

- **Vertis CV trial**: The weight change observed with ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg in the VERTIS CV trial was slightly lower than previously reported. Results from another trial, although not a CVOT, indicated that weight loss at 26 weeks was maintained for a longer period, up to 104 weeks. No specific results from VERTIS CV on weight change with ertugliflozin by baseline BMI or HbA1c group have been published. However, another clinical trial with ertugliflozin in overweight and obese patients concluded that achievement of glycemic control at 26 weeks (HbA1c reduction) was similar irrespective of baseline BMI, and so was the percentage of weight loss (approximately 3–4%).

- **Cardiorenal outcomes**: The impressive cardiorenal outcomes are only partially explained by SGLT2 inhibitors' effects on the heart, kidneys, blood vessels, and the whole body. Potential mechanisms include structural changes (reduction of ventricular mass and wall stress, improvement of fibrosis markers, and endothelial function), dynamic changes (direct inhibition of myocardial Na+/H+ pump, reduction of blood pressure, and improvement of ventricular loading conditions and tubuloglomerular feedback), and energetic changes (improvement of cardiac metabolism).

- **Associated weight loss**: In this context, the associated weight loss has been investigated as a potential distinctive mediator of cardiovascular risk reduction in diabetes. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of large CVOTs with different glucose-lowering drugs showed a significant relative reduction in the risk of heart failure of 5.9% (3.9–8.0%) for every difference of 1 kg between treatment groups (p < 0.0001).

### The pleiotropic effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors: Beyond the glycemic benefit [^112zE1tW]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

- **Body weight effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors**: In CVOTs of SGLT-2is, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin were associated with small reductions in body weight from baseline compared with placebo. A meta-analysis of 43 randomized clinical trials with durations of 4–208 weeks indicated that SGLT-2i therapy was associated with reductions in body weight, with a weighted mean (95% CI) difference of −1.88 (−2.11 to −1.66) kg versus comparators across studies. Given the favorable effects of SGLT-2is on body weight, they may be particularly beneficial in patients with T2D who are overweight or obese, especially when used in combination with other medications that increase satiety.

The reductions in body weight with SGLT-2is are believed to result from an increase in urinary glucose excretion. SGLT-2is are associated with daily glucose losses of approximately 60–80 g or 240–320 calories. Yet, body weight reductions observed after 12–24 weeks of SGLT-2i therapy are typically in the 2- to 3-kg range. Discrepancies between expected and observed weight loss may be accounted for by an increase in energy intake or compensatory mechanisms. Although fluid loss may initially play a role in weight loss, overall reductions in body weight are believed to be mainly the result of fat loss.

### A randomized controlled trial of dapagliflozin plus once-weekly exenatide versus placebo in individuals with obesity and without diabetes: Metabolic effects and markers associated with bodyweight loss [^1114D98i]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

For individuals with overweight and obesity, achieving and maintaining bodyweight loss presents many challenges, including physiological counterregulatory mechanisms of restoring bodyweight, hunger-induced food cravings, and ongoing sedentary lifestyles. When administered in combination, the complementary mechanisms of action of an SGLT2 inhibitor (increasing urinary caloric loss) and a GLP-1RA (suppressing appetite) may represent a novel treatment approach for obesity.

Counterregulatory mechanisms in response to SGLT2 inhibitor-induced urinary caloric loss have been described, including compensatory increases in appetite/caloric intake. Therefore, the mechanisms of action of GLP-1RAs, including centrally mediated appetite suppression and possibly also delayed gastric emptying, may attenuate dapagliflozin-induced counterregulatory mechanisms, resulting in improved bodyweight loss.

Meta-analyses of studies among patients with T2DM evaluating exenatide QW and dapagliflozin administered separately estimate bodyweight loss versus placebo at 24 weeks to range from 0.8 to 1.6 kg and 1.6 to 2.2 kg, respectively. Assuming an additive effect with combined administration, bodyweight loss versus placebo at 24 weeks with DAPA + ExQW would be expected to be in the approximate range of 2.4–3.8 kg. Although it is not possible to make direct comparisons with other studies or to confirm additive bodyweight loss because of the lack of single-agent comparator arms, in the study among participants without diabetes, bodyweight loss versus placebo at 24 weeks was 4.1 kg.

### Sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: A review of their basic and clinical pharmacology [^1133anL7]. Diabetes Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Use of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors leads to a reduction in body weight, ranging from about 1 to 5 kg. A greater fall is seen in patients with long-standing diabetes and in those with a higher baseline weight. This weight loss is sustained after up to 2 years of use of dapagliflozin and may be linked to a reduction in insulin dose requirements of patients with long-standing diabetes. An analysis of 208-week data comparing dapagliflozin in combination with metformin versus glimepiride in combination with metformin showed a 4.38 kg (95% CI −5.31, −3.46) difference between the two groups. Patients in the glimepiride group gained a mean of 0.73 kg, while those in the dapagliflozin group lost 3.65 kg.

### Practical approach to initiating SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes [^115Mek7U]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are an attractive novel therapeutic option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. They block the reabsorption of filtered glucose in the kidneys, mainly in proximal renal tubules, resulting in increased urinary glucose excretion and correction of diabetes-related hyperglycemia. Beyond improving glucose control, SGLT2 inhibitors offer potential benefits by reducing body weight and blood pressure.

Based on the efficacy demonstrated in clinical trials, SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended as second- or third-line agents for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes. Beneficial effects on kidney disease progression, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure have also been demonstrated with one SGLT2 inhibitor, empagliflozin. Potential adverse events resulting from their mechanism of action or related to concomitant therapies are reviewed. A treatment algorithm for the adjustment of concomitant therapies after initiating SGLT2 inhibitors is also proposed.

### Dapagliflozin improves glycemic control and reduces body weight as add-on therapy to metformin plus sulfonylurea: a 24-week randomized, double-blind clinical trial [^113CmCJC]. Diabetes Care (2015). High credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin and sulfonylurea, patients with HbA1c of 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) to 10.5% (91 mmol/mol) receiving sulfonylurea and metformin were randomized to receive dapagliflozin 10 mg/day (n = 109) or placebo (n = 109) for 24 weeks.

- **Results**: HbA1c (baseline: dapagliflozin 8.08% [65 mmol/mol]; placebo 8.24% [67 mmol/mol]) and fasting plasma glucose (baseline: dapagliflozin 167.4 mg/dL [9.29 mmol/L]; placebo 180.5 mg/dL [10.02 mmol/L]) significantly improved from baseline with dapagliflozin (placebo-subtracted change -0.69% [-7.5 mmol/mol], P < 0.0001; -33.5 mg/dL [-1.86 mmol/L], P < 0.0001, respectively). More patients achieved a therapeutic glycemic response (HbA1c < 7.0% [53 mmol/mol]) with dapagliflozin (31.8%) versus placebo (11.1%) (P < 0.0001).

- **Body weight and systolic blood pressure**: These were significantly reduced from baseline over 24 and 8 weeks, respectively, with dapagliflozin (placebo-subtracted change -2.1 kg, P < 0.0001; -3.8 mmHg, P = 0.0250). Patients receiving dapagliflozin showed placebo-subtracted increases in total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol (11.4 mg/dL, P = 0.0091; 11.4 mg/dL, P = 0.0030; 2.2 mg/dL, P = 0.0172, respectively) with no change in LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio (0.1; P = 0.2008) or triglycerides (-16.5 mg/dL; P = 0.1755).

- **Adverse events**: These occurred in 48.6% of patients receiving dapagliflozin and 51.4% receiving placebo. Significantly more patients with dapagliflozin compared with placebo experienced hypoglycemia.

### Efficacy and safety of semaglutide compared with liraglutide and placebo for weight loss in patients with obesity: a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial [^113bU4Z9]. Lancet (2018). High credibility.

Obesity is a major public health issue, and new pharmaceuticals for weight management are needed. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue semaglutide in comparison with liraglutide and a placebo in promoting weight loss.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, multicentre, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial in eight countries, involving 71 clinical sites. Eligible participants were adults (≥ 18 years) without diabetes and with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m² or more. Participants were randomly assigned (6:1) to each active treatment group (i.e. semaglutide [0.05 mg, 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, 0.3 mg, or 0.4 mg; initiated at 0.05 mg per day and incrementally escalated every 4 weeks] or liraglutide [3.0 mg; initiated at 0.6 mg per day and escalated by 0.6 mg per week]) or a matching placebo group (equal injection volume and escalation schedule to active treatment group) using a block size of 56. All treatment doses were delivered once daily via subcutaneous injections. Participants and investigators were masked to the assigned study treatment but not the target dose. The primary endpoint was percentage weight loss at week 52. The primary analysis was done using intention-to-treat ANCOVA estimation, with missing data derived from the placebo pool.

- **Findings**: Between Oct 1, 2015, and Feb 11, 2016, 957 individuals were randomly assigned (102–103 participants per active treatment group and 136 in the pooled placebo group).

### SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin: finally at the latter stage of understanding [^114tsbQo]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are a relatively new adjunctive treatment option for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Extraglycemic benefits of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition include weight and blood pressure reduction. Cherney et al. now demonstrate that these extraglycemic properties of empagliflozin are preserved despite reduced urinary glucose excretion in advancing chronic kidney disease. Limited therapeutic options for patients with type 2 diabetes in the latter stages of chronic kidney disease make empagliflozin an attractive therapeutic agent with additional cardiovascular benefits.

### Efficacy of liraglutide for weight loss among patients with type 2 diabetes: The SCALE diabetes randomized clinical trial [^116xb97X]. JAMA (2015). High credibility.

Weight loss of 5% to 10% can improve type 2 diabetes and related comorbidities. Few safe, effective weight-management drugs are currently available. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of liraglutide versus placebo for weight management in adults with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes.

The research was a fifty-six-week randomized (2:1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial with a 12-week observational off-drug follow-up period. It was conducted at 126 sites in 9 countries between June 2011 and January 2013. Of the 1361 participants assessed for eligibility, 846 were randomized. Inclusion criteria included a body mass index of 27.0 or greater, age 18 years or older, taking 0 to 3 oral hypoglycemic agents (metformin, thiazolidinedione, sulfonylurea) with stable body weight, and glycated hemoglobin level of 7.0% to 10.0%.

Interventions included once-daily, subcutaneous liraglutide (3.0 mg) (n = 423), liraglutide (1.8 mg) (n = 211), or placebo (n = 212), all as adjuncts to a 500 kcal/d dietary deficit and increased physical activity (≥ 150 min/wk).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Three coprimary endpoints were assessed: relative change in weight, proportion of participants losing 5% or more, and more than 10% of baseline weight at week 56.

- **Results**: Baseline weight was 105.7 kg with liraglutide (3.0-mg dose), 105.8 kg with liraglutide (1.8-mg dose), and 106.5 kg with placebo. Weight loss was 6.0% (6.4 kg) with liraglutide (3.0-mg dose), 4.7% (5.0 kg) with liraglutide (1.8-mg dose), and 2.0% (2.2 kg) with placebo.

### Effects of dapagliflozin on body weight, total fat mass, and regional adipose tissue distribution in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycemic control on metformin [^114W37GU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin, a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, reduces hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by increasing urinary glucose excretion, and weight loss is a consistent associated finding. Our objectives were to confirm weight loss with dapagliflozin and establish through body composition measurements whether weight loss is accounted for by changes in fat or fluid components.

This was a 24-week, international, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with an ongoing 78-week site- and patient-blinded extension period at 40 sites in five countries. Included were 182 patients with T2DM (mean values: women 63.3 and men 58.6 years of age; hemoglobin A1c 7.17%, body mass index 31.9 kg/m², and body weight 91.5 kg) inadequately controlled on metformin. Dapagliflozin 10 mg/d or placebo was added to open-label metformin for 24 weeks.

- **Main outcome measures**: Primary endpoint was total body weight (TBW) change from baseline at week 24. Key secondary endpoints were waist circumference and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry total-body fat mass (FM) changes from baseline at week 24, and the proportion of patients achieving body weight reduction of at least 5% at week 24. In a subset of patients, magnetic resonance assessment of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) volume and hepatic lipid content were also evaluated.

At week 24, placebo-corrected changes with dapagliflozin were as follows: TBW, -2.08 kg [95% confidence interval (CI)].

### A randomized controlled trial of dapagliflozin plus once-weekly exenatide versus placebo in individuals with obesity and without diabetes: Metabolic effects and markers associated with bodyweight loss [^115foJxT]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Among patients with T2DM, estimated caloric intake is increased by an average of 10–15% during chronic treatment with an SGLT2 inhibitor; this offsets about 9 kg of an expected glucosuria-induced bodyweight loss of 11 kg over 2 years. From the magnitude of bodyweight loss observed in the study, it might be inferred that food intake was reduced by the addition of exenatide QW, thus counteracting the dapagliflozin-induced increase in food intake. However, the mechanisms involved have not been elucidated, and it is not clear whether the degree of bodyweight loss with DAPA + ExQW achieved among participants with obesity and without diabetes is similar to that achieved among patients with T2DM.

In the analysis, we first explored possible metabolic adaptations during DAPA + ExQW treatment. These included changes in substrate use (FFAs, glycerol, beta-OH-butyrate, and glucose), insulin and glucagon during OGTTs, and insulin secretion and sensitivity. Change from baseline at 24 weeks in 2-h FFAs was significantly increased versus placebo. Although no placebo comparisons were available at 52 weeks, DAPA + ExQW significantly increased 2-h FFAs and significantly decreased fasting glycerol and 2-h beta-OH-butyrate over 52 weeks. Fasting beta-OH-butyrate remained unchanged. The changes in 2-h FFAs and fasting glycerol were similar to those observed among individuals without diabetes receiving the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin, supporting the hypothesis that SGLT2-induced glucosuria favors a shift towards greater utilization of lipids for energy production.

### Attenuation of weight loss through improved antilipolytic effect in adipose tissue via the SGLT2 inhibitor tofogliflozin [^113E5SUq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Although calorie loss from increased urinary glucose excretion continues after long-term treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), the mechanisms of the attenuated weight loss due to SGLT2is are not well known.

- **Objective**: To examine the mechanism of the attenuated weight loss during long-term treatment with an SGLT2i, tofogliflozin, focusing on the antilipolytic effect of insulin on adipose tissue.

- **Design and participants**: An integrated analysis was performed using data from two phase 3 studies of 52 weeks of tofogliflozin administration. The antilipolytic effect was evaluated using adipose tissue insulin resistance (Adipo-IR) calculated from the product of the levels of fasting insulin (f-IRI) and fasting free fatty acids (f-FFAs).

- **Results**: Data from 774 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age, 58.5 years; glycosylated hemoglobin, 8.1%; body mass index, 25.6 kg/m²; estimated glomerular filtration rate, 83.9 mL/min/1.73 m²; 66% men) were analyzed. Weight loss plateaued between weeks 24 and 52 after decreasing significantly. f-IRI levels decreased significantly from baseline to week 24, and the decrease was maintained until week 52. f-FFA levels significantly increased, peaked at week 24, then declined from weeks 24 to 52. Adipo-IR levels declined progressively throughout the 52 weeks (-3.6 mmol/L·pmol/L and -6.2 mmol/L·pmol/L at weeks 24 and 52, respectively; P < 0.001 baseline vs weeks 24 and 52 and week 24 vs week 52). Higher baseline Adipo-IR levels were independently associated with greater weight loss at week 52.

### Clinical outcomes with canagliflozin according to baseline body mass index: Results from post hoc analyses of the CANVAS Program [^116jcAVZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce several cardiovascular risk factors, including plasma glucose, blood pressure, albuminuria, and body weight. Long-term treatment lowers risks of cardiovascular and renal events. The objective of this post hoc analysis was to determine the effects of canagliflozin treatment versus placebo on clinical outcomes in relation to body mass index (BMI).

The CANVAS Program randomized 10,142 participants with type 2 diabetes to canagliflozin or placebo. These analyses tested the consistency of canagliflozin treatment effects across BMI levels for cardiovascular, renal, safety, and body weight outcomes in three groups defined by baseline BMI: < 25, 25- < 30, and ≥ 30 kg/m².

In total, 10,128 participants with baseline BMI measurements were included. There were 966 participants with BMI < 25 kg/m², 3,153 with BMI 25- < 30 kg/m², and 6,009 with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m². Mean percent body weight reduction with canagliflozin compared with placebo was greater at 12 months [-2.77% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.95, -2.59)] than at 3 months [-1.72% (95% CI: -1.83, -1.62)]. The hazard ratios (HRs) for canagliflozin compared with placebo control for the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke were 1.03 (95% CI: 0.66, 1.59) in participants with BMI < 25 kg/m², 0.97 (0.76, 1.23) with BMI 25- < 30 kg/m², and 0.79 (0.67, 0.93) with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² (P for heterogeneity = 0.55). The effects of canagliflozin on each component of the composite were also similar across BMI subgroups.

### Empagliflozin treatment effects across categories of baseline HbA1c, body weight and blood pressure as an add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes [^117SMwTy]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

The results for weight reduction align with previous reports on the effects of empagliflozin on weight and indices of fat mass by baseline levels. Weight considerations concerning medications to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) are important to consider. In contrast, certain widely used glucose-lowering medications, particularly insulin, insulin secretagogues, and the less frequently used class of thiazolidinediones, are often associated with weight gain. Whether this iatrogenic increased weight carries a potential long-term deleterious effect is unknown. However, weight gain is an important patient-centered aspect of care, as the majority of patients with T2D are overweight or obese.

In the United States, more than 85% of patients with T2D have a BMI higher than 25 kg/m², with more than 50% of patients having a BMI higher than 30 kg/m². Furthermore, studies have shown that even modest weight reductions (e.g. 2‐3 kg) can improve a person's treatment satisfaction and weight-related quality of life. In the study, in the highest BMI category of 35 kg/m² or higher, the adjusted mean change from baseline in body weight at 76 weeks was −4.77 kg in the empagliflozin 25 mg group. This indicates that even in the heaviest group of patients, a reduction in weight of approximately 4‐5 kg is achievable over time.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^111mJg9j]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly concerning weight loss, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend offering weight management treatment aiming for any magnitude of weight loss. They recognize that a weight loss of 3–7% of baseline weight improves glycemia and other intermediate cardiovascular risk factors. Sustained loss of more than 10% of body weight usually confers greater benefits, including disease-modifying effects, possible remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and may improve long-term cardiovascular outcomes and mortality.

- **Declare-TIMI 58 trial**: The DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial outcomes, which involved evaluating the composite risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease and hospitalization for heart failure along with its components, including CV and renal events, were analyzed based on baseline BMI categories ranging from normal to very obese. A comparable reduction in body weight of approximately 2% versus placebo was observed, along with a similar relative risk for the composite event across these BMI categories.

- **EMPA-REG outcomes trial**: A post hoc analysis of EMPA-REG OUTCOMES data demonstrated significant weight reduction with empagliflozin compared to placebo (p < 0.0001) at 12 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year. The clinical and metabolic benefits were evident in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), both with and without heart failure at baseline, and these benefits were considered largely independent of HbA1c reduction.

### SGLT2 inhibition in diabetes mellitus: Rationale and clinical prospects [^117GcHGc]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

This review covers the rationale, physiological consequences, and clinical application of pharmacological sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, where renal glucose reabsorption might be upregulated, orally active, selective SGLT2 inhibitors improve glycaemic control to a therapeutically useful extent. Chronic administration of several SGLT2 inhibitors dose-dependently lowers HbA(1c) levels by 0.5–1.5% without causing hypoglycaemia.

The unique mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors — which does not depend on β-cell function or tissue insulin sensitivity — means that they can exert their antihyperglycaemic effects in combination with any other oral antidiabetic drug as well as insulin. Available phase III studies confirm a good tolerability profile. Weight loss due to urinary calorie leakage may be less than expected, but the negative energy balance offers a valuable clinical benefit. Offloading of sodium can assist blood pressure control.

The progressive loss of efficacy in patients with reduced glomerular function needs to be balanced against the potential for renal protection. Safety issues, such as genitourinary infections and cancer risk, require careful, proactive monitoring and analysis of robust exposure data, particularly in elderly, frail patients and those with impaired kidney function and/or high cardiovascular or cancer risk. These individuals represent an increasing fraction of the population with diabetes mellitus.

### Effect of hemoglobin A1c reduction or weight reduction on blood pressure in glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus: A meta-analysis [^116AwRrk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) have demonstrated beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes and multiple cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension. However, the mechanism of the blood pressure-lowering effects of these agents remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate the impact of hemoglobin A1c reduction or body weight reduction with GLP-1 treatment and SGLT-2i treatment on changes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

- **Methods and results**: Studies were identified by a search of various databases, including the Cochrane Central Register, until June 2019. Meta-regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between hemoglobin A1c reduction or body weight reduction and changes in blood pressure. A total of 184 trials were included. Both GLP-1 and SGLT-2i treatments led to significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference: −2.856 mm Hg for GLP-1 and −4.331 mm Hg for SGLT-2i; P < 0.001 for both) and diastolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference: −0.898 mm Hg for GLP-1 and −2.279 mm Hg for SGLT-2i; P < 0.001 for both). For both drug classes, hemoglobin A1c reduction was not independently associated with reductions in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. In GLP-1 treatment, weight reduction was positively associated with reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (β = 0.821 and β = 0.287, respectively; P < 0.001 for both). In SGLT-2i treatment, weight loss was significantly associated with systolic reduction (β = 0.820; P = 0.001) but was not associated with diastolic reduction.

- **Conclusions**: Treatment with GLP-1 and SGLT-2i led to significant reductions in blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Weight reduction was positively associated with these reductions.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and the clinical implications of associated weight loss in type 2 diabetes: A narrative review [^1172FaW7]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

At therapeutic doses, urinary glucose excretion (UGE) is approximately 70–90 g/day, equivalent to 300 kcal/day, with additional diuresis of 400 mL/day. Based on the measured number of calories lost per day due to UGE, the expected weight loss would be approximately 10 kg/year. However, actual loss in body weight is much less, as shown in clinical trials and in clinical practice. The relationship between SGLT2 inhibition and the caloric effect is much more complex and not a simple linear function, as initially thought. Clinical trials and observational data indicate that weight reduction is lower than expected (approximately 2–5 kg), with variations depending on baseline weight and concomitant medication. The body weight reduction during treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors has been considered modest, though it provides significant cardiovascular benefits. The mechanisms of weight loss and their influence on cardiorenal effects seem complex and are not fully elucidated.

This short review explores how the weight loss achieved with SGLT2 inhibitors might influence multiple outcomes in type 2 diabetes. Our aim is to briefly review the weight-related results reported in the context of cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) and discuss the possible implications for clinical practice.

### Comparison between SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP4 inhibitors added to insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes: A systematic review with indirect comparison meta-analysis [^114RZuNy]. Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews (2017). High credibility.

Both sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors can be used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that is inadequately controlled with insulin therapy, and yet there has been no direct comparison of these two inhibitors.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov through June 2015. Randomized controlled trials published in English that compared SGLT2 inhibitor plus insulin (SGLT2i/INS) with placebo plus insulin or DPP4 inhibitor plus insulin (DPP4i/INS) with placebo plus insulin in patients with T2DM were selected. Data on the study characteristics, efficacy, and safety outcomes were extracted. We compared the efficacy and safety between SGLT2i/INS and DPP4i/INS indirectly with covariates adjustment, and the risk of potential bias was assessed.

- **Results**: Fourteen eligible randomized controlled trials comprising 6980 patients were included (five SGLT2 inhibitor studies and nine DPP4 inhibitor studies). Covariate-adjusted indirect comparison using meta-regression analyses revealed that SGLT2i/INS achieved a greater reduction in HbA1c [weighted mean difference (WMD) -0.24%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.43 to -0.05%], fasting plasma glucose (WMD -18.0 mg/dL, 95% CI -28.5 to -7.6 mg/dL), and body weight (WMD -2.38 kg, 95% CI -3.18 to -1.58 kg) from baseline than DPP4i/INS without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia (relative risks 1.19, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.82).

- **Conclusions**: Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors achieved better g

### Sglt inhibitors on weight and body mass: A meta-analysis of 116 randomized-controlled trials [^111PCtRR]. Obesity (2022). High credibility.

Multiple trials have demonstrated the metabolic effects of sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients regardless of diabetes status, and recent trials have been conducted on the combined sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 and sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT1/SGLT2) inhibitors. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the weight reduction effects and dose-response relationship of SGLT inhibitors and to assess the relative efficacy of SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitors.

- **Methods**: Four electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Scopus) were searched on November 21, 2020, for articles published from January 1, 2000, up to November 21, 2020.

- **Results**: In total, 116 randomized-controlled trials were included, with a combined cohort of 98,497 patients. Overall, patients had a mean weight reduction of -1.79 kg (95% CI: -1.93 to -1.66, p < 0.001) compared with placebo. This effect was observed across diabetes status, duration of follow-up, various comorbidities, and all SGLT drug types. Mean BMI changes were -0.71 kg/m² (95% CI: -0.94 to -0.47, p < 0.001) compared with placebo. Canagliflozin, empagliflozin, sotagliflozin, and licogliflozin showed a dose-response relationship for mean weight change. Compared with SGLT2 inhibitors, SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitors had a significantly larger reduction in weight.

- **Conclusions**: SGLT inhibitors demonstrated weight reduction benefits in this meta-analysis. Further studies are needed to clarify their role in weight management.

### Sglt2 inhibitors and the clinical implications of associated weight loss in type 2 diabetes: A narrative review [^113rUUei]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

With the development of new and more efficacious treatments for diabetes, the choice of antihyperglycemic agent has become important. In patients with high cardiovascular risk requiring additional disease control, the association of an SGLT2i with GLP-1 RA seems a rational choice. The DURATION 8 study showed that dapagliflozin plus exenatide once weekly improved glycemic control and resulted in a larger weight loss than either drug alone. Similar results were seen in more recent trials, AWARD-10 and SUSTAIN-9, with other GLP-1 RAs added to a background treatment with an SGLT2i. Based on the overall evidence, it seems that sequential or concomitant use of SGLT2is and GLP-1 RA provides the most favorable approach based on their cardiovascular protection (heart failure and major adverse cardiovascular events), glycemic control (HbA1c lowering), and metabolic effects (attenuation of compensatory hyperphagia, weight loss, and minimal risk of hypoglycemia).

For patients and medical staff, type 2 diabetes management requires an ongoing effort to control the disease. We strongly believe that novel agents associated with weight loss — SGLT2is and GLP-1 RAs — should be exploited at a higher rate. Updated guidelines and treatment recommendations are a solid basis for this opinion. Although many elements of SGLT2is' potential are still not elucidated, it is likely that physicians go through a clear decision-making process when prescribing them in daily clinical practice.

Interviews conducted with patients with type 2 diabetes under treatment with one SGLT2i provide a new perspective on patient-reported outcomes.

### Empagliflozin: Role in treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115LhiNY]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

In addition to improvements in blood glucose control, clinical trials demonstrated that empagliflozin was also associated with significant reductions in body weight compared with placebo, with weight loss of around 2 kg sustained over long-term extension studies (up to 76 weeks). A pooled analysis of five clinical trials (3300 patients) also showed reductions in indices of total and visceral adiposity, such as central obesity and the visceral adiposity index, in addition to weight loss and reduced waist circumference. Imaging studies have shown that empagliflozin reduced the total fat mass, including abdominal visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue.

Empagliflozin has also been associated with modest reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP). In a pooled analysis of four 24-week studies (1652 patients on empagliflozin 10 or 25 mg, 825 on placebo), the adjusted mean difference for the pooled empagliflozin groups versus placebo in change from baseline in SBP at week 24 was −3.6 mmHg (95% CI: −4.5 to −2.7; P 140 mmHg group: −6.3 mmHg, SBP 130–140 mmHg group: −4.0 mmHg, and SBP < 130 mmHg group: −2.6 mmHg). Events consistent with volume depletion were reported in 0.2% of patients.

### Improved glucose control with weight loss, lower insulin doses, and no increased hypoglycemia with empagliflozin added to titrated multiple daily injections of insulin in obese inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes [^111zazhE]. Diabetes Care (2014). High credibility.

We investigated the efficacy and safety of the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, added to multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI insulin) in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

- **Research design and methods**: Patients inadequately controlled on MDI insulin ± metformin (mean HbA1c 8.3% [67 mmol/mol]; BMI 34.8 kg/m²; insulin dose 92 international units/day) were randomized and treated with once-daily empagliflozin 10 mg (n = 186), empagliflozin 25 mg (n = 189), or placebo (n = 188) for 52 weeks. Insulin dose was to remain stable in weeks 1–18, adjusted to meet glucose targets in weeks 19–40, then stable in weeks 41–52. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 18. Secondary endpoints were changes from baseline in insulin dose, weight, and HbA1c at week 52.

- **Results**: Adjusted mean ± SE changes from baseline in HbA1c were -0.50 ± 0.05% (-5.5 ± 0.5 mmol/mol) for placebo versus -0.94 ± 0.05% (-10.3 ± 0.5 mmol/mol) and -1.02 ± 0.05% (-11.1 ± 0.5 mmol/mol) for empagliflozin 10 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively, at week 18 (both P < 0.001). At week 52, further reductions with insulin titration resulted in changes from baseline in HbA1c of -0.81 ± 0.08% (-8.9 ± 0.9 mmol/mol), -1.18 ± 0.08% (-12.9 ± 0.9 mmol/mol), and -1.27 ± 0.08% (-13.9 ± 0.9 mmol/mol) with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively, and final HbA1c of 7.5% (58 mmol/mol), 7.2% (55 mmol/mol), and 7.1% (54 mmol/mol), respectively. More patients attained HbA1c < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) with empagliflozin (31–42%) versus placebo.

### Long-term study of patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment shows that dapagliflozin reduces weight and blood pressure but does not improve glycemic control [^113G6th5]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

In patients with diabetes, glycemic improvement by sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibition depends on the kidney's ability to filter glucose. Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, reduces hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes and normal or mildly impaired renal function. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we assessed daily treatment with dapagliflozin in 252 patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment.

The primary endpoint, the mean change in HbA1c, was not statistically different from placebo after 24 weeks (-0.41% and -0.44% for 5- and 10-mg doses, respectively, and -0.32% for placebo). The mean weight change from baseline was -1.54 kg and -1.89 kg for the 5- and 10-mg doses, respectively, and +0.21 kg for placebo. The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased in the dapagliflozin groups compared to placebo.

Through 104 weeks, 13 patients receiving dapagliflozin and no patients receiving placebo experienced bone fracture. At 1 week, the mean serum creatinine increased with dapagliflozin 5 mg (+0.13 mg/dL) and 10 mg (+0.18 mg/dL) and did not change further after 104 weeks. Mean serum electrolytes did not change in any group, and there were fewer episodes of hyperkalemia with dapagliflozin than placebo. Thus, in patients with moderate renal impairment, dapagliflozin did not improve glycemic control but reduced weight and blood pressure.

### Diabetes and gout: Another role for SGLT2 inhibitors [^114XpE19]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are established blood glucose-lowering and body weight-lowering agents used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Their competitive inhibition of SGLT2 in the proximal renal tubules reduces the reabsorption of glucose from the renal filtrate, leading to glucosuria, which lowers blood glucose levels. The caloric loss associated with glucosuria contributes to weight reduction. Consequently, reduced glucotoxicity and adiposity decrease insulin resistance and insulin concentrations.

Beyond their metabolic effects, SGLT2 inhibitors also provide cardioprotective and renoprotective benefits. They typically lower blood pressure in individuals with hypertension, partly due to osmotic diuresis from glucosuria. This antihypertensive effect may reduce the onset and severity of heart failure, whether with preserved or reduced ejection fraction, independently of blood glucose and body weight effects. These benefits are observed in individuals with or without T2DM.

Increased lipolysis due to caloric deficit and reduced insulin also allows SGLT2 inhibitors to improve cardiac energetics by enhancing the availability of energy substrates for the heart.

### Long-term study of patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment shows that dapagliflozin reduces weight and blood pressure but does not improve glycemic control [^117Er9cC]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 2/3 study was conducted across 111 sites in the United States, Argentina, Canada, India, Mexico, Peru, Italy, Australia, France, Spain, Denmark, Puerto Rico, and Singapore. Institutional review boards or independent ethics committees approved the protocol, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Each patient provided written informed consent.

Male and female patients aged 18 years or older with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and inadequate glycemic control, defined as HbA1c levels between 7.0% and 11.0%, were enrolled between June 19, 2008, and May 21, 2009. Eligible patients had estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values of 30 to 59 ml/min per 1.73 m² and a body mass index (BMI) of 45.0 kg/m² or less. A stable antidiabetic regimen was defined as diet and exercise therapy alone or in combination with any approved antidiabetic medication(s), including insulin, provided that doses of oral antidiabetic medications, exenatide, or pramlintide had not changed during the six weeks prior to enrollment. Additionally, doses of long-acting or intermediate-acting insulin should not have varied by more than 20% during the same period.

Exclusion criteria included:

Secondary endpoint analysis of responders achieving 5% or 10% weight loss revealed statistically significant differences among the individual treatment groups versus placebo for responders with ≥ 5% decrease in body weight from baseline at the higher licogliflozin doses only (licogliflozin 50 mg qd, licogliflozin 150 mg qd, licogliflozin 25 mg bid, and licogliflozin 50 mg bid). The greatest effect was observed with the two highest doses in each dose regimen: 45.3% [95% CI: 2.72% to 14.93%], P < 0.001, licogliflozin 50 mg bid; 42.9% [95% CI: 2.41% to 12.88%], P < 0.001, licogliflozin 150 mg qd versus 12.8% placebo. Very few responders met the criterion of ≥ 10% decrease in body weight from baseline, with a maximum of 10.8% in the licogliflozin 25 mg bid group compared with 3.8% in the placebo group, and no significant differences were noted across active treatments versus placebo.

Waterfall plots of individual participants' percent change in body weight (kilograms) from baseline at week 24 are provided in Supporting Information Figure S2. These plots show that as the dose increased, a greater proportion of patients lost weight, and the extent of weight loss was also greater. Raw mean percent change in body weight (kilograms) from baseline by treatment at week 24 is shown in Figure 4. While an apparent dose-response effect was observed with both treatment regimens, absolute changes in body weight were small in all treatments.

### A randomized controlled trial of dapagliflozin plus once-weekly exenatide versus placebo in individuals with obesity and without diabetes: Metabolic effects and markers associated with bodyweight loss [^111Yev6F]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). High credibility.

The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin and the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist exenatide reduce bodyweight via differing and complementary mechanisms. This post hoc analysis investigated the metabolic effects and baseline associations with bodyweight loss on coadministration of dapagliflozin and exenatide once weekly (QW) among adults with obesity and without diabetes.

- **Methods**: In the primary trial, adults with obesity and without diabetes [n = 50; 18–70 years; body mass index (BMI) 30–45 kg/m²] were randomized to double-blind oral dapagliflozin 10 mg (DAPA) once daily plus subcutaneous long-acting exenatide 2 mg QW (ExQW) or placebo over 24 weeks, followed by an open-label extension from 24–52 weeks during which all participants received active treatment. Primary results have been published previously. This analysis evaluated: (1) the effects of DAPA+ExQW on changes in substrates [free fatty acids (FFAs), glycerol, beta-OH-butyrate, and glucose], hormones (glucagon and insulin), and insulin secretion [insulinogenic index (IGI)] via an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and (2) associations between bodyweight loss and baseline characteristics (e.g. BMI), single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the GLP-1 pathway, and markers of glucose regulation.

- **Results**: Compared with placebo at 24 weeks, 2-hour FFAs post-OGTT increased (mean difference, +20.4 μmol/l; P < 0.05), and fasting glucose, 2-hour glucose post-OGTT, and glucose area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) decreased with DAPA+ExQW [mean differences.

### Licogliflozin, a novel SGLT1 and 2 inhibitor: Body weight effects in a randomized trial in adults with overweight or obesity [^1167XDKm]. Obesity (2020). High credibility.

The primary endpoint of this study was the percent change from baseline in body weight following treatment with various doses of licogliflozin. The treatment consisted of four once-daily doses (2.5 mg, 10 mg, 50 mg, and 150 mg qd) or four twice-daily doses (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg bid), compared to a placebo, after 24 weeks.

- **Secondary endpoints**: Response rates were measured by percent decrease in body weight (≥ 5% or ≥ 10%) from baseline at week 24 for the overall population and categorized by glycemic status (normoglycemic, dysglycemic, and T2DM). The study also measured weight loss following 24 weeks of treatment according to glycemic status, the effect of 24 weeks of licogliflozin versus placebo on waist circumference, FPG, HbA1c, BP, fasting lipid profile, hsCRP, and UGE 24. Additionally, the study assessed changes in weight and secondary efficacy parameters by licogliflozin treatment versus placebo between week 24 and week 48, as well as the safety and tolerability of licogliflozin and its pharmacokinetics.

- **Exploratory endpoints**: These included the percent change in weight from baseline after 48 weeks, the effects of licogliflozin on selected efficacy variables over 48 weeks in the individual treatment groups (waist circumference, BP, fasting lipid profile, hsCRP), and the effects of licogliflozin on selected AEs of interest over 48 weeks.

### Empagliflozin as adjunct to insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes: a 4-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (EASE-1) [^111dUUZ7]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Insulin therapy is an essential part of the management of type 1 diabetes but is often associated with weight gain and hypoglycemia. Despite advances in insulin formulation and delivery, patients with type 1 diabetes often fail to reach the target HbA1c of < 7%. Inadequate glucose control can lead to acute conditions such as ketoacidosis and chronic complications including retinopathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular disease. Compared with the general population, the risk of cardiovascular disease is nearly eight times greater in patients with type 1 diabetes, and the increased risk of mortality from heart disease is even greater.

Empagliflozin is a potent and selective inhibitor of the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) that inhibits renal glucose reabsorption and thus increases urinary glucose excretion (UGE) in patients with diabetes. In patients with type 2 diabetes, empagliflozin given as monotherapy or as add‐on therapy (including as add‐on to basal insulin or multiple daily injections of insulin) has consistently been shown to improve glycemic control and reduce blood pressure and weight, with a low risk of hypoglycemia.

As the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors is independent of the action of insulin, these agents have the potential to be used as an adjunct to insulin to improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes. In an 8-week single-arm pilot study in patients with type 1 diabetes, empagliflozin as adjunct to insulin led to significant reductions in glycated hemoglobin.

### Dapagliflozin is associated with improved glycaemic control and weight reduction at 44 months of follow-up in a secondary care diabetes clinic in the UK [^113DkrpK]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Low credibility.

We examined HbA1c and cardiovascular risk factors with a median follow-up of 44 months of therapy with dapagliflozin.

- **Methods**: We undertook a clinical practice evaluation of 101 patients attending our clinic.

- **Results**: Dapagliflozin resulted in a significant reduction in HbA1c, decreasing from 82.6 ± 15.7 to 68.7 ± 17.8 mmol/mol.

- **Conclusion**: Dapagliflozin maintains glycaemic control along with sustained improvements in weight, and there is no decline in renal function.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists combined with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors reduce weight in type 1 diabetes [^115sJN1Z]. Obesity (2023). High credibility.

This study evaluated whether adding sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and/or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) to insulin reduced weight and glycemia in people with type 1 diabetes.

- **Methods**: This retrospective analysis of electronic health records evaluated 296 people with type 1 diabetes over 12 months after medications were first prescribed. Four groups were defined: control (n = 80), SGLT2i (n = 94), GLP1-RA (n = 82), and combination of drugs (Combo) (n = 40). We measured changes at one year in weight and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).

- **Results**: The control group did not have changes in weight or glycemic control. The mean (SD) percentage weight loss after 12 months was 4.4% (6.0%), 8.2% (8.5%), and 9.0% (8.4%) in the SGLT2i, GLP1-RA, and Combo groups, respectively (p < 0.001). The Combo group lost the most weight (p < 0.001). The HbA1c reduction was 0.4% (0.7%), 0.3% (0.7%), and 0.6% (0.8%) in the SGLT2i, GLP1-RA, and Combo groups, respectively (p < 0.001). The Combo group had the biggest improvements in glycemic control and total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with baseline (all p < 0.01). Severe adverse events were similar between all the groups, with no increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis.

- **Conclusions**: The SGLT2i and GLP1-RA agents on their own improved body weight and glycemia, but combining the medications resulted in more weight loss. Treatment intensification appears to result in benefits with no difference in severe adverse events.

### Licogliflozin, a novel SGLT1 and 2 inhibitor: Body weight effects in a randomized trial in adults with overweight or obesity [^113gtKJU]. Obesity (2020). Low credibility.

Clinically relevant and statistically significant raw mean changes in HbA1c over 24 weeks (−0.4% to −0.6%) were observed only with the two highest once-daily doses and the highest twice-daily dose of licogliflozin versus placebo in patients with T2DM. Raw mean HbA1c changes from week 24 to week 48 are provided in the supporting information.

- **Systolic blood pressure changes**: Overall, SBP tended to be reduced from baseline in all licogliflozin treatment groups versus placebo following 24 weeks of treatment. Statistically significant adjusted mean changes were observed for:
	- Licogliflozin 50 mg qd (−6.5 mmHg [95% CI: −10.52 to −2.42], n = 38; P = 0.002)
	- Licogliflozin 25 mg bid (−4.1 mmHg [95% CI: −8.07 to −0.19], n = 37; P = 0.04)
	- Licogliflozin 50 mg bid (−3.4 mmHg [95% CI: −6.61 to −0.19], n = 75; P = 0.038) versus placebo (n = 78).

Changes in diastolic blood pressure versus placebo following 24 weeks of licogliflozin and BP changes between week 24 and week 48 are detailed in the online supporting information.

### Lyrica [^117Se7eQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Weight gain**: Lyrica treatment may cause weight gain. In Lyrica-controlled clinical trials lasting up to 14 weeks with adult patients, a gain of 7% or more over baseline weight was observed in 9% of Lyrica-treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients. Few patients treated with Lyrica (0.3%) withdrew from controlled trials due to weight gain. Lyrica-associated weight gain was related to dose and duration of exposure but did not appear to be associated with baseline BMI, gender, or age. Weight gain was not limited to patients with edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Although weight gain was not associated with clinically important changes in blood pressure in short-term controlled studies, the long-term cardiovascular effects of Lyrica-associated weight gain are unknown.

Among diabetic patients, Lyrica-treated individuals gained an average of 1.6 kg (range: -16 to 16 kg), compared to an average 0.3 kg (range: -10 to 9 kg) weight gain in placebo patients. In a cohort of 333 diabetic patients who received Lyrica for at least 2 years, the average weight gain was 5.2 kg.

While the effects of Lyrica-associated weight gain on glycemic control have not been systematically assessed, in controlled and longer-term open-label clinical trials with diabetic patients, Lyrica treatment did not appear to be associated with loss of glycemic control (as measured by HbA1C).

- **Tumorigenic potential**: In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies of Lyrica, an unexpectedly high incidence of hemangiosarcoma was identified in two different strains of mice [see Nonc].

### Medications and conditions associated with weight loss in patients prescribed semaglutide based on real-world data [^115sTvip]. Obesity (2023). High credibility.

Approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017 for diabetes and in 2021 for weight loss, semaglutide has seen widespread use among individuals who aim to lose weight. The aim of this study was to evaluate weight loss and the influence of clinical factors on semaglutide patients in real-world clinical practice.

- **Methods**: Using data from 10 health systems within the Greater Plains Collaborative (a PCORnet Clinical Research Network), nearly 4000 clinical factors encompassing demographic, diagnosis, and prescription information were extracted for semaglutide patients. A gradient-boosting, machine-learning classifier was developed for weight-loss prediction and identification of the most impactful factors via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value extrapolation.

- **Results**: A total of 3555 eligible patients (539 of whom were observed 52 weeks following exposure) from March 2017 to April 2022 were studied. On average, individuals lost 4.44% (male individuals, 3.66%; female individuals, 5.08%) of their initial weight. History of diabetes mellitus diagnosis was associated with less weight loss, whereas prediabetes and linaclotide use were associated with more pronounced weight loss.

- **Conclusions**: Weight loss in patients prescribed semaglutide from real-world evidence was strong but attenuated compared with previous clinical trials. Machine-learning analysis of electronic health record data identified factors that warrant further research and consideration when tailoring weight-loss therapy.

### The pleiotropic effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors: Beyond the glycemic benefit [^111ge2Bu]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

A literature search of PubMed was conducted on February 13, 2019, for English-language publications using the following search terms: (SGLT2 inhibitors OR SGLT-2 inhibitors OR SGLT-2is OR SGLT2is OR sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors OR sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors OR empagliflozin OR canagliflozin OR dapagliflozin OR ertugliflozin) AND (type 2 diabetes mellitus OR type 2 diabetes OR T2D OR non-insulin dependent diabetes) AND (nonglycemic effects OR nonglycaemic effects OR non-glycemic effects OR non-glycaemic effects OR pleiotropic effects). Additional literature was identified by reviewing bibliographies from the reference data set. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and the clinical implications of associated weight loss in type 2 diabetes: A narrative review [^1177k27o]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

The mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibition leads to cardiorenal risk reduction are not fully elucidated but include improved glycemic control, reduced body weight, lower blood pressure, and osmotic diuresis. Cardiovascular benefits and weight loss are consistently reported with SGLT2 inhibitors across different patient population groups, irrespective of baseline BMI, moderate chronic disease, and glycemic control.

Weight reduction remains a crucial goal in the prevention and treatment of diabetes. Along with clinical trials, large real-world studies would allow a better understanding of the appetite patterns and caloric behavior of patients with Type 2 Diabetes treated with an SGLT2 inhibitor to allow this versatile therapeutic class to reach its full potential.

### Early weight loss with liraglutide 3.0 mg predicts 1-year weight loss and is associated with improvements in clinical markers [^1142z7yK]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

To identify an early response criterion for predicting ≥ 5% weight loss with liraglutide 3.0 mg at week 56, and to compare efficacy outcomes in early responders (ERs) and early non-responders (ENRs), the following methods were used:

Using pooled data from the SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes and SCALE Diabetes trials, weight loss of ≥ 4% at 16 weeks best predicted ≥ 5% weight loss after 56 weeks. Weight loss and changes in cardiometabolic risk factors and health-related quality of life were evaluated in ERs (≥ 4% weight loss at week 16) and ENRs (< 4% weight loss at week 16).

- **Results**: More ERs achieved thresholds of ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, and > 15% weight loss at week 56 with liraglutide 3.0 mg. Greater improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors and health-related quality of life scores were observed in ERs versus ENRs.

The early response criterion was clinically useful in identifying individuals who would achieve clinically meaningful weight loss at 56 weeks.

### A randomized controlled trial of dapagliflozin plus once-weekly exenatide versus placebo in individuals with obesity and without diabetes: Metabolic effects and markers associated with bodyweight loss [^11315Ytk]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Participants**: Characteristics of study participants have been described previously. Briefly, of 50 randomized participants, 23 (92%) and 20 (80%) completed 24 weeks of double-blind treatment with DAPA + ExQW and placebo, respectively. Of these, 21 participants (84%) continued DAPA + ExQW, and 17 (68%) switched from placebo to DAPA + ExQW (ESM Fig. S1).

- **Effect of DAPA + ExQW on substrates**: Mean ± standard deviation urinary glucose excretion, measured during the 3-hour OGTT, was 50.5 mmol/3 h ± 31.4 (9.1 g/3 h ± 5.7) and 44.6 mmol/3 h ± 26.7 (8.0 g/3 h ± 4.8) after 24 and 52 weeks of DAPA + ExQW therapy, respectively. No measurable glucosuria occurred in placebo-treated participants.

### Sglt2 inhibitors and the clinical implications of associated weight loss in type 2 diabetes: a narrative review [^114syMK1]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

The mechanism of action and effect on energy balance is critical in understanding the role of SGLT2 inhibitors in diabetes management. Glycosuria is one of the key characteristics of poorly controlled diabetes, along with hyperglycemia and reduced insulin secretion and/or glucose utilization. The kidneys play a key role in maintaining glucose homeostasis, participating in steps along the whole metabolic chain of glucose, including its production (gluconeogenesis), utilization, filtration, reabsorption, and excretion.

- **SGLT2 function**: SGLT2 is a high-capacity, low-affinity glucose transporter responsible for 90% of glucose reabsorption. SGLT2 transporters are located in the kidneys, mainly in the S1 and S2 segments of the proximal convoluted tubules. The rest of the glucose is further reabsorbed in the S3 segment by SGLT1, a low-capacity, high-affinity transporter. Tubular reabsorption reaches its maximum capacity at approximately 375 mg glucose/min, with a corresponding plasma glucose level of 200 mg/dL. Glycosuria occurs when this threshold is exceeded. If the hyperglycemic status is persistent, enhanced SGLT1/2 expression leads to paradoxically higher rates of glucose reabsorption.

The development of SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) represents a major paradigm shift in the treatment of diabetes, turning a "defect" into a "mode of action". Four SGLT2is are currently approved in Europe for T2D treatment, in combination with diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and ertugliflozin). They are not specifically approved by regulatory agencies for body weight reduction or treatment of obesity.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition and cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: The emerging role of natriuresis [^111at9Sp]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Inhibition of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 causes both glycosuria and natriuresis, leading to reductions in hyperglycemia, body weight, blood pressure, and proteinuria. The recently published EMPA-REG OUTCOME study demonstrated significant cardiovascular and mortality benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition with empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, suggesting a broader role for sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition in patients with heart failure.

### Weight-independent amelioration of adipokine profile by enavogliflozin, a selective SGLT2 inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113jrh6o]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). High credibility.

According to several studies, SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with diabetes significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular events. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on adipokines may also be related to cardioprotective mechanisms. Increased serum leptin levels have been linked to insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, high leptin concentrations have also been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including microvascular complications and cardiac autonomic dysfunction. Additionally, endothelial dysfunction is more commonly observed in patients with type 2 diabetes and elevated leptin levels. Emerging evidence suggests the role of leptin in exacerbating coronary atherosclerosis and contributing to endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Considering the relationship between adipokines and metabolic dysfunction, the observed changes in leptin following SGLT2 inhibitor administration in our study may provide a hypothesis for the cardiovascular benefits associated with these agents.

Interestingly, herein, a small subgroup of participants in the enavogliflozin group who experienced weight gain (< 0% weight loss; n = 5) still demonstrated an increase in adiponectin levels. In contrast, participants in the placebo group who experienced weight gain (< 0% weight loss; n = 20) generally showed a decrease in adiponectin. While this finding should be interpreted with caution due to the very small sample size and the potential influence of inter-individual variability, it highlights a distinctive response in adipokine levels regardless of weight change.

### Licogliflozin, a novel SGLT1 and 2 inhibitor: Body weight effects in a randomized trial in adults with overweight or obesity [^114Kgj5R]. Obesity (2020). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to explore the dose response of licogliflozin, a dual inhibitor of sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) and 2 (SGLT2), by evaluating the change in body weight in adults with overweight or obesity.

- **Methods**: This dose-response analysis evaluated the change in body weight following 24 weeks with four once-daily and twice-daily licogliflozin doses (2.5–150 mg) versus placebo. The primary endpoint was weight change. A further 24-week analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of two once-daily licogliflozin doses in maintaining initial weight reduction.

- **Results**: Licogliflozin, administered once or twice daily, produced a significant dose-response signal for weight loss versus placebo (P < 0.0001). However, mean adjusted percent changes in body weight after 24 weeks were modest, ranging from -0.45% to -3.83% in the 50 mg twice daily group [95% CI: -5.26% to -2.48%]; n = 75. A responder analysis of ≥ 5% weight loss at week 24 revealed significant differences versus placebo, which were most pronounced with the highest doses of 50 mg twice daily (45.3%) and 150 mg once daily (42.9%) (both P < 0.01). While weight loss was greater at higher doses, gastrointestinal adverse events were also more frequent. The 50 mg once-daily dose had perhaps the best balance between efficacy and tolerability.

- **Conclusions**: Licogliflozin produced significant reductions in body weight versus placebo. However, the magnitude of weight reduction was modest.

### Licogliflozin, a novel SGLT1 and 2 inhibitor: Body weight effects in a randomized trial in adults with overweight or obesity [^117CCQK9]. Obesity (2020). Low credibility.

In this study, licogliflozin administered once daily or twice daily resulted in statistically significant weight loss compared to placebo, including a dose-response signal (P < 0.0001) over 24 weeks. However, the mean percent decreases in body weight were mild (< 5% from baseline). This effect was less robust than the ~6% weight loss reported in the prior 12-week proof-of-concept (PoC) study. Most of the weight loss associated with licogliflozin treatment appeared to occur in the first 12 weeks before plateauing. In the 12-week PoC study, the reduction in body weight with dual SGLT1 and 2 inhibition was greater in patients with dysglycemia. However, this trend was not observed in the current study.

The greatest weight loss observed with licogliflozin treatment versus placebo over 48 weeks was 5.4% in the licogliflozin 50 mg once daily/25 mg group (5.5 kg placebo-subtracted weight loss), exceeding the weight loss previously reported with approved SGLT2 inhibitors, which typically result in ~2% to 3% weight reduction. This additional weight loss was likely due to the SGLT1 effect of licogliflozin. A significant weight reduction of ≥ 5% from baseline among the licogliflozin treatment groups (34.2% to 45.3% for licogliflozin versus 12.8% for placebo) was observed only at higher doses (150 mg once daily, 50 mg once daily, 25 mg twice daily, 50 mg twice daily). Very few responders met the criterion of ≥ 10% weight reduction from baseline (5.3%−10.8% for licogliflozin vs. 3.8% for placebo).

### The SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: A bench to bedside review [^1117viNy]. Diabetes Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

The treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) continues to pose challenges for clinicians and patients. The dramatic rise in T2DM prevalence, which has paralleled the rise in obesity, has strained the healthcare system and prompted the search for therapies that not only effectively treat hyperglycemia but are also weight neutral or promote weight loss.

In most clinical situations after diagnosis, patients are advised to adopt lifestyle changes, and metformin is initiated to help control blood glucose levels. However, metformin may not be tolerated or sufficient for those with higher glucose levels at diagnosis. Even among those who have initial success with metformin, the majority eventually require one or more additional agents to achieve their treatment goals. Because T2DM is a progressive disease, the requirement for combination treatment escalates over time, driving the need for therapies with complementary mechanisms of action.

- **Methods and results**: Online public resources were searched using "empagliflozin", identifying 32 articles in PubMed and 12 abstracts presented at the 2013 American Diabetes Association meeting. Peer-reviewed articles and abstracts describing preclinical studies and clinical trials were retrieved, and relevant publications were included in this review. Trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov were searched for ongoing empagliflozin studies.

- **Conclusion**: The sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are of great interest since they provide a novel, insulin-independent mechanism of action.

### Sglt2 inhibitors and the clinical implications of associated weight loss in type 2 diabetes: A narrative review [^115faBjX]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

The obesity epidemic is closely linked to the rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Body weight reduction remains an important challenge in patients with T2D, as it requires changing their overall metabolic control. Of all glucose-lowering therapies, only sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) consistently result in weight improvement. Moreover, these two classes have important cardiovascular and renal benefits. We summarize the key available information related to the weight loss effect of SGLT2is in T2D, focusing on the unexploited potential of these drugs.

- **Methods**: Data on weight change with SGLT2is in patients with T2D were extracted from published cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs). A discussion on patient perspectives about weight change is based on key preclinical and clinical trials, meta-analyses, and reviews, supplemented by the authors' clinical judgment and research experience in the field.

- **Results**: SGLT2is have a unique mode of action resulting in caloric loss through glycosuria. The anticipated weight loss with SGLT2is is not reflected in clinical trial results. There is a discrepancy between the magnitude of improvement in glycemic control and the weight loss, cardiovascular, and renal benefits obtained in large clinical trials.

- **Conclusion**: The relationships between the magnitude of weight loss, improvement in glycemic control, and cardiorenal benefits with SGLT2i are still unclear. Potential mechanisms other than simple glycemic efficacy should be investigated.

### Why do SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit only 30–50% of renal glucose reabsorption in humans [^117K48g3]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is a serious global health issue that has reached epidemic proportions in both developed and developing countries over the last two decades. With currently available medicines, many diabetic patients fail to achieve optimal glycemic control (HbA 1c < 6.5–7.0%). With the exception of the glucagon-like peptide 1 analogs and the thiazolidinediones, other antidiabetic medications lose their effectiveness to control hyperglycemia over time due to the progressive decline of β-cell function. As a consequence, many patients receive multiple antidiabetic medicines and eventually require insulin therapy, which often fails to achieve the desired glycemic goal and is associated with weight gain and hypoglycemia. Failure to achieve glycemic targets is the primary factor responsible for the microvascular complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy) and, to a lesser extent, macrovascular complications. Additionally, the majority of diabetic patients are overweight or obese, and many therapies are associated with weight gain, which causes insulin resistance and deterioration in glycemic control.

### Potential place of SGLT2 inhibitors in treatment paradigms for type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114APGot]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this paper is to examine the role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, a drug class that gained attention following their first FDA approval in 2013, in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Methods implemented involve reviewing clinical trials for SGLT2 inhibitors, focusing on canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin.

Results indicate that clinical trials support the use of SGLT2 inhibitors as either monotherapy or in addition to other glucose-lowering treatments as adjuncts to diet and exercise. Significant clinical experience has been accumulated in a relatively short time frame.

In conclusion, these drugs appear beneficial across a variety of T2DM populations, with efficacy linked mainly to renal function. They seem especially suitable for patients at risk of hypoglycemia or weight gain, as clinical trials show moderate weight loss and low hypoglycemic risk when not paired with an insulin secretagogue. Additionally, SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated the ability to lower blood pressure, potentially benefiting patients with T2DM complicated by hypertension. These inhibitors were incorporated into the 2015 American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes position statement on hyperglycemia management, and they received even more prominence in subsequent American positions.

### A novel and selective sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, tofogliflozin, improves glycaemic control and lowers body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^1151DtsB]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of different doses of tofogliflozin, a novel, highly selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

In a 12-week, multicentre, multinational, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study, patients with inadequate glycaemic control from diet and exercise alone, or from diet and exercise plus a stable dose of metformin, were randomized to one of five doses of tofogliflozin (2.5, 5, 10, 20, or 40 mg) or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the absolute change at week 12 from baseline in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), minus the change in the placebo group.

Statistically significant dose-dependent reductions in HbA1c were shown in all treated groups except the 2.5-mg dose group, with a maximum reduction of 0.56% (placebo-subtracted) at the 40-mg dose, along with increased urinary glucose excretion. Metformin treatment had no substantial influence on tofogliflozin efficacy. Dose-dependent reductions in fasting plasma glucose and body weight were observed, and glucose intolerance was improved, with a trend towards blood pressure reduction. Slight increases were observed for mean ketone bodies with no abnormal change in the ketone body ratio. No deaths or treatment-related serious adverse events were reported. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the placebo group (37.9%) compared to the tofogliflozin group (35.9–46.3%). Withdrawal because of adverse events was rare (≤ 2 patients per treatment group), with similar rates across groups.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes [^1154Rhy8]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacological interventions for diabetes mellitus type 2, and more specifically with respect to weight loss, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of glucose-lowering medications that have effects on weight loss, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists, to reduce weight in patients with overweight or obesity.
