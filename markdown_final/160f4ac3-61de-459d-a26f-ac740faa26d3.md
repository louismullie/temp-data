## Question

Yellow ear drainage

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage yellow ear drainage. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about characterizing the drainage and its likely sources. Then, I should verify the tympanic membrane status and whether tubes or perforations are present. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis by phenotype, including tympanostomy tube otorrhea, acute otitis media with perforation, otitis externa, chronic suppurative otitis media, cholesteatoma, and auricular or cartilage infections. After that, I need to outline targeted diagnostics, including cultures and imaging when indicated. Finally, I will align treatment to the diagnosis, emphasizing topical therapy, aural toilet, water precautions, and escalation or referral triggers, while double-checking safety and follow-up points throughout.

> Let me first confirm the basics about the drainage itself, because the color, consistency, odor, and duration guide the differential. Yellow drainage often reflects purulence or serous-purulent fluid from middle ear infection, but I should not jump to conclusions; yellow can also be seen with fungal debris, cholesteatoma keratin, or even cerumen mixed with exudate, so I need to correlate with otoscopy and symptoms like pain, pruritus, and hearing changes [^11598rhu] [^115CepoX] [^114gHW5c].

> Wait, let me verify the tympanic membrane status and middle ear access next, because that determines whether topical drops will reach the middle ear. If tympanostomy tubes are present, yellow drainage is common and usually represents tube otorrhea; if the TM is perforated or there is a chronic perforation, drainage can be from the middle ear; if the TM is intact, I should consider external canal sources such as otitis externa or cerumen-related pathology, and I should also ask about recent water exposure, trauma, or instrumentation that could have damaged the canal skin or TM [^1111wXgB] [^112dPPGu] [^114U9KpW].

> I will now examine the ear canal and tympanic membrane carefully with pneumatic otoscopy or microscopy, and I should double-check for granulation tissue, cholesteatoma debris, or a blocked tube, because these findings change management. If the tube is blocked, drainage may be absent despite infection; if granulation is present, pink or bloody discharge may coexist with yellow purulence; and if there is retraction or a pocket, I need to consider cholesteatoma as a source of refractory drainage [^1111wXgB] [^115MnrGL] [^113ow5jx].

> Let me consider the scenario of tympanostomy tube otorrhea first, since yellow drainage with tubes is common and typically uncomplicated. The first-line treatment is topical quinolone drops such as ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin-dexamethasone, and I should confirm that caregivers are instructed to clean crusts with tissue spears or a swab with hydrogen peroxide before drops, pump the tragus to deliver medication, and keep the ear dry during active drainage; oral antibiotics are generally not needed unless there is persistent infection or a specific indication, and I need to ensure we avoid prolonged topical therapy to prevent fungal overgrowth [^115rZfmA] [^1161poeu] [^11279yip].

> Hold on, I should verify water precautions because families often ask about swimming. During active drainage, I should advise avoiding swimming and using a coated cotton ball or silicone ear plugs for bathing. Once drainage resolves, routine water precautions are usually unnecessary, though plugs may be used selectively for comfort or in non-chlorinated water, and I should caution against using putty-like materials that can lodge in the canal [^115ztNrV] [^115X2knX].

> Next, I should review acute otitis media with spontaneous perforation, where yellow purulent otorrhea follows pain and fever. I need to ensure the diagnosis is supported by otoscopic signs of acute inflammation and middle ear effusion, and then treat with topical quinolone drops as first-line; systemic antibiotics may be reserved for severe illness, young age, or failure of topical therapy, and I should confirm that caregivers understand to keep the ear dry and arrange follow-up to document healing of the perforation [^115ZpWLJ].

> Let me think about acute otitis externa, which can produce yellow, malodorous discharge with canal edema and exquisite tenderness. I should confirm that the TM is intact before considering irrigation, and I should treat with topical antibiotic drops, adding a steroid if edema is marked; if canal swelling precludes drop delivery, I should place an ear wick and arrange follow-up in 48–72 hours, and I need to counsel on keeping the ear dry and avoiding trauma or drops if the TM is perforated [^114U9KpW] [^112oQnh3].

> I need to check for chronic suppurative otitis media when drainage persists beyond two weeks through a known perforation, because management differs from acute disease. Aural toilet to remove debris improves drug penetration, and topical quinolone antibiotics are preferred; evidence suggests topical therapy outperforms systemic antibiotics for short-term resolution, though I should individualize based on access and severity, and I should consider culture if drainage is refractory or recurrent [^111wqyZs] [^1172yQDg] [^1155AYug].

> But wait, what if the drainage is refractory or accompanied by granulation, foul odor, or a marginal perforation? I should consider cholesteatoma and arrange urgent ENT evaluation. Cholesteatoma presents with chronic, sometimes painless drainage and requires surgical management; persistent yellow keratinous debris and retraction pockets are red flags that should prompt imaging and specialty referral rather than prolonged empiric topical therapy [^113ow5jx].

> I should also consider auricular cartilage infections, particularly in patients with piercings or trauma, where yellow drainage from sinus tracts and severe auricular pain can signal perichondritis or actinomyces. Let me verify that cultures were obtained, because actinomyces is difficult to culture and may require prolonged high-dose penicillin therapy; surgical debridement may be necessary for necrotic cartilage, and I should coordinate with ENT and infectious diseases for definitive management [^1111ykss] [^115tSxDR].

> Next, I should review diagnostics I can deploy at the point of care. I need to ensure pneumatic otoscopy or tympanometry to document middle ear status, and if drainage is present with tubes or perforation, I should obtain a mini-tipped swab culture of the drainage after cleaning the canal, because this guides therapy in refractory cases. I should avoid relying on nasopharyngeal swabs for middle ear pathogens, as they are not representative [^113SvNNA] [^112YAxw6].

> Hold on, I should verify when imaging is warranted. If there is suspected malignant otitis externa in an older diabetic or immunocompromised patient with severe otalgia and otorrhea, contrast-enhanced temporal bone CT is indicated to assess for bony destruction. Likewise, if cholesteatoma is suspected or complications such as facial weakness or vertigo arise, imaging supports surgical planning and anticipatory guidance [^111wNmKS] [^113ow5jx].

> I will now examine treatment principles and make sure I am not overusing systemic antibiotics. For most draining ears with tubes or perforations, topical quinolone drops are first-line and sufficient; systemic antibiotics are reserved for systemic toxicity, failure of appropriate topical therapy, or specific indications, and I should double-check that caregivers understand correct drop administration and canal cleaning to maximize efficacy [^1161poeu] [^115rZfmA].

> Let me reconsider the role of aural toilet, because I initially thought routine daily suction might be clearly beneficial. Wait, the evidence is actually limited and low-certainty, but expert guidance still supports clearing debris to improve topical penetration, and in practice, suction under microscopy or careful dry mopping can be helpful when drainage is thick or recurrent, with shared decision-making about frequency and setting [^1155AYug] [^114LmLKU].

> I should confirm follow-up and referral triggers. If drainage persists beyond 7–10 days despite appropriate topical therapy, if tubes cannot be visualized or are blocked, if hearing loss is present, or if recurrent episodes occur, ENT referral is indicated. Likewise, any signs of complications such as facial weakness, vertigo, or postauricular erythema warrant urgent specialty evaluation [^116FEFKh] [^113ow5jx].

> Finally, I need to ensure preventive counseling is provided. Families should keep ears dry during active drainage, avoid inserting objects into the canal, and maintain dry ear precautions after swimming or bathing. For children with recurrent tube otorrhea, prophylactic topical drops at the time of water exposure may be considered selectively, and I should reinforce that routine water precautions are not universally required once drainage resolves [^115X2knX] [^115ztNrV].

Yellow ear drainage most commonly reflects **purulent otorrhea** from acute otitis media with perforation [^115ZpWLJ], chronic suppurative otitis media [^1172yQDg], or tympanostomy tube otorrhea [^115g7mra]. Other causes include otitis externa [^112dPPGu], fungal infections [^115CepoX], cholesteatoma [^113ow5jx], and auricular infections such as perichondritis or actinomycosis [^1111ykss]. Evaluation should include **otoscopy** [^11598rhu], **culture** [^113SvNNA] if refractory, and imaging if complications are suspected [^111wNmKS]. Management is cause-specific: topical quinolone drops for tympanostomy tube otorrhea [^115rZfmA] or CSOM [^111wqyZs], aural toilet [^1155AYug], and systemic antibiotics for severe infection or cellulitis; urgent ENT referral is indicated for suspected cholesteatoma, malignant otitis externa [^111wNmKS], or refractory cases [^116FEFKh].

## Common causes of yellow ear drainage

| **Condition** | **Description** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute otitis media (AOM) with perforation | Middle ear infection with tympanic membrane rupture | - Purulent yellow discharge <br/> - Ear pain <br/> - Fever <br/> - Hearing loss [^115ZpWLJ] |
| Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) | Persistent middle ear infection with tympanic membrane perforation | - Chronic yellow otorrhea <br/> - Hearing loss <br/> - Recurrent infections [^1172yQDg] |
| Tympanostomy tube otorrhea | Infection or inflammation around ear tubes | - Yellow drainage <br/> - Minimal pain <br/> - Common in children with tubes [^115g7mra] |
| Otitis externa (swimmer's ear) | External ear canal infection | - Yellow purulent discharge <br/> - Ear pain <br/> - Itching <br/> - Redness <br/> - Swelling [^114U9KpW] |
| Fungal otitis externa (otomycosis) | Fungal infection of the external ear canal | - Yellow or white discharge <br/> - Itching <br/> - Black or white fungal debris [^115CepoX] |
| Cholesteatoma | Abnormal skin growth in the middle ear | - Chronic yellow drainage <br/> - Foul odor <br/> - Hearing loss <br/> - Possible complications [^113ow5jx] |
| Auricular infections (perichondritis, actinomycosis) | Infection of the external ear cartilage | - Yellow drainage <br/> - Ear pain <br/> - Swelling <br/> - Erythema <br/> - Cartilage deformity [^1111ykss] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Otoscopy**: Visualize the external canal and tympanic membrane to identify perforation, tubes, granulation, or cholesteatoma [^115PsMMN].

- **Culture**: Obtain ear swabs for bacterial and fungal culture in refractory or severe cases [^113SvNNA].

- **Imaging**: Use CT or MRI if complications (mastoiditis, intracranial extension) are suspected [^111wNmKS].

---

## Management strategies

- **Topical antibiotics**: First-line for tympanostomy tube otorrhea [^115rZfmA] and CSOM; quinolone drops are preferred [^111wqyZs].

- **Aural toilet**: Regular ear cleaning to remove debris and improve medication penetration [^1155AYug].

- **Systemic antibiotics**: Indicated for severe infection, cellulitis, or failed topical therapy [^115rZfmA].

- **Surgical intervention**: Refer to ENT for cholesteatoma, refractory CSOM, or complications [^113ow5jx].

---

## Potential complications

Complications include **hearing loss** — conductive or sensorineural — from chronic infection or structural damage [^11437RZ8], and **mastoiditis** — a mastoid bone infection that may require surgical intervention. Intracranial extension can lead to meningitis or brain abscess, particularly with cholesteatoma or malignant otitis externa [^111wNmKS]. Chronic infections can cause cartilage deformity or necrosis, especially in perichondritis or actinomycosis [^115tSxDR].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Seek care for **persistent drainage** lasting more than 7–10 days without improvement [^116FEFKh], or for drainage accompanied by severe pain, fever, hearing loss, or vertigo. Immunocompromised patients or those with diabetes who develop ear drainage should be evaluated promptly [^111wNmKS]. Yellow ear drainage most often reflects **purulent otorrhea** from AOM with perforation, CSOM, or tympanostomy tube otorrhea, but also includes otitis externa, fungal infections, cholesteatoma, and auricular infections. Accurate diagnosis and targeted therapy are essential to prevent complications; persistent or complicated cases warrant ENT referral [^1161qQW4].

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^111qQ7jV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Statement 9, outcomes assessment — clinicians should assess patients at the conclusion of in-office treatment of cerumen impaction and document the resolution of impaction; if the impaction is not resolved, the clinician should use additional treatment; if full or partial symptoms persist despite resolution of impaction, the clinician should evaluate the patient for alternative diagnoses. Recommendation is based on RCTs with limitations and with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C with a high level of confidence; benefits include detecting complications, encouraging proper diagnosis, and ensuring effective therapy; risks and costs relate to additional treatment or evaluation. Quality improvement focuses on ensuring effectiveness of treatment and accurate diagnosis, and value judgments emphasize clinician assessment after treatment to avoid misdiagnosis.

### Ear drops for the removal of ear wax [^1134u2MG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Problems attributed to the accumulation of wax (cerumen) are one of the most common reasons for people to present to their general practitioners with ear trouble (Sharp 1990). Treatment for this condition often involves use of a wax softening agent (cerumenolytic) in order to disperse the cerumen and reduce the need for syringing, or to facilitate syringing should it prove necessary, but there is no consensus on the effectiveness of the wide variety of cerumenolytics in use.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of ear drops (cerumenolytics) for the removal of symptomatic ear wax.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 1, 2003), and MEDLINE and EMBASE up to March 2003. Reference lists of all trials were also manually searched.

Selection Criteria

We identified all randomised controlled trials (with or without blinding) in which a cerumenolytic was evaluated in comparison with either no treatment, a placebo, or other cerumenolytics in participants with hard or impacted ear wax, and in which the proportion of participants with sufficient clearance of the external canal to make further mechanical clearance unnecessary (primary outcome measure) was stated or calculable. The full text articles of all the retrieved trials of possible relevance were reviewed by the two reviewers and the inclusion criteria applied independently. Any differences in opinion about which studies to include in the review were resolved by discussion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trials were graded for methodological quality using the Cochrane approach. Data extraction was performed in a standardised manner by one reviewer and rechecked by the other reviewer, and where necessary investigators were contacted to obtain missing information. Meta-analysis was neither possible nor considered appropriate because of the heterogeneity of the treatments, treatment amounts and durations, trial procedures, and scoring systems. A narrative overview of the results is therefore presented.

Main Results

Eight trials satisfied the inclusion criteria, the majority of which were of poor quality. In all, 587 participants received one of nine different cerumenolytics. One trial compared active treatments with no treatment, two trials compared active treatments with water or a saline 'placebo', and all eight trials placed two or more active treatments in head-to-head comparisons. Seven trials included syringing as a secondary treatment where necessary. Overall, results were inconclusive. One trial found a significant difference between one of three active agents (Cerumol) in comparison to no treatment, but no statistically significant difference was found between these three agents (sodium bicarbonate ear drops; Cerumol; sterile water). In two trials no statistical difference was found between the effectiveness of either sodium bicarbonate ear drops, Cerumol, Cerumenex or Colace versus a sterile water or saline 'placebo'. Three trials (from the same source) found statistically significant differences in favour of the same active agent (Exterol) in comparison to glycerol and Cerumol. Three trials found no statistically significant difference between two or more cerumenolytics (Otocerol versus Cerumol; Audax versus Earex; sodium bicarbonate ear drops versus Cerumol). Two trials comparing the same two cerumenolytics (Cerumenex versus Colace) also failed to show any significant benefit of one over the other. No serious adverse effects were reported from any of the interventions.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Trials to date have been heterogeneous and of poor quality, making it difficult to offer any definitive recommendations on the effectiveness of cerumenolytics for the removal of symptomatic ear wax. Future trials should be of high methodological quality, have large sample sizes, and compare both oil-based and water-based solvents with placebo and/or no treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^113C2uGK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Table 7 — patient education for cerumen (earwax) outlines Do items such as recognizing that earwax is normal and that earwax not causing symptoms or blocking the ear canal should be left alone; understanding symptoms of cerumen impaction (decreased hearing, fullness, tinnitus, and changes to hearing aid function); seeking medical evaluation for hearing loss, ear fullness, or ear pain when the cause is uncertain because other conditions can masquerade as cerumen impaction; asking a provider about safe home treatments; and seeking medical attention for ear pain, drainage, or bleeding. The Don't items include: overclean your ears; put anything smaller than your elbow in your ear; use ear candles because there is no evidence they remove impacted cerumen and they can cause serious damage; ignore symptoms if home remedies are unsuccessful; irrigate or try cerumen-removing/softening drops after ear surgery or with a perforated eardrum unless cleared by an otolaryngologist; and forget to clean hearing aids as recommended by the manufacturer or hearing health professional.

### Aural toilet (ear cleaning) for chronic suppurative otitis media [^114LmLKU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Aural toileting describes processes for manually cleaning the ear, including dry mopping (with cotton wool or tissue paper), suction clearance (typically under a microscope), or irrigation (using manual or automated syringing). Aural toileting can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or topical antiseptics. This is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM. This is the first update of a Cochrane review published in 2020.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of aural toilet procedures for people with chronic suppurative otitis media.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The searches were run on 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials with at least a one-week follow-up involving adults or children who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. We included any aural toileting method as the intervention, at any frequency, and for any duration. The main comparisons were aural toileting versus placebo or no intervention, and one aural toileting method versus another aural toileting method. Within each comparison, we separated studies into those in which both groups received other concomitant treatments (e.g. antiseptics or antibiotics) and those without concomitant treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology. Our primary outcomes were resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at one week to up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and adverse events (dizziness/vertigo/balance problems, ear bleeding). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This update did not find any new studies. We included three studies with 431 participants (465 ears) reporting on two comparisons. Two studies included only children with CSOM in the community (351 participants) and the other study (80 participants) included children and adults with chronic ear discharge for at least six weeks. One study recruited participants from the Solomon Islands, who were considered a 'high-risk' Indigenous group. None of the included studies reported health-related quality of life, ear pain, or ear bleeding. 1. Daily aural toileting versus no treatment Two studies (351 children; 370 ears) compared daily dry mopping with no treatment. For resolution of ear discharge after four weeks, only one study reported the results per person. We are very uncertain whether there is a difference at 16 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.72; 1 study, 217 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no results reported for the adverse events of dizziness, vertigo, or balance problems. Only one study reported serious complications, but it was not clear which group these participants were from, or whether the complications occurred pre- or post-treatment, and therefore the certainty of evidence was very low. One study reported hearing, but the results were presented by treatment outcome rather than by treatment group, so it was not possible to determine whether there was a difference between the two groups. 2. Daily aural toileting versus single aural toileting episode (both in addition to topical ciprofloxacin) One study (80 participants; 95 ears) compared daily aural toileting (suction) with administration of topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) ear drops in a clinic, to a single aural toileting (suction) episode followed by daily self-administered topical antibiotic drops, in participants of all ages. We are very uncertain if there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge at between one and up to two weeks (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.30; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks were presented by ear, not person, and could not be adjusted to by person. The authors only reported qualitatively that there was no difference between the two groups in hearing results (very low-certainty evidence). One participant in the group with single aural toileting and self-administration of topical antibiotic ear drops reported the adverse event of dizziness, which the authors attributed to the use of cold topical ciprofloxacin. It is very uncertain whether there is a difference between the groups (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.95; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no results reported for the other adverse events of vertigo or balance problems, or for serious complications.

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain whether treatment with aural toileting is effective in resolving ear discharge in people with CSOM when compared to no treatment, due to a lack of data and the poor quality of the available evidence. The evidence was considered very low-certainty as there were concerns over risk of bias, indirectness, imprecision, and suspected publication bias. We also remain uncertain about other outcomes, including adverse events, as these were not well reported. Similarly, we are very uncertain whether daily suction clearance, followed by antibiotic ear drops administered at a clinic, is better than a single episode of suction clearance followed by self-administration of topical antibiotic ear drops. Limitations of the review include lack of recency in data, and limited information on certain population groups or interventions.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^115rZfmA]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes — care during ear drainage and use of ear drops is addressed as follows: If you see drainage from the ear, we recommend the following: Antibiotic ear drops, without oral antibiotics, are all that is needed in most cases (usually ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin-dexamethasone). Do NOT use over the counter ear drops. Ear drainage may build up or dry at the opening of the ear canal, so remove the crusting with a cotton-tipped swab dipped in hydrogen peroxide or warm water, and if thick you can roll up a piece of tissue or toilet paper to help soak it up before using ear drops. Do not swim during infections when there is drainage or discharge coming from the ear; during bathing, use silicone ear plugs, or coat a small cotton ball with petroleum jelly and use it to cover the opening of the ear canal. Use the ear drops only for the amount of time recommended by your doctor, because using them too long could result in a yeast infection. Antibiotics taken by mouth are not needed for most ear drainage with tubes in place, although they may be needed if there is another reason to be on an antibiotic or if the infection does not go away after using only ear drops. When using ear drops, do the following to help pump the drops in the ear canal and get down to the ear tube: Have your child lay down on their side, put ear drops into opening of ear canal, then push down on tragus 4–5 times to help pump the drops into the canal. Most children do not typically have fever or pain when they have ear drainage with tubes in place.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^113SvNNA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Otitis media — diagnostic work-up and laboratory specimens indicate that 'Microbiologic diagnostic work-up of otitis media are best reserved for patients likely to have a bacterial etiology (recent onset, bulging tympanic membrane, pain, or exudate), who have not responded to prior courses of antimicrobial therapy, patients with immunological deficiencies, and acutely ill patients'. The 'only representative specimen is middle ear fluid obtained either by tympanocentesis, or in patients with otorrhea or myringotomy tubes, by collecting drainage on mini-tipped swabs directly after cleaning the ear canal', and 'Cultures of the pharynx, nasopharynx, anterior nares, or of nasal drainage material are of no value in attempting to establish an etiologic diagnosis of bacterial OM'. Table 22 lists etiologic agents such as 'Moraxella catarrhalis Haemophilus influenzae (non-typeable) Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Pseudomonas aeruginosa Alloiococcus otitidis Staphylococcus aureus Escherichia coli Klebsiella pneumoniae' and specifies diagnostic procedures 'Gram stain, Aerobic bacterial culture' on 'Tympanocentesis fluid' with transport 'Sterile container, RT, ≤ 2 h'. For drainage in patients with tubes or otorrhea, the specimen is a 'Mini-tipped swab of fluid draining from the middle ear cavity in patients with myringotomy tubes or otorrhea' with transport 'Swab transport device, RT, ≤ 2 h'. Additional notes state 'Viruses are often etiologic agents but microbiologic studies do not assist treatment decisions' and 'Abbreviation: RT, room temperature'.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^114QS4kC]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) randomized trial protocol in toddlers — amoxicillin-clavulanate versus placebo — specified dose, population, definition, compliance, and outcome. Tähtinen et al conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, intention-to-treat study of amoxicillin-clavulanate (40 mg/kg/day) versus placebo. Three hundred nineteen patients from 6 to 35 months of age were studied: 161 in the antibiotic group and 158 in the placebo group. AOM definition was the presence of MEE, distinct erythema over a bulging or yellow TM, and acute symptoms such as ear pain, fever, or respiratory symptoms. Compliance was measured by using daily patient diaries and number of capsules remaining at the end of the study. Primary outcome was time to treatment failure defined as a composite of 6 independent components.

### A novel treatment approach to cholesterol granulomas. technical note [^115ahXQe]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

The authors report a novel technique for the treatment of cholesterol granulomas. An extradural middle fossa approach was used to access the granuloma, with drainage through silastic tubes into the sphenoid sinus via the anteromedial triangle between V1 and V2. Cholesterol granulomas occur when the normal aeration and drainage of temporal bone air cells is occluded, resulting in vacuum formation and transudation of blood into the air cells. This process results in anaerobic breakdown of the blood with resulting cholesterol crystal formation and an inflammatory reaction. Traditional treatment of this lesion involves extensive drilling of the temporal bone to drain the granuloma cyst and establish a drainage tract into the middle ear. Such drainage procedures can be time consuming and difficult, and potentially involve structural damage to the inner ear and facial nerve. An extradural middle fossa approach provides easy access to the granuloma and anterior petrous bone entry into the granuloma for resection. Granuloma drainage is then achieved using shunt tubing in the sphenoid sinus via a small hole in the anteromedial triangle between V1 and V2. Five patients with symptomatic cholesterol granuloma were treated without complication using this novel extradural middle fossa approach. One patient required reoperation 1-year postoperatively for cyst regrowth and occlusion of the drainage tube. At the 5-year follow-up examination, no patient reported recurrent symptoms. Extradural middle fossa craniotomy and silastic tube drainage into the sphenoid sinus is a viable alternative method for treatment of cholesterol granuloma.

### Yellow nail syndrome with chylothorax after coronary artery bypass grafting [^113icv6B]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 62-year-old man with coronary artery disease underwent four-vessel CABG including left internal thoracic artery (ITA) to left anterior descending artery. The patient was discharged on postoperative day (POD) 6 after an uneventful postoperative course with low chest tube output and trace pleural effusions.

On POD 13, the patient was readmitted after four days of moderate chest pain and exertional dyspnea. Diminished respiratory sounds were noted over the full left lung field. Chest radiograph confirmed a large left pleural effusion (Fig. 1). A left pigtail catheter drained 2.3 l of milky fluid with a triglyceride level of 1604 mg/dL, diagnosing chylothorax.

Fig. 1
Chest radiograph detected a large pleural effusion over the left lung field on post-operative day 13 after coronary artery bypass grafting

Conservative management was attempted with continued catheter drainage and initiation of a low-fat diet with medium-chain triglycerides on POD 14. Drainage gradually decreased over the next three days to < 100 ml/day, but by POD 18, drainage increased to 350 mL/day that continued for two days despite attempts to readjust the catheter position. On POD 20, the pigtail catheter was replaced with a chest tube, and the patient was transitioned to total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and octreotide while nil per os, but chest tube drainage persisted at 200–360 ml/day. On POD 28, the patient noted new, bilateral yellow toenail discoloration (Fig. 2). The yellow nail discoloration was not associated with any disfiguring features such as nail thickening or separation from nail bed. No lymphedema was found. Presence of yellow nails and chylothorax resulted in diagnosis of YNS.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^113Dwmh7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for cerumen impaction, more specifically with respect to patients who may not express symptoms, AAO-HNS 2017 guidelines recommend to identify patients with obstructing cerumen in the ear canal who may not be able to express symptoms (such as young children and cognitively impaired children and adults), and promptly evaluate the need for intervention.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^116FYb2h]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — need for intervention (Statement 3A) states that clinicians should treat, or refer to another clinician who can treat, cerumen impaction when identified, designated as a strong recommendation based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with heterogeneity and with a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile specifies aggregate evidence quality Grade B, RCTs with heterogeneity; level of confidence in the evidence high; benefits include improved hearing and symptom relief compared with no treatment; risks, harms, costs include potential complications related to treatment and the direct cost of managing the impaction; and the benefit–harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Additional profile notes report value judgments none, intentional vagueness none, role of patient preferences small, exceptions none, policy level strong recommendation, and differences of opinion none.

### Ultrasound-guided greater auricular nerve block for emergency department ear laceration and ear abscess drainage [^1153CQpB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Adequate emergency department (ED) anesthesia for painful ear conditions, such as ear lacerations or ear abscesses, can be challenging. Much of the sensory innervation of the ear is supplied from the anterior and posterior branches of the greater auricular nerve (GAN). The GAN is a branch of the superficial cervical plexus, which arises from the C2/C3 spinal roots. The GAN innervation includes most of the helix, antihelix, the lobule, and the skin over the mastoid process and parotid gland. Anesthesia of the GAN is commonly performed in emergency medicine as part of a landmark-based ear "ring" block. Recently, a selective ultrasound-guided GAN block has been described.

Case Report

We report the first cases of ultrasound-guided greater auricular nerve block (UGANB) successfully performed in the ED as the sole procedural anesthesia for both an ear laceration and abscess drainage. In addition, we review the relevant anatomy and technical details of the procedure. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Our cases suggest that UGANB is a potentially effective nerve block for ED management of acute ear pain related to procedures involving the tail of the helix and the lobule, such as ear lacerations or ear abscess incision and drainage. Advantages include real-time visualization of the GAN that may increase block success and the decreased volume of local anesthetic required for a block.

### Antibiotics versus topical antiseptics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^111ngono]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Antibiotics and antiseptics kill or inhibit the micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be applied topically or administered systemically via the oral or injection route. Antiseptics are always directly applied to the ear (topically).

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of antibiotics versus antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 4, via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 April 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving patients (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The intervention was any single, or combination of, antibiotic agent, whether applied topically (without steroids) or systemically. The comparison was any single, or combination of, topical antiseptic agent, applied as ear drops, powders or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. Two comparisons were topical antiseptics compared to: a) topical antibiotics or b) systemic antibiotics. Within each comparison we separated where both groups of patients had received topical antibiotic a) alone or with aural toilet and b) on top of background treatment (such as systemic antibiotics).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity measured in several ways.

Main Results

We identified seven studies (935 participants) across four comparisons with antibiotics compared against acetic acid, aluminium acetate, boric acid and povidone-iodine. None of the included studies reported the outcomes of quality of life or serious complications. A. Topical antiseptic (acetic acid) versus topical antibiotics (quinolones or aminoglycosides) It is very uncertain if there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge with acetic acid compared with aminoglycosides at one to two weeks (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.08; 1 study; 100 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported results for ear discharge after four weeks. It was very uncertain if there was more ear pain, discomfort or local irritation with acetic acid or topical antibiotics due to the low numbers of participants reporting events (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.34; 2 RCTs; 189 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No differences between groups were reported narratively for hearing (quinolones) or suspected ototoxicity (aminoglycosides) (very low-certainty evidence). B. Topical antiseptic (aluminium acetate) versus topical antibiotics No results for the one study comparing topical antibiotics with aluminium acetate could be used in the review. C. Topical antiseptic (boric acid) versus topical antibiotics (quinolones) One study reported more participants with resolution of ear discharge when using topical antibiotics (quinolones) compared with boric acid ear drops at between one to two weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 1.92; 1 study; 409 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that one additional person will have resolution of ear discharge for every five people receiving topical antibiotics (compared with boric acid) at two weeks. No study reported results for ear discharge after four weeks. There was a bigger improvement in hearing in the topical antibiotic group compared to the topical antiseptic group (mean difference (MD) 2.79 decibels (dB), 95% CI 0.48 to 5.10; 1 study; 390 participants; low-certainty evidence) but this difference may not be clinically significant. There may be more ear pain, discomfort or irritation with boric acid compared with quinolones (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.98; 2 studies; 510 participants; low-certainty evidence). Suspected ototoxicity was not reported. D. Topical antiseptic (povidone-iodine) versus topical antibiotics (quinolones) It is uncertain if there is a difference between quinolones and povidone-iodine with respect to resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.26; 1 RCT, 39 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study reported qualitatively that there were no differences between the groups for hearing and no patients developed ototoxic effects (very low-certainty evidence). No results for resolution of ear discharge beyond four weeks, or ear pain, discomfort or irritation, were reported. E. Topical antiseptic (acetic acid) + aural toileting versus topical + systemic antibiotics (quinolones) One study reported that participants receiving topical and oral antibiotics had less resolution of ear discharge compared with acetic acid ear drops and aural toileting (suction clearance every two days) at one month (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.90; 100 participants). The study did not report results for resolution of ear discharge at between one to two weeks, ear pain, discomfort or irritation, hearing or suspected ototoxicity.

Authors' Conclusions

Treatment of CSOM with topical antibiotics (quinolones) probably results in an increase in resolution of ear discharge compared with boric acid at up to two weeks. There was limited evidence for the efficacy of other topical antibiotics or topical antiseptics and so we are unable to draw conclusions. Adverse events were not well reported.

### Systemic antibiotics versus topical treatments for chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations [^111wqyZs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) causes ear discharge and impairs hearing.

Objectives

To compare systemic antibiotics and topical antiseptics or antibiotics (excluding steroids) for treating chronically discharging ears with an underlying eardrum perforation (CSOM).

Search Strategy

The Cochrane ENT Disorders Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1951 to March 2005), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2005), LILACS (January 1982 to March 2005), AMED (1985 to March 2005), CINAHL (January 1982 to March 2005), OLDMEDLINE (January 1958 to December 1965) PREMEDLINE, Metadatabase of registers of ongoing trials (mRCT), and article references.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials; any systemic versus topical treatment (excluding steroids); participants with CSOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author assessed eligibility and quality, extracted data, entered data into RevMan; two authors provided a second assessment of titles and abstracts, and inputted where there was ambiguity. We contacted investigators for clarifications.

Main Results

Nine trials (833 randomised participants; 842 analysed participants or ears). CSOM definitions and severity varied; some included mastoid cavity infections, other diagnoses, or complications. Methodological quality varied; generally poorly reported, follow-up short, handling of bilateral disease inconsistent. Topical quinolone antibiotics were better than systemic antibiotics at clearing discharge at 1–2 weeks: relative risks (RR) were, 3.21 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 5.49) using systemic non-quinolone antibiotics (2 trials, N = 116), and 3.18 (1.87 to 5.43) using systemic quinolone (3 trials, N = 175); or 2.75 (1.38 to 5.46) in favour of systemic plus topical quinolone over systemic quinolone alone (2 trials, N = 90). No statistically significant benefit was seen at 2–4 weeks for topical non-quinolone antibiotic (without steroids) or topical antiseptic over systemic antibiotics (mostly non-quinolones), but numbers were small: one trial tested topical non-quinolones (N = 31); two tested antiseptics (N = 152). No benefit of adding systemic to topical treatment at 1–2 weeks was detected either, although evidence was limited (three trials, N = 204). Evidence regarding safety was generally weak. Adverse events reported were generally mild, although hearing worsened by ototoxicity (damaging auditory hair cells) was seen with chloramphenicol drops (non-quinolone antibiotic).

Authors' Conclusions

Topical quinolone antibiotics can clear aural discharge better than systemic antibiotics; topical non-quinolone antibiotic (without steroids) or antiseptic results are less clear. Evidence regarding safety was weak. Further studies should clarify topical non-quinolones and antiseptic effectiveness, assess longer-term outcomes (for resolution, healing, hearing, or complications), and include further safety assessments, particularly to clarify the risks of ototoxicity and whether there may be fewer adverse events with topical quinolones than other topical or systemic treatments.

### Ofloxaxin (ofloxacin) [^11279yip]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

How often should Ofloxacin Otic Solution be given?

In patients with an Ear Canal Infection ("Swimmer's Ear"), Ofloxacin Otic Solution ear drops should be given once daily at about the same time each day (for example, 8 AM or 8 PM) in each infected ear unless the doctor has instructed otherwise.

In patients with a Middle Ear Infection, Ofloxacin Otic Solution ear drops should be given 2 times each day (about 12 hours apart, for example 8 AM and 8 PM) in each infected ear unless the doctor has instructed otherwise. The best times to use the ear drops are in the morning and at night.

It is very important to use the ear drops for as long as the doctor has instructed, even if the symptoms improve. If Ofloxacin Otic Solution ear drops are not used for as long as the doctor has instructed, the infection may be more likely to return.

What if a dose is missed?

In patients with an Ear Canal Infection ("Swimmer's Ear"), it is important that you take the drops every day. If you miss a dose which may have been scheduled for earlier in the day, (for example, 8 AM), you should take that day's dose as soon as possible and then go back to your regular daily dosing schedule.

In patients with Middle Ear Infection, if a dose of Ofloxacin Otic Solution is missed, it should be given as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule.

Do not use a double dose unless the doctor has instructed you to do so. If the infection is not improved after one week, you should consult your doctor. If you have two or more episodes of drainage within six months, it is recommended that you see your doctor for further evaluation.

What activities should be avoided while using Ofloxacin Otic Solution?

It is important that the infected ear(s) remain clean and dry. When bathing, avoid getting the infected ear(s) wet. Avoid swimming unless the doctor has instructed otherwise.

### Evaluation of cholesteatoma [^113ow5jx]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of cholesteatoma depends on clinical history and examination, with microscope and/or endoscope. A history of hearing loss with a chronic draining ear, refractory to ototopical medication, raises suspicion for cholesteatoma. Symptoms of Eustachian tube dysfunction or prior ear surgery including ear tubes should be elicited. Inflammation can be severe and should be suppressed if possible. Once cholesteatoma is diagnosed or strongly suspected, further workup includes audiometry prior to surgical excision. Imaging may supplement the workup and is especially helpful if there are concerning features including vertigo, third window symptoms, asymmetric bone line, facial nerve weakness, or for anticipatory guidance.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^116MzcS9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Statement 3B: Nonintervention if asymptomatic — clinicians "should not routinely treat cerumen in patients who are asymptomatic and whose ears can be adequately examined", a "Recommendation against" based on "control groups in randomized trials and observational studies" with a "preponderance of benefit over harms". The action profile specifies "Quality improvement opportunity: Avoidance of harm, efficient use of health care resources", "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C", and "Level of confidence in the evidence: Medium", with benefits to "Avoid unnecessary treatment with potential adverse events and costs", risks of "Potential progression to impaction", and "Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harms". Value judgments are that "The presence of cerumen is not in itself harmful, and it may not progress to impaction; in fact, it may resolve spontaneously. If it progresses, it can be managed at that time", with "The word routinely was added to this statement to acknowledge that there may be circumstances where cerumen removal may be offered anyway, as in a patient with hearing aids", and "Role of patient preferences: Substantial role for shared decision making. The patient may still opt for removal of the cerumen". Exceptions include "history of recurrent cerumen impaction", with "Policy level: Recommendation against" and "Differences of opinion: None".

Patient Information

IMPORTANT PATIENT INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS.

Rev. 06/22

READ BEFORE USE.

What is Ofloxacin Otic Solution?

Ofloxacin Otic Solution is an antibiotic in a sterile solution used to treat ear infections caused by certain bacteria found in:

patients (12 years and older) who have middle ear infection and have a hole in the eardrum
pediatric patients (between 1 and 12 years of age) who have a middle ear infection and have a tube in the eardrum
patients (6 months and older) who have an infection in the ear canal

Middle Ear Infection: A middle ear infection is a bacterial infection behind the eardrum. People with a hole or a tube in the eardrum may notice a discharge (fluid draining) in the ear canal.

Ear Canal Infection: An ear canal infection (also known as "Swimmer's Ear") is a bacterial infection of the ear canal. The ear canal and the outer part of the ear may swell, turn red, and be painful. Also, a fluid discharge may appear in the ear canal.

Who should NOT use Ofloxacin Otic Solution?

Do not use this product if allergic to ofloxacin or to other quinolone antibiotics.
Do not give this product to pediatric patients who:
have an ear canal infection and are less than 6 months of age because no data were collected from this population
have a middle ear infection and have a tube in the eardrum and are less than one year of age because no data were collected from this population
have a middle ear infection and have a hole in the eardrum and are less than 12 years of age because no data were collected from this population

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^1111wXgB]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes — reasons an ear infection may be diagnosed without visible drainage include that the tube is open and drainage has started but is not yet seen at the ear canal opening, suggesting an early stage of infection for which antibiotic ear drops will help it go away quickly; the tube is not working or is blocked, so the ear infection is treated as if the tube were not present and antibiotics by mouth may be needed, with the blocked tube doing no harm and acetaminophen or ibuprofen recommended for pain; or the tube is open but there is no drainage in the tube opening or ear canal, in which case no special treatment is necessary even if the eardrum appears red or irritated when a child cries or has fever without an ear infection.

### Treatment of auricular pseudocyst with aspiration and local pressure [^116VXtsP]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

An auricular pseudocyst is a fluid filled cavity unlined by epithelium in the intracartilaginous space of the ear. Clinically, it presents as a painless outpouching on the upper anterior surface of the auricle with sterile straw coloured fluid found upon aspiration. If left untreated, permanent deformity of the pinna may result. Treatment of the pseudocysts has varied in the literature with techniques involving aspiration alone or incision and drainage; however, due to the high recurrence rates with these methods more aggressive therapies have been instituted. Although these techniques have achieved reasonable results with few recurrences, their invasive nature and chemotherapeutic and toxic agents used have caused significant morbidity. We present treatment of an auricular pseudocyst by simple aspiration and local pressure application using an auricular prosthesis formulated with the creation of a moulage fitted to the ear by our prosthetist. This minimally invasive and simplistic approach can avoid some of the complications related to other therapies, such as cartilage deformity, depigmentation of skin, and scarring and yields optimal cosmetic results.

### A sticky situation: case series of successful treatment of glue ear with dupilumab [^115Qy2MY]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To highlight the efficacy of dupilumab in treating chronic otitis media with effusion (glue ear).

Patients

Three patients with chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) refractory to medical and surgical treatment were retrospectively identified. All patients had medical history suggestive of the presence of eosinophilic inflammation.

Interventions

Each patient received a 300-mg injection of dupilumab every 4 weeks for a total of three injections.

Main Outcome Measures

Audiometric data, patient-reported incidence of new ear infections, patient-reported symptoms.

Results

All patients reported subjective improvement in ear pain, drainage, and hearing loss between 2 weeks and 6 months on dupilumab therapy. In case 1 and case 2, audiograms showed some improvement in hearing loss posttreatment. Case 2 had an unexpected interruption of treatment for 4 weeks and reported return of thick ear drainage and difficulty with hearing.

Conclusions

Dupilumab may be a novel, effective, and nonsurgical treatment option for patients with chronic otitis media with effusion and underlying atopic conditions.

### Lymphatic drainage of the external ear [^115gUpqQ]. Head & Neck (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Lymphoscintigraphy reveals inconsistencies in our knowledge of the lymphatic anatomy of the external ear.

Methods

Fifteen external ears from 9 unembalmed human cadavers were studied. Six percent hydrogen peroxide was used to find the lymphatic vessels using a surgical microscope. They were injected with a radio-opaque mixture, dissected, photographed, and radiographed to demonstrate lymphatic vessels in the tissue. Final results were transferred to the computer for analysis.

Results

Four groups of lymph collecting vessels were found. The anterior branch, in all specimens, drained directly or indirectly (having merged with a vessel descending from the scalp) into the preauricular lymph nodes. The superior, middle, and inferior (lobule) branches drained to their multiple first tier lymph nodes.

Conclusion

An accurate lymphatic map of the external ear is described to upgrade our anatomic knowledge. It will be of benefit for the clinical management of malignancies in this region.

### The development of antibiotic resistant organisms with the use of ototopical medications [^111dsHrJ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

There is growing concern over the use of systemic antibiotics and the development of bacterial resistance. The question remains as to whether ototopical medications may also promote antibiotic-resistant organisms, either on a local level (in the ear) or in other areas of the aerodigestive tract. We performed an evidence-based review to answer the following clinical question, "Do antibiotic ototopical medications induce antibiotic resistant organisms?"

Study Design

We performed a MEDLINE search of the published literature from 1966 to the present. We used appropriate search terms such as "ototopical antibiotics", "ototopical drops", "antibiotic resistance", "topical antibiotics and otitis externa", "otitis externa and treatment", "otitis externa and antibiotic drops", "otitis externa and ototopical drops", "otitis media", "otitis media and treatment", "otitis media and antibiotic drops", "chronic suppurative otitis media", "chronic suppurative otitis media and treatment", "chronic suppurative otitis media and antibiotic drops", " otitis externa and resistant organisms", "otitis media and resistant organisms", "chronic suppurative otitis media and resistant organisms", "ophthalmic antibiotic drops", "draining ear", "P.E. tube otorrhea", "pressure equalizing tube otorrhea", "pressure equalizing tube otorrhea and treatment", and "pressure equalizing tube otorrhea and ototopical therapy" to identify pertinent articles. These articles were reviewed and graded according to the evidence quality.

Results

After an initial screening of over 2,500 articles, 38 articles were analyzed further; of these, 11 were determined to warrant extensive review. Eight articles evaluated chronic suppurative otitis media; 2, otitis externa; and 1, post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea, whereas 3 others studied systemic absorption. Of the 8 chronic suppurative otitis media studies, there were thought to be 5 grade 2B studies, 1 grade 1B study, and 1 grade 2C study. These studies did not demonstrate a propensity for the development of resistant organisms. No study answered the question as to whether resistance to systemic antibiotics might occur in otitis externa.

Conclusions

Overall grade B evidence seems to indicate that no significant antibiotic resistance develops from the use of ototopical antibiotic treatment.

### Ear wax and ear cleanings… [^114gHW5c]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Naples JG. Understanding Ear Wax and Ear Cleanings. JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2022; 148:

388. doi: 10.1001/jamaoto.2021.4283 Ear wax, also called cerumen, is a natural and normal product in our outer ear. It is made by the glands of the ear canal skin. All people make cerumen, and it is often a yellow or brownish color. Cerumen is healthy for the ear because it helps keep the ear clean and keep infection away. Although cerumen is a normal part of the ear, it can cause problems for some people. If there is excess cerumen, it can block the ear canal. This is called cerumen impaction. Impaction is more common in people who have narrow ear canals or wear hearing aids. Use of cotton swabs in the ears can also create cerumen impaction. Symptoms of impaction typically include the feeling of blockage within the ear or itching. Occasionally people will note a small decrease in their hearing.

It rarely causes pain, drainage, or significant hearing loss, and if these symptoms are present, consideration should be given to another cause of the symptoms. Sometimes infection and other causes of hearing loss may be mistaken for cerumen. If you do experience a cerumen impaction, there are various ways to fix the problem. Over-the-counter ear drops, such as carbamide peroxide, are often available and can help soften the cerumen and relieve some of the obstruction. Irrigation of the ears by a trained clinician is also an option, but should be avoided if there are concerns about infection, a hole in the eardrum, or problems other than cerumen. Irrigation and OTC drops are generally considered to have similar effectiveness in relief of the impaction. If you seek care from an otolaryngologist, various small instruments can be used to remove the cerumen impaction. Not everyone forms cerumen impactions or needs routine care for their ear wax.

Some people build up cerumen more quickly than others and may need more frequent removals. It is generally recommended to avoid use of cotton swabs and other at-home tools to take out cerumen. This may lead to unnecessary damage to the ear. It is best to discuss with your physician whether routine follow-up and/or attempts to prevent cerumen buildup is recommended for cerumen impaction.

### Doc, just cut my ears off – A case report of Actinomyces in bilateral chronic auricular chondritis [^1111ykss]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Body piercings have become a widespread phenomenon in the last decade, but the ear remains the most common site with the piercing of ear cartilage, or a "high ear piercing", gaining popularity. Among infectious complications, andare the most common colonizing bacteria. Meanwhile, Actinomyces has been reported in the literature to affect the middle ear, temporal bone, mastoids, tonsils, and even as a nasal mass. This is the first description in literature of bilateral chronic chondritis with actinomyces speciated. This report highlights a uniquely morbid case of auricular chondritis demanding complex interdisciplinary care and drastic surgical measures.

1.1 Case Report

A 38‐year‐old male with a past medical history notable for type 1 diabetes mellitus, diastolic heart failure, tobacco use, generalized anxiety, and chronic pain presented to the emergency department for evaluation of chronic bilateral otalgia and helical drainage.

Approximately 1 year prior to presenting to our emergency room, the patient had the superior aspect of his bilateral helical cartilages pierced. In the weeks following, the patient reportedly fell into brackish waters while working around animal manure. Upon presenting to our facility, the patient had already experienced around 10 months of bilateral auricular pain and intermittent drainage, despite piercing removal. He had been evaluated by numerous providers in the outpatient setting and at an outside hospital. Cultures from an outside hospital incision and drainage of both ears yielded actinomyces growth of unknown speciation. He had been treated with multiple courses of antibiotics throughout the prior year, including doxycycline, cephalexin, clindamycin, levofloxacin, and ampicillin‐sulbactam. When he presented to our emergency department, he was experiencing persistent severe otalgia and intermittent drainage while on a prolonged course of high‐dose amoxicillin. His otologic exam demonstrated left greater than right superior auricular erythema, firmness, and exquisite pain to palpation with yellow punctate crusting consistent with draining sinus tracts (Figures 1 and 2). He was admitted to the hospital for evaluation.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^111q8AQv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — symptoms, hearing impact, treatment options, and complication rates are described: Patients seek treatment for a host of symptoms including pain, itching, sensation of fullness, tinnitus, odor, drainage, and cough, and hearing loss can range from 5 to 40 dB depending on the degree of occlusion. Multiple treatment options exist — observation, cerumenolytic agents, irrigation, and manual removal other than irrigation — with combinations used and manual removal performed with a curette, probe, hook, forceps, or suction under direct visualization. Though generally safe, complications such as tympanic membrane perforation, canal laceration, infection, bleeding, or hearing loss occur at a rate of about 1 in 1000 ear irrigations, which applied nationally estimates that 8000 complications occur annually; other reported complications include otitis externa, pain, dizziness, and syncope.

### Interventions for the prevention of postoperative ear discharge after insertion of ventilation tubes (grommets) in children [^1132BHY2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Grommets are frequently inserted in children's ears for acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion. A common complication is postoperative ear discharge (otorrhoea). A wide range of treatments are used to prevent the discharge, but there is no consensus on whether or not intervention is necessary nor which is the most effective intervention.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of prophylactic interventions, both topical and systemic, in reducing the incidence of otorrhoea following the surgical insertion of grommets in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 3 July 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the efficacy of prophylactic interventions against placebo/control and/or with other prophylactic interventions for postoperative otorrhoea in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. The outcome data were dichotomous for all the included trials. We calculated individual and pooled risk ratios (RR) using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method. We also calculated the numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNTB).

Main Results

We found 15 eligible RCTs (2476 children, aged from four months to 17 years). We graded seven RCTs as being at a low risk of bias (n = 926 children) and for an eighth RCT we also graded two of the arms as being at a low risk of bias. We graded the other seven trials as being at a high risk of bias. For a single application at surgery, there was evidence from two low risk of bias trials that at two weeks postoperatively the risk of otorrhoea was reduced by multiple saline washouts (from 30% to 16%; RR 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 1.00; NNTB 7; one RCT; 140 children) and antibiotic/steroid ear drops (from 9% to 1%; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.57; NNTB 13; one RCT; 322 ears). A meta-analysis of two low risk of bias trials (222 ears) failed to find an effect of a single application of antibiotic/steroid ear drops at four to six weeks postoperatively. For a prolonged application of an intervention, there was evidence from four low risk of bias trials that the risk of otorrhoea was reduced two weeks postoperatively by antibiotic ear drops (from 15% to 8%; RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.97; NNTB 15; one RCT; 372 children), antibiotic/steroid ear drops (from 39% to 5%; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.31; NNTB 3; one RCT; 200 children), aminoglycoside/steroid ear drops (from 15% to 5%; RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.74; NNTB 11; one RCT; 356 children) or oral antibacterial agents/steroids (from 39% to 5%; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.51; NNTB 3; one RCT; 77 children). Only one trial assessed the secondary outcome of ototoxicity, but no effect was found. There were no trials that assessed quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review found that each of the following were effective at reducing the rate of otorrhoea up to two weeks following surgery: (1) multiple saline washouts at surgery, (2) a single application of topical antibiotic/steroid drops at surgery, (3) a prolonged application of topical drops (namely antibiotic ear drops, antibiotic/steroid eardrops or aminoglycoside/steroid ear drops) and (4) a prolonged application of oral antibacterial agents/steroids. However, the rate of otorrhoea between RCTs varied greatly and the higher the rates of otorrhoea within a RCT, the smaller the NNTB for therapy. We conclude that if a surgeon has a high rate of postoperative otorrhoea in children then either saline irrigation or antibiotic ear drops at the time of surgery would significantly reduce that rate. If topical drops are chosen, it is suggested that to reduce the cost and potential for ototoxic damage this be a single application at the time of surgery and not prolonged thereafter.

### Aeration of the human prussak's space: a 3D synchrotron imaging study [^111c3PAx]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Prussak's space (PS) is an intricate middle ear region which may play an essential role in the development of middle ear disease. The three-dimensional (3D) anatomy of the human PS and its drainage routes remain relatively unknown. Earlier studies have histologically analyzed PS, by micro-dissection and endoscopy. Here, we used synchrotron-radiation phase-contrast imaging (SR-PCI), 3D reconstructions, and modeling to study the framework of the human PS, including aeration pathways. It may lead to increased understanding of development of middle ear pathology.

Design

Nine human temporal bone specimens underwent in-line SR-PCI at the Canadian Light Source in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Data were processed with volume-rendering software to create 3D reconstructions using scalar opacity mapping and segmentations to visualize its walls in fixed, undecalcified human temporal bones.

Results

The PS was found to be an irregular, variably shaped chamber with different aeration systems. Three different drainage pathways were found: 1) via the posterior malleolar pouch of von Tröltsch in seven of nine ears; 2) directly posterior-inferior into the mesotympanum medial to the posterior malleolar pouch in one ear; and 3) anteriorly in another. The posterior-inferior communications depended on the anatomy of the posterior malleolar fold. In one bilateral case, the aeration differed between the ears. Earlier descriptions of upper ventilation routes between the PS and the epitympanic spaces could not be substantiated.

Conclusions

The 3D anatomy of the membrane folds organizing the PS in humans was demonstrated for the first time using in-line SR-PCI. The PS was always aerated into the mesotympanum, suggesting its relative independence of attic ventilation. The impact of its various drainage routes on middle ear ventilation and disease were discussed.

### Topical versus systemic antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1138CiiD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Antibiotics are the most common treatment for CSOM, and aim to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be administered both topically and systemically, and can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as ear cleaning (aural toileting). This is the first update of a review published in 2021. The update found no new studies. It is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of topical versus systemic antibiotics for people with CSOM.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The latest search date was 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving adults and children who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The studies compared topical antibiotics versus systemic (oral, injection) antibiotics. The two main comparisons were the same type of antibiotic in both treatment groups and different types of antibiotics in each group. Within each comparison, we separated studies into 1. those in which both groups of participants had received aural toileting in addition to the antibiotics, and those where neither group had received aural toileting, and 2. those in which both groups received some other concomitant treatment (such as topical antiseptics) and those with no such concomitant treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not, measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks up to four weeks, and after four weeks), health-related quality of life using a validated instrument, and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and ototoxicity. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This update did not find any new studies. We included six studies (445 participants), all with high risk of bias. Three studies included participants with confirmed CSOM, where perforation of the ear drum was clearly documented. None of the studies reported results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks or health-related quality of life. 1. Topical quinolone versus systemic quinolone Four studies (325 participants) compared topical versus systemic (oral) administration of ciprofloxacin. Topical administration may slightly increase resolution of ear discharge at one to less than two weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 1.84; 2 studies, 210 participants; low-certainty evidence). These studies either did not mention aural toileting or limited it to the first visit. Three studies (265 participants) reported that they did not suspect ototoxicity in any participants, but it is unclear how this was measured (very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported the outcomes of resolution after four weeks, health-related quality of life, ear pain, or serious complications. No studies reported results for hearing, despite it being measured in three studies. 2. Topical quinolone versus systemic aminoglycosides One study (60 participants) compared topical ciprofloxacin versus gentamicin injected intramuscularly. No aural toileting was reported. Resolution of ear discharge was not measured at one to two weeks. The study did not report any "side effects" from which we assumed that no ear pain, suspected ototoxicity, or serious complications occurred (very low-certainty evidence). The study stated that "no worsening of the audiometric function related to local or parenteral therapy was observed". 3. Topical quinolone versus systemic penicillin plus beta-lactamase inhibitor One study (60 participants) compared topical ofloxacin versus oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with all participants receiving suction ear cleaning at the first visit. Oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid may increase the resolution of ear discharge at one to less than two weeks compared to topical ofloxacin, but the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence is also very uncertain about the effects of topical ofloxacin compared with oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid on ear pain, hearing, or suspected ototoxicity (all very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported the outcomes of resolution after four weeks, health-related quality of life, and serious complications.

Authors' Conclusions

There was a limited amount of low- or very low-quality evidence available, from studies completed over 15 years ago, to determine whether topical or systemic antibiotics are more effective in achieving resolution of ear discharge for people with CSOM. This was mostly due to high risk of bias in the studies and imprecision. However, amongst this uncertainty, there is some evidence to suggest that the topical administration of quinolone antibiotics may be slightly more effective than systemic administration of antibiotics in achieving resolution of ear discharge (dry ear). There is limited evidence available regarding different types of topical antibiotics. It is not possible to determine with any certainty whether topical quinolones are better or worse than systemic aminoglycosides. These two groups of compounds have different adverse effect profiles, but there is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make any comment about these. In general, harmful effects were poorly reported. Limitations of the review include lack of recency in data, and limited information on certain population groups or interventions.

### Cerumen impaction: diagnosis and management [^113EoJWW]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Cerumen production is a normal and protective process for the ear canal. However, cerumen should be removed when it causes symptoms (e.g., hearing loss, itching, pain, tinnitus) or prevents assessment of the external auditory canal, the tympanic membrane, or audiovestibular system. Cerumen should also be removed when it limits examination in patients who cannot communicate their symptoms, such as those with dementia or developmental delay, nonverbal patients with behavioral changes, and young children with fever, speech delay, or parental concerns. Patients with coagulopathies, hepatic failure, thrombocytopenia, or hemophilia, and those taking antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications, should be counseled about the increased risk of bleeding in the external auditory canal when cerumen is removed. Effective treatment options include cerumenolytic agents, irrigation with or without cerumenolytic pretreatment, and manual removal. Home irrigation with a bulb syringe may be appropriate for selected adults. Cotton-tipped swabs, ear candling, and olive oil drops or sprays should be avoided. If multiple attempts to remove the impacted cerumen-including a combination of treatments-are ineffective, clinicians should refer the patient to an otolaryngologist. Persistent symptoms despite resolution of the impaction should also prompt further evaluation for an alternative diagnosis.

### An emergency medicine-focused review of malignant otitis externa [^111wNmKS]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Malignant otitis externa (MOE) is a progressive infection of the external auditory canal (EAC). This disease is rare but has severe morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This narrative review provides an overview of malignant otitis externa for emergency clinicians.

Discussion

MOE is an invasive external ear infection that spreads to the temporal bone and can further progress to affect intracranial structures. Complications of advanced MOE include cranial nerve involvement, most commonly the facial nerve, and intracranial infections such as abscess and meningitis. The most common causative agent of MOE is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but others include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and fungi. Major risk factors for MOE include diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, and advanced age. Red flags for MOE include severe otalgia (pain out of proportion to exam) or severe otorrhea, neurologic deficits (especially facial nerve involvement), previously diagnosed otitis externa not responsive to therapy, and patients with major risk factors for MOE. Examination may show purulent otorrhea or granulation tissue in the EAC, and culture of EAC drainage should be performed. Diagnosis is aided by computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast, which may demonstrate bony destruction of the temporal bone or skull base. When suspecting MOE, early consultation with an otolaryngologist is recommended and antibiotics with pseudomonal coverage are needed. Most patients with MOE will require admission to the hospital.

Conclusions

MOE is a rare, yet deadly diagnosis that must be suspected when patients with immunocompromise, diabetes, or advanced age present with severe otalgia. Rapid diagnosis and treatment may prevent complications and improve outcomes.

### The "hyperdense basivertebral vein" sign: another marker of a CSF-venous fistula [^116ppsYM]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Case 2

A 55-year-old woman reported on sudden onset of strong orthostatic headache, nausea, vomiting, tinnitus and ear pressure starting 5 months ago. MRI scan was "head positive" (Bern score of 3), spine MRI was SLEC negative. Lateral decubitus CTM disclosed a hyperdense basivertebral vein at the level Th5/6 (Fig. 2), via an accessory paravertebral connection, the basivertebral vein on the level above filled as well. This accessory paravertebral vein of the CVF was present in the DSM as well (not shown), the central drainage, on the other hand, was not seen using this modality. Opacity of the contrast medium in the basivertebral vein was maximum 2600 HU, at the side of the intrathecal contrast column maximum 3100 HU, a lot denser than bony structures or calcifications. Complementary right-sided decubitus CTM the next day confirmed an "empty basivertebral vein" at these levels. After the patient had undergone transvenous occlusion symptoms completely resolved but rebound-hypertension occurred. MRI 6 weeks after embolization showed a declining SIH score from 3 to 1.

### Ofloxacin (ofloxacin otic) [^113FYHkD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients with a Middle Ear Infection, if a dose of Ofloxacin Otic Solution is missed, it should be given as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule.

Do not use a double dose unless the doctor has instructed you to do so. If the infection is not improved after one week, you should consult your doctor. If you have two or more episodes of drainage within six months, it is recommended that you see your doctor for further evaluation.

What activities should be avoided while using Ofloxacin Otic Solution?

It is important that the infected ear(s) remain clean and dry. When bathing, avoid getting the infected ear(s) wet. Avoid swimming unless the doctor has instructed otherwise.

What are some of the possible side effects of Ofloxacin Otic Solution?

During the testing of Ofloxacin Otic Solution in external ear infections, the most common side effect was discomfort upon application which happened in 7% of patients. If the pain is severe, the medication should be stopped and you should contact your doctor. Other side effects were: itching (1%), earache (0.8%), and dizziness (0.4%).

### Aural toilet (ear cleaning) for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1155AYug]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Aural toileting is a term describing a number of processes for manually cleaning the ear. Techniques used may include dry mopping (with cotton wool or tissue paper), suction clearance (typically under a microscope) or irrigation (using manual or automated syringing). Dry mopping may be effective in removing mucopurulent discharge. Compared to irrigation or microsuction it is less effective in removing epithelial debris or thick pus. Aural toileting can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or topical antiseptics.

Objectives

To assess the effects of aural toilet procedures for people with CSOM.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving people (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. We included any aural toileting method as the intervention, at any frequency and for any duration. The comparisons were aural toileting compared with a) placebo or no intervention, and b) any other aural toileting method. We analysed trials in which background treatments were used in both arms (e.g. topical antiseptics or topical antibiotics) separately.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and the adverse events of ear bleeding and dizziness/vertigo/balance problems.

Main Results

We included three studies with a total of 431 participants (465 ears), reporting on two comparisons. Two studies included only children with CSOM in the community (351 participants) and the other study (80 participants) included children and adults with chronic ear discharge for at least six weeks. None of the included studies reported the outcomes of health-related quality of life, ear pain or the adverse event of ear bleeding. Daily aural toileting (dry mopping) versus no treatment Two studies (351 children; 370 ears) compared daily dry mopping with no treatment. Neither study presented results for resolution of ear discharge at between one and up to two weeks or between two to four weeks. For resolution of ear discharge after four weeks, one study reported the results per person. We are very uncertain whether there is a difference at 16 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.72; 1 study; 217 participants) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. No results were reported for the adverse events of dizziness, vertigo or balance problems. Only one study reported serious complications, but it was not clear which group these patients were from, or whether the complications occurred pre- or post-treatment. One study reported hearing, but the results were presented by treatment outcome rather than by treatment group so it is not possible to determine whether there is a difference between the two groups. Daily aural toileting versus single aural toileting on top of topical ciprofloxacin One study (80 participants; 95 ears) compared daily aural toileting (suction) with administration of topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) ear drops in a clinic, to a single aural toileting (suction) episode followed by daily self-administered topical antibiotic drops, in participants of all ages. We are unsure whether there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge at between one and up to two weeks (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.30; 1 study; 80 participants) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. There were no results reported for resolution of ear discharge at between two to four weeks. The results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks were presented by ear, not person, and could not be adjusted to by person. One patient in the group with single aural toileting and self administration of topical antibiotic ear drops reported the adverse event of dizziness, which the authors attributed to the use of cold topical ciprofloxacin. It is very uncertain whether there is a difference between the groups (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.95; 1 study; 80 participants, very low-certainty). No results were reported for the other adverse events of vertigo or balance problems, or for serious complications. The authors only reported qualitatively that there was no difference between the two groups in hearing results (very low-certainty).

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain whether or not treatment with aural toileting is effective in resolving ear discharge in people with CSOM, due to a lack of data and the poor quality of the available evidence. We also remain uncertain about other outcomes, including adverse events, as these were not well reported. Similarly, we are very uncertain whether daily suction clearance, followed by antibiotic ear drops administered at a clinic, is better than a single episode of suction clearance followed by self-administration of topical antibiotic ear drops.

### The complication of middle facelift surgery resulting in migration of temporal augmentation implant [^114DLowm]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

A 66-year-old woman admitted with induration, peri-wound marceration, swelling, and tenderness on temporal area. She had repeated painful tenderness on temporal area for 10 days. In the peri-wound, discharge volume increased when she ate spicy food or drank lemon juice. She had no trauma history and special medical history. But 3 weeks ago, she had midface lift surgery at another local clinic. Initially, the authors had aspiration to swelling spot, checked 50 cc serotic discharge. The authors checked contrast enhance facial computed tomography and found homogenous fluid collection and peripheral enhancing low attenuated lesion in the anterior portion of tragus and inferior aspect of left ear lobe. Also migration of ipsilateral temporal augmentation implant was shown as a result of seroma in temporal fossa. The authors decided to proceed with the surgical removal and diversion of fluid collection. Under local anesthesia, the authors had incision and drainage, inserted drainage tube and bag. After inserting a drainage device, daily discharge was reduced and the condition was treated conservatively with additional drainage and resolved completely in 3 weeks. There were no wound problems such as infection, disruption, and so on.

PATIENT INFORMATION

Rx Only

Ofloxacin Otic Solution, 0.3%

IMPORTANT PATIENT INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS. READ BEFORE USE.

What is Ofloxacin Otic Solution?

Ofloxacin Otic Solution is an antibiotic in a sterile solution used to treat ear infections caused by certain bacteria found in:

patients (12 years and older) who have a middle ear infection and have a hole in the eardrum
pediatric patients (between 1 and 12 years of age) who have a middle ear infection and have a tube in the eardrum
patients (6 months and older) who have an infection in the ear canal

Middle Ear Infection

A middle ear infection is a bacterial infection behind the eardrum. People with a hole or a tube in the eardrum may notice a discharge (fluid draining) in the ear canal.

Ear canal infection

An ear canal infection (also known as "Swimmer's Ear") is a bacterial infection of the ear canal. The ear canal and the outer part of the ear may swell, turn red, and be painful. Also, a fluid discharge may appear in the ear canal.

Who should NOT use Ofloxacin Otic Solution?

Do not use this product if you are allergic to ofloxacin or to other quinolone antibiotics.
Do not give this product to pediatric patients who:
have an ear canal infection and are less than 6 months of age because no data were collected from this population
have a middle ear infection and have a tube in the eardrum and are less than one year of age because no data were collected from this population
have a middle ear infection and have a hole in the eardrum and are less than 12 years of age because no data were collected from this population

### Yellow nail syndrome with chylothorax after coronary artery bypass grafting [^111jTisJ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Yellow nail syndrome is a rare condition considered secondary to functional anomalies of lymphatic drainage. Yellow nail syndrome is diagnosed through the triad of intrathoracic findings (30% being pleural effusions), nail discoloration, and lymphedema, with any two features sufficient for diagnosis. We report the second case of post-operative yellow nail syndrome.

Case Presentation

After coronary artery bypass grafting, our patient presented with chylothorax on post-operative day 13 and yellow toenail discoloration on post-operative day 28, diagnosing yellow nail syndrome. Initial conservative management with pigtail catheter drainage and low-fat diet with medium-chain triglycerides reduced chylous drainage from 350 mL/day on post-operative day 14 to < 100 mL/day on post-operative day 17. However, by post-operative day 18, drainage returned to 350 mL/day that persisted despite attempts to readjust the catheter position, replacement of catheter with chest tube, and transition to total parenteral nutrition and octreotide while nil per os. Lymphangiogram on post-operative day 32 did not identify the thoracic duct or cisterna chyli, precluding embolization. Talc and doxycycline pleurodeses performed on post-operative days 33 and 38, respectively, resolved his chylothorax and nail discoloration.

Conclusions

Both yellow nail syndrome and chylothorax as a complication of coronary artery bypass grafting are rare entities. The proposed mechanism of post-operative chylothorax is iatrogenic injury to thoracic duct or collateral lymphatic vessels. Diagnosing yellow nail syndrome in patients with post-operative chylothorax (through co-existing yellow nail discoloration and/or lymphedema) may suggest predisposition to impaired lymphatic drainage, portending a difficult recovery and potentially indicating need for surgical management.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^115CepoX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Otomycosis (fungal otitis externa) — prevalence, features, and management: Otomycosis, or fungal infection of the external ear canal, is a relatively common diagnosis and accounts for about 10% of AOE cases, with predisposing factors including moisture, absence of cerumen, alkaline pH, prior topical antibiotic or steroid use, chronic otitis media, hearing aid use, and immunocompromised states. Symptoms include pruritus and thick otorrhea that may be black, gray, bluish green, yellow, or white; Candida otitis externa generally results in white debris sprouting hyphae and Aspergillus niger usually appears as a moist white plug dotted with black debris ("wet newspaper"). Fungal otitis externa should also be suspected if a patient fails to respond to initial topical therapy, management may include debridement plus topical antifungal therapy, rarely systemic antifungal therapy, or both, and topical antibiotic therapy is contraindicated in managing otomycosis because it is ineffective and may promote further fungal overgrowth.

### Antibiotics versus topical antiseptics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^116RTQaU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity. It is characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Antibiotics and antiseptics kill or inhibit the micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be applied topically or administered systemically via the oral or injection route. Antiseptics are always directly applied to the ear (topically).

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics versus antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The latest search date was 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving adults and children who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The intervention was any single, or combination of, antibiotic agent, whether applied topically (without steroids) or systemically. The comparison was any single, or combination of, topical antiseptic agent, applied as ear drops, powders, or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. The comparisons were 1. topical antiseptics compared to topical antibiotics, and 2. topical antiseptics compared to systemic antibiotics. We further separated these comparisons into those in which a. both groups of participants received aural toileting in addition to the intervention, or b. both groups received some other add-on therapy treatment (such as systemic antibiotics) to both arms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology. Our primary outcomes were resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and ototoxicity. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This updated review included eight new studies. Overall, we identified 15 studies (2371 participants) across seven comparisons with antibiotics compared to acetic acid, aluminium acetate, boric acid, and povidone-iodine. None of the included studies reported health-related quality of life or serious complications. 1. Topical antibiotics (quinolones or aminoglycosides) versus topical antiseptic (acetic acid) We included seven studies (835 participants). Acetic acid may increase resolution of ear discharge when compared to aminoglycoside at one to two weeks (low-certainty evidence). It is very uncertain whether acetic acid may increase resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks when compared to topical quinolone. Results after four weeks were only presented narratively. It is very uncertain whether acetic acid may cause more ear pain, discomfort, local irritation, or combinations of these compared to topical antibiotics (aminoglycosides and quinolones) (risk ratio (RR) 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 1.12; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 277 participants; very low-certainty evidence). An additional two studies (350 participants) provided narrative results. There may be little to no difference in hearing between groups reported narratively (quinolones; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain for serious complications (aminoglycosides) or suspected ototoxicity (aminoglycosides) (very low-certainty evidence). 2. Topical antibiotics (quinolones) versus topical antiseptic (boric acid) We included two studies (532 participants). Topical quinolones are likely to increase resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks compared with boric acid ear drops (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.35; 1 study, 411 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that one additional person will have resolution of ear discharge for every four people receiving topical antibiotics (compared with boric acid) at two weeks. No study reported results for ear discharge after four weeks. There may be less ear pain, discomfort, or irritation with quinolones compared with boric acid (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.98; 2 studies, 510 participants; low-certainty evidence). Suspected ototoxicity and serious complications were not reported. Topical quinolones may result in a greater improvement in mean hearing from baseline compared to topical boric acid (mean difference (MD) 2.79 decibels, 95% CI 0.48 to 5.10; 1 study, 390 participants; low-certainty evidence), but this difference may not be clinically significant. 3. Topical antibiotics (quinolones) versus topical antiseptic (povidone-iodine) We included one study (40 participants). It is very uncertain if there is a difference between quinolones and povidone-iodine with respect to resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.26; 1 RCT, 39 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study reported qualitatively that there were no differences between the groups for hearing and no participants developed ototoxic effects (very low-certainty evidence). There were no results reported for resolution of ear discharge beyond four weeks; ear pain, discomfort, or irritation; or serious complications. 4. Topical antibiotics versus topical antiseptic (aluminium acetate) We included one study (51 participants; 60 ears) that presented results for resolution of ear discharge at two to four weeks results narratively. No other results were reported. 5. Other comparisons Five studies (966 participants) were assessed over an additional three comparisons; however, these results have not been included in the abstract.

Authors' Conclusions

Treatment of CSOM with topical antibiotics (quinolones) likely results in an increase in resolution of ear discharge compared with boric acid at up to two weeks. There was limited evidence for the efficacy of other topical antibiotics or topical antiseptics and so we are unable to draw conclusions. Harmful effects were not well reported. Limitations of the review include lack of recent data, limitations in the quality of included studies, and limited information on certain population groups or interventions.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^114r7BTp]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for otitis media with effusion, more specifically with respect to tympanostomy (AAO-HNSF), AAO-HNS 2022 guidelines recommend to consider performing tympanostomy tube insertion in pediatric patients with unilateral or bilateral OME of ≥ 3 months duration (chronic OME) and symptoms likely attributable, all or in part, to OME including, but are not limited to, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, ear discomfort, or reduced QoL.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^116PfbT7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children — clinical role and risk considerations — state that when children receive surgery for otitis media with effusion (OME), insertion of tympanostomy tubes is the preferred initial procedure, with candidacy dependent primarily on hearing status, associated symptoms, and the child's developmental risk. Placement of tympanostomy tubes significantly reduces middle ear effusion (MEE) prevalence, resolves hearing loss caused by MEE, reduces the incidence of recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), and provides a mechanism for drainage and administration of topical antibiotic therapy should acute tube otorrhea occur. Tympanostomy tubes also can improve disease-specific quality of life (QOL) for children with chronic OME, recurrent AOM, or both. Risks and potential adverse events are related to general anesthesia, usually required for the procedure, and the effects of the tympanostomy tube on the tympanic membrane and middle ear, but risks associated with general anesthesia can be eliminated by inserting tubes in the office setting without general anesthesia, when appropriate, based on shared decision making between the clinician and family.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^114syHK2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — background and symptoms note that cerumen, or "earwax", is a naturally occurring substance that cleans, protects, and lubricates the external auditory canal and is the primary reason why the ear canal can become obstructed. Blockage of the ear canal by cerumen can cause symptoms including hearing loss, tinnitus, fullness, itching, otalgia, discharge, odor, and cough, and can prevent diagnostic assessment by preventing complete examination of the external auditory canal and/or eardrum (tympanic membrane).

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112dPPGu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Other causes of otalgia or otorrhea that may mimic acute otitis externa — differential and evaluation: Furunculosis is the presence of an infected hair follicle on the outer third of the ear canal, sometimes referred to as localized otitis externa; clinical findings include acute otalgia, otorrhea, localized tenderness, focal swelling, and pustular lesions, and treatment may include local heat, incision and drainage, or systemic antibiotics that cover S aureus. Complaints of otalgia in the absence of swelling of the ear canal and without apparent middle ear disease should arouse suspicion of pathology outside the ear, and perhaps the most common cause of referred otalgia is temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome. A complete head and neck examination with visualization of the mucosal surfaces of the head and neck, assessment of any neck masses, and palpation of the tongue base is recommended. Other potential etiologies include dental pathologies, tonsillitis, peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscesses, carotidynia, styloid process elongation, angina, intrathoracic aneurysms, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and geniculate neuralgia. Although otorrhea may accompany AOE, other causes should be considered; cholesteatoma may be mistaken for AOE or chronic external otitis but is typically painless.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^114KbQJ2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) frequently asked questions — ear fluid is described as "a buildup of mucus or liquid behind the eardrum, without symptoms of an ear infection", and ear infections (acute otitis media [AOM]) "cause fever, ear pain, and active (acute) inflammation"; in OME the fluid "is not actively infected, and pain may be absent or minimal". The page notes that "Nearly all children get ear fluid at least once by school age". Children may have "no symptoms at all or more subtle findings", and clinicians can detect fluid "by looking in the ear canal (otoscopy) or by measuring the movement of the eardrum (tympanometry or pneumatic otoscopy)". Causes listed include "a cold, an ear infection (AOM), or the normal congestion (negative pressure)", and most fluid "goes away on its own in weeks or months". OME "is of more concern if it lasts > 3 mo", and "Your doctor should check the ears periodically until the fluid is gone"; management advice notes that the "best advice can be found in clinical practice guidelines" based on evidence and consideration of benefits and harms.

### The unpredictability of lymphatic drainage from the ear in melanoma patients, and its implications for management [^113VxTem]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The ear is known to have variable lymphatic drainage. The purpose of this study was to define better the lymphatic drainage patterns of the ear by correlating the location of primary tumors, classified according to the embryologically derived anatomical subunits of the ear, with their mapped sentinel nodes (SNs) identified by lymphoscintigraphy (LS).

Methods

Lymphatic drainage data for patients with a primary melanoma of the ear were reviewed and correlated with the precise primary melanoma site.

Results

Between 1993 and 2010, LS was performed in 111 patients with a primary melanoma on the ear, identifying 281 SNs in 195 lymph node (LN) fields. The mean numbers of SNs and LN fields identified by LS per patient were 2.65 and 1.76. SN biopsy was performed in 71 patients (64%). The mean number of SNs removed was 2.36. The 111 ear melanomas were mostly located on the helical rim (55%), followed by the lobule (24.3%). The five different primary ear sites drained mainly to SNs in level CII, level CV and the preauricular region. Drainage was most often to level CII (36.4%). Drainage to the contralateral neck was not observed.

Conclusions

Lymphatic drainage of the ear has no predictable pattern and can be to SNs anywhere in the ipsilateral neck. Most commonly drainage is to cervical level II and the preauricular and postauricular LN fields. LS defines the lymphatic drainage pattern in individual melanoma patients and is essential for accurate SN identification and reliable SN biopsy.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^11598rhu]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — otoscopic signs and diagnostic performance are characterized in a two-site Finnish study correlating tympanic membrane (TM) color, mobility, and position with the presence of middle ear effusion (MEE) obtained by tympanocentesis; 2911 children were followed from 6 months to 2.5 years of age, with 11 804 visits analyzed and MEE present in 84.9% and 81.8% of visits with acute symptoms. AOM was diagnosed if MEE was found and the child had fever, earache, irritability, ear rubbing or tugging, simultaneous other acute respiratory tract symptoms, vomiting, or diarrhea. The combination of a "cloudy", bulging TM with impaired mobility was the best predictor of AOM using the symptom-based diagnosis; impaired mobility had the highest sensitivity and specificity (approximately 95% and 85%, respectively), cloudiness had the next best combination of high sensitivity (~74%) and high specificity (~93%), and bulging had high specificity (~97%) but lower sensitivity (∼51%). A TM that was hemorrhagic, strongly red, or moderately red also correlated with the presence of AOM, whereas a TM that was only "slightly red" was not helpful diagnostically. In a small myringotomy series, 31 children (40 ears) were studied; bulging TMs had positive bacterial cultures 75% of the time, increasing to 80% if the TM was yellow, and the conclusion is that moderate to severe bulging of the TM represents the most important characteristic in the diagnosis of AOM.

### What is swimmer's ear? [^112oQnh3]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

How Does This Happen. Swimmer's ear is common in children but may occur at any age. Swimmers are at highest risk, but anyone can be affected. For example, people who wear hearing aids or ear buds may trap moisture in the ear canal from sweating or showering. When the ear does not dry completely, bacteria and fungi grow more easily. This causes infection and irritation of the ear canal. Cleaning, scratching, or putting items in the ear can also cause infection. Unlike other ear infections, the space behind the eardrum is usually not involved. What Are the Symptoms. Ear pain is very common. A feeling of fullness in the ear or muffled hearing are also common. There may be smelly drainage from the ear, especially on the pillow after sleeping. Many people may experience itchiness, redness, or swelling. Fever, chills, or symptoms not involving the ear are rare. Who Needs Treatment. If the symptoms of swimmer's ear are present, a clinician should be seen.

The main treatment is antibiotic ear drops for about a week. Antibiotics by mouth are usually not needed. This will help fight the bacteria and control the infection. The ear drops may include a steroid to decrease swelling and pain. Sometimes repeat infections happen. Completing the entire treatment is important. If the infection causes a lot of swelling, sometimes an ear, nose, and throat specialist needs to put something in the ear canal to keep it open and allow the antibiotic drops to reach the infection. This is called an ear wick. An ENT specialist may also need to clean the ear by using instruments or suction. Keeping the ears dry, avoiding putting items in the ear, and cleaning ear devices regularly can decrease infections. While bathing, a cotton ball with Vaseline can be used to prevent water from entering the ear. After swimming or bathing, a hair dryer on cool can be used to gently dry the ear.

Over-the-counter ear cleaning devices, candling, or other home remedies should be avoided. What If It Does Not Improve. Symptoms should improve within a few days after treatment starts. Most patients will be fully healed within 7 to 10 days. If not, this may be a sign that it is more serious, and an ENT specialist should be seen. When left untreated, there is a risk of the infection spreading to nearby bones or skin. This is especially important in older people with diabetes or weak immune systems. Long-term infections can result in decreased hearing and scarring.

### Successful replantation of the ear as a venous flap [^113zCfMG]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Successful microvascular ear replantation is well described, and often involves the use of arterial inflow anastomoses with leeches and systemic anticoagulation to augment outflow. Failed replantation attempts have also been published, with most of the failures attributed to venous drainage problems. A case of successful replantation of an ear is presented using a single 0.5-mm arteriovenous anastomosis, as no suitable artery could be identified in the amputated part. Postoperatively, dextran and leech therapies were employed to promote adequate venous drainage. We report a 100% successful ear replantation using a single arterialized vein as the inflow. In situations where no adequate artery is identifiable in the amputated part, an arteriovenous anastomosis may be a suitable alternative.

### Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea and otorrhea: a case report and literature review [^115hgysy]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak is a condition that commonly presents with unilateral watery drainage from the nose or ear, tinnitus, and stuffy ears or hearing loss. Spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea and otorrhea together are rare. A 64-year-old woman presented at our department with complaints of clear watery rhinorrhea and hearing loss on the right side persisting for 10 months. Imaging and surgery were used to diagnose the condition. Through surgical treatment, she was eventually cured. Review of the literature has shown that patients with both nasal and aural CSF leaks are rare. When a patient presents with both unilateral watery drainage from both the nose and ear, a diagnosis of CSF rhinorrhea and otorrhea should be considered. This case report will benefit clinicians by providing more information to assist with diagnosing the disease.

### WITHDRAWN: ear drops for the removal of ear wax [^111ojt4z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Problems attributed to the accumulation of wax (cerumen) are among the most common reasons for people to present to their general practitioners with ear trouble. Treatment for this condition often involves use of a wax softening agent (cerumenolytic) to disperse the cerumen, reduce the need for, or facilitate syringing, but there is no consensus on the effectiveness of the variety of cerumenolytics in use.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of ear drops (cerumenolytics) for the removal of symptomatic ear wax.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2008 issue 2); MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; ISI Proceedings; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was April 2008.

Selection Criteria

We identified all randomised controlled trials in which a cerumenolytic was compared with no treatment, a placebo, or other cerumenolytics in participants with obstructing or impacted ear wax, and in which the proportion of participants with sufficient clearance of the external canal to make further mechanical clearance unnecessary (primary outcome measure) was stated or calculable.

Data Collection and Analysis

The two authors reviewed all the retrieved trials and applied the inclusion criteria independently.

Main Results

Nine trials satisfied the inclusion criteria. In all, 679 participants received one of 11 different cerumenolytics. One trial compared active treatments with no treatment, three compared active treatments with water or a saline 'placebo', and all nine trials compared two or more active treatments. Eight trials included syringing as a secondary intervention. Overall, results were inconclusive. The majority of comparisons showed no difference between treatments. Meta-analysis of two high quality trials produced a statistical difference in favour of triethanolamine polypeptide over saline in preventing the need for syringing, but no other significant differences between treatments. In three trials of high to moderate quality, no difference was found between the effectiveness of either sodium bicarbonate ear drops, chlorbutanol, triethanolamine polypeptide oleate condensate or docusate sodium liquid versus a sterile water or saline 'placebo'. One trial of moderate methodological quality found all three treatments - sodium bicarbonate ear drops, chlorbutanol and sterile water - to be significantly better than no treatment at preventing the need for syringing. None of the higher quality trials demonstrated superiority of one agent over another in direct comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

Trials have been heterogeneous and generally of low or moderate quality, making it difficult to offer any definitive recommendations on the effectiveness of cerumenolytics for the removal of symptomatic ear wax. Using drops of any sort appears to be better than no treatment, but it is uncertain if one type of drop is any better than another. Future trials should be of high methodological quality, have large sample sizes, and compare both oil-based and water-based solvents with placebo, no treatment or both.

### Otitis externa: a practical guide to treatment and prevention [^114U9KpW]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Otitis externa is most commonly caused by infection (usually bacterial, although occasionally fungal), but it may also be associated with a variety of noninfectious systemic or local dermatologic processes. The most characteristic symptom is discomfort that is limited to the external auditory canal, while the most characteristic signs are erythema and swelling of the canal with variable discharge. Excessive moisture and trauma, both of which impair the canal's natural defenses, are the two most common precipitants of otitis externa, and avoidance of these precipitants is the cornerstone of prevention. Thorough cleansing of the canal is essential for diagnosis and treatment, but flushing should be avoided. Acidification with a topical solution of 2 percent acetic acid combined with hydrocortisone for inflammation is effective treatment in most cases and, when used after exposure to moisture, is an excellent prophylactic. Other prophylactic measures such as drying the ears with a hair dryer and avoiding manipulation of the external auditory canal may help prevent recurrence.

### Treatment of otorrhea in infants and children… [^115ZpWLJ]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Otorrhea, defined as drainage from the ear, can be acute or chronic. This common problem can be caused by benign or serious conditions. Sabella reviewed the management of otorrhea in infants and children. Acute otorrhea is usually a result of acute otitis media or otitis externa, or a postoperative complication of tympanostomy tube placement. Acute otitis media can cause spontaneous rupture of the tympanic membrane, allowing purulent material to drain into the external ear canal. The microbiology of these cases is similar to that of otitis media without perforation. The most common organisms associated with an acutely perforated tympanic membrane are. Otitis externa can cause acute otorrhea, accompanied by ear pain and severe edema along with the drainage. This infection is more common in the summer months and is associated with swimming and prolonged exposure to water.

Differentiating otitis externa from acute mastoiditis may be difficult because of severe ear pain and the inability to visualize the tympanic membrane. The absence of postauricular erythema and tenderness in otitis externa helps with differentiation. Gram-negative bacteria, especially. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cause most cases of otitis externa. Otorrhea is the most common complication of tympanostomy tube placement. The insertion of ototopical drops at the time of surgery appears to be effective in reducing the rate of otorrhea. Acute otorrhea in a patient with a tympanostomy tube may represent acute otitis media or water contamination from the external canal. Aspirating material from the middle ear through the tympanostomy tube will help in identifying the causative organisms. When otorrhea continues for 10 days despite the use of oral antibiotics, culture of the drainage from the perforation site is important in guiding antibiotic choice.

The specimen can be obtained using a spinal needle attached to a tuberculin syringe. Cleaning of the ear canal may also be required. Otorrhea that continues beyond 14 days requires a careful examination for cholesteatoma, neoplasm or intracranial abnormalities. P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans streptococci and S. pneumoniae. Evaluation includes a complete examination and a culture of organisms from the middle ear. Initial management includes the use of ototopical agents and aural toilet.

### Topical antibiotics with steroids for chronic suppurative otitis media [^116YrGRc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics act to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as steroids, antiseptics or ear cleaning (aural toileting). Antibiotics are commonly prescribed in combined preparations with steroids.

Objectives

To assess the effects of adding a topical steroid to topical antibiotics in the treatment of people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving participants (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any combination of a topical antibiotic agent(s) of any class and a topical corticosteroid (steroid) of any class, applied directly into the ear canal as ear drops, powders or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. The two main comparisons were topical antibiotic and steroid compared to a) placebo or no intervention and b) another topical antibiotic.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks and after four weeks; health-related quality of life; ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity.

Main Results

We included 17 studies addressing 11 treatment comparisons. A total of 1901 participants were included, with one study (40 ears) not reporting the number of participants recruited, which we therefore could not account for. No studies reported health-related quality of life. The main comparisons were: 1. Topical antibiotics with steroids versus placebo or no treatment Three studies (210 participants) compared a topical antibiotic-steroid to saline or no treatment. Resolution of discharge was not reported at between one to two weeks. One study (50 'high-risk' children) reported results at more than four weeks by ear and we could not adjust the results to by person. The study reported that 58% (of 41 ears) resolved with topical antibiotics compared with 50% (of 26 ears) with no treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain. One study (123 participants) noted minor side effects in 16% of participants in both the intervention and placebo groups (very low-certainty evidence). One study (123 participants) reported no change in bone-conduction hearing thresholds and reported no difference in tinnitus or balance problems between groups (very low-certainty evidence). One study (50 participants) reported serious complications, but it was not clear which group these patients were from, or whether the complications occurred pre- or post-treatment. One study (123 participants) reported that no side effects occurred in any participants (very low-certainty evidence). 2. Topical antibiotics with steroids versus topical antibiotics (same antibiotics) only Four studies (475 participants) were included in this comparison. Three studies (340 participants) compared topical antibiotic-steroid combinations to topical antibiotics alone. The evidence suggests little or no difference in resolution of discharge at one to two weeks: 82.7% versus 76.6% (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.21; 335 participants; 3 studies (4 study arms); low-certainty evidence). No results for resolution of discharge after four weeks were reported. One study (110 participants) reported local itchiness but as there was only one episode in each group it is uncertain whether there is a difference (very low-certainty evidence). Three studies (395 participants) investigated suspected ototoxicity but it was not possible to determine whether there were differences between the groups for this outcome (very low-certainty evidence). No study reported serious complications. 3. Topical antibiotics with steroids compared to topical antibiotics alone (different antibiotics) Nine studies (981 participants plus 40 ears) evaluated a range of comparisons of topical non-quinolone antibiotic-steroid combinations versus topical quinolone antibiotics alone. Resolution of discharge may be greater with quinolone topical antibiotics alone at between one to two weeks compared with non-quinolone topical antibiotics with steroids: 82.1% versus 63.2% (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.84; 7 studies; 903 participants, low-certainty evidence). Results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks were not reported. One study (52 participants) reported usable data on ear pain, two studies (419 participants) reported hearing outcomes and one study (52 participants) reported balance problems. It was not possible to determine whether there were significant differences between the groups for these outcomes (very low-certainty evidence). Two studies (149 participants) reported no serious complications (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain about the effectiveness of topical antibiotics with steroids in improving the resolution of ear discharge in patients with CSOM because of the limited amount of low-certainty evidence available. Amongst this uncertainty, we found no evidence that the addition of steroids to topical antibiotics affects the resolution of ear discharge. There is also low-certainty evidence that some types of topical antibiotics (without steroids) may be better than topical antibiotic/steroid combinations in improving resolution of discharge. There is also uncertainty about the relative effectiveness of different types of antibiotics; it is not possible to determine with any certainty whether or not quinolones are better or worse than aminoglycosides. These two groups of compounds have different adverse effect profiles, but there is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make any comment about these. In general, adverse effects were poorly reported.

VA/DoD tinnitus history and symptoms — provider should first rule out transient ear noise, defined as the perception of sound, usually occurring in one ear at a time and described as high-pitched ringing or tone, lasting fewer than five minutes, and sometimes accompanied by a sense of hearing loss and aural fullness; transient ear noise is common and does not generally require clinical management. If transient ear noise is ruled out, the following pertinent information should be obtained (not in any particular order): frequency, laterality, quality (e.g., pulsatile, non-pulsatile), and intensity of tinnitus; circumstance and date of onset of tinnitus; impact of tinnitus on sleep, daily activities, or quality of life (screen the patient with a validated instrument, when indicated); hearing loss (e.g., asymmetric, bilateral, unilateral, sudden, recent); ear pressure or fullness with normal ear exam; presence of co-occurring conditions, such as anxiety, stress, depression, insomnia, dental issues (e.g., temporomandibular disorder [TMD]), cervical issues; and history of head or neck injury; blast exposure; noise exposure; hearing difficulties; sound tolerance issues; ear pain, drainage, or both; dizziness or vertigo; or possible ototoxic medication (see Appendix C).

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^115ztNrV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Ear tubes — indications and water guidance emphasize benefits and simple precautions. Ear tubes are recommended for "frequent ear infections or prolonged fluid in the ears" to "Help decrease the number of ear infections", allow treatment with "antibiotic ear drops instead of antibiotics that are taken by mouth", "Help prevent fluid from backing up" into the middle ear, and "Improve hearing" reduced by fluid. For water activities, "Your child will not usually need ear plugs", and "Head bands or other special efforts… are also unnecessary, but may be helpful" when there is "Pain or discomfort when water enters the ear canal", "Current fluid or drainage", "Swimming in lakes or non-chlorinated pools that are not clean", or "Dunking head in the bathtub". The guide cautions, "NEVER use Play-Doh or Silly Putty as an ear plug — these materials can become trapped in the ear canal and even require surgical removal".

### Current bacteriology of suppurative otitis: resistant patterns and outcomes analysis [^113Xh2GT]. Otology & Neurotology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Antibiotic resistance has complicated the management of the draining ear. In this study, we examine the factors predisposing to resistance, as well as the role culture played in the management of these patients.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients with a complaint of otorrhea during a 3-year period. Demographic factors, the patients diagnosis, previous antimicrobial use, the organism isolated, the resistance pattern of the organism, the treatment instituted, the treatment changed, and the efficacy of treatment were all examined.

Results

Previous antibiotic use resulted in a significantly increased rate of resistance only for the diagnosis of otitis externa (p = 0.01). No other factors were found to be clinically significant. The previous use of ototopical quinolones was shown to be correlated with a significant increase in quinolone resistance (p = 0.01). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated was shown to have 60% and 33% resistance rates to clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, respectively. The overall treatment failure rate was 36% but rose to 50% for infections involving highly resistant bacteria (p = 0.01). Treatment was changed based on culture results in 21% of cases.

Conclusion

Previous antibiotic use is correlated with increased bacterial resistance in the case of otitis externa. Highly resistant bacteria were associated with an increased rate of treatment failure. Culture plays an essential role in the management of refractory otorrhea.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^115PsMMN]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion — tympanometry preparation and calibration. Prior to performing tympanometry, the ear canal should be examined with otoscopy for cerumen blockage, foreign bodies, drainage, tympanic membrane perforation, or a collapsed canal to correlate findings with tympanometry results. Proper calibration of the tympanometer is essential for accurate results.

### Minimally invasive image-guided access for drainage of petrous apex lesions: a case report [^116pEbtV]. Otology & Neurotology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

In this case report, we present a novel, minimally invasive image-guided approach to drainage of a petrous apex lesion.

Patient(S)

A 34-year-old man diagnosed with a petrous apex lesion consistent with cholesterol granuloma. The granuloma was large and caused mild compression of the brainstem with associated neurologic symptoms and seizure-like activity.

Interventions

Based on the anatomic location of the lesion, it was determined that the treatment plan would be to surgically drain the lesion via 2 linear paths-one after an infralabyrinthine approach and the other a subarcuate approach. Customized microstereotactic frames that mount on bone-implanted markers and constrain the drill along the desired path were used to accurately drill these desired paths and avoid damage to surrounding critical structures. After a simple mastoidectomy, the petrous apex was successfully reached without damage to vital adjacent structures by drilling the 2 linear channels using 2 custom microstereotactic frames.

Main Outcome Measures

Viscous brown liquid and debris was recovered by irrigating through one of the channels and suctioning through the other.

Results

Drainage of the petrous apex was successfully performed via 2 linear channels without any complications. Custom microstereotactic frames were used to accurately drill those linear channels. Postoperative CT ensured no complications. Postoperative course of the patient was remarkable with normal hearing and normal facial nerve function.

Conclusion

We presented a successful implementation of an image-guided approach to drain petrous apex.

### A novel negative pressure drainage treatment of auricular pseudocyst [^111997HR]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pseudocyst of the auricle is a benign cystic lesions of the ear. A variety of methods have been proposed priorly with different treatment effects. Although aggressive treatments may have good results, we aimed to introduce a less invasive method that also yield optimal cosmetic outcome.

Patients and Methods

From August 2019 to April 2020, a total of 32 patients with pseudocyst of the auricle were treated with a novel negative pressure drainage method.

Results

The treatment has performed successfully in all patients. Only 2 patients experienced negative pressure drainage device detachment, and recovered smoothly after reinstallment. Patients were followed up for an average period of 3 months. The appearance of the auricle was recovered excellent in all patients. There were no postoperative complications or episodes of recurrence during the follow-up period.

Conclusion

Considering the excellent cosmetic outcome and free of recurrence, we would recommend our negative pressure drainage method as a first-line treatment for all patients with auricular pseudocyst.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^112YAxw6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2004 guideline codeveloped by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, provides evidence-based recommendations to manage otitis media with effusion (OME), defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. Changes from the prior guideline include consumer advocates added to the update group, evidence from 4 new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews, and 49 randomized control trials, enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of OME.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing OME and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from OME, and educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME and the clinical benefits for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). Additional goals relate to OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient for the guideline is a child aged 2 months through 12 years with OME, with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage children with OME, and it applies to any setting in which OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline, however, does not apply to patients < 2 months or > 12 years old.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child; (2) should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both; (3) should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy; (4) should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown); (5) should recommend against using intranasal or systemic steroids for treating OME; (6) should recommend against using systemic antibiotics for treating OME; and (7) should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should document in the medical record counseling of parents of infants with OME who fail a newborn screening regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure that hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss; (2) should determine if a child with OME is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from middle ear effusion because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (3) should evaluate at-risk children for OME at the time of diagnosis of an at-risk condition and at 12 to 18 months of age (if diagnosed as being at risk prior to this time); (4) should not routinely screen children for OME who are not at risk and do not have symptoms that may be attributable to OME, such as hearing difficulties, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, or ear discomfort; (5) should educate children with OME and their families regarding the natural history of OME, need for follow-up, and the possible sequelae; (6) should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR for OME of any duration in an at-risk child; (7) should counsel families of children with bilateral OME and documented hearing loss about the potential impact on speech and language development; (8) should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; (9) should recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a child < 4 years old; adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); (10) should recommend tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both when surgery is performed for OME in a child ≥ 4 years old; and (11) should document resolution of OME, improved hearing, or improved quality of life when managing a child with OME.

### Topical antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1172yQDg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics, the most common treatment for CSOM, act to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antiseptics or ear cleaning (aural toileting).

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical antibiotics (without steroids) for people with CSOM.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 April 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving participants (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any single, or combination of, topical antibiotic agent(s) of any class, applied directly into the ear canal as ear drops, powders or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. The two main comparisons were topical antibiotic compared to a) placebo or no intervention and b) another topical antibiotic (e.g. topical antibiotic A versus topical antibiotic B). Within each comparison we separated studies where both groups of participants had received topical antibiotic a) alone or with aural toileting and b) on top of background treatment (such as systemic antibiotics).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity measured in several ways.

Main Results

We included 17 studies with a total of 2198 participants. Twelve studies reported the sample size in terms of participants (not ears); these had a total of 1797 participants. The remaining five studies reported both the number of participants and ears, representing 401 participants, or 510 ears. A: Topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment (with aural toilet in both arms and no other background treatment) One small study compared a topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) with placebo (saline). All participants received aural toilet. Although ciprofloxacin was better than saline in terms of resolution of discharge at one to two weeks: 84% versus 12% (risk ratio (RR) 6.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.82 to 24.99; 35 participants, very low-certainty evidence), the very low certainty of the evidence means that it is very uncertain whether or not one intervention is better or worse than the other. The study authors reported that "no medical side-effects and worsening of audiological measurements related to this topical medication were detected" (very low-certainty evidence). B: Topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment (with use of oral antibiotics in both arms) Four studies compared topical ciprofloxacin to no treatment (three studies; 190 participants) or topical ceftizoxime to no treatment (one study; 248 participants). In each study all participants received the same antibiotic systemically (oral ciprofloxacin, injected ceftizoxime). In at least one study all participants received aural toilet. Useable data were only available from the first three studies; ciprofloxacin was better than no treatment, resolution of discharge occurring in 88.2% versus 60% at one to two weeks (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.80; 2 studies, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported ear pain or discomfort/local irritation. C: Comparisons of different topical antibiotics The certainty of evidence for all outcomes in these comparisons is very low. Quinolones versus aminoglycosides Seven studies compared an aminoglycoside (gentamicin, neomycin or tobramycin) with ciprofloxacin (734 participants) or ofloxacin (214 participants). Whilst resolution of discharge at one to two weeks was higher in the quinolones group the very low certainty of the evidence means that it is very uncertain whether or not one intervention is better or worse than the other (RR 1.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 4.29; 6 studies, 694 participants). One study measured ear pain and reported no difference between the groups. Quinolones versus aminoglycosides/polymyxin B combination ± gramicidin We identified three studies but data on our primary outcome were only available in one study. Comparing ciprofloxacin to a neomycin/polymyxin B/gramicidin combination, for an unknown treatment duration (likely four weeks), ciprofloxacin was better (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.22, 186 participants). A "few" patients experienced local irritation upon the first instillation of topical treatment (numbers/groups not stated). Others Other studies examined topical gentamicin versus a trimethoprim/sulphacetamide/polymixin B combination (91 participants) and rifampicin versus chloramphenicol (160 participants). Limited data were available and the findings were very uncertain.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain about the effectiveness of topical antibiotics in improving resolution of ear discharge in patients with CSOM because of the limited amount of low-quality evidence available. However, amongst this uncertainty there is some evidence to suggest that the use of topical antibiotics may be effective when compared to placebo, or when used in addition to a systemic antibiotic. There is also uncertainty about the relative effectiveness of different types of antibiotics; it is not possible to determine with any certainty whether or not quinolones are better or worse than aminoglycosides. These two groups of compounds have different adverse effect profiles, but there is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make any comment about these. In general, adverse effects were poorly reported.

### Cerumen impaction: diagnosis and management [^112h5YoV]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cerumen impaction:

- **Definition**: Cerumen impaction refers to symptomatic accumulation of cerumen in the external ear.
- **Pathophysiology**: The accumulation of a mixture of ceruminous and sebaceous gland secretions mixed with desquamated epithelium results in cerumen impaction. Overproduction of ear wax and narrowing of the ear canal by massess or bony growths may predisopse to impaction.
- **Disease course**: Cerumen impaction is usually asymptomatic but can cause ear discomfort, hearing loss, tinnitus, dizziness, chronic cough, and otitis externa.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Cerumen impaction is not associated with increased mortality.

### Systemic antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1131UuJr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation and infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Systemic antibiotics are a commonly used treatment option for CSOM, which act to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic antibiotics for people with CSOM.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing systemic antibiotics (oral, injection) against placebo/no treatment or other systemic antibiotics with at least a one-week follow-up period, involving patients with chronic (at least two weeks) ear discharge of unknown cause or due to CSOM. Other treatments were allowed if both treatment and control arms also received it.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not, measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks); health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity measured in several ways.

Main Results

We included 18 studies (2135 participants) with unclear or high risk of bias. 1. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo It is very uncertain if there is a difference between systemic (intravenous) antibiotics and placebo in the resolution of ear discharge at between one and two weeks (risk ratio (RR) 8.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 38.21; 33 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not report results for resolution of ear discharge after two weeks. Health-related quality of life was not reported. The evidence is very uncertain for hearing and serious (intracranial) complications. Ear pain and suspected ototoxicity were not reported. 2. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (both study arms received topical antibiotics) Six studies were included of which five presented useable data. There may be little or no difference in the resolution of ear discharge at between one to two weeks for oral ciprofloxacin compared to placebo or no treatment when ciprofloxacin ear drops were used in both intervention arms (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.12; 390 participants; low-certainty evidence). No results after two weeks were reported. Health-related quality of life was not reported. The evidence is very uncertain for ear pain, serious complications and suspected ototoxicity. 3. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (both study arms received other background treatments) Two studies used topical antibiotics plus steroids as background treatment in both arms. It is very uncertain if there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge between metronidazole and placebo at four weeks (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.65; 40 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). This study did not report other outcomes. It is also very uncertain if resolution of ear discharge at six weeks was improved with co-trimoxazole compared to placebo (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.16; 98 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Resolution of ear discharge was not reported at other time points. From the narrative report there was no evidence of a difference between groups for health-related quality of life, hearing or serious complications (very low-certainty evidence). One study (136 participants) used topical antiseptics as background treatment in both arms and found similar resolution of ear discharge between the amoxicillin and no treatment groups at three to four months (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.41; 136 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). The narrative report indicated no evidence of differences in hearing or suspected ototoxicity (both very low-certainty evidence). No other outcomes were reported. 4. Different types of systemic antibiotics This is a summary of four comparisons, where different antibiotics were compared to each other. Eight studies compared different types of systemic antibiotics against each other: quinolones against beta-lactams (four studies), lincosamides against nitroimidazoles (one study) and comparisons of different types of beta-lactams (three studies). It was not possible to conclude if there was one class or type of systemic antibiotic that was better in terms of resolution of ear discharge. The studies did not report adverse events well.

Authors' Conclusions

There was a limited amount of evidence available to examine whether systemic antibiotics are effective in achieving resolution of ear discharge for people with CSOM. When used alone (with or without aural toileting), we are very uncertain if systemic antibiotics are more effective than placebo or no treatment. When added to an effective intervention such as topical antibiotics, there seems to be little or no difference in resolution of ear discharge (low-certainty evidence). Data were only available for certain classes of antibiotics and it is very uncertain whether one class of systemic antibiotic may be more effective than another. Adverse effects of systemic antibiotics were poorly reported in the studies included. As we found very sparse evidence for their efficacy, the possibility of adverse events may detract from their use for CSOM.

### Successful microsurgical replantation of a child's completely amputated ear [^113tLq4g]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Summary

We present a case of a 9-year old boy who underwent successful replantation of a completely amputated ear. Few reports have been published on replantation of children's ears that are completely avulsed. Venous drainage is a well-known factor contributing to the failure of completely amputated ear replantation. In this case, we used a technique of transillumination to examine the amputated ear, and selected veins for exploration. Finally, a suitable vein was found and anastomosed to the one on the recipient side. The ear seemed to be completely viable once the problems of arterial blood supply and venous drainage were solved. A 4-year follow-up was conducted, and the result was satisfactory. The technique of transillumination is recommended in similar cases to solve the problem of venous drainage and to improve the survival rate of replanted ears.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^111aU8Ds]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) surgical options — shared decision grid compares watchful waiting, ear (tympanostomy) tube placement, and adenoidectomy across age limits, process, timing, benefits, risks, and long‑term expectations. Watchful waiting and ear tubes can be done at any age, but "Adenoidectomy is not recommended for age < 4 y for treating ear fluid that persists for at least 3 mo". Watchful waiting involves "Checking the eardrum every 3 to 6 mo in your doctor's office". Ear tube surgery "takes about 10 to 20 min and usually requires general anesthesia", while adenoidectomy "takes about 30 min and requires general anesthesia". Benefits include that ear tubes "Relieves fluid and hearing loss promptly and prevents relapse of fluid while the tube is in place and stays open", and adenoidectomy "reduces the need for future ear surgery", with "The chance that your child may need future ear tubes is reduced by about 50% after adenoidectomy". Risks for tubes include "About 1 in 4 children get an ear infection (drainage) that is treated with eardrops" and "About 2 or 3 in 100 children have a tiny hole in the eardrum that does not close after the tube falls out and may need surgery". Long‑term, "Most tubes fall out in about 12 to 18 mo" and "About 1 in every 4 children may need to have them replaced".

Naltrexone Implant Patient Information

What is Naltrexone Implant?

Naltrexone blocks the effects of narcotic medicines and alcohol.
Naltrexone implants are used to treat addiction to alcohol or narcotic drugs. It is also used to prevent narcotic addiction relapse.
Naltrexone Implants prevents the reward effects of opioids and alcohol with subsequent use.
Craving decrease substantially in those people on naltrexone, and that this craving reduction occurs very quickly, from the beginning of treatment (first 2–3 weeks) and doesn't seem to return after that. There are certainly people who continue to have cravings, but this is a rather small proportion and usually occurs only after coming off medication. Those who maintain treatment with naltrexone have no cravings, and some believe that combining naltrexone with personal recovery work in a 12-step based program is especially effective.
Naltrexone implants may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.

What are the possible side effects of naltrexone implant?

Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an allergic reaction: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.

Call your doctor at once if you have any of these serious side effects:

Blurred vision or eye problems
Fast heartbeat
Wheezing, difficulty breathing
Mood changes, hallucinations (seeing or hearing things), confusion, thoughts of hurting yourself
Nausea, stomach pain, low fever, loss of appetite, dark urine, clay-colored stools, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)
Ear pain, ringing in your ears
Feeling light-headed, fainting
Skin rash or itching
Pain, redness, bruising, itching, swelling, oozing, skin changes, or a hard lump where the medication was implanted

### Yellow nail syndrome resulting from cardiac mitral valve replacement [^113csf7D]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Yellow nail syndrome is a rare disease with unknown etiology, Attributed to functional anomalies or disturbance in lymphatic drainage. This condition is characterized by triad of nail discoloration, respiratory or intrathoracic manifestations and lymphedema.

Case presentation

Twenty days after mitral valve replacement for severe rheumatic mitral valve stenosis, 39 years old woman presented with face tenderness and hearing problems besides stuffy and clogged nose and underwent routin rhinosinusitis therapy. She came back to ears, nose and throat service with persistent rhinosinusitis as well as relapsing preoperative couphs and dyspnea besides lower extremities edema and toenails discoloration. After some modulations of treatment, she was introduced to pulmonary clinic on post -operative day = 30. Chest x ray showed a lot of left pleural effusion then she was returned to our service (cardiac surgery) on post- operative day = 33. The pigtail catheter was secured and we attained a significant amount of milky fluid which conformed with chylothorax. Finally Yellow nail syndrome was diagnosed with her on post–operative day = 35. Early conservative therapy such as bed rest, legs massage, low fat diet with medium chain triglycerides, diuretics, bronchodilator inhaler was not be able to satisfy us (chylous out put > 330 cc/d). Therefore the catheter replacement with chest tube was carried out followed by pleurodesis using Talc and doxycycline besides transition of oral intake to total parentral nutrition and vitamine E supplement, on post - operative day = 41. After that chylous leakage gradually subsided and patient was discharged to home on post- operative day = 47. At 4 weeks follow ups, chest x ray was clear without effusion and nails discoloration and legs lymphedema resolved.

Conclusion

We reported the third post cardiac surgery Yellow nail syndrome which is an unclear entity with a set of associated signs and symptoms. Two prior reports involved with coronary artery bypass graft whereas we performed mitral valve replacement.

### Connection between the inner ear and the lymphatic system [^115kQijx]. The Laryngoscope (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to identify the lymphatic drainage of the inner ear in guinea pigs.

Study Design

Prospective study.

Methods

The prospective study was performed in guinea pigs by injection of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) into either the right-side scala tympani or the middle ear cavity. The left side was not injected and served as a control. Fifteen minutes after injection, the animals were killed by intracardiac perfusion with paraformaldehyde and tissue specimens (right and left temporal bones, cervical lymph nodes, and the spleen) were collected. The presence of KLH in each specimen was determined by immunohistochemical assay of frozen sections using polyclonal mouse anti-KLH antibodies.

Results

After injection into the middle ear, labeled cells were identified in the parotid, superficial ventral, mandibular, and deep cranial cervical lymph nodes. However, after inner ear injections KLH was present in only the parotid and superficial ventral cervical nodes. The spleen contained KLH-positive cells following injection into either the middle or inner ear, but not all animals contained labeled spleen cells.

Conclusions

The inner ear has a connection to the lymphatic drainage system. Because fewer lymph nodes contained labeled cells after inner ear injection than after middle ear injection, it is concluded that the inner ear does not simply drain to the middle ear and subsequently to the lymph nodes but seems likely to have its own connections.

### Successful treatment of pyoderma vegetans with doxycycline [^116ThH3E]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 93-year–old Caucasian man presented to a dermatology clinic with a rapidly enlarging rash involving both his armpits, face, and inguinal folds over the past 2 months. He exhibited mild associated pruritus. A review of systems was negative for gastrointestinal symptoms. Medical history was significant for hypertension, with no personal or family history of inflammatory bowel disease or hematologic malignancy. His last colonoscopy, 8 years prior to presentation, was unremarkable. Physical examination revealed pink verrucous papules and nodules coalescing into thick plaques with overlying yellow scale crust, pinpoint pustules, and yellow caseous drainage in his armpits (Fig 1, A), cheeks, ears, and right inguinal fold (Fig 2, A). No intact vesicles or bullae were noted. The initial differential diagnosis included pemphigus vegetans, PDV, vegetative Hailey-Hailey disease, and an atypical mycobacterial infection.

Routine workup, including complete blood counts with leukocyte differential, complete metabolic panel, and T-SPOT, was normal, with the exception of peripheral blood eosinophilia of 1069 cells/μL. Axillary wound cultures revealed Staphylococcus aureus susceptible to tetracycline. Histopathologic examination demonstrated eosinophilic spongiosis, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and subcorneal pustules containing eosinophils and neutrophils, narrowing the differential diagnosis to PDV versus pemphigus vegetans (Figs 3 and 4, A and B). However, direct immunofluorescence for IgG, IgA, immunoglobulin M, C3, and fibrin was negative. Indirect immunofluorescence on monkey esophagus for anti-intercellular and antibasement membrane zone IgG and IgG4 was also negative, favoring the diagnosis of PDV. The patient was started on doxycycline 100 mg twice daily as well as desonide 0.05% ointment to the face and mupirocin 2% ointment to the axillae.

### Doc, just cut my ears off – A case report of Actinomyces in bilateral chronic auricular chondritis [^115tSxDR]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Discussion

Piercing of auricular cartilage may result in injury to the cartilage and its supporting structures. Necrosis, abscess formation, and loss of cartilage are potential complications that may demand surgical intervention. Treatment options include antibiotic therapy, drainage, and debridement, but despite intervention, cosmetic defects may result.

When considering a differential diagnosis for patients with bilateral otalgia that spares the lobule, relapsing polychondritis is of chief relevance. This patient underwent extensive rheumatologic evaluation with unremarkable serum inflammatory markers. Cellulitis remained lower on the differential diagnosis because the lobule was spared, which theoretically implicated the cartilage and its supportive structures. That said, the bilateral nature of this patient's presentation posed a unique diagnostic challenge.

Actinomyces is an indolent, suppurative granulomatous infection caused by a facultative anaerobic organism that may exist in natural healthy oral flora. These organisms grow in tight clusters called sulfur granules that are typically yellow in appearance. The patient's complaint of focal yellow draining pits is what initially led to suspicion of Actinomyces infection.

Actinomyces organisms are particularly difficult to culture; thus, culture negativity may not entirely exclude the diagnosis. However, once a diagnosis is confirmed with bacterial culture, long‐term treatment with high‐dose penicillin derivatives is recommended, with alternative options including erythromycin, clindamycin, or tetracyclines. Despite long‐term antibiosis, recurrence or resistance may occur, and permanent eradication may require an even longer secondary antibiotic regimen or surgical source control.

To date, no cases in the literature have described bilateral chronic perichondritis which speciated actinomyces. Cervicofacial actinomyces is typically an indolent infection, which usually does not present with severe pain, this case highlights a particularly morbid infectious etiology of auricular chondritis, which resulted in a protracted treatment course demanding longitudinal multidisciplinary care and ultimately an aggressive surgical solution.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^116FEFKh]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes — when to call the ear doctor (otolaryngologist) is specified as when your child's regular doctor or health care provider can't see the tube in the ear, or the tube is blocked; when your child has a hearing loss, continued ear infections or continued ear pain/discomfort; when ear drainage continues for more than 7–10 days without improvement with treatment; when drainage from the ear occurs frequently or more than you think should happen; or when there is wax build-up in the ear canal that doesn't allow the tube to be seen.

### Incision and drainage followed by mattress suture repair of auricular hematoma [^1126rNvU]. The Laryngoscope (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Auricular hematoma is a condition requiring early and effective management to prevent pathogenesis of the unsightly cauliflower ear. The objective of this study is to review cases of auricular hematoma and present incision and drainage followed by through-and-through whip-type absorbable mattress sutures without bolsters as an effective treatment.

Study Design

Retrospective chart review of auricular hematoma cases.

Methods

A 5-year retrospective evaluation of auricular hematomas presenting to an otolaryngology group was performed. Patients' charts were reviewed and data regarding the treatment and follow-up of auricular hematomas were assembled and analyzed.

Results

Twenty-two patients were found to present with auricular hematoma. One patient was lost to follow-up. Twenty-eight treatments were performed on 23 ears. Seven hematomas were treated with needle aspiration, two were treated with incision and drainage with iodoform wick placement, and 19 were treated with incision and drainage followed by absorbable mattress sutures. There were five hematoma reaccumulations requiring an additional procedure after treatment by an otolaryngologist. Three followed needle drainage; one followed incision and drainage with wick placement, and one followed incision and drainage with absorbable mattress sutures.

Conclusion

Incision and drainage followed by through-and-through absorbable mattress sutures appears to be a superior method of treatment with rare reaccumulation of hematoma. This method of treatment was shown to be simple and well tolerated, and it had few complications.

### Adenoid hypertrophy in children: a narrative review of pathogenesis and clinical relevance [^11437RZ8]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Otitis media with effusion

OME is defined as a condition where fluid in the tympanic cavity accumulates when there are no features of acute otitis media present. It occurs while the continuity of the eardrum membrane is preserved. Local inflammation leads to metaplasia of the epithelium lining the tympanic cavity and to an accumulation of fluid within the middle ear. The exudate is mucinous or serous-mucous. Persistent OME refers to a situation when symptoms last for at least 3 months.OME may be asymptomatic, or patients may experience various forms of ear discomfort, hearing loss, tinnitus, dizziness or a feeling of fullness in the ear. The otoscopic picture may vary depending on the nature and duration that the fluid is present. Its most common symptoms are a thickening of the eardrum with a yellowish or amber tint, or bruising to the eardrum with a bright white colouration. Persistent ear effusion leads to permanent changes in the tympanic membrane structure which intensify due to being exposed to prolonged negative pressure. Untreated exudate may lead to irreversible consequences, such as calcification and/or atelectasis of the tympanic membrane, the formation of retraction pockets, tympanosclerosis and cholesteatoma. Permanent conductive hearing loss, which may occur due to the presence of middle ear fluid, usually leads to delayed or impaired speech development, communication difficulties, limited vocabulary, disturbances in attention and lower academic performance.

The pathophysiology of OME in children is complex. It includes specific host, environmental, genetic and social risk factors. The relatively higher prevalence of OME in children compared with adults is thought to be related to the immaturity of the eustachian tube (ET). The eustachian tube is shorter and more horizontal in children. Additionally, its cartilage is more dense with less elastin in children compared with adults. Moreover, the mucosal lining of the children's ET is thicker and more folded. Also, lymphoid tissue aggregation that built the tubal tonsil is more developed in children. Bacteria accumulating in the nasal cavity explains the increased risk of ear infections, nevertheless, conventional microbiological tests on middle ear exudates do not always show bacterial growth. The sensitivity of bacterial detection in middle ear infections has been improved thanks to the introduction of the PCR technique. This method is useful in detecting slowly growing pathogens that are difficult to culture in a diagnostic lab.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^113nWtig]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guideline for cerumen impaction — scope and target population notes that the target patient for this guideline is > 6 months of age with a clinical diagnosis of cerumen impaction. The primary purpose is to help clinicians identify patients with cerumen impaction who may benefit from intervention and to promote evidence-based management, with another purpose to highlight needs and management options in special populations or in patients who have modifying factors; the secondary goal includes creating a guideline suitable for deriving a performance measure on cerumen impaction. This update is needed due to the time since the original publication and to the presence of new evidence, and it is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with cerumen impaction and applies to any setting in which cerumen impaction would be identified, monitored, or managed. The guideline does not apply to patients with cerumen impaction associated with the following conditions: dermatologic.

### Interventions for children with ear discharge occurring at least two weeks following grommet (ventilation tube) insertion [^115g7mra]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ear discharge (otorrhoea) is common in children with grommets (ventilation/tympanostomy tubes); the proportion of children developing discharge ranges from 25% to 75%. The most common treatment strategies include oral broad-spectrum antibiotics, antibiotic eardrops or those containing a combination of antibiotic(s) and a corticosteroid, and initial observation. Important drivers for one strategy over the other are concerns over the side effects of oral antibiotics and the potential ototoxicity of antibiotic eardrops.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of current treatment strategies for children with ear discharge occurring at least two weeks following grommet (ventilation tube) insertion.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register, CENTRAL (2016, Issue 5), multiple databases and additional sources for published and unpublished trials (search date 23 June 2016).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing at least two of the following: oral antibiotics, oral corticosteroids, antibiotic eardrops (with or without corticosteroid), corticosteroid eardrops, microsuction cleaning of the ear canal, saline rinsing of the ear canal, placebo or no treatment. The main comparison of interest was antibiotic eardrops (with or without corticosteroid) versus oral antibiotics.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were: proportion of children with resolution of ear discharge at short-term follow-up (less than two weeks), adverse events and serious complications. Secondary outcomes were: proportion of children with resolution of ear discharge at intermediate- (two to four weeks) and long-term (four to 12 weeks) follow-up, proportion of children with resolution of ear pain and fever at short-term follow-up, duration of ear discharge, proportion of children with chronic ear discharge, ear discharge recurrences, tube blockage, tube extrusion, health-related quality of life and hearing. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included nine studies, evaluating a range of treatments, with 2132 children who developed acute ear discharge beyond the immediate postoperative period. We judged the risk of bias to be low to moderate in most studies. Antibiotic eardrops (with or without corticosteroid) versus oral antibioticsAntibiotic eardrops with or without corticosteroid were more effective than oral antibiotics in terms of:- resolution of discharge at one week (one study, 42 children, ciprofloxacin eardrops versus amoxicillin: 77% versus 30%; risk ratio (RR) 2.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 5.22; moderate-quality evidence);- resolution of discharge at two weeks (one study, 153 children, bacitracin-colistin-hydrocortisone eardrops versus amoxicillin-clavulanate: 95% versus 56%; RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.08; moderate-quality evidence);- duration of discharge (two studies, 233 children, ciprofloxacin eardrops versus amoxicillin: median 4 days versus 7 days and bacitracin-colistin-hydrocortisone eardrops versus amoxicillin-clavulanate: 4 days versus 5 days; moderate-quality evidence);- ear discharge recurrences (one study, 148 children, bacitracin-colistin-hydrocortisone eardrops versus amoxicillin-clavulanate: 0 versus 1 episode at six months; low-quality evidence); and- disease-specific quality of life (one study, 153 children, bacitracin-colistin-hydrocortisone eardrops versus amoxicillin-clavulanate: difference in change in median Otitis Media-6 total score (range 6 to 42) at two weeks: -2; low-quality evidence). We found no evidence that antibiotic eardrops were more effective in terms of the proportion of children developing chronic ear discharge or tube blockage, generic quality of life or hearing. Adverse events occurred at similar rates in children treated with antibiotic eardrops and those treated with oral antibiotics, while no serious complications occurred in either of the groups. Other comparisons(a) Antibiotic eardrops with or without corticosteroid were more effective thancorticosteroid eardrops in terms of:- duration of ear discharge (one study, 331 children, ciprofloxacin versus ciprofloxacin-fluocinolone acetonide versus fluocinolone acetonide eardrops: median 5 days versus 7 days versus 22 days; moderate-quality evidence).(b) Antibiotic eardrops were more effective than saline rinsing of the ear canal in terms of:- resolution of ear discharge at one week (one study, 48 children, ciprofloxacin eardrops versus saline rinsing: 77% versus 46%; RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.69; moderate-quality evidence); but not in terms of tube blockage. Since the lower limit of the 95% CI for the effect size for resolution of ear discharge at one week approaches unity, a trivial or clinically irrelevant difference cannot be excluded.(c) Eardrops containing two antibiotics and a corticosteroid (bacitracin-colistin-hydrocortisone) were more effective than no treatment in terms of:- resolution of discharge at two weeks (one study; 151 children: 95% versus 45%; RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.62 to 2.69; moderate-quality evidence);- duration of discharge (one study; 147 children, median 4 days versus 12 days; moderate-quality evidence);- chronic discharge (one study; 147 children; RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.62; low-quality evidence); and- disease-specific quality of life (one study, 153 children, difference in change in median Otitis Media-6 total score (range 6 to 42) between groups at two weeks: -1.5; low-quality evidence). We found no evidence that antibiotic eardrops were more effective in terms of ear discharge recurrences or generic quality of life.(d) Eardrops containing a combination of an antibiotic and a corticosteroid were more effective than eardrops containing antibiotics (low-quality evidence) in terms of:- resolution of ear discharge at short-term follow-up (two studies, 590 children: 35% versus 20%; RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.31); and- duration of discharge (three studies, 813 children); but not in terms of resolution of discharge at intermediate-term follow-up or proportion of children with tube blockage. However, there is a substantial risk of publication bias, therefore these findings should be interpreted with caution.

Authors' Conclusions

We found moderate to low-quality evidence that antibiotic eardrops (with or without corticosteroid) are more effective than oral antibiotics, corticosteroid eardrops and no treatment in children with ear discharge occurring at least two weeks following grommet insertion. There is some limited, inconclusive evidence that antibiotic eardrops are more effective than saline rinsing. There is uncertainty whether antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops are more effective than eardrops containing antibiotics only.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^1156Q5DX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) with structural damage — The text states individuals "should have prompt tympanostomy tube insertion when there is real or impending structural damage to the tympanic membrane caused by retraction (from negative middle ear pressure) or collapse (from atrophy or atelectasis)". It adds, "Although there are no randomized trials to support this approach, inserting the tube will equalize middle ear pressure and eliminate middle ear effusion, which may help avoid more extensive otologic surgery for ears with retraction pockets, atelectasis, or early signs of cholesteatoma".

### A case report of chronic dacryocystitis caused by nasal stones [^116VtC7z]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

An 84-year-old male patient presented with lacrimal discharge and purulent discharge in his right eye for more than 1 month without any obvious cause. Later, the patient came to our hospital for treatment due to aggravation of the symptoms and was admitted to the hospital with chronic dacryocystitis of the right eye. On admission, the patient showed persistent tearing and purulent discharge from the right eye with a localized cystic bulge in the lacrimal sac area. The patient underwent lacrimal duct irrigation and inserted the needle from the upper lacrimal punctum of the right eye. The flushing liquid flowed back from the lower lacrimal punctum, accompanied by a large amount of purulent secretions. Lacrimal duct CT angiography showed the following a high-density shadow in the right lacrimal sac area and a soft-tissue-density shadow in the right nasal cavity, including a high-density shadow. Nasal endoscopy revealed many yellow‒white nasal calculus-like foreign bodies in the right common and inferior nasal meatus (Fig. 1).
