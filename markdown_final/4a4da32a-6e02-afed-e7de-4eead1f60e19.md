## Question

Would you omit completion ALND for a woman with invasive breast cancer and a positive sentinel lymph node if she otherwise matches the ACOSOG Z0011 cohort, based on the 10-year results? Justify your answer.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be omitted for a woman with invasive breast cancer and a positive sentinel lymph node who otherwise matches the ACOSOG Z0011 cohort, and how the 10-year results justify that decision. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact Z0011 eligibility criteria and whether the patient fits them. Then, I should verify the 10-year outcomes and whether they meet noninferiority. Next, I will review regional recurrence and disease-free survival to ensure oncologic safety. After that, I need to check guideline positions and corroborating trials. Finally, I will consider exceptions and edge cases before synthesizing a recommendation with shared decision-making in mind.

> Let me first confirm the Z0011 inclusion criteria so I don't jump to conclusions: clinical T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer, no palpable axillary nodes, 1 or 2 positive sentinel nodes, planned breast-conserving surgery with whole-breast irradiation, and adjuvant systemic therapy as indicated. Patients with more than 2 positive nodes, matted nodes, gross extranodal extension, or prior neoadjuvant therapy were excluded, so I need to ensure none of those apply here [^113ThdMS] [^112FF4sd].

> Now, I should verify the 10-year outcomes. The 2017 JAMA publication reports a median follow-up of 9.3 years and shows 10-year overall survival of 86.3% with sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) alone versus 83.6% with ALND, with a hazard ratio of 0.85 and a one-sided 95% CI that meets the prespecified noninferiority margin, indicating SLND alone is noninferior to ALND for overall survival in this population [^113ThdMS] [^115ACcX8].

> Wait, let me verify regional control because survival might mask locoregional differences. The 10-year cumulative ipsilateral axillary recurrence was 0.5% with ALND and 1.5% with SLND alone, and the 10-year locoregional recurrence was 6.2% with ALND versus 5.3% with SLND alone, with no statistically significant differences, which reassures me that regional control is excellent even without completion ALND in this setting [^114tB2xX] [^114hR8go].

> I should confirm disease-free survival as well. The 10-year disease-free survival was 80.2% with SLND alone versus 78.2% with ALND, again with no significant difference, supporting the conclusion that omitting ALND does not compromise disease control in appropriately selected patients [^113ThdMS] [^115ACcX8].

> Next, I should review guideline alignment so I'm not over-extrapolating. ASCO's 2025 update explicitly recommends not recommending ALND for patients with early-stage, clinically node-negative disease who have 1–2 positive sentinel nodes and will receive breast-conserving surgery with whole-breast radiotherapy, citing high-quality evidence and a strong recommendation, which aligns with the Z0011 data and its long-term follow-up [^112232P7] [^116EeiiV]. NCCN similarly supports omission of ALND in this exact scenario, reinforcing the practice standard [^117Dxnur] [^112SXbdw].

> Hold on, I should verify corroborating evidence beyond Z0011. The SENOMAC randomized trial, published in 2024, demonstrated that omitting completion ALND was noninferior to ALND for recurrence-free survival in patients with 1–2 sentinel-node macrometastases, most of whom received nodal radiation, which strengthens the external validity of the de-escalation approach in this risk stratum [^115wGUzD]. The AMAROS trial also showed equivalent regional control with axillary radiotherapy compared with ALND, with less lymphedema, supporting radiation-based strategies when ALND is omitted [^113FqgxF].

> But wait, what if the patient has features that fall outside Z0011? I need to ensure we don't overgeneralize. Exclusions include more than 2 positive nodes, matted nodes, gross extranodal extension, T3/T4 tumors, inflammatory breast cancer, prior neoadjuvant therapy, or mastectomy without planned regional nodal irradiation; in those settings, ALND may still be indicated or regional nodal irradiation considered, so I should double-check that none of these apply before recommending omission of ALND [^117Dxnur] [^112SXbdw] [^116ixuij].

> I should also consider patient-specific modifiers. Younger age, ER-negative status, and lack of systemic therapy were associated with worse overall survival in subgroup analyses, so even though Z0011 supports omission of ALND in eligible patients, I need to discuss these risk factors and consider multidisciplinary input and shared decision-making, especially if the patient prefers a more aggressive regional approach or if adjuvant therapy plans would change with more complete nodal information [^114hR8go] [^112232P7].

> Let me think about morbidity trade-offs because that matters clinically. ALND carries a substantially higher risk of lymphedema and other arm morbidities compared with SLNB alone, and avoiding ALND reduces these risks without compromising oncologic outcomes in Z0011-eligible patients, which strengthens the case for omission when criteria are met [^115E21CT] [^111ABT2m].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. If the patient truly meets all Z0011 criteria — T1–T2 tumor, clinically node-negative, 1–2 positive sentinel nodes, planned breast-conserving surgery with whole-breast irradiation, and adjuvant systemic therapy as indicated — then yes, completion ALND should be omitted because the 10-year data demonstrate noninferior overall survival, excellent regional control, and no detriment in disease-free survival, and this is supported by contemporary guidelines and corroborating randomized trials [^113ThdMS] [^112232P7] [^115wGUzD].

Based on the 10-year ACOSOG Z0011 results, **completion ALND can be safely omitted** for women with invasive breast cancer and 1–2 positive sentinel nodes who meet Z0011 criteria (cT1–2, cN0, BCS with whole-breast RT, no neoadjuvant therapy) because 10-year overall survival (86.3% vs 83.6%) and locoregional recurrence (5.3% vs 6.2%) are noninferior with SLND alone compared with ALND [^113ThdMS] [^114tB2xX]. ALND should still be considered for patients with **≥ 3 positive nodes**, **extranodal extension**, or those undergoing mastectomy without planned regional nodal irradiation, as these were not included in Z0011 [^117Dxnur] [^112SXbdw].

---

## Key findings from the 10-year ACOSOG Z0011 trial

- **Overall survival**: 10-year OS was 86.3% with SLND alone vs 83.6% with ALND (HR 0.85; 95% CI, 0–1.16; noninferiority P = 0.02) [^113ThdMS] [^115ACcX8].

- **Disease-free survival**: 10-year DFS was 80.2% with SLND alone vs 78.2% with ALND (HR 0.85; 95% CI, 0.62–1.17; P = 0.32) [^113ThdMS] [^115ACcX8].

- **Locoregional recurrence**: 10-year cumulative LRR was 5.3% with SLND alone vs 6.2% with ALND (P = 0.36) [^114tB2xX] [^114hR8go].

- **Axillary recurrence**: 10-year isolated axillary recurrence was 1.5% with SLND alone vs 0.5% with ALND (P = 0.28) [^114tB2xX] [^114hR8go].

---

## Clinical implications and guidelines

Current guidelines from ASCO, NCCN, and ASTRO align with Z0011 and recommend **omitting completion ALND** for patients who meet the following criteria:

- **Clinical T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer**: Tumor size ≤ 5 cm.

- **Clinically node-negative axilla**: No palpable axillary nodes.

- **One or two positive sentinel lymph nodes**: Limited nodal disease.

- **Planned breast-conserving surgery with whole-breast radiotherapy**: Standard adjuvant therapy.

- **No prior neoadjuvant therapy**: Upfront surgery cohort.

---

## Limitations and considerations

While the 10-year Z0011 results are robust, certain scenarios require **individualized decision-making**:

- **Mastectomy patients**: Z0011 excluded mastectomy; evidence supports omitting ALND when postmastectomy regional nodal irradiation is planned, but this extrapolates from AMAROS and SENOMAC rather than Z0011 [^116ixuij] [^115wGUzD].

- **Extranodal extension**: Associated with higher residual nodal burden; ALND may be considered despite Z0011 criteria.

- **Three or more positive sentinel nodes**: Outside Z0011; ALND is generally recommended.

- **Neoadjuvant therapy**: Z0011 excluded this group; management should follow contemporary neoadjuvant-era guidance.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

For a woman with invasive breast cancer and 1–2 positive sentinel nodes who otherwise matches the Z0011 cohort, **completion ALND should be omitted** because 10-year outcomes show noninferior survival and low locoregional recurrence with SLND alone. ALND remains indicated for those with ≥ 3 positive nodes, extranodal extension, or mastectomy without planned regional nodal irradiation, and decisions should be individualized for borderline cases.

### Effect of axillary dissection vs No axillary dissection on 10-year overall survival among women with invasive breast cancer and sentinel node metastasis: the ACOSOG Z0011 (alliance) randomized clinical trial [^113ThdMS]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The results of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 (ACOSOG Z0011) trial were first reported in 2005 with a median follow-up of 6.3 years. Longer follow-up was necessary because the majority of the patients had estrogen receptor-positive tumors that may recur later in the disease course (the ACOSOG is now part of the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology).

Objective

To determine whether the 10-year overall survival of patients with sentinel lymph node metastases treated with breast-conserving therapy and sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) alone without axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is noninferior to that of women treated with axillary dissection.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The ACOSOG Z0011 phase 3 randomized clinical trial enrolled patients from May 1999 to December 2004 at 115 sites (both academic and community medical centers). The last date of follow-up was September 29, 2015, in the ACOSOG Z0011 (Alliance) trial. Eligible patients were women with clinical T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer, no palpable axillary adenopathy, and 1 or 2 sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases.

Interventions

All patients had planned lumpectomy, planned tangential whole-breast irradiation, and adjuvant systemic therapy. Third-field radiation was prohibited.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was overall survival with a noninferiority hazard ratio (HR) margin of 1.3. The secondary outcome was disease-free survival.

Results

Among 891 women who were randomized (median age, 55 years), 856 (96%) completed the trial (446 in the SLND alone group and 445 in the ALND group). At a median follow-up of 9.3 years (interquartile range, 6.93–10.34 years), the 10-year overall survival was 86.3% in the SLND alone group and 83.6% in the ALND group (HR, 0.85 [1-sided 95% CI, 0–1.16]; noninferiority P = 0.02). The 10-year disease-free survival was 80.2% in the SLND alone group and 78.2% in the ALND group (HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.62–1.17]; P = 0.32). Between year 5 and year 10, 1 regional recurrence was seen in the SLND alone group vs none in the ALND group. Ten-year regional recurrence did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among women with T1 or T2 invasive primary breast cancer, no palpable axillary adenopathy, and 1 or 2 sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases, 10-year overall survival for patients treated with sentinel lymph node dissection alone was noninferior to overall survival for those treated with axillary lymph node dissection. These findings do not support routine use of axillary lymph node dissection in this patient population based on 10-year outcomes.

### To do or not to do: axillary nodal evaluation after ACOSOG Z0011 trial [^113BHorF]. Radiographics (2014). Low credibility.

Methods of axillary evaluation in invasive breast cancer continue to evolve. The recent American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 Trial is a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial that compared the survival and locoregional recurrence rates after complete axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) versus sentinel node biopsy (SNB) alone in women with a positive sentinel node in an effort to avoid the complications associated with ALND. As the results of this trial are implemented clinically, affecting surgical management of axillary metastatic disease, radiologists may need to redefine their role in the preoperative assessment of the axilla. Before the Z0011 trial, breast imagers worked to identify axillary metastases preoperatively, allowing appropriate patients to proceed directly to ALND and avoiding the need for SNB. However, the Z0011 trial concluded that ALND may not be necessary in women with metastatic axillary disease who meet the trial criteria. In the Z0011 trial, after 6 years of median follow-up there was no difference in either locoregional recurrence or survival among the women who underwent SNB alone compared with those who underwent ALND, suggesting that ALND is unnecessary in a subset of women with a positive node at SNB. These results raise questions about how aggressively radiologists should pursue percutaneous sampling of axillary nodes, as some practitioners conclude that, in an otherwise eligible woman, positive results from imaging-guided percutaneous biopsy preclude a Z0011 trial-directed pathway. Debate about the best way to implement the results of the Z0011 trial into daily clinical practice exists. It is important for breast imagers to work closely with breast surgeons to provide the most appropriate treatment course for each patient.

### Research gaps in sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer [^111fGXDM]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

What should the breast surgeon do if he has positive one out of one or 2 out of 2 sentinel nodes?

The ACOSOG Z0011 trial was a practice-changing study that paved the way to limiting the role of ALND in patients who met all of the following criteria: only one or 2 positive sentinel nodes, small tumors, did not receive neoadjuvant therapy, and underwent breast-conserving therapy with planned postoperative axillary irradiation. Recently, the guidelines were expanded to include patients who underwent mastectomy as well. Many surgeons worldwide have adopted the Z0011 policy and omit ALND when there are one or 2 positive LNs out of 2 or more total nodes excised.

However, breast surgeons may face ambiguous situations with no clear answers based on existing evidence, eg, what if a patient has positive one out of one or 2 out of 2 dissected sentinel nodes? Should the surgeon stick literally to the Z0011 criteria and omit ALND accepting the risk that there could be additional positive axillary nodes, or should he pursue ALND carrying the risk that all the excised LNs may be negative for malignancy and exposing the patient to unnecessary complications of ALND?

Further research should be conducted to include this category of patients and compare the surgical and oncological outcomes in patients with 1/1 or 2/2 positive LNs on SLNB when they undergo completion versus omission of ALND.

### Is completion axillary lymph node dissection necessary in patients who are underrepresented in the ACOSOG Z0011 trial? [^114meJQV]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group trial Z0011 demonstrated that axillary node dissection (ALND) can be omitted in patients managed with breast conserving surgery and 1 to 2 positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) without adverse effects on locoregional recurrence or disease-free survival (DFS). We investigated patients with breast cancer for whom clinicopathologic features were underrepresented in the Z0011 trial and analyzed radiation therapy treatment patterns and clinical outcomes.

Methods and materials

We retrospectively reviewed records of patients who underwent a lumpectomy and SLN biopsy with positive SLNs but not an ALND and completed adjuvant radiation therapy. Eligible patients had T3 tumors, > 2 positive SLNs, invasive lobular carcinoma, estrogen receptor negative status, extranodal extension, Nottingham Grade 3, or were age < 50 years.

Results

We identified 105 women treated between July 2011 and July 2016 with a median follow-up time of 48.5 months (Range, 11–83 months). There were 40 women with an extranodal extension (38.9%) and 42 women with grade 3 disease (40.0%). Nineteen patients received whole breast irradiation alone (18.1%) and 86 patients were treated with modified tangent fields including the superior axilla level I/II (81.9%). Thirty-three patients (31.4%) also received a 3 rd supraclavicular, nodal-directed field. Among the 86 patients who received axillary nodal irradiation, nodal volume contouring was performed in 77 patients (89.5%). Fifty-one patients (48.6%) also received adjuvant chemotherapy. The overall rates of 4-year DFS and locoregional control (LRC) were 94.3% and 98.1%, respectively. Off all patients, 1 patient experienced an internal mammary nodal recurrence, another patient a contralateral breast tumor, and two patients distant metastases. There were no axillary or ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences.

Conclusions

This retrospective analysis of women who were underrepresented or excluded from the Z11 trial and underwent a lumpectomy and SLN biopsy with positive SLNs demonstrated comparable rates of LRC and DFS. The high rates of LRC and DFS suggest that completion ALND may be safely omitted in this patient population but larger data sets and longer follow-up times are needed to confirm this finding.

### Axillary dissection vs no axillary dissection in women with invasive breast cancer and sentinel node metastasis: a randomized clinical trial [^112FF4sd]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

The study ACOSOG Z0011 (5-year survival) was published by Giuliano AE and colleagues in 2011 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Breast cancer. In the ACOSOG Z0011 (5-year survival) study, the trial question was: is sentinel lymph node dissection noninferior to axillary lymph node dissection in female patients with clinical T1-T2 invasive breast cancer? In the ACOSOG Z0011 (5-year survival) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ACOSOG Z0011 (5-year survival) study, the population was: 891 female patients. The inclusion criteria were female patients with clinical T1-T2 invasive breast cancer, no palpable adenopathy, and 1 to 2 sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases. The key exclusion criteria were metastases identified initially or solely with immunohistochemical staining, ≥ 3 positive SLNs, matted nodes, gross extranodal disease, or receipt of neoadjuvant hormonal or chemotherapy. In the ACOSOG Z0011 (5-year survival) study, the interventions were: n = 446 sentinel lymph node dissection (no further axillary-specific intervention) n = 445 complete axillary lymph node dissection (dissection of ≥ 10 nodes). In the ACOSOG Z0011 (5-year survival) study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in overall survival at 5 years (92.5% vs. 91.8%; HR 0.79, 90% CI 0.56 to 1.1). In the ACOSOG Z0011 (5-year survival) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in disease-free survival at 5 years (83.9% vs. 82.2%; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.17) No significant difference in local recurrence at 5 years (1.6% vs. 3.1%; RR 0.51, 95% CI -0.12 to 1.14) No significant difference in locoregional recurrence-free survival at 5 years (96.7% vs. 95.7%; RR 1.01, 95% CI -0.81 to 2.83). In the ACOSOG Z0011 (5-year survival) study, the conclusion was: in female patients with clinical T1-T2 invasive breast cancer, no palpable adenopathy, and 1 to 2 sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases, sentinel lymph node dissection was noninferior to complete axillary lymph node dissection with respect to overall survival at 5 years.

### Oncological safety of skipping axillary lymph node dissection in patients with clinical N0, sentinel node-positive breast cancer undergoing total mastectomy [^113FqgxF]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

The presence of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) is one of the most important factors governing treatment decisions in patients with breast cancer. Following the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial, surgery for breast cancer has trended toward less invasive axillary surgery for patients presenting limited metastatic SLN involvement. – According to the Z0011 trial, survival results of patients without axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) were non-inferior to those of patients who underwent ALND. Notably, the Z0011 trial included patients with one to two SLNs who received breast-conserving surgery, whole-breast irradiation, and adjuvant systemic treatment. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines have adapted these results to omit ALND for patients with SLN metastases meeting the same criteria.

It is widely accepted that a less invasive strategy for axillary nodal management can spare a subset of patients from potentially harmful and persistent morbidity associated with ALND. Compared with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone, ALND has been associated with complications, including lymphedema of the affected arm, wound infection, axillary seroma, and paresthesia. Approximately 75% of patients who undergo ALND reportedly exhibit at least one complication, in contrast to 25% of those who undergo SLNB alone. Thus, avoiding short- and long-term adverse effects of ALND in appropriate candidates could substantially impact the quality of life of patients.

Axillary radiation therapy (RT) has been evaluated in several studies to determine whether it could produce comparable effects to ALND. The AMAROS trial prospectively compared ALND and axillary RT in patients with T1–T2 primary breast cancer without palpable lymphadenopathy and SLN metastases. The authors reported that ALND or axillary radiation could afford effective and comparable regional control in terms of the 5 year axillary recurrence rate. Furthermore, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) did not differ substantially between the two groups; however, the difference in the rate of arm lymphedema was statistically significant in favor of axillary RT. Patients who underwent total mastectomy (TM) comprised 18% of the eligible cohort in the AMAROS trial. Accordingly, the omission of ALND has gradually increased in patients with SLNs undergoing TM in recent years. However, the oncologic safety of skipping ALND in patients undergoing TM remains debatable, given that the AMAROS trial was underpowered and included a limited proportion of patients who underwent TM.

### Is completion axillary lymph node dissection necessary in patients who are underrepresented in the ACOSOG Z0011 trial? [^114M6ZX3]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) trial Z11 demonstrated that axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be omitted in patients with breast cancer who undergo breast conserving surgery after positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) without compromising disease outcomes. The results from the trial demonstrated no significant differences in locoregional recurrence (LRR), disease-free survival (DFS), or overall survival (OS) after SLNB alone versus completion ALND in patients with clinical T1 to T2 N0 invasive breast cancer who present with 1 to 2 positive SLNs.

However, translating these results into clinical practice is complicated by the inconsistent use of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) fields in the study. Fifty percent of patients with available treatment data received high tangent fields that covered the superior level I and II axillary nodes and 15% of patients were treated with a 3 rd level III and supraclavicular nodal (SCN)-directed field. This complicates the interpretation of the data because the contribution of nodal irradiation to the noninferiority of SLNB alone compared with ALND is not clear. For instance, the After Mapping of the Axilla: Radiotherapy or Surgery? (AMAROS) trial demonstrated that regional nodal irradiation (RNI) after positive SLNB can provide similar disease control outcomes as ALND with improved morbidity. Furthermore, the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) MA.20 and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 22922 studies showed significant improvements in DFS after RNI in node-positive or high-risk patients.

### Effect of axillary dissection vs No axillary dissection on 10-year overall survival among women with invasive breast cancer and sentinel node metastasis: the ACOSOG Z0011 (alliance) randomized clinical trial [^115ACcX8]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study ACOSOG Z0011 (10-year survival) was published by Armando E Giuliano and colleagues in 2017 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Breast cancer. In the ACOSOG Z0011 (10-year survival) study, the trial question was: is sentinel lymph node dissection noninferior to axillary lymph node dissection in patients with invasive breast cancer and sentinel lymph node metastasis? In the ACOSOG Z0011 (10-year survival) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ACOSOG Z0011 (10-year survival) study, the population was: 891 female patients. The inclusion criteria were women with clinical T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer, no palpable axillary adenopathy, and 1 or 2 sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases. The key exclusion criteria were lactation; previous treatment with chemotherapy; estrogen receptor antagonists or selective estrogen receptor modulators; concurrent invasive bilateral breast malignancies; previous ipsilateral axillary surgery. In the ACOSOG Z0011 (10-year survival) study, the interventions were: n = 446 sentinel lymph node dissection (sentinel lymph node dissection alone without axillary lymph node dissection) n = 445 axillary lymph node dissection (axillary lymph node dissection followed by whole breast irradiation). In the ACOSOG Z0011 (10-year survival) study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in overall survival at 10 year follow-up (86.3% vs. 83.6%; HR 0.85, 95% CI 0 to 1.16). In the ACOSOG Z0011 (10-year survival) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in disease-free survival at 10 years (80.2% vs. 78.2%; HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.61) No significant difference in locoregional relapse-free survival at 10 years (83% vs. 81.2%; HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.61). In the ACOSOG Z0011 (10-year survival) study, the conclusion was: in women with clinical T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer, no palpable axillary adenopathy, and 1 or 2 sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases, sentinel lymph node dissection was noninferior to axillary lymph node dissection with respect to overall survival at 10 year follow-up.

### Axillary dissection vs no axillary dissection in women with invasive breast cancer and sentinel node metastasis: a randomized clinical trial [^115cqFJF]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Context

Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) accurately identifies nodal metastasis of early breast cancer, but it is not clear whether further nodal dissection affects survival.

Objective

To determine the effects of complete axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) on survival of patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis of breast cancer.

Design, Setting, and Patients

The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial, a phase 3 noninferiority trial conducted at 115 sites and enrolling patients from May 1999 to December 2004. Patients were women with clinical T1-T2 invasive breast cancer, no palpable adenopathy, and 1 to 2 SLNs containing metastases identified by frozen section, touch preparation, or hematoxylin-eosin staining on permanent section. Targeted enrollment was 1900 women with final analysis after 500 deaths, but the trial closed early because mortality rate was lower than expected.

Interventions

All patients underwent lumpectomy and tangential whole-breast irradiation. Those with SLN metastases identified by SLND were randomized to undergo ALND or no further axillary treatment. Those randomized to ALND underwent dissection of 10 or more nodes. Systemic therapy was at the discretion of the treating physician.

Main Outcome Measures

Overall survival was the primary end point, with a noninferiority margin of a 1-sided hazard ratio of less than 1.3 indicating that SLND alone is noninferior to ALND. Disease-free survival was a secondary end point.

Results

Clinical and tumor characteristics were similar between 445 patients randomized to ALND and 446 randomized to SLND alone. However, the median number of nodes removed was 17 with ALND and 2 with SLND alone. At a median follow-up of 6.3 years (last follow-up, March 4, 2010), 5-year overall survival was 91.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 89.1%-94.5%) with ALND and 92.5% (95% CI, 90.0%-95.1%) with SLND alone; 5-year disease-free survival was 82.2% (95% CI, 78.3%-86.3%) with ALND and 83.9% (95% CI, 80.2%-87.9%) with SLND alone. The hazard ratio for treatment-related overall survival was 0.79 (90% CI, 0.56–1.11) without adjustment and 0.87 (90% CI, 0.62–1.23) after adjusting for age and adjuvant therapy.

Conclusion

Among patients with limited SLN metastatic breast cancer treated with breast conservation and systemic therapy, the use of SLND alone compared with ALND did not result in inferior survival.

### Is completion axillary lymph node dissection necessary in patients who are underrepresented in the ACOSOG Z0011 trial? [^113M35zD]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Summary

The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group trial Z0011 demonstrated that axillary lymph node dissection can be omitted in select patients with positive lymph nodes on the basis of sentinel biopsy test results. We report on treatment patterns including adjuvant radiation fields in patients who were underrepresented in the Z0011 trial due to baseline risk factors for recurrence and demonstrate favorable outcomes. Our results suggest that the completion of axillary dissection can be omitted in some patients who receive adjuvant radiation therapy with regional nodal coverage, which may decrease treatment morbidity in these patients.

### Impact of the American college of surgeons oncology group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial on clinical management of the axilla in older breast cancer patients: a SEER-Medicare analysis [^1117NPYX]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 demonstrated that eligible breast cancer patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) could be spared an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) without sacrificing survival or local control. Although heralded as a "practice-changing trial", some argue that the stringent inclusion criteria limit the trial's clinical significance. The objective was to assess the potential impact of ACOSOG Z0011 on axillary surgical management of Medicare patients and examine current practice patterns.

Methods

Medicare beneficiaries aged C66 years with nonmetastatic invasive breast cancer diagnosed from 2001 to 2007 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database (n = 59,431). Eligibility for ACOSOG Z0011 was determined: SLN mapping, tumor\5 cm, no neoadjuvant treatment, breast conservation; number of positive nodes was determined. Actual surgical axillary management for eligible patients was assessed.

Results

Twelve percent (6,942/59,431) underwent SLN mapping and were node positive. Overall, 2,637 patients (4.4% (2,637/59,431) of the total cohort, but 38% (2,637/6,942) of patients with SLN mapping and positive nodes) met inclusion criteria for ACOSOG Z0011, had 1 or 2 positive lymph nodes, and could have been spared an ALND. Of these 2,637 patients, 46% received a completion ALND and 54% received only SLN biopsy.

Conclusions

Widespread implementation of ACOSOG Z0011 trial results could potentially spare 38% of older breast cancer patients who undergo SLN mapping with positive lymph nodes an ALND. However, 54% of these patients are already managed with SLN biopsy alone, lessening the impact of this trial on clinical practice in older breast cancer patients.

### Is completion axillary lymph node dissection necessary in patients who are underrepresented in the ACOSOG Z0011 trial? [^11491E9Q]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Collectively, these studies suggest that adjuvant RT with fields that are guided by pathologic characteristics after SLNB without completion ALND can offer improvements in morbidity and mortality in select patients with breast cancer. However, the heterogeneity of RT fields among these trials limits the translation into clinical practice. Moreover, the results may not be generalizable to all patients because the majority of subjects in the Z11 trial were negative for extranodal extension (ENE) and presented with hormone receptor positive cancer and 1 to 2 axillary metastases. Furthermore, many patients had a low burden of axillary disease with micrometastases only.

Herein, we report on the RT treatment patterns and clinical outcomes of patients with breast cancer with features that were underrepresented in the Z11 trial. Specifically, we add to the existing literature with data on omission of ALND in patients with one or more of the following features: T3 tumors, > 2 positive SLNs, hormone receptor negative status, ENE, or Nottingham grade 3 histology.

Clinically node-negative patients with limited pathologic node-positive disease

Several phase III, multicenter trials showing that ALND can be omitted in selected SLN-positive women have recently been reported with resulting changes in clinical practice. These are summarized in Table 1. The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial was a multi-institutional, prospective non-inferiority trial which enrolled clinically node-negative patients with T1 or T2 tumors treated with breast conservation therapy (BCT) and adjuvant radiotherapy and were found to have one or two positive SLNs. Patients were randomized to completion ALND versus SLN alone and followed for evidence of disease recurrence and for overall survival. There were no differences in 5-year overall survival (91.9% in ALND vs. 92.5% in SLND alone, P = 0.24) or disease-free survival (82.2% vs. 83.8%, P = 0.13). In patients randomized to ALND, additional positive non-SLNs were identified in the axillary specimen in 27% of cases. The investigators concluded that ALND could be safely omitted in clinically node-negative patients with T1 or T2 tumors undergoing BCT with one or two positive lymph nodes. The majority of patients in this trial had post-operative adjuvant whole-breast radiotherapy and systemic therapy without specific directed nodal radiotherapy to the axilla (Fig. 1).

### ASCO guidelines… [^112BiFmE]. ASCO (2025). Medium credibility.

The patients who are eligible for omission of sentinel lymph node biopsy according to the SOUND and INSEMA trial are patients with invasive ductal carcinoma that is size smaller than 2 cm, Nottingham grades 1 and 2, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative in patients intending to receive adjuvant endocrine therapy, and no suspicious lymph nodes on axillary ultrasound or if they have only one suspicious lymph node, then the biopsy of that lymph node is benign and concordant according to the axillary ultrasound findings. The patients who are eligible for sentinel lymph node biopsy omission according to the SOUND and INSEMA trials were patients who are undergoing lumpectomy followed by whole breast radiation, especially in patients who are younger than 65 years of age. For patients who are 65 years or older, they also qualify for omission of sentinel lymph node biopsy in addition to consideration for radiation therapy omission according to the PRIME II and CALGB 9343 clinical trials.

And so in those patients, a more shared decision-making approach with the radiation oncologist is encouraged. So, in these patients, regional nodal irradiation, there would be no clear indication for that more aggressive and more extensive radiation treatment. Dr. Ko Un "Clara" Park: No. And this is confirmed based on the ACOSOG Z0011 study that demonstrated in patients with 1 to 3 positive sentinel lymph node biopsy when the study compared completion axillary lymph node dissection to no completion axillary lymph node dissection, there was no difference. Dr. Mylin Torres: It's actually not and this is confirmed by two trials, the AMAROS study as well as the SENOMAC trial. And in both studies, they compared a full lymph node dissection versus sentinel lymph node biopsy alone in patients who are found to have 1 to 2 positive lymph nodes and confirmed that there was no difference in axillary recurrence rates, overall survival or disease-free survival.

Brittany Harvey: Thank you. And then Dr. Park, for patients with early-stage breast cancer who do not have nodal metastases, can completion axillary lymph node dissection be omitted. Dr. Ko Un "Clara" Park: Yes, and this is an unchanged recommendation from the earlier ASCO Guidelines from 2017 as well as the 2021 joint guideline with Ontario Health, wherein patients with clinically node-negative early stage breast cancer, the staging of the axilla can be performed through sentinel lymph nodal biopsy and not completion axillary lymph node dissection.

### The need for axillary lymph node dissection in T1 / T2 breast cancer surgery – counterpoint [^1145984s]. Cancer Research (2013). Low credibility.

For breast cancer patients, the role of the axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in the management of clinically node negative breast cancer patient has shifted from routine, to selective, to increasingly rare. With the publication of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial results, some are ready to announce the time of death of this procedure. However, many questions remain regarding the design and statistical interpretation of the study, the treatments the patients actually received, and its applicability in clinical practice in light of other studies concerning regional management. Thus, the reports of the ALND's death may be greatly exaggerated. Careful acknowledgement of the study's strengths and shortcomings, and more recent trial data, suggest that although ALND may be safely avoided in a subset of sentinel lymph node positive, Z0011-eligible patients, others may require multidisciplinary review and consensus, and a careful conversation with the patient, before deciding it is not necessary.

### The importance of applying ACOSOG Z0011 criteria in the axillary management of invasive lobular carcinoma: a multi-institutional cohort study [^116tEw4o]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial led to a significant change in the management of patients with early stage breast cancer and limited sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases. However, only 27 patients with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) were randomized to the completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) arm. To assess the generalizability of the Z0011 trial, the primary aim of this study was to determine the risk of residual nodal burden (RNB) for ILC.

Methods

A multi-institutional cohort study was completed. RNB was determined for women of any age with an ILC and at least one positive SLN who underwent a primary breast procedure (lumpectomy or mastectomy) and both a SLN biopsy followed by a completion ALND between July 1, 1999, and June 30, 2009, at two large academic centers.

Results

A total of 59 patients (60 ILCs) met the inclusion criteria. Although the overall RNB was 40%, it was significantly greater in the T3+ group compared to T1/T2 (87 vs. 24%, respectively, p < 0.0001). When comparing only ILCs that met all of the inclusion criteria for ACOSOG Z0011 (T1 or T2, 1 or 2 SLNs positive, no SLN extranodal extension, and breast conservation) to those ILCs that did not, the RNB was significantly greater in the latter (56 vs. 17%; p < 0.003).

Conclusions

Overall, the clinical practice changes that have occurred after publication of the ACOSOG Z0011 trial appear to be generalizable to ILCs within the inclusion criteria of the study.

Schema for the ACOSOG Z0011 Trial. The ACOSOG Z0011 trial was designed to determine whether there was a difference in overall survival or locoregional recurrence in early breast cancer with one or two positive sentinel lymph nodes who underwent axillary lymph node dissection versus those that had no further axillary therapy

A similar European trial, the EORTC 10981–22023 AMAROS (After Mapping of the Axilla, Radiotherapy or Surgery?) trial, was also a multi-institutional trial enrolling clinically node-negative patients with positive SLNs. The trial started with eligibility criteria of a unifocal tumor < 3 cm, which was later expanded to include tumors up to 5 cm and those with multifocal disease. Similar to ACOSOG Z0011, a positive SLN was considered positive by standard hematoxylin and eosin staining with isolated tumor cells considered negative. They randomized 744 patients to ALND and 681 patients to axillary radiotherapy. Unlike the Z0011 trial, the type of breast surgery was not dictated by the protocol, so patients undergoing mastectomy were eligible for enrollment (17% of the ALND cohort and 18% of the axillary radiotherapy group). In the ALND group, 33% (220/672) had additional positive non-SLNs identified. They reported a 5-year axillary recurrence rate of 0.43% after ALND and 1.19% in the axillary radiotherapy group. The study was underpowered to show statistical assurance of non-inferiority due to the low number of events. Because patients were enrolled and randomized before surgery, the trial included results on 3131 SLN-negative patients with a 0.72% 5-year axillary recurrence rate. There were no differences in 5-year disease-free survival (86.9% in ALND vs. 82.7% in radiotherapy, P = 0.18) or 5-year overall survival (93.3% in ALND vs. 92.5% in radiotherapy, P = 0.34). They also reported that clinical evidence of lymphedema was higher in the ALND group at 5 years (23% compared to 11%, P < 0.0001) as well as the proportion of patients with a ≥ 10% increase in arm circumference (13% vs. 6%, P = 0.0009). Interestingly, despite these changes, there were no differences in quality of life scores.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy vs No axillary surgery in patients with small breast cancer and negative results on ultrasonography of axillary lymph nodes: the SOUND randomized clinical trial [^116jssje]. JAMA Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard of care for axillary node staging in patients with early breast cancer (BC). The application of this technique represented a milestone in surgical de-escalation, providing the same outcome as axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). The results of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 (ACOSOG Z0011) randomized clinical trialshowed that there is no advantage in performing ALND compared with not performing ALND, even when up to 2 sentinel nodes are positive, for patients receiving breast-conserving surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy, and medical treatment. These data were supported by other randomized clinical trials, and became the basis for a new standard of axillary care. In the past, SLNB was conceived as a reliable means to distinguish between patients with negative nodes who can be spared the morbidity associated with a complete ALND and those with nodal involvement who might benefit from a more extensive surgical procedure. But the absence of advantages from ALND revealed in the ACOSOG Z0111 trialraised 2 questions: first, whether it is really necessary to perform surgical staging of axillary lymph nodes, and second, whether imaging might replace surgery for reliable staging of axillary lymph nodes. The SOUND (Sentinel Node vs Observation After Axillary Ultra-Sound) trial was launched in February 2012 with the aim of evaluating the oncological safety of omitting axillary surgery in patients with BC of a diameter equal to or smaller than 2 cm and a negative result on preoperative axillary lymph node ultrasonography.

### Patient-reported outcomes for the intergroup sentinel mamma study (INSEMA): a randomised trial with persistent impact of axillary surgery on arm and breast symptoms in patients with early breast cancer [^113PNXAY]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The publication of ACOSOG Z0011 trial outcomes, opened a decade of de-escalation trials for axillary surgery in early breast cancer. The Intergroup-Sentinel-Mamma (INSEMA) trial (, GBG-75, ABCSG-43) investigates the non-inferiority of omission of axillary surgical staging versus sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer (tumor size ≤ 5 cm) and upfront breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) as the primary endpoint. In the case of pN1a(sn) in the SLNB arm, patients underwent a second randomization to complete axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or no further axillary surgery.

Previously, we reported the characteristics of the first 1000 recruited INSEMA patients in 2017. Due to the frequent use of protocol-prohibited nodal fields in the ACOSOG Z0011 trial, a preplanned central quality assurance review process for radiotherapy planning was included in the INSEMA protocol, and the associated findings were published in 2020.

It is assumed that reduced axillary intervention leads to improved quality of life (QoL), although there is only indirect level I evidence supporting this assumption to date. Three studies, including 1755 patients, reported QoL for the setting SLNB versus ALND, of which two trials found improved QoL after SLNB. Moreover, the IBCSG 10–93 trial randomized women aged 60 years and older to ALND versus no ALND and demonstrated that QoL was better in the group with no axillary surgery.

However, these trials do not provide evidence concerning QoL outcomes for patients who undergo axillary SLNB versus no axillary intervention. Because QoL considerations are the primary motivation for abandoning SLNB, there is a need for randomized trials with QoL as a defined endpoint. Here we report for the first time comprehensive QoL data using patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for clinically node-negative patients with and without SLNB (Rando 1) and for SLNB-positive patients with and without completion ALND (Rando 2).

### The exportability of the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria for omitting axillary lymph node dissection after positive sentinel lymph node biopsy findings: a multicenter study [^115Qa33o]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the exportability of the criteria defined by the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial for selecting patients who are eligible for omitting completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) after a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy result and to investigate whether not following the Z0011 criteria might affect patient outcomes.

Methods

From a multicenter database, we selected 188 patients with positive SLNs and then excluded patients with positive SLNs on immunohistochemistry only. We retrospectively applied the Z0011 criteria and grouped the patients as eligible or ineligible for omitting cALND. The eligible group was compared with the cohort included in the Z0011 trial and with the ineligible group. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated for each group, and univariate analyses assessed associations between the groups and clinicopathological variables.

Results

The final analysis involved 125 patients with positive SLNs. Eighty-seven patients (69.6%) were potentially eligible for omitting cALND. The estrogen receptor status, T stage, grade, and number of positive non-SLNs were not statistically different between the eligible group and the Z0011 cohort. The ineligible group had significantly more positive non-SLNs (P = 0.01) and a lower 5-year overall survival rate than the eligible group (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

The similarity of clinical characteristics between the Z0011 trial cohort and our eligible group confirms the exportability of these criteria to another population. The worse prognosis of patients who did not meet the Z0011 criteria suggests prudence before disregarding or enlarging broadening the indications for omitting cALND.

### Trends in axillary lymph node dissection after mastectomy among patients with limited nodal burden [^1126toUV]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Over the past 2 decades, management of the axilla for patients with breast cancer with axillary nodal metastases has evolved significantly, with an overall trend toward surgical de-escalation. Axillary overtreatment can result in substantial morbidity and long-term harms, such as lymphedema, secondary malignant neoplasms, reduced quality of life, and financial toxicity, without reducing the risk of breast cancer recurrence or improving patient survival. Consequently, eliminating unnecessary locoregional treatment can significantly improve cancer survivorship.

The ACOSOG Z0011 (American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011) trial demonstrated that sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone resulted in equivalent overall and disease-specific survival when compared with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for patients with limited nodal disease burden undergoing breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. As a result, ALND has been deimplemented in this setting, with national data showing that less than 20% of patients undergoing upfront breast-conserving therapy with 1 to 2 positive axillary lymph nodes (LNs) receive ALND in the post–ACOSOG Z0011 trial era. However, surgical de-escalation of the axilla for patients undergoing mastectomy with positive axillary LNs has been less straightforward. Although the ACOSOG Z0011 trial excluded patients who underwent mastectomy, the AMAROS (10981–22023 Comparison of Complete Axillary Lymph Node Dissection With Axillary Radiation Therapy in Treating Women With Invasive Breast Cancer) and SENOMAC (Sentinel Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer: Omission of Axillary Clearance After Macrometastases) trials included patients undergoing mastectomy and confirmed the safety of ALND omission for patients with up to 3 positive axillary LNs. In particular, the AMAROS trial found equivalent cancer outcomes with axillary radiotherapy compared with ALND. However, the risk of lymphedema was higher with ALND, while the risk of secondary malignant neoplasms was higher with axillary radiotherapy.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^114hR8go]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

ACOSOG Z0011 — eligibility, treatment arms, and outcomes for patients with SLNB-positive early breast cancer show no advantage to completion ALND under specified conditions. Patients ≥ 18 years with clinical T1/T2 tumors and fewer than 3 positive SLNs undergoing breast-conserving surgery with whole-breast radiotherapy were randomized to SLNB alone (n = 436) or completion ALND (n = 420). In this study, there was no difference in local recurrence, DFS, or OS; at a median follow-up of 6.3 years, locoregional recurrences were 4.1% with ALND versus 2.8% with SLNB (P = 0.11) and median OS was approximately 92% in each group. Long-term follow-up (median 9.25 years) showed no statistically significant difference in local recurrence-free survival (P = 0.13); ipsilateral axillary recurrences at 10 years were 0.5% with ALND versus 1.5% with SLNB alone (P = 0.28), and 10-year cumulative locoregional recurrences were 6.2% versus 5.3% (P = 0.36). The trial demonstrated that there is no benefit to ALND in patients who have only one or two SN metastases after WBRT as part of breast-conserving therapy, and mastectomy patients were not enrolled; only ER-negative status, age < 50 years, and lack of adjuvant systemic therapy were associated with decreased OS.

### Patient age and tumor subtype predict the extent of axillary surgery among breast cancer patients eligible for the American college of surgeons oncology group trial Z0011 [^116ySMnA]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial established the safety of omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for early-stage breast cancer patients with limited nodal disease undergoing lumpectomy. We examined the extent of axillary surgery among women eligible for Z0011 based on patient age and tumor subtype.

Methods

Patients with cT1-2, cN0 breast cancers and one or two positive nodes diagnosed from 2009 to 2014 and treated with lumpectomy were identified in the National Cancer Data Base. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was defined as the removal of 1–5 nodes and ALND as the removal of 10 nodes or more. Tumor subtype was categorized as luminal, human epidermal growth factor 2-positive (HER2+), or triple-negative. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of receiving SLNB alone versus ALND.

Results

The inclusion criteria were met by 28,631 patients (21,029 SLNB-alone and 7602 ALND patients). Patients 70 years of age or older were more likely to undergo SLNB alone than ALND (27.0% vs 20.1%; p < 0.001). The radiation therapy use rate was 89.4% after SLNB alone and 89.7% after ALND. In the multivariate analysis, the uptake of Z0011 recommendations increased over time (2014 vs 2009: odds ratio [OR] 13.02; p < 0.001). Younger patients were less likely to undergo SLNB alone than older patients (age < 40 vs ≥ 70: OR 0.59; p < 0.001). Patients with HER2+ (OR 0.89) or triple-negative disease (OR 0.79) (p < 0.001) were less likely to undergo SLNB alone than those with luminal subtypes.

Conclusions

Among women potentially eligible for ACOSOG Z0011, the use of SLNB alone increased over time in all groups, but the extent of axillary surgery differed by patient age and tumor subtype.

### A 10-year trend analysis of sentinel lymph node frozen section and completion axillary dissection for breast cancer: are these procedures becoming obsolete? [^11537Q2c]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Recent results from the ACOSOG Z0011 trial question the use of intraoperative frozen section (FS) during sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy and the role of axillary dissection (ALND) for SLN-positive breast cancer patients. Here we present a 10-year trend analysis of SLN-FS and ALND in our practice.

Methods

We reviewed our prospective SLN database over 10 years (1997–2006, 7509 SLN procedures) for time trends and variation between surgeons in the use of SLN-FS and ALND in patients with cN0 invasive breast cancer.

Results

Use of SLN-FS decreased from 100% to 62% (P < 0.0001) and varied widely by surgeon (66% to 95%). There were no statistically significant trends in the performance of ALND for patients with SLN metastases detected by FS (n = 1370, 99–99%) or routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) (n = 333; 69–77%), but only for those detected by serial section H&E with or without immunohistochemistry (n = 438; 73–48%; P = 0.0054) or immunohistochemistry only (n = 294; 48–28%; P < 0.0001). These trends coincided with an increase in the proportion of completion versus immediate ALND (30–40%; P = 0.0710).

Conclusions

Over 10 years, we have observed a diminishing rate of SLN-FS and, for patients with low-volume SLN metastases, fewer ALND, trends that suggest a more nuanced approach to axillary management. If the Z0011 selection criteria had been applied to our cohort, 66% of SLN-FS (4159 of 6327) and 48% of ALND (939 of 1953) would have been avoided, sparing 13% of all patients the morbidity of ALND.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy in primary breast cancer: window to management of the axilla [^116TH1yW]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

In patients with primary breast cancer, several large, randomized prospective trials have shown that sentinel node biopsy (SNB) substantially reduces the morbidity associated with axillary surgery compared with formal axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Moreover, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-32 trial has demonstrated that when the sentinel node reveals no evidence of metastatic disease, then no further ALND is required. Recently, the results of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial have challenged the notion that all patients with metastases to the sentinel node require ALND. The results of this trial suggest that in selected sentinel node-positive patients, ALND can be potentially avoided. Yet, some concerns about the ACOSOG Z0011 trial have been raised, and these concerns may have implications in the widespread implementation of the results of this trial. Since the advent of the SNB technology, occult metastases within the sentinel node are frequently observed, and the significance of these findings remains controversial. Finally, this review considers special situations, such as pregnancy and the neoadjuvant setting, where the use of SNB should be applied judiciously. The SNB technology has dramatically improved the quality of life for women with breast cancer, and further modifications of its role in breast cancer treatment should be based on evidence obtained from randomized, controlled trials.

### Is completion axillary lymph node dissection necessary in patients who are underrepresented in the ACOSOG Z0011 trial? [^113VhjEe]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Elective IMN coverage remains controversial due to a lack of benefit shown in prior trials and the potential risk of increasing late cardiac toxicity. However, more recent evidence has demonstrated a benefit to IMN radiation; thus, at our institution the threshold for electively covering IMN in high-risk patients has decreased and particularly in those with right-sided tumors. Notably, 1 patient with > 2 mm ENE developed an ipsilateral IMN recurrence and subsequent distant metastasis. This patient was treated with RNI that did not include elective coverage of the IMN chain.

The limitations of this study include the follow-up time and patient numbers. However, with newer data to substantiate RNI, many recent patients are no longer treated according to the Z11 trial. Thus, this study provides valuable data in a patient group that may be difficult to study moving forward. Axillary recurrences have been reported at a median of 15 to 30 months, which is well within our median follow-up time of 48.5 months.

Furthermore, while others have validated the Z11 trial outcomes after omitting ALND in women with sentinel node involvement, this is the first study to our knowledge that demonstrates favorable DFS and LRC after ALND omission in women who did not meet the Z11 study criteria. Our results appear promising to reduce potential morbidity in clinical practice because the data demonstrate excellent outcomes with directed adjuvant RT in patients who present with high-risk features such as ENE, Nottingham grade 3 disease, or hormone receptor negative tumors despite the omission of ALND.

A significant limitation of this study is its retrospective nature, which precludes the identification of causal relationships. The low number of events further limits the ability to identify significant associations with patient outcomes. As such, further prospective work needs to be done to validate these findings. Moreover, our cohort contained relatively few patients with Stage 3 disease, estrogen-receptor negative status, and positive surgical margins. Therefore, our analyses may lack the statistical power to generate robust conclusions about the omission of ALND after SLNB among these subgroups. Nonetheless, these favorable results add to the growing body of literature on ALND omission after SLNB and provide an impetus for additional study in underrepresented patient populations.

### Is completion axillary lymph node dissection necessary in patients who are underrepresented in the ACOSOG Z0011 trial? [^115nHUX8]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods and materials

Patient data from the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center (Pittsburgh, PA) were obtained from the ARiA record and Varian database (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). After institutional review board approval, we identified women with clinically node-negative invasive breast cancer who underwent segmental mastectomy and SLNB with positive sentinel nodes and also received adjuvant RT between July 2011 and July 2016. Our inclusion criteria were broad and included patients with T3 tumors, > 2 positive SLNs, invasive lobular carcinoma histology, estrogen receptor negative status, any extent of ENE, Nottingham grade 3, and/or age < 50 years. We excluded patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy, underwent completion ALND or mastectomy, did not receive adjuvant RT, or whose radiation treatment plans were unobtainable. The decision to omit ALND was made after a discussion with the patient with regard to the risks of disease recurrence and the potential morbidity of ALND on the basis of the currently available literature.

Individual patients' RT plans were individually reviewed by a single radiation oncologist using the Eclipse Treatment Planning System (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). RT fields were categorized as whole breast irradiation (WBI) alone using standard tangent fields, modified tangent (MT) fields for coverage of the superior level I and II axilla, or MT and the addition of a 3 rd level III and SCN-directed field.

All data analysis was performed with SPSS Statistics 24 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY). Binary logistic regression was utilized to test for associations between patient characteristics and delivered RT fields. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate DFS and locoregional control (LRC) rates and the log-rank test was performed to identify potential associations with risk factors.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^116EeiiV]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

ACOSOG Z0011 — sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) versus axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in early-stage breast cancer shows no long-term oncologic detriment with SLNB alone while whole-breast irradiation (WBI) was planned for all patients; among intention-to-treat patients, 10-year locoregional recurrence was 6.2% with ALND and 5.3% with SLNB-only (P = 0.36), and overall survival at 10 years was 86.3% with SLNB alone versus 83.6% with ALND (HR, 0.85 [one-sided 95% CI, 0 to 1.16]; noninferiority P = 0.02), with disease-free survival 78.2% versus 80.2% (HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.62 to 1.17]; P = 0.32) after median follow-up near 9–9.3 years; randomization was ALND (n = 446) versus no further surgery after SLNB (n = 445).

### Axillary dissection can be avoided in the majority of clinically node-negative patients undergoing breast-conserving therapy [^1153dMib]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The extent to which ACOSOG Z0011 findings are applicable to patients undergoing breast-conserving therapy (BCT) is uncertain. We prospectively assessed how often axillary dissection (ALND) was avoided in an unselected, consecutive patient cohort meeting Z0011 eligibility criteria and whether subgroups requiring ALND could be identified preoperatively.

Methods

Patients with cT1,2cN0 breast cancer undergoing BCT were managed without ALND for metastases in < 3 sentinel nodes (SNs) and no gross extracapsular extension (ECE). Patients with and without indications for ALND were compared using Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests.

Results

From August 2010 to November 2012, 2,157 invasive cancer patients had BCT. A total of 380 had histologic nodal metastasis; 93 did not meet Z0011 criteria. Of 287 with ≥ 1 H&E-positive SN (209 macrometastases), 242 (84%) had indications for SN only. ALND was indicated in 45 for ≥ 3 positive SNs (n = 29) or ECE (n = 16). The median number of SNs removed in the SN group was 3 versus 5 in the ALND group (p < 0.0001). Age, hormone receptor and HER2 status, and grade did not differ between groups; tumors were larger in the ALND group (p < 0.0001). Of ALND patients, 72% had additional positive nodes (median = 1; range 1–19). No axillary recurrences have occurred (median follow-up, 13 months).

Conclusions

ALND was avoided in 84% of a consecutive series of patients having BCT, suggesting that most patients meeting ACOSOG Z0011 eligibility have a low axillary tumor burden. Age, ER, and HER2 status were not predictive of ALND, and the criteria used for ALND (≥ 3 SNs, ECE) reliably identified patients at high risk for residual axillary disease.

### Sentinel lymph nodes for breast carcinoma: an update on current practice [^1175fy2u]. Histopathology (2016). Low credibility.

Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has been established as the standard of care for axillary staging in patients with invasive breast carcinoma and clinically negative lymph nodes (cN0). Historically, all patients with a positive SLN underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). The ACOSOG Z0011 trial showed that women with T1-T2 disease and cN0 who undergo breast-conserving surgery and whole-breast radiotherapy can safely avoid ALND. The main goal of SLN examination should be to detect all macrometastases (> 2 mm). Gross sectioning of SLNs at 2-mm intervals and microscopic examination of one haematoxylin and eosin-stained section from each SLN block is the preferred method for pathological evaluation of SLNs. The role and timing of SLN biopsy for patients who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy is controversial, and continues to be explored in clinical trials. SLN biopsies from patients with invasive breast carcinoma who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy pose particular challenges for pathologists.

### De-implementation of low-value care for women 70 years of age or older with low-risk breast cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic [^1121ceBz]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Finally, the rates of nodal positivity are low among patients meeting the criteria for omission of axillary staging. In the low-risk cohort, 11% of the patients had sentinel lymph node involvement compared with 35% of the patients in the cohort that was not eligible for omission of axillary staging. This is supported by other studies that have found the rate of nodal involvement among women 70 years of age or older with cN0, T1, ER+/HER2– IBC to be lower than 10%.

The target rate for SLNB and radiotherapy de-implementation among patients eligible for omission of these therapies is unknown. However, the dramatic decrease in rates of completion ALND among patients with one or two tumors involving lymph nodes who received BCS and radiotherapy after dissemination of the ACOSOG Z0011 trial can serve as a model for successful de-implementation. National data suggest that among patients meeting eligibility criteria for Z0011, the rates of completion ALND decreased from 63% in 2004 to 14% in 2016, a relative reduction of 78%. Thus, despite the significant de-implementation of radiotherapy and SLNB among women 70 years of age or older with low-risk ER+ IBC observed in the current study, opportunity likely exists for continued de-escalation.

Prior work has shown that several factors are associated with utilization of low-value SLNB and radiotherapy for breast cancer patients. First, patient age is strongly correlated with SLNB and radiotherapy receipt among patients who are candidates for omission. This is supported by findings in the current study showing that few patients older than 80 years with low-risk ER+ IBC received SLNB or radiotherapy.

Second, both patients and providers refer to the importance of considering physiologic age in addition to biologic age when age-based guidelines are evaluated. Qualitative work has shown that patients who feel healthier than average are more likely to desire aggressive care despite recommendations for omission. Similarly, surgeons frequently describe making treatment decisions based on a patient's functional status rather than a patient's biologic age. However, despite the bias that healthy patients with low-risk ER+ IBC might benefit more from SLNB and radiotherapy, it is important to note that the patients included in CALGB 9343 had a higher overall survival than age-matched women in the general population, suggesting that the results of this trial apply equally to women who are healthier than average and without significant comorbid conditions.

### Axillary dissection and nodal irradiation can Be avoided for most node-positive Z0011-eligible breast cancers: a prospective validation study of 793 patients [^116KKoC2]. Annals of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine rates of axillary dissection (ALND) and nodal recurrence in patients eligible for ACOSOG Z0011.

Background

Z0011 demonstrated that patients with cT1-2N0 breast cancers and 1 to 2 involved sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) having breast-conserving therapy had no difference in locoregional recurrence or survival after SLN biopsy alone or ALND. The generalizability of the results and importance of nodal radiotherapy (RT) is unclear.

Methods

Patients eligible for Z0011 had SLN biopsy alone. Prospectively defined indications for ALND were metastases in ≥ 3 SLNs or gross extracapsular extension. Axillary imaging was not routine. SLN and ALND groups and radiation fields were compared with chi-square and t tests. Cumulative incidence of recurrences was estimated with competing risk analysis.

Results

From August 2010 to December 2016, 793 patients met Z0011 eligibility criteria and had SLN metastases. Among them, 130 (16%) had ALND; ALND did not vary based on age, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, or HER2 status. Five-year event-free survival after SLN alone was 93% with no isolated axillary recurrences. Cumulative 5-year rates of breast+nodal and nodal+distant recurrence were each 0.7%. In 484 SLN-only patients with known RT fields (103 prone, 280 supine tangent, 101 breast+nodes) and follow-up ≥ 12 months, the 5-year cumulative nodal recurrence rate was 1% and did not differ significantly by RT fields.

Conclusions

We confirm that even without preoperative axillary imaging or routine use of nodal RT, ALND can be avoided in a large majority of Z0011-eligible patients with excellent regional control. This approach has the potential to spare substantial numbers of women the morbidity of ALND.

### ASO author reflections: an alternative to sentinel-node biopsy? Preoperative sonographic prediction of limited axillary disease in breast cancer patients meeting the Z0011 criteria [^114t4d7Z]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Past

The approach to axillary surgery for patients with breast cancer has evolved tremendously over recent decades, leading to significant changes in the role of preoperative axillary imaging. With the replacement of axillary lymph-node dissection (ALND) by sentinel node biopsy (SNB) for primary surgical staging of clinical node-negative breast cancer patients, a paradigm shift evolved that made the identification of axillary involvement the main goal of preoperative axillary staging, as these patients could bypass SNB and proceed directly to ALND. In addition, the ACOSOG-Z0011 trial showed that ALND can be safely omitted in patients with early-stage (T1–2) breast cancer who undergo breast-conserving therapy and in whom SNB reveals two or fewer metastatic lymph nodes. With the implementation of these findings into clinical practice, the use of axillary imaging became controversial from a surgical standpoint, as preoperative detection of metastatic axillary disease would process patients directly to ALND, resulting in a clinical need for preoperative quantification of the extent of axillary disease. If limited histopathological axillary disease could be identified safely by preoperative ultrasound and core needle biopsy, SNB may constitute overtreatment and the omission of SNB in this setting due to the lack of consequence in selected patient populations might be an approach for further scientific evaluation.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^112SXbdw]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Breast-conserving therapy patients meeting ACOSOG Z0011 criteria — clinically node-negative with pathologically positive SLN — had no benefit from completion ALND and low long-term recurrence rates. Patients ≥ 18 years with clinical T1/T2 tumors and fewer than 3 positive SLNs undergoing BCS and WBRT were randomized to SLNB alone (n = 436) or completion ALND (n = 420), with no difference in local recurrence, DFS, or OS. At a median follow-up of 6.3 years, locoregional recurrences were 4.1% with ALND versus 2.8% with SLNB (P = 0.11) and median OS was approximately 92% in each group. Long-term follow-up (median 9.25 years) showed no statistically significant difference in local recurrence-free survival (P = 0.13), 10-year ipsilateral axillary recurrences were 0.5% (2 patients) after ALND versus 1.5% (5 patients) after SLNB alone (P = 0.28), and 10-year locoregional recurrences were 6.2% with ALND versus 5.3% with SLNB alone (P = 0.36). Only ER-negative status, age < 50 years, and lack of adjuvant systemic therapy were associated with decreased OS, and the trial demonstrates no benefit to ALND in early-stage patients with only one or two SLN metastases after WBRT as part of BCT; mastectomy patients were not enrolled.

### The need for axillary dissection in patients with positive axillary sentinel lymph nodes [^116fQRGa]. Current Oncology Reports (2011). Low credibility.

The need for completion axillary dissection after a positive sentinel node biopsy continues to be challenged. In the 2 years since we last reviewed this subject, a number of authors have shared their experiences about micrometastatic disease and isolated tumor cells, opining both for and against axillary treatment. Data from the ACOSOG Z0011 trial and other small studies do not appear to support the use of completion axillary dissection even for macro-metastatic disease in patients with clinically node-negative (N0) disease. While existing guidelines still recommend axillary dissection for patients with clinically positive nodes, even when conversion to clinically negative disease following neoadjuvant chemotherapy has occurred, this concept is being questioned in ACOSOG Z1071 and in several other recent small trials. The surgical approach to the treatment of breast cancer continues to move away from the traditional Halstedian concept.

### National trend of axillary management in clinical T3 / T4 N0 patients having breast conserving therapy [^113eG8es]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The ACOSOG Z0011 trial has essentially eliminated axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in breast conserving therapy (BCT) patients with clinical T1/T2 and 1–2 positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). Currently, ALND is recommended for positive SLNs unless ACOSOG Z0011 criteria are applicable. We aimed to assess the national trends and axillary management before and after the publication of ACOSOG Z0011 for larger tumors.

Methods

An IRB-approved study evaluated the National Cancer Database from 2006 to 2016. Women with clinical T3/T4, N0 who otherwise fit ACOSOG Z0011 criteria were included. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy or known nodal disease was excluded. Clinicopathologic data were compared between two timeframes based on ACOSOZ Z0011 publication and by axillary management. Patients were categorized into SLNB alone (1–5 lymph nodes examined) and ALND (≥ 10 lymph nodes examined) groups.

Results

A total of 230 women fit inclusion criteria, of whom 36% underwent ALND. ALND use decreased from 54% in 2006 to 14% in 2016 (P < 0.01). Comparing ALND to SLNB alone within the pre-Z0011 era, comprehensive community cancer programs had higher proportions of ALND, whereas academic centers had higher rates of SLND alone (P = 0.03). Comparing similar axillary management between eras, SLNB-alone patients in the post-Z0011 era had higher pT and pN stages, were less likely to be Her2 positive, and were more likely to receive systemic treatment.

Conclusions

There is a national trend to forgo ALND in women who have tumors larger than those included in the Z0011 criteria without any clear clinicopathologic indications.

### Locoregional recurrence after sentinel lymph node dissection with or without axillary dissection in patients with sentinel lymph node metastases: long-term follow-up from the American college of surgeons oncology group (alliance) ACOSOG Z0011 randomized trial [^114tB2xX]. Annals of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

The early results of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial demonstrated no difference in locoregional recurrence for patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) randomized either to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) alone. We now report long-term locoregional recurrence results.

Methods

ACOSOG Z0011 prospectively examined overall survival of patients with SLN metastases undergoing breast-conserving therapy randomized to undergo ALND after SLND or no further axillary specific treatment. Locoregional recurrence was prospectively evaluated and compared between the groups.

Results

Four hundred forty-six patients were randomized to SLND alone and 445 to SLND and ALND. Both groups were similar with respect to age, Bloom-Richardson score, Estrogen Receptor status, adjuvant systemic therapy, histology, and tumor size. Patients randomized to ALND had a median of 17 axillary nodes removed compared with a median of only 2 SLNs removed with SLND alone (P < 0.001). ALND, as expected, also removed more positive lymph nodes (P < 0.001). At a median follow-up of 9.25 years, there was no statistically significant difference in local recurrence-free survival (P = 0.13). The cumulative incidence of nodal recurrences at 10 years was 0.5% in the ALND arm and 1.5% in the SLND alone arm (P = 0.28). Ten-year cumulative locoregional recurrence was 6.2% with ALND and 5.3% with SLND alone (P = 0.36).

Conclusion

Despite the potential for residual axillary disease after SLND, SLND without ALND offers excellent regional control for selected patients with early metastatic breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy and adjuvant systemic therapy.

### Intraoperative nomograms, based on one-step nucleic acid amplification, for prediction of non-sentinel node metastasis and four or more axillary node metastases in breast cancer patients with sentinel node metastasis [^111XgiMb]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Axillary lymph node (ALN) status is still the most important prognostic factor for patients with breast cancer, and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is currently widely accepted as a standard surgical procedure for the determination of ALN status of clinically node-negative breast cancer patients.–In case of negative sentinel lymph node (SLN), completion ALN dissection (cALND) can be avoided; however, in case of positive SLN, cALND is performed because of a high probability of non-SLN (NSLN) metastasis, whereas a certain proportion of patients with positive SLN are forgoing cALND if they meet the inclusion criteria for the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 study. It has been reported that 40–70% of SLN-positive patients actually have NSLN metastasis, indicating that approximately half of SLN-positive patients undergo unnecessary cALND. In the current era of precision medicine, the risk of NSLN metastasis should be estimated accurately, and the indication for cALND should be personalized according to the risk of NSLN metastasis. For these reasons, various prediction models for NSLN metastasis and four or more ALN metastases have been developed for SLN-positive breast cancer patients.–

### Axillary lymph node dissection is associated with improved survival among men with invasive breast cancer and sentinel node metastasis [^1172MMKt]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare, and management is extrapolated from trials that enroll only women. It is unclear whether contemporary axillary management based on data from landmark trials in women may also apply to men with breast cancer. This study aimed to compare survival in men with positive sentinel lymph nodes after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone versus complete axillary dissection (ALND).

Patients and Methods

Using the National Cancer Database, men with clinically node-negative, T1 and T2 breast cancer and 1–2 positive sentinel nodes who underwent SLNB or ALND were identified from 2010 to 2020. Both 1:1 propensity score matching and multivariate regression were used to identify patient and disease variables associated with ALND versus SLNB. Survival between ALND and SLNB were compared using Kaplan-Meier methods.

Results

A total of 1203 patients were identified: 61.1% underwent SLNB alone and 38.9% underwent ALND. Treatment in academic centers (36.1 vs. 27.7%; p < 0.0001), 2 positive lymph nodes on SLNB (32.9 vs. 17.3%, p < 0.0001) and receipt or recommendation of chemotherapy (66.5 vs. 52.2%, p < 0.0001) were associated with higher likelihood of ALND. After propensity score matching, ALND was associated with superior survival compared with SLNB (5-year overall survival of 83.8 vs. 76.0%; log-rank p = 0.0104).

Discussion

The results of this study suggest that among patients with early-stage MBC with limited sentinel lymph node metastasis, ALND is associated with superior survival compared with SLNB alone. These findings indicate that it may be inappropriate to extrapolate the results of the ACOSOG Z0011 and EORTC AMAROS trials to MBC.

### Impact of the American college of surgeons oncology group Z0011 criteria applied to a contemporary patient population [^114akmK9]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial concluded that axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) may not be necessary for all patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis undergoing breast-conserving therapy (BCT). The aim of this study was to assess applicability of Z0011 results to our patient population and determine what percentage may be affected by these results.

Study Design

Patients with clinical T1-2, N0 breast cancer, treated with surgery first between 1994 and 2009, who had 1 to 2 positive SLNs, were included in this study. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated and log-rank used to compare overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for ALND vs SLN dissection (SLND) alone in 2 patient populations: patients undergoing BCT or total mastectomy (TM) and patients undergoing BCT only.

Results

Of 861 patients, 188 (21.8%) underwent SLND alone. Of 488 (56.7%) patients who underwent BCT, 125 (25.6%) had SLND alone. Of 412 patients undergoing TM, 67 (16.3%) had SLND alone. Patients undergoing ALND were significantly younger, had larger tumors, macrometastasis, and extranodal extension in both populations. Compared with the Z0011 cohort, our BCT patients had more T1 tumors (76.0% vs 69.3%, p = 0.01) and more grade II to III tumors (87.3% vs 76.2%, p < 0.0001). After adjusting for T-stage, there were no significant differences in DFS and OS between patients undergoing SLND alone or ALND in both populations.

Conclusions

Examination of our breast cancer patients with Z0011 trial criteria suggests that almost 75% of SLN-positive patients would be candidates to avoid ALND if they undergo BCT.

### Axillary lymph node dissection in breast cancer patients [^1147kag6]. ASBrS (2018). Medium credibility.

American Society of Breast Surgeons resource guide — Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) indications in breast cancer: ALND has largely been replaced by sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for patients with cN0 breast cancer but is still required for a significant proportion of all breast cancer patients. Current indications for ALND are as follows: the clinically node-positive axilla confirmed by fine needle aspiration or core biopsy in a patient for whom neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not planned; occult breast cancer presenting as axillary node metastasis; SLN positive patients who fall outside the Z0011 selection criteria (i.e. > 2 SLN positive, matted nodes, mastectomy, or breast conservation without whole-breast RT); inflammatory, clinical stage T4, or high-risk T3 breast cancer; failed SLN mapping; inadequate prior ALND with residual clinically suspicious nodes; sentinel or axillary nodes which remain positive after neoadjuvant chemotherapy; and axillary recurrence following previous breast cancer treatment.

### Axillary recurrence after a tumor-positive sentinel lymph node biopsy without axillary treatment: a review of the literature [^116ZYhZL]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Since the 1990s, the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become the standard staging procedure for patients with invasive breast cancer. According to the current treatment guidelines, treatment of the axilla in case of a negative SLNB can be safely omitted. A positive SLNB indicates that completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) has to be performed. In case of four or more positive lymph nodes in the dissection specimen, adjuvant radiotherapy of the supra- and infraclavicular lymph nodes is indicated. Axillary radiotherapy is possibly an appropriate alternative for cALND. In the AMAROS trial cALND and axillary radiotherapy were compared; the main objective was to show equivalent locoregional control and reduced morbidity after radiotherapy. The final results of this trial have not yet been established. Although a cALND not only provides additional prognostic information, it could also optimize regional control and potentially improve overall survival. However, in 15–20% of the cases, a cALND leads to long-term complications such as pain, paresthesia due to intercostobrachial nerve injury, impairment of the shoulder function, or lymphedema.

The axillary recurrence rate (ARR) after a cALND has been performed in patients with a positive SLNB is low. Recent publications show rates that vary between 0.2 and 0.9% for micrometastatic disease of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) and around 1.0% in case of macrometastatic disease.–These results are comparable with results from older studies in which all patients had been treated with ALNDs. Patients with positive axillary lymph nodes are usually treated with adjuvant systemic therapy: hormone therapy, chemotherapy or both. Although this might be an important factor for the low recurrence rate in the axilla, in case of breast conservative treatment radiotherapy itself on the breast is considered an important reason for a low ARR.

Recently, several studies in patients with a positive SLNB who predominantly underwent breast conservative treatment have reported a low ARR when cALND had not been performed.–A prospective randomized trial (ACOSOG Z0011) tried to investigate whether cALND could safely be omitted in these patients. The trial was closed early as a result of slow accrual. The slow accrual probably implies that in daily practice there is still concern about the safety of omitting a cALND. Because interest is growing in omitting a cALND even if the SLNB is positive, this systematic review article aims to determine the ARR after a cALND has been omitted in SLNB-positive patients.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^116ixuij]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — ALND in mastectomy candidates: ALND is not necessary and can be omitted in patients with clinically node-negative invasive breast cancer ≤ 5 cm who receive mastectomy and have one to two positive sentinel nodes, and postmastectomy RT (PMRT) with regional nodal irradiation (RNI) can be offered (Evidence quality: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong). In patients with T1-T2, pN1 disease undergoing mastectomy but not receiving PMRT or RNI, completion ALND is recommended (Evidence quality: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong). ALND should be performed and followed by PMRT for patients who receive mastectomy and have ≥ 3 positive nodes (Evidence quality: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong).

### Application of ACOSOG Z0011 criteria reduces perioperative costs [^117QjUYR]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The ACOSOG Z0011 (Z0011) trial concluded that sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) without completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) provides excellent regional control in women with T1-T2 sentinel lymph node (SLN) positive breast cancers receiving breast conservation therapy. We determined whether application of Z0011 guidelines would reduce costs.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of patients with invasive breast cancer treated with lumpectomy and SLNB at our institution during 2009 was performed. We determined the number of overnight hospital admissions following ALND and estimated costs pertaining to the perioperative surgical management of the axilla patients actually received, and compared those to the estimated number of inpatient days and perioperative costs if Z0011 guidelines had been followed for eligible patients. The 2011 Medicare Fee Schedule was used to estimate costs for procedures, and costs for OR time were estimated using procedure length and cost of OR time per minute.

Results

A total of 71 patients underwent lumpectomy with SLNB and had at least 1 positive SLN. Estimated costs related to perioperative surgical management of the axilla were $322,775, and there were 36 overnight admissions. Applying Z0011 criteria, 51 patients (72%) would have been eligible to forego completion ALND. Estimated costs would have been $264,513 with 13 overnight admissions, translating into a cost savings of $58,262 and 23 fewer overnight admissions.

Conclusion

Application of Z0011 guidelines resulted in cost savings, with a 64% reduction in inpatient hospital days and an 18% reduction in early perioperative costs.

### Omitting axillary dissection in breast cancer with sentinel-node metastases [^115wGUzD]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Trials evaluating the omission of completion axillary-lymph-node dissection in patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer and sentinel-lymph-node metastases have been compromised by limited statistical power, uncertain nodal radiotherapy target volumes, and a scarcity of data on relevant clinical subgroups.

Methods

We conducted a noninferiority trial in which patients with clinically node-negative primary T1 to T3 breast cancer (tumor size, T1, ≤ 20 mm; T2, 21 to 50 mm; and T3, > 50 mm in the largest dimension) with one or two sentinel-node macrometastases (metastasis size, > 2 mm in the largest dimension) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to completion axillary-lymph-node dissection or its omission (sentinel-node biopsy only). Adjuvant treatment and radiation therapy were used in accordance with national guidelines. The primary end point was overall survival. We report here the per-protocol and modified intention-to-treat analyses of the prespecified secondary end point of recurrence-free survival. To show noninferiority of sentinel-node biopsy only, the upper boundary of the confidence interval for the hazard ratio for recurrence or death had to be below 1.44.

Results

Between January 2015 and December 2021, a total of 2766 patients were enrolled across five countries. The per-protocol population included 2540 patients, of whom 1335 were assigned to undergo sentinel-node biopsy only and 1205 to undergo completion axillary-lymph-node dissection (dissection group). Radiation therapy including nodal target volumes was administered to 1192 of 1326 patients (89.9%) in the sentinel-node biopsy-only group and to 1058 of 1197 (88.4%) in the dissection group. The median follow-up was 46.8 months (range, 1.5 to 94.5). Overall, 191 patients had recurrence or died. The estimated 5-year recurrence-free survival was 89.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 87.5 to 91.9) in the sentinel-node biopsy-only group and 88.7% (95% CI, 86.3 to 91.1) in the dissection group, with a country-adjusted hazard ratio for recurrence or death of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.66 to 1.19), which was significantly (P < 0.001) below the prespecified noninferiority margin.

Conclusions

The omission of completion axillary-lymph-node dissection was noninferior to the more extensive surgery in patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer who had sentinel-node macrometastases, most of whom received nodal radiation therapy.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy versus axillary lymph node dissection in breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy with one to two metastatic sentinel lymph nodes: sub-analysis of the SINODAR-ONE multicentre randomized clinical trial and reopening of enrolment [^113tYcGF]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Over the past two decades, the management of early BC has focused on less radical surgeries and axillary management has undergone a paradigm shift along this path. The results of the SINODAR-ONE and ACOSOG Z0011 clinical trials have suggested that ALND can be avoided in cN0 patients with up to two macroscopically positive SLNs who undergo BCS. For patients treated with mastectomy, the clinical value of ALND has not been well defined. There is still controversy over the de-escalation of axillary surgery in patients receiving mastectomy with one to two macrometastatic SLNs, and it remains unclear whether these results can be safely applied to these patients.

Retrospective analyses have, however, evaluated the outcomes of BC patients selected for mastectomy with omission of ALND, despite one to two SLN macrometastases. Gao et al.performed a large multi-institutional study on 1161 BC patients with one to two positive SLNs. Overall, 763 patients underwent mastectomy, of which 84 received SLNB only. There were no differences in adjusted RFS and OS between the SLNB-only and ALND groups, thus indicating that omitting ALND has no impact on oncological outcomes. To note, 26 of 84 (31.0 per cent) patients treated with mastectomy and SLNB merely had micrometastases in the SLNs. Milgrom et al.analysed the outcome of 535 patients with early-stage BC and positive SLNs, treated with breast surgery (210 treated with mastectomy and 325 treated with BCS), who did not receive ALND. Patients treated with mastectomy had favourable oncological outcomes even in the absence of ALND. Axillary failure rates did not differ significantly from patients selected for BCS. The 4-year local and regional failure rates were 1.7 and 1.2 per cent among patients treated with mastectomy and 1.4 and 1.0 per cent among patients treated with BCS respectively. FitzSullivan et al.evaluated 525 patients with BC and positive SLNs treated with mastectomy, including 58 patients who did not undergo ALND and/or axillary RT. At a median follow-up of 66 months, the incidence of axillary recurrences was not statistically different between patients who did not receive further axillary treatment and those who underwent ALND or axillary RT (10-year rate 3.8 versus 1.6 versus 0 per cent respectively).

### Age and receptor status Do not indicate the need for axillary dissection in patients with sentinel lymph node metastases [^116tUhsd]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial demonstrated the safety of omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for women with fewer than three positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) who are undergoing breast-conservation therapy (BCT). Because most of the women were postmenopausal with estrogen receptor (ER) positive cancers, applicability of ALND for younger patients and those with triple-negative (TN) or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing (HER2+) tumors remains controversial.

Methods

From August 2010 to December 2015, patients undergoing BCT for cT1-2N0 disease and found to have positive SLNs were prospectively followed. Axillary lymph node dissection was indicated for more than two positive SLNs or gross extracapsular extension. Clinicopathologic characteristics, axillary surgery, nodal burden, and outcomes were compared between the high-risk patients (TN, HER2+, or age < 50 years) and the remaining patients, termed average risk patients.

Results

Among 701 consecutive patients, 242 (35%) were high risk: 31 (13%) with TN, 48 (20%) with HER2+, 130 (54%) with age less than 50 years, and 33 (14%) with more than one high-risk feature. The remaining 459 patients (65%) were average risk. The high-risk patients were younger, had higher-grade tumors (p < 0.0001), and more often had abnormal nodes imaged (p = 0.02). In this study, SLNB alone was performed for 85% high-risk versus 82% average-risk cases (p = 0.39). A median of four versus three SLNs were excised (p = 0.04), and both groups had a median of one positive SLN. Additional positive nodes at ALND were found in 62% high-risk patients versus 65% average-risk patients (p = 0.8), with a median of three positive nodes in both groups. During a median follow-up period of 31 months, no patients experienced isolated axillary recurrences.

Conclusions

Axillary lymph node dissection was no more likely to be indicated for high-risk patients. For patients undergoing ALND, the nodal burden was similar. For patients otherwise meeting the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 clinical eligibility criteria, ALND is not indicated on the basis of age or subtype.

### Impact of axillary dissection among patients with sentinel node-positive breast cancer undergoing mastectomy [^111WvT5K]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Results of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial supports omission of completion axillary lymph node dissection (CLND) after breast-conservation surgery with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). We hypothesized that CLND also does not impact outcomes in women with clinically node-negative (cN0), pathologically node-positive breast cancer undergoing mastectomy.

Materials and Methods

A single-institution retrospective review was performed of patients with SLN-positive breast cancer treated from July 1999 through May 2018. Clinicopathologic and outcome data were collected. Patients with SLNBs were compared with those receiving SLNB and CLND. The Kruskal-Wallis, chi-square, and Fisher exact tests were used to assess for differences between continuous and categorical variables. The log-rank test was used for time-to-event analyses, and Cox proportional hazards models were fit for locoregional and distant recurrence and overall survival (OS).

Results

Of 329 patients with SLN-positive breast cancer undergoing mastectomy, 60% had CLND (n = 201). Median age at diagnosis was 53 years (interquartile range [IQR], 46–62 years). The median number of SLNs sampled was 3 (IQR, 2–4), and the median number of positive SLNs was 1 (IQR, 1–2). Patients receiving CLND had higher tumor grades (P = 0.02) and a higher proportion of hormone receptor negativity (estrogen receptor, 19%; progesterone receptor, 27%; both P = 0.007). A total of 44 patients (22%) had increased N stage after CLND. Median follow-up was 51 months (IQR, 29–83 months). No association was found between CLND and change in OS and locoregional or distant recurrence. Completion of postmastectomy radiotherapy was associated with improved OS (P = 0.04).

Conclusions

CLND is not significantly correlated with reduced recurrence or improved OS among patients who have cN0, SLN-positive breast cancer treated with mastectomy. CLND was significantly correlated with receipt of adjuvant systemic therapy. Completion of postmastectomy radiotherapy was associated with improved OS.

### Adherence rate to alliance for clinical trials in oncology Z0011 trial based on breast cancer subtype [^1168ym3L]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 (ACOSOG Z0011 or Z11) trial demonstrated no survival advantage with completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for patients with T1-2 breast cancer, 1 to 2 positive SLNs who received adjuvant chemoradiation therapy. More than 70% of the cohort had estrogen receptor (ER)+ tumors. There is paucity of data on the adherence rate to Z11, as well as a dearth of data on the applicability of Z11 for the different subtypes. We conducted a large hospital-based study to evaluate the adherence rate to Z11 based on subtypes.

Study Design

The National Cancer Database was queried to evaluate 33,859 patients diagnosed with T1-2, N1, and M0 breast cancer treated with lumpectomy with negative margins, and adjuvant chemoradiation therapy between 2012 and 2018. Patients were classified into 3 groups: (1) ER+/HER2-, (2) ER-/HER2-, and (3) HER2+ regardless of ER status. The revised Scope of the Regional Lymph Node Surgery 2012 was used to classify patients into those who underwent an SLN or ALND. Differences in use of ALND by subtypes were compared. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to compare overall survival (OS). A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

For ER+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-, ER-/HER2-, and HER2+ tumors, the rate of ALND was 43.6%, 50.2%, and 47.8%, respectively. The 5-year OS for SLN and ALND for the entire cohort was 94.0% and 93.1% (p = 0.0004); for ER+/HER2-, it was 95.4% and 94.7% (p = 0.04); for ER-/HER2-, it was 84.1% and 84.3% (p = 0.41); for HER2+, it was 94.2% and 93.2% (p = 0.20). Multivariable cox proportional hazard regression analysis demonstrated no significant survival differences between SLN and ALND (p = 0.776).

Conclusions

Z11 is applicable for women with early N1 disease, regardless of subtypes. ALND did not confer a survival advantage over SLN. Despite this, up to 50% of patients who fit Z11 criteria continue to undergo ALND.

### Is preoperative axillary imaging beneficial in identifying clinically node-negative patients requiring axillary lymph node dissection? [^112G6Mms]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Background

American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 results support the omission of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in women with less than 3 positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and radiation therapy. We sought to determine if abnormal axillary imaging is predictive of the need for ALND in this population.

Study Design

Patients with cT1-2N0 breast cancer by physical examination undergoing BCS were managed according to Z0011 criteria independent of axillary imaging. Patient characteristics and rates of ALND were compared among those with and without abnormal lymph nodes (LNs) detected by mammogram, ultrasound (US), or MRI. All available axillary imaging was reviewed by 1 breast radiologist.

Results

Between August 2010 and December 2013, 3,253 breast cancer patients were treated with BCS and SLN biopsy; 425 patients met Z0011 criteria (cT1-2N0) and had nodal metastasis on SLN biopsy. Clinicopathologic features were median patient age, 58 years; median tumor size, 1.8 cm; 85% ductal histology; and 89% estrogen receptor positive. All women had a mammogram, 242 had axillary US, 172 had MRI. Abnormal LNs were seen on 7%, 25%, and 30% of mammograms, US, and MRIs, respectively. Although abnormal LNs on mammogram or US were associated with a significant increase in ALND and a non-significant trend was seen with MRI, 68% to 73% of women with abnormal axillary imaging did not require ALND.

Conclusions

Among clinically node-negative patients with abnormal axillary imaging, 71% did not meet criteria for ALND and were spared further surgical morbidity. Abnormal nodes on US, MRI, or mammogram in clinically node-negative patients are not reliable indicators of the need for ALND.

### Sentinel node dissection in early-stage breast cancer: ongoing prospective randomized trials in the USA [^113VcVXW]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

One of the most important advances in the surgical treatment of early-stage breast cancer has been the introduction of sentinel lymph node dissection as an alternative to routine axillary node dissection. This minimally invasive procedure may reduce the morbidity of surgical treatment and improve staging of the axillary lymph node basin. Over the last 5 to 7 years, numerous institutions have published their sentinel node identification rates, false-negative events, optimal techniques, and learning curves. Many of these issues need confirmation in a prospective multicentered fashion and other issues such as survival and comparative toxicities require prospective randomized trials. Two prospective randomized trials using sentinel node biopsy have been implemented in the United States: the NSABP B-32 trial and the ACOSOG Z0010/Z0011 trials. Design, hypotheses, and rationale for these trials are discussed.

### Sentinel node involvement with or without completion axillary lymph node dissection: treatment and pathologic results of randomized SERC trial [^111fAT85]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The most commonly accepted prognostic factors for proposing adjuvant systemic therapy in breast cancer (BC) include patient age, tumor size, axillary lymph node status, tumor pathology including grade, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), endocrine receptor (ER) status, Her2 status, and proliferation assays such as the Ki67 labeling index –. Axillary lymph node involvement remains a major prognostic factor.

Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the recommended surgical procedure for patients with BC with clinically N0 status based on results of randomized studies, without completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND).

Axillary lymph node involvement rate in early BC is about 35–36%, with 3% pN0(i+), 8% pN1mi, and 24% pN1. Since results of randomized ACOSOG-Z0011 trial, cALND is less frequently performed for patients with primary breast conservation therapy and one or two involved sentinel nodes (SNs) by micro- or macro-metastases without extracapsular extension with whole breast radiotherapy and systemic adjuvant treatment (endocrine therapy and or chemotherapy). Results of IBCSG 23–01 confirmed the non-inferiority of cALND omission for patients with SN isolated tumor cells (ITC) or micro-metastases. However, some limitations to conclude non-inferiority of cALND omission in comparison with cALND were reported, particularly for patients with SN micro-metastases and total mastectomy, related to the very low number of patients included in this situation in IBCSG 23–01 trial. Moreover, neither trial had included patients with SN macro-metastases and total mastectomy or patients with more than two involved SN by macro-metastases and or extracapsular extension.

Before results with 10-years follow-up of these two randomized trial, we started the SERC randomized trial of cALND versus no cALND for patients with SN involvement, whatever the size of metastasis, and with breast conservative surgery or mastectomy. The aim of this study was to analyze treatment delivered and pathologic results of patients included in SERC trial.

### ASO author reflections: trends of axillary treatment in sentinel node-positive breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy [^1149vt7F]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Past

During the last decade, the necessity to perform axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in clinically node-negative (cN0) patients with sentinel lymph node metastases (SLN+) is debated worldwide. For patients with early breast cancer undergoing breast-conserving therapy (BCT), the ACOSOG-Z0011 trial has allowed for avoidance of unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with 1–2 positive SLNs without compromising outcome. The AMAROS trial investigated axillary radiotherapy (RT) versus ALND in patients with tumor-affected SLNs and showed that axillary RT could serve as a safe alternative to ALND with less morbidity. Since 2012, both national and international guidelines suggest no further axillary treatment in patients meeting the Z0011 criteria or advocate regional radiotherapy (RT) as alternative therapy for ALND. As patients treated with mastectomy were not included in the Z0011 and underrepresented in the AMAROS trial (with only 18% receiving mastectomy), evidence regarding the omission of ALND in this subset of patients is scarce. In the present study, we aimed to explore patterns of axillary treatment in Dutch patients with SLN+ breast cancer undergoing mastectomy.

### What to Do with non-visualized sentinel nodes? A Dutch nationwide survey study [^112UuR8m]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The present study shows the results of a nationwide survey, which was distributed among certified oncological (breast) surgeons in The Netherlands, regarding routine practice during the SLN procedure and the axillary treatment in case of a non-visualized and non-retrieved SLN. The data show that respondents are currently more reserved in performing a complete ALND in case of a non-vSLN compared with the period prior to publication of the Z0011 trial. Moreover, the indication to perform an ALND nowadays mostly depends on clinicopathological factors.

The Z0011 trial caused a paradigm shift in the axillary treatment of clinically node-negative but SLN-positive patients. This trial compared the effects of ALND after SLNB versus SLNB alone on (disease-free) survival and concluded that omitting the ALND in some of these patients did not negatively affect (disease-free) survival. Patients in whom the ALND could be omitted can be selected by using the so-called 'Z0011 criteria': (i) invasive breast cancer; (ii) clinical tumor size ≤ 5 cm (T1–2); (iii) no palpable lymphadenopathy; (iv) one or two positive sentinel nodes; and (v) treated with lumpectomy. In addition, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) AMAROS (After Mapping of the Axilla: Radiotherapy or Surgery) trial showed that in SLN positive patients with T1–2 invasive breast cancer without lymphadenopathy, administering axillary radiotherapy was not inferior to an ALND in providing locoregional disease control. Next to these two studies, numerous other studies have shown that the ALND is no longer absolutely necessary in every breast cancer patient and, consequently, various prediction models and scoring systems have been developed to select patients in whom the ALND could be omitted.–Although these studies provide a promising perspective for breast cancer patients, as the ALND can cause significant morbidity, they only included patients with a positive SLN, thereby disregarding clinically node-negative patients in whom the SLN could not be retrieved.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy versus axillary lymph node dissection in breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy with one to two metastatic sentinel lymph nodes: sub-analysis of the SINODAR-ONE multicentre randomized clinical trial and reopening of enrolment [^115cdbhv]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has always been part of breast cancer (BC) treatment. Two large RCTs demonstrated no survival or recurrence advantage of ALND over less extensive surgery in BC patients with clinically negative nodes (cN0). Despite this, ALND remained the routine operation for axillary staging and locoregional control in BC treatment, conferring a high morbidity burden, due to frequent lymphoedema, pain, nerve damage, and decreased range of motion. In the 1990s, sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB) was introduced into the BC surgical treatment algorithm. In prospective RCTs, this simple and accurate axillary staging procedure was compared with ALND. Equivalent regional control, recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) was shown if the SLN was negative.

Efforts to limit redundant axillary surgical management have been ongoing over the last decade. The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial randomized 891 women with cN0 BC and up to two positive SLNs detected after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) to either ALND or observation. No statistically significant difference in OS was found after 9.3 years of follow-up. The SINODAR-ONE RCT was designed to overcome limitations of the Z0011 study by enrolling BC patients undergoing both BCS and mastectomy. The initial study results showed similar outcomes (3-year survival, regional recurrence, and distant recurrence rates) in BC patients with T1–2 tumours and one to two SLN macrometastases treated with BCS and SLNB only when compared with those treated with ALND. According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2017 guidelines, there is insufficient evidence to recommend no further axillary surgery beyond SLNB for women with early BC and one to two SLN metastases selected for mastectomy. Management of the axilla in patients with cN0 T1–2 BC with positive SLNB operated on with mastectomy is highly debated. Recent retrospective studies have demonstrated that ALND does not improve post-mastectomy survival outcomes among patients with a positive SLNB. The use of ALND in these patients has, moreover, steadily decreased in routine clinical practice. To extend the recommendation of ALND omission even in patients treated with mastectomy, a sub-analysis of the SINODAR-ONE trial is presented here.

### Regional recurrence rates with or without complete axillary dissection for breast cancer patients with node-positive disease on sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy [^1145W4wt]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Current standard of care for node-positive disease identified on SLNB after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer consists of completion axillary dissection. Our study demonstrates that when carefully selected, patients with a positive lymph node on SLNB after neoadjuvant chemotherapy have excellent regional control and disease-free survival even when completion ALND is omitted. We found that regional failure rate did not differ significantly according to extent of axillary surgery, with 3-year regional control rates of 90.2% and 95.5% for patients who were managed with SLNB alone and SLNB plus ALND, respectively, and subsequently received regional nodal irradiation.

Axillary dissection comes at the cost of significant morbidity, with acute complication rates ranging from 20% to 30% and risk of chronic lymphedema in 1 out of 4 patients. For these reasons, use of axillary dissection has declined in favor of SLNB for patients with early stage breast cancer treated in the upfront setting. The ACOSOG Z0011 trial demonstrated that among patients with 1 to 2 positive sentinel lymph nodes treated with breast conservation therapy, sentinel node dissection alone is noninferior to full axillary dissection, and the AMAROS trial (NCT00014612) showed that ALND and axillary radiation therapy after positive SLNB offered excellent and comparable axillary control.

However, these studies supporting omission of ALND are based on patients treated in the upfront setting, not after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Outcome data on the risk of regional recurrence for node-positive disease found on SLNB after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is currently limited. This has to do with the fact that use of SLNB for clinically node-positive disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy did not become more widespread until after publication of the ACOSOG Z1071 and SENTINA trials, which showed the feasibility of this approach. However, these trials' results were not ideal, demonstrating a false-negative rate of 13% to 14%, which did not meet the predefined acceptable threshold of < 10%. Our study offers some reassurance that using SLNB to assess nodal disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an acceptable approach, considering our overall 3-year regional control rate was high at 95.1%.

### American college of surgeons oncology group (ACOSOG) Z0011: impact on surgeon practice patterns [^111d4CTC]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The ACOSOG Z0011 trial has been described as practice-changing. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of the trial on surgeon practice patterns at our institution.

Methods

This is a review of practice patterns comparing the year before release of Z0011 to the year after an institutional multidisciplinary meeting discussing the results. Patients meeting Z0011 inclusion criteria were identified. Clinicopathologic data were compared between the cohorts.

Results

There were 658 patients with clinical T1-2 tumors planned for breast conservation: 335 in the pre-Z0011 cohort and 323 post-Z0011. Sixty-two (19%) patients were sentinel lymph node (SLN) positive in the pre-Z0011 group versus 42 (13%) post-Z0011 (p = 0.06). Before Z0011, 85% (53/62) of SLN-positive patients underwent axillary node dissection (ALND) versus 24% (10/42) after Z0011 (p < 0.001). After Z0011, surgeons were more likely to perform ALND on patients with larger tumors (2.2 vs. 1.5 cm, p = 0.09), lobular histology (p = 0.01), fewer SLNs (1 vs. 3, p = 0.09), larger SLN metastasis size (4 vs. 2.5 mm, p = 0.19), extranodal extension present (20 vs. 6%, p = 0.16), or a higher probability of positive non-SLNs (p = 0.03). Surgeons were less likely to perform intraoperative nodal assessment post-Z0011 (26 vs. 69%, p < 0.001) resulting in decreased median operative times for SLN-negative patients (79 vs. 92 min, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Surgeons at our institution have implemented Z0011 results for the majority of patients; however, clinicopathologic factors still impact the decision to perform ALND. Z0011 results have significantly impacted practice by decreasing rates of ALND, use of intraoperative nodal evaluation, and operative times.

### Applicability of the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria in women with high-risk node-positive breast cancer undergoing breast conserving surgery [^117WETEA]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The relevance of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial in patients with high-risk breast cancer has been questioned. We hypothesize that Z0011 applies to women with HER2-positive disease (HER2+), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and/or age < 50 years at diagnosis (YA).

Methods

Women with node-positive HER2+, TNBC, or YA were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Patients were grouped based on Z0011 trial eligibility criteria into those meeting criteria (eligible) and those who did not (ineligible). Patient and tumor characteristics were compared; survival of those meeting Z0011 criteria was determined.

Results

We identified 186 node-positive women undergoing lumpectomy/radiation for high-risk breast cancer: 57 of 186 (31%) HER2+, 55 of 186 (30%) TNBC, 74 of 186 (40%) YA. Overall, 125 of 186 (67%) met Z0011 criteria. HER2-positivity was associated with the lowest rate of ineligibility compared with TNBC and YA (16 vs. 53 and 31%, respectively, p < 0.01). Larger tumor size, high grade, extranodal extension, and high Ki67 were associated with Z0011 ineligibility. Among those who were eligible, 105 of 125 (84%) had ALND and 48 of 125 (38%) had involvement of nonsentinel nodes (NSLN); median number of NSLNs involved was one (range 1–3). With median follow-up of 5.5 years, there was no difference in survival between those who had ALND and those who did not. After patients with clinically palpable nodes were excluded, 125 of 149 (84%) met criteria.

Conclusions

The Z0011 trial eligibility requirements apply to a significant proportion of patients with HER2+, TNBC, and YA. ALND can be avoided in 67% node-positive cases and in 84% of those with clinically negative nodes.

### The feasibility of the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria for omitting axillary lymph node dissection after positive sentinel lymph node biopsy in Chinese breast cancer patients: a multicenter study… [^116YEvwn]. ASCO (2015). Low credibility.

Abstract e12058 Background: The ACOSOG Z0011 trial has been described as practice-changing of sentinel lymph nodes positive breast cancers. This study was undertaken to examine current practice pattern in China, evaluate the impact of Z0011 on practice, and determine the exportability of the Z0011criteria for selecting Chinese patients who are eligible for omitting axillary lymph node dissection with positive SLNs. Methods: A electronic survey about Z0011 trial was distributed to members of Surgical Group of Breast Cancer attached to Chinese Preventive Medicine Association. Surgeons were questioned about the impact of the trial results on their practice. At the mean time, we collected 658 consecutive patients with ALND after positive SLN biopsy from five centers' database and grouped them as eligible or ineligible for omitting ALND according to Z0011 criteria.

The eligible group was compared with the cohort included in the Z0011 trial and with the ineligible group. Results: Of the 427 respondents, 116 answered familiarity with Z0011 data. 106 would not routinely perform ALND in patients meeting Z0011 criteria before learning of the trial results and after learning of the trial, 130 would not routinely perform ALND in such patients. Among the 658 patients enrolled in this study, 151 patients were potentially eligible for omitting ALND and 507 patients were still needed to have ALND. The estrogen receptor status, T stage, and number of positive lymph nodes and positive non-SLNs were not statistically different between the eligible group and the Z0011 cohort. Compared with the eligible Group in this study, the ineligible group had significantly more T2 and T3 stage tumors, positive LNs and positive non-SLNs.

Conclusions: Applying Z0011 criteria to Chinese patients could select the ones with similar clinical characteristics as Z0011 cohort and it suggests good exportability of Z0011criteria for Chinese patients omitting ALND. But maybe due to the slight impact of Z0011 trial on Chinese surgeons' practice, it still need time to have the criteria feasible in China.

### Axillary lymph node coverage with 3-dimensional tangential field irradiation and correlation with heart and lung dose [^1131GGFt]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The results of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial changed surgical management of the axilla in patients with early breast cancer. Multiple previous trials demonstrated that the omission of axillary LN dissection had no adverse effect in women with negative lymph nodes (LNs). The ACOSOG Z0011 trial randomized patients with T1 or T2 breast cancer who were treated with breast-conserving surgery and sentinel LN (SLN) dissection (SLND) with a positive SLN to either axillary LN dissection (ALND) or no axillary-specific treatment. The protocol specified that third-field radiation would not be used. All patients received opposing-field whole breast radiation. At a median follow-up of 6.3 years, there was no statistically significant difference in local or regional recurrence between the 2 groups. Ten-year follow-up demonstrated that locoregional control and survival with SLND alone was comparable to that with ALND.

A postprotocol analysis of radiation field design of enrolled patients showed that high tangents (ie, cranial tangent borders ≤ 2 cm from the humeral head) were used in 50% of patients assigned to the ALND arm and 52.6% of patients assigned to the SLND only arm. Third-field radiation was used in 18.9% of patients, 22 in the ALND arm and 21 in the SLND arm. There were no significant differences in these deviations between the 2 groups. A review of the protocol deviations showed that 11% of patients did not receive radiation, which was required by the protocol, and 18.9% of patients received third-field radiation, including areas outside of those specified by the protocol; patients were equally distributed in both arms. Omission of radiation was associated with increased local recurrence risk and reduced overall survival. The addition of third-field radiation did not improve survival.

### Do the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria affect the number of sentinel lymph nodes removed? [^111r27FC]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

We sought to determine if adoption of the Z0011 criteria was associated with removal of more sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs).

Methods

In a retrospective review of a prospective database of breast cancer patients treated at our institution from 2006 to 2013, we identified 5213 eligible patients who elected to undergo breast-conserving surgery; 2372 were treated pre-Z0011 and 2841 post-Z0011. Clinicopathologic factors were collected, and univariate and multivariate models were fit to identify variables associated with number of SLNs removed.

Results

Median patient age, 60 years, did not differ between groups. Median tumor size was similar in both groups: 1.1 (0.05–5.0) cm in the pre-Z0011 group and 1.2 (0.1–5.2) cm in the post-Z0011 group. The mean number of SLNs excised in the pre-Z0011 patients was 2.8 compared with 2.9 in post-Z0011 patients (p = 0.01). Three or fewer lymph nodes were removed in 1771 (75%) pre-Z0011 patients compared with 2006 (71%) post-Z0011 patients (p = 0.01). Factors associated with the removal of more SLNs on multivariate analysis included adoption of ACOSOG Z0011 criteria (p = 0.03), young age (p ≤ 0.0001), and large tumor size (p = 0.0005). Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was performed in 379 (16%) patients pre-Z0011 compared with 68 (2%) node-positive post-Z0011 patients (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Since the adoption of Z0011 criteria, we found significantly fewer patients undergoing ALND for positive SLNs. We noted a significant, slight shift in the removal of ≥ 4 SLNs. The Z0011 criteria were not associated with a clinically significant increase in the number of SLNs removed.

### Nomograms for preoperative prediction of axillary nodal status in breast cancer [^114Fnq7Z]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

In patients with a clinically negative axilla, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has been replaced by sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) as an axillary staging procedure 1, 2. Even though there is concordance between metastatic involvement of the axilla and the prognostic outcome, the quantitative relationship remains controversial. There has been a fundamental shift in management of the axilla since the introduction of SLNB. An increasing number of reports have questioned the need for ALND after a positive SLNB result, including those from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial 3, 4 and the International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG) trial 23‐01 5, which compared ALND versus no further axillary surgery, whereas the AMAROS (After Mapping of the Axilla: Radiotherapy or Surgery?) trial 6 compared ALND versus postoperative axillary radiotherapy. The results from the ACOSOG Z0011 trial suggested that ALND might be omitted without a negative impact on prognosis in selected patients with a limited number of sentinel node metastases undergoing breast‐conserving surgery and postoperative radiotherapy.

### Multicenter prospective evaluation of the reliability of the combined use of two models to predict non-sentinel lymph node status in breast cancer patients with metastatic sentinel lymph nodes: the MSKCC nomogram and the tenon score. results of the NOTEGS study [^111VDLcL]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

The other finding is the low proportion of patients selected by the MSKCC nomogram and the Tenon score for omission of ALND (26.9% and 46.7%, respectively). The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group led the multicenter Z0011 trial to determine the effects of ALND on overall survival in patients with one or two positive SLN. The use of SLND alone compared with ALND did not result in inferior survival and locoregional control. For micrometastasis only, IBCSG 23–01 provided similar results Using the Z0011 eligibility criteria, ∼70% of patients are eligible for omitting completion ALND. The rate was 13.5% in our study using the combined approach, far beyond a selection based on Z011 criteria that has been endorsed by most guidelines. This over selection is clearly a limitation of the use of models in clinical practice. The absence of benefit in terms of survival between SLNB alone and complete ALND in Z011, IBCSG 23–01 and in all non-randomised studies limits the additional information gained from ALND to the number of nodes containing metastases. However, this prognostic information, obtained at the cost of an increase in morbidity, is unlikely to change systemic therapy decisions. Moreover, there is no improvement in axillary recurrence and DFS by ALND when the nodal invasion is micrometastatic or limited to a few lymph nodes. This suggests that this limited burden of disease is likely to be controlled with systemic therapy and RT. Other authors have suggested that it is more important to identify patients at risk of pN2 disease (⩾4 metastatic nodes). Other models, and particularly those that integrate extracapsular extension of the tumour in the SN, or those designed to predict the risk of ⩾4 metastatic nodes, have to be tested in this series.

In conclusion, we demonstrated in this controlled prospective trial that in metastatic SN patients with both a ≤ 10% probability of metastatic non-SN with the MSKCC nomogram and a Tenon score ≤ 3.5, the FRR was statistically over 5% and resulted in a selection that was not compatible with clinical practice. Even evaluated separately, the discrimination, calibration and clinical utility of the Tenon score and the MSKCC nomogram was moderate.

### Accurate staging of axillary lymph nodes from breast cancer patients using a novel molecular method [^114bSeWi]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

In breast cancer, the number of axillary lymph-node metastases is the most powerful prognostic factor and nodal tumour burden is a continuous variable of prognosis. Sentinel lymph-node (SN) biopsy is the standard axillary staging procedure for patients with clinically node-negative early-stage breast cancer. Current guidelines recommend completion axillary lymph-node dissection (CALND) for patients with SN metastases. This procedure is considered valuable in achieving regional control and obtaining accurate nodal staging for the selection of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy, which leads to improved survival of node-positive patients. In addition, identifying tumour spread to non-SNs beyond the SNs seems to be an independent determinant of patient outcome.

Recently, however, the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z-0011 randomised trial, which was designed to compare survival in SN-positive patients who did or did not undergo CALND, has found no difference in locoregional recurrence rates and survivals between the two study arms. However, a more careful consideration is required for accurate node staging after CALND to determine treatments for SN-positive patients. Patients enrolled in this trial were limited, and poor prognostic patients who have three or more positive SNs were not included. Therefore, there is a potential role for avoiding CALND in a selected and limited group of SN-positive patients, but eligibility criteria and the role of adjuvant therapies need to be further elucidated.

Regarding medical management for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to management of early breast cancer, axillary lymph node dissection, ASCO 2025 guidelines recommend to omit axillary lymph node dissection in patients with clinically node-negative invasive breast cancer ≤ 5 cm who receive mastectomy and have 1–2 positive sentinel nodes, and offer postmastectomy radiptherapy with regional nodal irradiation.

### Nomograms for preoperative prediction of axillary nodal status in breast cancer [^111iVf3t]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

In this study, the endpoints of the analyses were chosen after applying criteria from the ACOSOG Z0011 trial, which showed no benefit of completion axillary dissection for patients with one or two involved lymph nodes. The present cohort was thus divided into patients with no axillary disease, patients with one or two positive nodes and those with at least three metastatic nodes, and the predictors for these categories were developed and displayed graphically in three different nomograms. The proposed predictive models had AUCs of 0.70–0.81 in ROC curve analysis; internal validation demonstrated good discrimination in predicting the three categories of axillary nodal status. These nomograms could be used to provide clinical guidance regarding appropriate axillary treatment as no further staging (N0), sentinel node staging (1–2 positive nodes) and completion axillary dissection or neoadjuvant therapy (at least 3 positive nodes). By categorizing the endpoints into low‐ and high‐risk groups based on the extent of nodal metastatic involvement and not solely counting on sentinel node status as a benchmark, the present nomograms were able to identify patients at risk of metastatic disease who may benefit from neoadjuvant therapy and/or direct ALND, thus bypassing SNLB.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^115CUjZ9]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To update the ASCO evidence-based recommendations on the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with initial surgery.

Methods

ASCO convened an Expert Panel to develop updated recommendations based on a systematic literature review (January 2016-May 2024).

Results

Eleven randomized clinical trials (14 publications), eight meta-analyses and/or systematic reviews, and one prospective cohort study met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Expert Panel members used available evidence and informal consensus to develop practice recommendations.

Recommendations

Clinicians should not recommend routine SLNB in select patients who are postmenopausal and ≥ 50 years of age and with negative findings on preoperative axillary ultrasound for grade 1–2, small (≤ 2 cm), hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer and who undergo breast-conserving therapy. Clinicians may offer postmastectomy radiation (RT) with regional nodal irradiation (RNI) and omit axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with clinically node-negative invasive breast cancer ≤ 5 cm who receive mastectomy and have one to two positive sentinel nodes. Clinicians may offer SLNB in patients who have cT3-T4c or multicentric tumors (clinically node-negative) or ductal carcinoma in situ treated with mastectomy, and in patients who are obese, male, or pregnant, or who have had prior breast or axillary surgery. Clinicians should not recommend ALND for patients with early-stage breast cancer who do not have nodal metastases, and clinicians should not recommend ALND for patients with early-stage breast cancer who have one or two sentinel lymph node metastases and will receive breast-conserving surgery and whole-breast RT with or without RNI. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/breast-cancer-guidelines. This guideline has been endorsed by the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO).

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy vs No axillary surgery in patients with small breast cancer and negative results on ultrasonography of axillary lymph nodes: the SOUND randomized clinical trial [^117E6zTD]. JAMA Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Study Population

Eligible patients were women of any age with invasive BC up to 2 cm in diameter, lack of involvement of axillary nodes at clinical evaluation, and a plan to undergo a breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy. All patients were required to have preoperative axillary ultrasonography showing no lymph node involvement at imaging. In the case of a doubtful finding on ultrasonography concerning an isolated lymph node, fine-needle aspiration was performed to rule out the presence of nodal metastases by cytological examination. Axillary lymph nodes with micrometastases or macrometastases were defined as positive. Exclusion criteria were the preoperative presence of multiple doubtful or suspicious lymph nodes, extensive multifocality or multicentricity, bilateral BC, diagnosis of synchronous distant metastases, previous cancer, ongoing pregnancy or lactation, and obstacles to obtaining informed consent or undergoing regular follow-up.

For the sample size calculation, the 5-year distant disease–free survival (DDFS) in the group randomized to receive no axillary surgery (no axillary surgery group) was assumed to be 96.5%. We calculated a target sample size of 1560 participants (780 per group) to test whether the no axillary surgery group experienced outcomes that were no worse than those of the group randomized to receive SLNB (SLNB group) given a margin of noninferiority for the 5-year DDFS of 2.5%. Between February 6, 2012, and June 30, 2017, 1463 women were recruited and enrolled in the study (93.8% of the planned sample size). The steering committee decided to close the accrual period early because the enrollment became too slow after most of the participating hospitals adopted the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria. Most of the enrolled patients (n = 1406) had negative ultrasonographic results; 57 patients who had a single doubtful node on ultrasonography were randomized after undergoing fine-needle aspiration cytological examination with negative results. Overall, 727 patients were randomized to the SLNB group and 736 to the no axillary surgery group. In the SLNB group, 19 patients discontinued intervention; in the no axillary surgery group, 39 patients discontinued intervention (Figure 1). The remaining 1405 women (708 in the SLNB group and 697 in the no axillary surgery group) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^111iZtpX]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — management of the axilla in patients with "clinical T1-2 cm breast cancer" — emphasizes that "Multidisciplinary discussion of adjuvant therapy options should occur prior to surgery when omitting sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)". Decision making "should be made on a case-by-case basis, and include a patient-centered approach", and "Full lymph node dissection may mitigate the need for RNI in select patients". The caption highlights that "Patients with three positive nodes were underrepresented in trials evaluating the omission of completion ALND", and that "There are no clinical trial data comparing SLNB/targeted axillary dissection (localized removal of clipped biopsy-proven positive node) to complete axillary lymph node dissection at this time, and either may be options for patients", with abbreviations defined as "ALND, axillary lymph node dissection", "RNI, regional nodal irradiation", and "SLNB, sentinel lymph node biopsy".

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^115o3vAQ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Breast cancer axillary management after mastectomy with positive sentinel nodes — regional nodal irradiation guidance states that RT with regional nodal irradiation (RNI) is recommended in place of completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for patients with clinically node-negative invasive breast cancer that is ≤ 5 cm who receive mastectomy and have one to two positive sentinel nodes. Decisions regarding the addition of RNI may be based on the increasing number of involved sentinel nodes and metastasis size with RNI reserved for macrometastasis versus micrometastasis, and in patients who receive mastectomy and have ≥ 3 positive nodes, ALND followed by RNI RT should be recommended.

### Completion of axillary dissection for a positive sentinel node: necessary or not? [^113ffWeH]. Current Oncology Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Sentinel node excision has been widely accepted as the initial surgical step for evaluating the axilla for metastatic breast cancer. When the nodes are positive, the standard of care is to complete the axillary node dissection, a more extended procedure that carries an increased risk for morbidity. This article reviews data from sentinel lymph node trials, case series reports of outcomes when axillary node dissection was not performed in the setting of positive sentinel nodes, models for predicting the status of nonsentinel nodes, and the morbidity associated with axillary operations. Despite an approximate 10% false-negative rate, early results indicate that there is a much lower local recurrence rate after sentinel node excision alone and that systemic therapy may sterilize the axilla. In selected patients, it may be appropriate to forgo an axillary node dissection, although there are no randomized clinical trial data to support or refute this suggestion.

### Axillary management: how much is too much? [^1153gMUz]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose of Review

To review the current management of the axilla in breast cancer.

Recent Findings

Axillary dissection is no longer indicated in patients with clinically node-negative axilla with 1–2 positive sentinel lymph nodes following upfront surgery or in patients with clinically node-negative axilla following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Summary

Breast cancer has evolved away from routine axillary clearance to the less invasive sentinel lymph node biopsy to now complete omission of axillary sampling in select patients. We will review the most salient evidence that has shaped these practice changes over the last three decades. Current practice controversies are especially relevant for elderly populations and those receiving neoadjuvant therapy. Ongoing clinical trials will provide data to further guide breast cancer surgical management.

### BJS commission on the surgical management of the axilla in breast cancer [^115tyazL]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Several prospective randomized trials have shown the non-inferiority of the omission of completion ALND in patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer and one to two SLN(s) with metastases who undergo primary surgery. Radiotherapy schedules, however, varied (Table 1). Hence, international guidelines do not recommend completion ALND in patients with limited axillary involvement, while disparity remains on recommendations for adjuvant radiotherapy. An interesting difference between these trials is the use of preoperative axillary ultrasound (AUS): in the ACOSOG Z0011 and AMAROS trials, AUS was optional, while the SINODAR-ONE and OTOASOR trials required a negative AUS for eligibility. SENOMAC mandated AUS but allowed enrolment of patients with suspicious, non-palpable lymph nodes in whom fine-needle aspiration cytology or core biopsy confirmed axillary metastases. AUS assessment of the axilla has limitations due to its user dependency and dynamic nature, which impact reproducibility. The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lacks strict criteria for the ultrasound assessment of the axilla. Features such as cortical or eccentric cortical hypertrophy ≥ 3 mm, a round shape, or the loss of central hilum typically indicate suspicious nodes. Moreover, AUS sensitivity and specificity vary significantly (26.4% to 75.9% and 88.4% to 98.1% respectively). Integrating deep-learning radiomics with combined imaging and clinical criteria may improve AUS performance and enhance its role in clinical decision-making in the future.

### ST gallen 2019 guidelines understage the axilla in lobular breast cancer: a population-based study [^112FiPrT]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Invasive lobular cancer (ILC) comprises approximately 10–15 per cent of all invasive breast cancers. It has distinct clinicopathological and genomic features with different responsiveness to systemic treatment, distinguishing it from ductal cancer of no special type (NST). The majority of ILCs are classified as luminal A-like. The long-term prognosis appears the same for ILC and NST, although there is a tendency towards a higher incidence of late recurrences in ILC.

ILC has a characteristic growth pattern, with single files of tumour cells diffusely infiltrating benign tissue. Both primary tumours and axillary lymph node (ALN) metastases tend to be non-palpable and difficult to detect by imaging, or fine-needle aspiration or core needle biopsy. The sensitivity of axillary ultrasound imaging for detection of ALN metastases is lower in ILC, especially in patients with a high metastatic nodal burden. The clinical value of breast MRI and PET–CT for clinical staging remains unclear. Patients with ILC are often diagnosed at a more advanced stage, have a tendency towards having four or more ALN metastases, and more non-sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases. Despite these differences, current treatment guidelines are similar for ILC and NST.

Nodal staging is one of the cornerstones in the diagnostic work-up of breast cancer as ALN metastasis is an important negative prognostic factor. In patients with clinically node-negative (cN0) breast cancer, axillary staging has been done by SLN biopsy followed by completion ALN dissection (cALND) in those with metastases. Two RCTs on ALN management, the American College of Surgical Oncology Group Z0011 trialand the International Breast Cancer Study Group 23–01 trial, showed that omitting cALND in patients with clinically node-negative but SLN-positive T1–2 breast cancer did not affect recurrence and survival rates during the first 10 years of follow-up. Furthermore, the AMAROS RCT, in which patients with clinically node-negative T1–2 breast cancer and at least one SLN metastasis were randomized to either cALND or axillary radiotherapy, showed no differences in recurrence or survival rates with 10 years of follow-up. The findings from these trials have led to a change in practice for axillary management, irrespective of histological subtype.

### Trends on axillary surgery in nondistant metastatic breast cancer patients treated between 2011 and 2015: a Dutch population-based study in the ACOSOG-Z0011 and AMAROS era [^11745d4C]. Annals of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate patterns of care in axillary surgery for Dutch clinical T1-4N0M0 (cT1-4N0M0) breast cancer patients and to assess the effect of the American College for Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG)-Z0011 and After Mapping of the Axilla: Radiotherapy Or Surgery (AMAROS) trial on axillary surgery patterns in Dutch cT1-2N0M0 sentinel node positive breast cancer patients.

Background

Since publication of the ACOSOG-Z0011 and AMAROS trial, omitting a completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) in sentinel node positive breast cancer patients is proposed in selected patients.

Methods

Data were obtained from the nationwide Nationaal Borstkanker Overleg Nederland breast cancer audit. Descriptive analyses were used to demonstrate trends in axillary surgery. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with the omission of cALND in cT1-2N0M0 sentinel node-positive breast cancer patients.

Results

Between 2011 and 2015 in cT1-4N0M0 breast cancer patients, the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy as definitive axillary staging increased from 72% to 93%, and (c)ALND as definitive axillary staging decreased from 24% to 6% (P < 0.001). The use of cALND decreased from 75% to 17% in cT1-2N0 sentinel node-positive patients (P < 0.001). Earlier year of diagnosis, lower age, primary mastectomy, invasive lobular subtype, increasing tumor grade, and treatment in a nonteaching hospital were associated with a lower probability of omitting cALND (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

This study shows a trend towards less extensive axillary surgery in Dutch cT1-T4N0M0 breast cancer patients; illustrated by an overall increase of sentinel lymph node biopsy and decrease in cALND. Despite this trend, particularly noticed in cT1-2N0 sentinel node-positive patients after publication of the ACOSOG-Z0011 and AMAROS trial, variations in patterns of care in axillary surgery are still present.

### ST gallen 2019 guidelines understage the axilla in lobular breast cancer: a population-based study [^112VWLSa]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

In the St Gallen 2019 guidelines for primary therapy of early breast cancer, all histological subtypes were included in the extended indication for cALND omission. Completion ALND can thus be omitted in clinically T3, N0 breast cancer with one or two SLN metastases, provided that the patient receives adjuvant systemic treatment and regional nodal irradiation. In addition, the St Gallen 2019 guidelines recommend adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with luminal A-like tumours and four or more ALN metastases. The number patients with ILC was small in the above-mentioned RCTs (8.0 per cent, 334 of 4192), and so the applicability these data as criteria for omitting cALND in patients with ILC is unclear.

The aim of the present study was to compare the prevalence of at least four ALN metastases and the number of non-SLN metastases in ILC and NST in a large population-based cohort from a validated register. A further aim was estimate the prevalence of luminal A-like tumours with at least four ALN metastases in ILC and NST among patients who met the criteria for omission of cALND according to the St Gallen 2019 guidelines or the Z0011 trial.

### Is a completion axillary dissection in patients with early breast cancer with a positive sentinel node necessary? An NCDB-based trial emulation of ACOSOG Z0011… [^115zt2sb]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract e12592 Background: The ACOSOG Z0011 Study is a practice-changing phase III clinical trial that promotes the de-escalation of axillary surgery in early breast cancer patients, which supports no completion axillary lymph node dissection in clinically node negative patients with 1 or 2 positive sentinel lymph nodes. Methods: NCDB PUF 2020 was queried for clinical T1-2 N0 M0 breast cancer patients diagnosed 2010–2017. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same as in the Z0011 trial except for the inclusion of 3 positive sentinel lymph nodes. Sentinel lymph node biopsy alone and ALND were defined using Site-Specific Factor 19. Results: 25, 774 patients were included in the analysis. 20311 patients were in the SLNB alone group, and 5463 patients were in the ALND group respectively. The utility rate of SLNB increased steadily over the years from 53. 7% in 2010 to
91. 0% in 2017.

The median age was 60, which was older than that in the Z0011 trial. The median follow-up time was 6. 78 years. By multivariable analysis using the original sample, SLNB alone and the ALND group had similar survival. By ATT weighting, the SLNB group had significantly improved survival. The magnitude of HR is close to that in the Z0011 trial, but the statistical significance was mainly driven by a much larger sample size in this study. Conclusions: This NCDB-based Trial-Emulation study validates the result of the ACOSOG Z0011 clinical trial through a post-trial and real-world setting, where we confirmed that patients with 1 or 2 pSLN are suitable for SLNB alone, but for patients with 3 pSLN, ALND may still maintain a viable option.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^112232P7]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) with one or two positive sentinel nodes after breast-conserving surgery and whole-breast RT: Clinicians should not recommend ALND for patients with early-stage, clinically node-negative breast cancer who have one or two positive sentinel lymph node metastases and will receive breast-conserving surgery with whole-breast RT (Evidence quality: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong). Completion ALND after demonstration of node positivity with SLNB is not necessary if the patient already meets candidacy for CDK4/6 inhibitor or olaparib; if a patient with 1–2 positive nodes on SLNB is not otherwise eligible, completion ALND can be considered, but the rate of four or more nodal metastases with completion ALND is low (13%), and physician-patient shared decision making is warranted.

### Preoperative sonographic prediction of limited axillary disease in patients with primary breast cancer meeting the Z0011 criteria: an alternative to sentinel node biopsy? [^113TGNdW]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

The approach to axillary surgery for patients with breast cancer has evolved tremendously over recent decades, leading to significant changes in the role of preoperative axillary imaging. Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) has replaced axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for primary surgical staging of clinical node-negative breast cancer patients, a paradigm shift that made the identification of axillary involvement the main goal of preoperative axillary staging as these patients could bypass SNB and proceed directly to ALND. In addition, large prospective trials, such as the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial, have shown that ALND can be safely omitted in patients with early-stage (T1–2) breast cancer who undergo breast-conserving therapy and in whom SNB reveals two or fewer metastatic lymph nodes. – With the implementation of these findings into clinical practice, the use of axillary imaging became controversial from a surgical standpoint, as preoperative detection of metastatic axillary disease would process patients directly to ALND, although these patients might not have been candidates for ALND following SNB according to the Z0011 protocol. As the mere preoperative identification of axillary disease was no longer sufficient to triage patients with early-stage breast cancer to appropriate axillary surgical treatment, a clinical need for preoperative quantification of the extent of axillary disease arose. Consecutively, preoperative breast imaging studies focused on the distinction of patients with limited axillary disease (LAD, one or two metastatic nodes) who would not undergo ALND after a positive sentinel due to the lack of therapeutic implication from patients with extensive axillary disease (EAD, three or more metastatic lymph nodes) who would benefit from ALND. These studies revealed a correlation between the number of abnormal lymph nodes identified by preoperative axillary ultrasound and the number of metastatic nodes on final pathology. – Given these findings, the recent NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN guidelines) advise consideration of SNB for patients meeting the Z0011 criteria in whom two or fewer suspicious lymph nodes are found on preoperative imaging, even when one node shows biopsy-proven positivity. If limited histopathological axillary disease could be identified safely by preoperative ultrasound and core needle biopsy, SNB may constitute overtreatment and omission of SNB in this setting due to a lack of consequence in selected patient populations might be an approach for further scientific evaluation. The purposes of this study were to assess the accuracy of preoperative sonographic axillary staging for prediction of LAD (one or two metastatic nodes on final pathology) in patients with early-stage breast cancer meeting the Z0011 criteria, who underwent ALND, and to identify factors associated with high concordance between sonographic prediction and histopathology.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^117Dxnur]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Breast Cancer — surgical axillary staging criteria specify that if axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) are clinically negative, ≤ 2 suspicious lymph nodes on imaging, or ≤ 2 positive lymph nodes by needle biopsy, the Panel recommends sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping. If SLN is negative, no further surgery is needed. If SLN is positive, based on ACOSOG Z 0011, no further surgery is recommended only when the following are met: cT1–2, N0 tumors, no preoperative systemic therapy, only 1 or 2 positive SLNs, and planned BCT (BCS + WBRT); otherwise, the Panel recommends level I and II axillary dissection. Based on AMAROS and OTASAR, no further surgery is recommended only when cT1–2, N0 tumors without preoperative systemic therapy have 1 to 2 positive SLNs and will undergo lumpectomy or mastectomy with adjuvant RT with intentional inclusion of undissected axilla at risk; otherwise, the Panel recommends level I and II axillary dissection. In select mastectomy patients with clinically negative axillae but 1 to 2 positive SLNs, the Panel notes that axillary radiation may replace ALND. The NCCN Panel recommends no ALND for positive SLNs when disease is limited to only micrometastatic, and AJCC defines micrometastatic nodal involvement as a metastatic deposit or > 0.2 mm but ≤ 2.0 mm.

### Management of the axilla in T1-2N1 breast cancer [^113CwHYQ]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of the axilla in T1-2N1, hormone receptor-positive/HER2 negative breast cancers

The rate of pCR in axillary nodes for hormone receptor-positive/HER2 negative tumors varies between 7.4% and 29.0%. Table 1 compares the nodal pCR in different tumor subtypes –.

Three important studies have shaped the creation of guidelines for the management of the axilla in hormone receptor-positive/HER2 negative tumors after chemotherapy: The Treatment for Positive Node, Endocrine Responsive Breast Cancer (RxPONDER) trial, the ACOSOG Z0011 trial, and the After Mapping of the Axilla: Radiotherapy or Surgery (AMAROS) trial.

The RxPONDER study accrued patients with estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor positive (> 1%), HER2 negative breast cancers with 1–3 positive lymph nodes, and an Oncotype DX (Exact Sciences, Redwood City, CA) score of 0–25. The patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, or endocrine therapy alone. The study showed that adjuvant chemotherapy has no impact on invasive disease-free survival in postmenopausal women. However, the study did show a clear benefit for premenopausal patients.

The ACOSOG Z0011 trial randomized breast cancer patients who were clinically node negative with T1-2 tumors and found to have 1–2 positive sentinel nodes to an axillary lymph node dissection or no further axillary procedure. It concluded that a full axillary lymph node dissection could be safely omitted in that group of patients, as there was no difference in locoregional recurrence, disease-free survival, or overall survival.

The AMAROS trial accrued patients with stage cT1-2N0M0 primary breast cancer. Those with positive sentinel nodes were randomized to an axillary lymph node dissection or axillary radiation therapy. At a median follow-up of 10 years, both of these arms showed no difference in regional recurrence, distant metastasis, or survival.

For hormone receptor-positive/HER2 negative T1-2 tumors, the decision on chemotherapy is dependent on the menopausal status of the patient as well as on the clinical examination of the axilla.

### Trends of axillary treatment in sentinel node-positive breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy [^116DY4wW]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

During the past decade, several randomized trials have cast doubt on the need to perform axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with sentinel lymph node metastases (SLN+). The Z0011 trial of The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG), published in 2011, demonstrated that ALND in cT1-2 patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS) who were found to have one or two positive SLN (SLN+) showed no lower regional recurrence risk or better survival compared with those undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) only. The International Breast Cancer Study Group trial (IBCSG 23–01) showed similar results for patients with micrometastases in the SLN. The results of the "After Mapping of the Axilla: Radiotherapy or Surgery?" (AMAROS) trial, published in 2014, demonstrated that axillary radiotherapy (RT) could serve as a safe alternative to ALND resulting in equivalent regional control.

The results of these trials led to a broad discussion about the need of performing ALND in SLN+ patients and about the use of RT as an alternative to ALND in SLN+ patients who would previously had been candidates for ALND. International guidelines suggest to consider foregoing axillary surgery in patients meeting the Z0011 criteria, i.e. patients who were treated by breast-conserving surgery (BCS) followed by routine external beam RT of the breast. – Other guidelines advocate the use of regional RT as an alternative for ALND in SLN+ patients, applying the AMAROS results both to patients who undergo BCS as well as to patients treated by mastectomy.

Some years ago, a substantial decrease was reported in ALND frequency among SLN+ patients both in those undergoing BCS and mastectomy. In a previous Dutch population-based study, describing patients treated from 2011 to 2015, the proportion of SLN+ patients receiving ALND alongside BCS versus mastectomy was 31% versus 52% at the start but had decreased to 11% and 26%, respectively, by the end of the study period. These trend lines show a stronger reduction of ALND in the context of BCS versus mastectomy, which may reflect an altered protocol with regard to the anticipated effectivity of ALND in conjunction with BCS. Because for mastectomy patients the Z0011 criteria do not apply, one might expect that postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) would have been applied as a substitute for ALND.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^114xGGuo]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to management of early breast cancer, sentinel lymph node biopsy, ASCO 2025 guidelines recommend to consider omitting sentinel lymph node biopsy in selected patients with small (≤ 2 cm) breast cancer and negative findings on preoperative axillary lymph node ultrasound, provided they meet all of the following criteria and detection of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes would not alter treatment recommendations:

- postmenopausal and ≥ 50 years

- unifocal invasive ductal carcinoma ≤ 2 cm

- nottingham grades 1–2

- HR+, HER2-negative in patients intending to receive adjuvant endocrine therapy

- no suspicious lymph nodes on axillary ultrasound or only one suspicious node with benign biopsy concordant with axillary ultrasound findings

- undergoing upfront breast-conservation surgery followed by whole-breast radiotherapy in patients aged < 65 years.

### Axillary treatment for operable primary breast cancer [^115E21CT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Axillary surgery is an established part of the management of primary breast cancer. It provides staging information to guide adjuvant therapy and potentially local control of axillary disease. Several alternative approaches to axillary surgery are available, most of which aim to spare a proportion of women the morbidity of complete axillary dissection.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of alternative approaches to axillary surgery (including omitting such surgery altogether) in terms of overall survival; local, regional and distant recurrences; and adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, Pre-MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov on 12 March 2015 without language restrictions. We also contacted study authors and checked reference lists.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including women with clinically defined operable primary breast cancer conducted to compare axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) with no axillary surgery, axillary sampling or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB); RCTs comparing axillary sampling with SLNB or no axillary surgery; RCTs comparing SLNB with no axillary surgery; and RCTs comparing ALND with or without radiotherapy (RT) versus RT alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed each potentially relevant trial for inclusion. We independently extracted outcome data, risk of bias information and study characteristics from all included trials. We pooled data according to trial interventions, and we used hazard ratios (HRs) for time-to-event outcomes and odds ratios (OR) for binary outcomes.

Main Results

We included 26 RCTs in this review. Studies were at low or unclear risk of selection bias. Blinding was not done, but this was only considered a source of bias for outcomes with potential for subjectivity in measurements. We found no RCTs of axillary sampling versus SLNB, axillary sampling versus no axillary surgery or SLNB versus no axillary surgery. No axillary surgery versus ALND Ten trials involving 3849 participants compared no axillary surgery versus ALND. Moderate quality evidence showed no important differences between overall survival of women in the two groups (HR 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.17; 3849 participants; 10 studies) although no axillary surgery increased the risk of locoregional recurrence (HR ranging from 1.10 to 3.06; 20,863 person-years of follow-up; four studies). It was uncertain whether no surgery increased the risk of distant metastasis compared with ALND (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.30; 946 participants; two studies). Low-quality evidence indicated no axillary surgery decreased the risk of lymphoedema compared with ALND (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.43; 1714 participants; four studies). Axillary sampling versus ALND Six trials involving 1559 participants compared axillary sampling versus ALND. Low-quality evidence indicated similar effectiveness of axillary sampling compared with ALND in terms of overall survival (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.21; 967 participants; three studies) but it was unclear whether axillary sampling led to increased risk of local recurrence compared with ALND (HR 1.41, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.12; 1404 participants; three studies). The relative effectiveness of axillary sampling and ALND for locoregional recurrence (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.20; 406 participants; one study) and distant metastasis was uncertain (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.49; 406 participants; one study). Lymphoedema was less likely after axillary sampling than after ALND (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.81; 80 participants; one study). SLNB versus ALND Seven trials involving 9426 participants compared SLNB with ALND. Moderate-quality evidence showed similar overall survival following SLNB compared with ALND (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.25; 6352 participants; three studies; moderate-quality evidence). Differences in local recurrence (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.77; 516 participants; one study), locoregional recurrence (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.24; 5611 participants; one study) and distant metastasis (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.53; 516 participants; one study) were uncertain. However, studies showed little absolute difference in the aforementioned outcomes. Lymphoedema was less likely after SLNB than ALND (OR ranged from 0.04 to 0.60; three studies; 1965 participants; low-quality evidence). Three studies including 1755 participants reported quality of life: Investigators in two studies found quality of life better after SLNB than ALND, and in the other study observed no difference. RT versus ALND Four trials involving 2585 participants compared RT alone with ALND (with or without RT). High-quality evidence indicated that overall survival was reduced among women treated with radiotherapy alone compared with those treated with ALND (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.21; 2469 participants; four studies), and local recurrence was less likely in women treated with radiotherapy than in those treated with ALND (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99; 22,256 person-years of follow-up; four studies). Risk of distant metastasis was similar for radiotherapy alone as for ALND (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.25; 1313 participants; one study), and whether lymphoedema was less likely after RT alone than ALND remained uncertain (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.44; 200 participants; one study). Less surgery versus ALND When combining results from all trials, treatment involving less surgery was associated with reduced overall survival compared with ALND (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.17; 6478 participants; 18 studies). Whether local recurrence was reduced with less axillary surgery when compared with ALND was uncertain (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.09; 24,176 participant-years of follow up; eight studies). Locoregional recurrence was more likely with less surgery than with ALND (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.78; 26,880 participant-years of follow-up; seven studies). Whether risk of distant metastasis was increased after less axillary surgery compared with ALND was uncertain (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.20; 2665 participants; five studies). Lymphoedema was less likely after less axillary surgery than with ALND (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.46; 3964 participants; nine studies). No studies reported on disease control in the axilla.

Authors' Conclusions

This review confirms the benefit of SLNB and axillary sampling as alternatives to ALND for axillary staging, supporting the view that ALND of the clinically and radiologically uninvolved axilla is no longer acceptable practice in people with breast cancer.

### Preoperative sonographic prediction of limited axillary disease in patients with primary breast cancer meeting the Z0011 criteria: an alternative to sentinel node biopsy? [^113oRa9Q]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

The generalizability of our findings is limited, given the variability in ultrasound image acquisition and interpretation, although the inclusion of data from two centers increases their reliability. The transfer of the findings to other populations has to be done cautiously as the collective assessed mostly comprised screening patients, with low rates of axillary nodal burden and moderate numbers of involved lymph nodes. However, the therapeutic consequences identified in the Z0011 trial are transferable to our sample, which was similar to the Z0011 population (medians of two and one metastatic lymph nodes).

In patients with early-stage breast cancer fulfilling the Z0011 criteria with one abnormal axillary lymph node identified by preoperative sonography who underwent ALND, the prediction of limited axillary disease on final pathology was highly accurate, with a false-negative rate comparable to that of sentinel node biopsy. These findings imply that omission of sentinel node biopsy might be an option that can be considered in these patients. With the ability to correctly distinguish limited from extensive nodal disease, axillary imaging represents a key clinical decision-making tool for management of the axilla and can be used to further individualize and deescalate surgical staging.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^1153E7dT]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

ASCO guideline update — axillary management for clinical T > 2 cm breast cancer presents an algorithm emphasizing staging and timing around sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). For clinically node-negative patients, the figure states "No axillary ultrasound for staging", and low-risk patients proceed to surgery with "Single tracer (radiocolloid) if primary surgery; if non identification or low volume center, use dual dye", while high-risk patients undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with "Axillary ultrasound pre-NAC for staging". The caption specifies, "Do not recommend SLNB before chemotherapy except in special circumstances after multidisciplinary discussion". For clinically node-positive disease "with lymph node biopsy to confirm diagnosis", options include NAC or a surgery pathway that features axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Postoperative radiation guidance shown includes "Standard RT (consider regional RT in select patients‡)" and, across node-positive scenarios (e.g., "If BCT, 1–2 nodes positive, and planning RT"; "If mastectomy, 1–2 nodes positive"; "If mastectomy or BCT, ≥ 3 nodes positive¶"), "Standard whole-breast or chest wall RT + RNI§". Notes in the figure add that "Full lymph node dissection may mitigate the need for RT in select patients" and that "Patients with three positive nodes were underrepresented in trials evaluating the omission of completion ALND".

### Applicability of the American college of surgeons oncology group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial results in invasive lobular carcinoma… [^114AEAbk]. ASCO (2013). Low credibility.

Abstract 1103 Background: The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial demonstrated that, for patients with clinical T1-T2, N0 breast cancer and one or two positive sentinel lymph nodes undergoing breast conserving therapy, there was no difference in local-regional recurrence, disease-free survival or overall survival between patients who underwent sentinel lymph node dissection alone or completion axillary lymph node dissection. However, there were a limited number of invasive lobular carcinoma participants in the study. In addition, it is known that ILC has a different pattern of metastases, frequently presenting as small foci requiring immunohistochemistry for detection. Together, these considerations raise concern regarding the applicability of the ACOSOG Z0011 data to patients with ILC.

Methods: Patients with ILC who met the ACOSOG Z0011 eligibility criteria were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Patients were evaluated based on the extent of axillary surgery: SLND alone or ALND. Clinicaloutcomes of the two groups were compared. Results: At a median follow-up of 71 months, there were no LRRs in the SLND arm, and only 4 in the ALND arm. There were no differences in OS or disease-specific survival between the two groups. Conclusions: Omission of completion ALND is appropriate in patients with ILC who fulfill the ACOSOG Z0011 eligibility criteria.

### Impact of immediate versus delayed axillary node dissection on surgical outcomes in breast cancer patients with positive sentinel nodes: results from American college of surgeons oncology group trials Z0010 and Z0011 [^116Jp2t5]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Patients with breast cancer metastasis to the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) generally undergo completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND), either concurrently with SLN biopsy or at a second procedure. The impact of the timing of cALND on pathologic results and complications in these patients has not been examined.

Patients and Methods

We examined outcomes from SLN-positive patients in American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) trials Z0010 and Z0011. Pathologic data examined included primary tumor characteristics, total number of SLNs recovered, positive SLN(s) and non-SLN(s) identified. Complications assessed included axillary seroma, paresthesia, arm morbidity and range of motion, and lymphedema.

Results

A total of 1,003 assessable patients with SLN metastasis had immediate (n = 425) or delayed (n = 578) cALND. The median number of SLNs and axillary LNs removed were the same between groups. Patients who had immediate cALND more often had larger tumors, SLN metastasis identified intraoperatively, two or more positive SLNs, and higher pathologic N stage. Axillary paresthesia, seroma, and impaired extremity range of motion were more common in the immediate group during the early postoperative period, but not at later time points. There was no difference in lymphedema at any time point.

Conclusion

In ACOSOG trials Z0010 and Z0011, LN recovery and long-term complications were similar after either delayed or immediate cALND for patients with metastasis to SLNs. Patients who undergo immediate cALND experience more short-term morbidity. With respect to staging and complications, there is no clear detriment for patients with a positive SLN who undergo a second procedure for cALND.

### Effect of sentinel lymph node vs full axillary dissection on overall breast cancer survival… [^113WtV5C]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

The ACOSOG Z0011 phase 3 randomized clinical trial enrolled patients from May 1999 to December 2004 at 115 sites. The last date of follow-up was September 29, 2015, in the ACOSOG Z0011 trial. Eligible patients were women with clinical T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer, no palpable axillary adenopathy, and 1 or 2 sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases. Even with follow-up extended to a median of 9. 3 years, the ACOSOG Z0011 randomized clinical trial demonstrated that SLND alone did not result in inferior overall survival outcomes compared with ALND for patients with clinical T1 or T2 node-negative breast cancer and 1 or 2 positive sentinel nodes treated with breast-conserving therapy and adjuvant systemic therapy.

Before publication of the initial ACOSOG Z0011 trial results, 9 there was a general consensus that axillary dissection was necessary for better cancer control when metastases were identified in sentinel lymph nodes. Among 701 consecutive patients with node-positive tumors at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who met ACOSOG Z0011 eligibility criteria, 83% did not have to undergo ALND. 19 In a 12-hospital network, use of ALND decreased from 71% to 17% after development of a guideline using ACOSOG Z0011 eligibility criteria and age of 50 years or older as indications for SLND alone.
20. The 10-year rates of overall survival in the SLND alone and ALND groups of the ACOSOG Z0011 trial were
86. 3% and 83. 6%, respectively, compared with
82. 8% in the nodal irradiation group in MA. 20 and 82. 3% in EORTC 22922/10925, suggesting that the ACOSOG Z0011 eligibility criteria identified a population that may not benefit from comprehensive nodal irradiation.

However, these conclusions apply only to patients meeting ACOSOG Z0011 eligibility criteria and should not be extrapolated to the management of patients with positive palpable nodes, those with metastases in more than 2 sentinel nodes, patients forgoing whole-breast irradiation, those treated with mastectomy without radiation, or patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy because all of these are circumstances in which the elimination of ALND is not known to be safe.

### Axillary management: how much is too much? [^115nEtk1]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the current management of the axilla in breast cancer.

Recent Findings

Axillary dissection is no longer indicated in patients with clinically node-negative axilla with 1–2 positive sentinel lymph nodes following upfront surgery or in patients with clinically node-negative axilla following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Breast cancer has evolved away from routine axillary clearance to the less invasive sentinel lymph node biopsy to now complete omission of axillary sampling in select patients. We will review the most salient evidence that has shaped these practice changes over the last three decades. Current practice controversies are especially relevant for elderly populations and those receiving neoadjuvant therapy. Ongoing clinical trials will provide data to further guide breast cancer surgical management.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^11311EJ6]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Sentinel lymph node–positive early breast cancer — regional nodal irradiation (RNI) versus completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in mastectomy candidates: In the OTOASOR phase III noninferiority trial, patients were randomly assigned to completion ALND (n = 244) or RNI without completion ALND (n = 230), and "Results showed that RNI was noninferior to completion ALND: The axillary recurrence in the completion ALND arm was 2.0% compared to 1.7% in the RNI arm (P = 1.00)". Mastectomy occurred in "30 patients (16%)" in the RNI arm and "44 patients (18%)" in the ALND arm, and "The results of this study support the use of RNI in place of completion ALND in these patients". In IBCSG 23–01, mastectomy represented "86 of 931 total patients (9%)", and post hoc analyses "suggest that omitting completion ALND could be an acceptable option for patients scheduled to receive mastectomy".

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy vs No axillary surgery in patients with small breast cancer and negative results on ultrasonography of axillary lymph nodes: the SOUND randomized clinical trial [^117QKMQC]. JAMA Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is it safe to omit sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with small breast cancer (BC) and a negative preoperative axillary ultrasonography result?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial that included 1463 women with small node-negative BC, patients who did not undergo axillary surgery had noninferior 5-year distant disease–free survival compared with those who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy.

Meaning

These findings suggest that patients with BC of a diameter equal to or smaller than 2 cm and a negative result on preoperative axillary lymph node ultrasonography can be safely spared any axillary surgery whenever the lack of pathological information does not affect the postoperative treatment plan.

### Management of the axilla in T1-2N1 breast cancer [^115MX7GR]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

In clinically node-negative premenopausal patients, the surgical procedure (mastectomy or lumpectomy) determines the management pathway. When a lumpectomy is planned, patients with positive sentinel nodes may be managed based on the ACOSOG Z0011 or AMAROS trials. The patients who are undergoing a mastectomy have not been included in the ACOSOG Z0011 trial, and the benefit of chest wall radiation may not be justified in all patients. We recommend a sonographic evaluation of the axilla with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of suspicious nodes. Patients with proven nodal metastasis are started on neoadjuvant chemotherapy, while those with negative FNA are candidates for upfront surgical intervention. Fig. 2b summarizes the suggested outline of treatment.

In postmenopausal patients with clinically palpable lymph nodes, the result of an FNA of the axillary node will determine the clinical pathway. Patients with negative cytology will undergo a sentinel lymph node biopsy with complete axillary lymph node dissection if the sentinel node is positive, as the number of positive nodes will dictate if they can be managed as per the RX-PONDER trial. In patients with positive FNA, those with Oncotype DX recurrence scores > 25 will be candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Those with Oncotype DX recurrence scores ≤ 25 may be candidates for a full axillary lymph node dissection on neoadjuvant endocrine therapy as per Fig. 2c.

### Axillary recurrence after a tumor-positive sentinel lymph node biopsy without axillary treatment: a review of the literature [^111fyQ2i]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Lastly, the definition and surgical technique of the SLNB itself is a limitation. In daily routine most patients have one or two SLNs, but in the six studies with 100 or more patients in this review mean number of biopsied nodes is 2–11 nodes. In the two large American databases, before analysis with lymph node count threshold (five or fewer nodes examined) 4–16 nodes and 1–44 nodes were included as SLNB patients, which should probably be considered as complete axillary lymph node dissections.

Overall survival was not subject of this review, although it is clinically relevant to investigate whether omission of cALND affects survival. Yi et al.stated that compared with SLNB alone, cALND does not seem to be associated with improved survival in patients with micrometastasis in the SLNB. Bilimoria et al.described that, in case of micrometastases, a cALND does not appear to improve the overall outcome, as there were no significant differences in survival or in axillary recurrences. In case of macrometastatic disease, there was a nonsignificant trend toward better outcomes in axillary recurrences and survival after cALND, but only after analysis was adjusted for clinicopathologic differences. In the ACOSOG Z0011 trial, Giuliano et al.observed no differences in overall survival between the cALND arm and the arm in which cALND was not performed. Long-term results and the impact of the omission of axillary lymph node dissection on survival are awaited.

Some minor differences of patient's characteristics between center 1 and others centers is report in Supplemental Data File 5. A very few number of events (n = 102) were reported. Consequently higher follow-up is necessary to analyze the non-inferiority of cALND omission.
