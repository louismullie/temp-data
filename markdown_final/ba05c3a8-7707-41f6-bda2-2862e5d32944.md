Desmopressin

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about desmopressin's indications, dosing, efficacy, safety, and monitoring across its major uses. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and mechanism of action to anchor downstream decisions. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled indications and reconcile them with real-world guideline-supported uses. Next, I will examine dosing by indication and formulation, including any age- or sex-specific nuances. After that, I need to review efficacy data for nocturia, enuresis, diabetes insipidus, and hemostasis. Then, I should confirm safety signals, contraindications, and hyponatremia risk stratification. Finally, I will outline practical monitoring protocols and synthesize a concise clinical algorithm, making sure I double-check areas of controversy and correct any missteps along the way [^112NJWNb] [^112hPujW] [^112DYJQT].

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and mechanism of action, because dosing and safety hinge on receptor selectivity and duration. Desmopressin is a synthetic vasopressin analogue with high V2 selectivity, which drives antidiuresis via renal collecting ducts, and minimal V1 activity, limiting vasoconstriction and hypertension risk compared with native vasopressin; clinically, this translates to reduced nocturnal urine output and prolonged first sleep period in nocturnal polyuria, and hemostatic benefit via endothelial VWF/FVIII release in bleeding disorders, so I need to keep that V2-centric profile in mind as I interpret outcomes and adverse effects [^1162sHeB] [^113pACMS] [^113PdELp].

> I should confirm the labeled indications before extrapolating. FDA labeling supports desmopressin for central diabetes insipidus, primary nocturnal enuresis, and nocturnal polyuria in adults, with the nocturnal polyuria indication reflected in the low-dose orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) formulation; wait, I initially thought "nocturnal polyuria" was not an FDA-labeled indication, but the ODT labeling and contemporary summaries do include it, so I should correct that assumption and align with the current label and reviews [^112NJWNb] [^116zaP4f] [^114kDGNB].

> Next, I will examine guideline-supported uses beyond the label, because clinicians often rely on society guidance for nocturia and enuresis. EAU 2025 recommends desmopressin for nocturnal polyuria in men and women, with age-stratified dosing and hyponatremia precautions; CUA 2022 supports desmopressin for refractory nocturnal polyuria impacting quality of life; AAFP 2025 recommends desmopressin for nocturnal polyuria unresponsive to conservative therapy; and EAN 2020 suggests intranasal desmopressin for nocturia in severe MS, with cardiovascular and renal cautions, so I should integrate these into practice patterns while respecting label constraints [^112hPujW] [^115DHm5N] [^111hFwhE] [^113vsexH] [^112Zy2P3] [^113maV2o].

> Now, dosing by indication and formulation; let me verify specifics and avoid overgeneralization. For nocturnal polyuria in adults, the ODT starts at 25 mcg in women and 50 mcg in men, titratable to 50–100 mcg in women and 50–100 mcg in men, with lower starting doses favored in older adults due to hyponatremia risk; intranasal formulations for nocturnal polyuria in adults ≥ 65 years or at risk of hyponatremia typically start at 0.83 mcg nightly and may be titrated to 1.66 mcg; for primary nocturnal enuresis, oral tablets start at 0.2 mg at bedtime and can be titrated to 0.6 mg; for central diabetes insipidus, oral tablets are dosed 0.1–0.8 mg two to three times daily, with intranasal spray or melt alternatives per bioavailability differences; for hemostasis, the standard dose is 0.3 mcg/kg IV or SC, with intranasal options when appropriate; I should double-check bioavailability differences across routes because they materially affect dose equivalence and clinical effect [^116zaP4f] [^117MvkZe] [^115FHF1a] [^112QiWR9] [^1127pkdo].

> Hold on, I should verify efficacy in nocturia before recommending it broadly. Randomized trials and meta-analyses show modest but clinically meaningful reductions in nocturnal voids and prolongation of the first sleep period, with the most consistent benefit in patients with documented nocturnal polyuria; for example, a randomized trial showed a 39% reduction in nocturnal voids versus 15% with placebo and a 108-minute prolongation of first sleep period, and a systematic review suggested about 0.72 fewer voids per night at 100 mcg dosing; subgroup analyses indicate larger effects with higher oral doses and in nocturnal polyuria, so patient selection matters [^111JQuWG] [^117LfyBS] [^116LR3x2].

> I will now examine enuresis efficacy, and I need to ensure I separate monosymptomatic from nonmonosymptomatic cases. In children with monosymptomatic enuresis, desmopressin reduces wet nights by roughly 1.8 per week versus placebo and increases the odds of achieving 14 consecutive dry nights, with a dose–response from 0.2 to 0.6 mg; combination therapy with anticholinergics can improve outcomes in nonresponders, and structured withdrawal may reduce relapse; however, relapse after discontinuation is higher than with alarm therapy, so I should counsel families accordingly and consider alarms or combined approaches for durability [^1173MiHh] [^113Y34vJ] [^1138wnY8] [^111ZkhKe].

> For central diabetes insipidus, let me think about practical titration and monitoring. Desmopressin effectively controls polyuria and polydipsia, with individualized dosing guided by urine output and osmolality; oral tablets or melts are preferred in ambulatory patients for convenience, and dose should be titrated to eliminate polyuria while avoiding hyponatremia; in post-surgical or transient DI, short-acting vasopressin may be safer initially, and scheduled desmopressin should be avoided in the first week after pituitary surgery due to hyponatremia risk; I should confirm that patients are educated about fluid restriction and overdose risk [^113pACMS] [^1114NYux] [^113uBiYF] [^115jTRbK].

> Turning to hemostasis, I should confirm which patients benefit and how to test responsiveness. Desmopressin is first-line for type 1 VWD and mild hemophilia A when effective, typically increasing VWF and FVIII two- to five-fold; a desmopressin trial with baseline and post-dose VWF antigen, activity, and FVIII is recommended to confirm responsiveness before relying on it clinically; it is contraindicated in type 2B VWD due to thrombocytopenia risk and is generally ineffective in type 3 VWD; for bleeding or perioperative prophylaxis, standard dosing is 0.3 mcg/kg IV or SC, with intranasal options when appropriate; I need to ensure we avoid using desmopressin as sole therapy for major surgery and confirm response in type 1 patients with low baseline VWF [^112DYJQT] [^113e8fnS] [^114VCXbz] [^1127pkdo].

> Safety and tolerability come next, and I should prioritize hyponatremia because it is the most consequential risk. Hyponatremia risk rises with age, female sex, higher doses, intercurrent illness, and concomitant medications such as SSRIs, TCAs, NSAIDs, and antiepileptics; symptoms include headache, nausea, confusion, and seizures; in older adults, the relative risk of hyponatremia is about 5-fold versus placebo in some analyses, so I should start low, monitor sodium frequently, and counsel on fluid restriction; rare adverse effects include headache, gastrointestinal upset, and, in children, water intoxication with seizures, particularly early in therapy or with intranasal formulations; I should double-check that intranasal use in children carries higher risk and warrants stricter fluid counseling [^117LfyBS] [^114geuBs] [^111JZGrM] [^112mb8PR].

> I need to ensure contraindications and precautions are explicit. Desmopressin is contraindicated in type 2B VWD and type 3 VWD, and should be avoided in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, significant cardiovascular disease, seizure disorders, or age under 2 years; in older adults, especially over 65–75, use the lowest effective dose and monitor sodium closely; in pregnancy, it has been used safely, but should be avoided in preeclampsia and in settings of fluid overload or oxytocic use; I should confirm that patients with baseline hyponatremia are not started on desmopressin [^112DYJQT] [^115AGUJJ] [^111ppFtf] [^1126mKgo].

> Monitoring should be protocolized, and I should double-check the frequency. For nocturia, check serum sodium at baseline, day 3, day 7, one month, and periodically thereafter, with more frequent checks in patients over 65 or at increased hyponatremia risk; for enuresis, monitor for hyponatremia symptoms and consider periodic sodium checks if high doses or intercurrent illness are present; for diabetes insipidus, track urine volume and osmolality to titrate dose and avoid hyponatremia; for hemostasis, confirm response with VWF and FVIII assays after a desmopressin trial and before relying on it for procedures [^114geuBs] [^115ch9D2] [^112DYJQT].

> Let me synthesize a practical clinical algorithm, and I will sanity-check each step against guidelines. First, confirm the indication and phenotype: nocturnal polyuria for nocturia, monosymptomatic versus nonmonosymptomatic enuresis, central diabetes insipidus, or a bleeding disorder where desmopressin is likely effective; second, choose the formulation and starting dose tailored to age, sex, and risk, favoring low doses in older adults; third, counsel on strict evening fluid restriction from 1 hour before dose until 8 hours after; fourth, implement sodium monitoring per risk profile; fifth, reassess efficacy and tolerability at 1–2 weeks and titrate cautiously; sixth, in enuresis, consider adding an alarm or anticholinergic if response is partial, and plan structured withdrawal to minimize relapse; seventh, in bleeding disorders, always perform a desmopressin trial and have VWF/FVIII concentrate backup if unresponsive or type 2B/3 [^112hPujW] [^113vsexH] [^117MvkZe] [^1173MiHh] [^112DYJQT].

> But wait, what about special populations and edge cases I might miss. In severe MS-related nocturia, intranasal desmopressin may help if cardiovascular and renal disease are controlled; in obesity, weight-based dosing for hemostasis is reasonable though data are limited; in children, ensure high adherence because suboptimal compliance undermines efficacy; in perioperative or trauma settings, desmopressin can be considered for platelet dysfunction or VWD but should not be used routinely in unselected bleeding patients; I should confirm that any off-label use is documented with rationale and risk–benefit discussion [^113maV2o] [^113ynERH] [^1127pkdo] [^113uDhA6].

> In summary, desmopressin is a targeted therapy whose net clinical benefit depends on careful patient selection, conservative dosing, and disciplined monitoring for hyponatremia; efficacy is most convincing for nocturnal polyuria-related nocturia, monosymptomatic enuresis, central diabetes insipidus, and selected bleeding disorders, while safety is acceptable when sodium surveillance and fluid counseling are enforced, especially in older adults; I should double-check that my plan aligns with EAU, CUA, AAFP, and hematology guidelines before finalizing treatment [^112hPujW] [^113vsexH] [^112Zy2P3] [^112DYJQT].

Desmopressin is a **synthetic vasopressin analog** used for nocturnal enuresis, nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria, and central diabetes insipidus [^112NJWNb]. It reduces nocturnal urine output by acting on V2 receptors, thereby decreasing nocturnal voids and improving sleep [^111JQuWG]. The most significant risk is **hyponatremia**, especially in older adults; therefore, serum sodium should be monitored at baseline, day 3, day 7, one month, and periodically thereafter, with closer monitoring in patients over 65 or those at increased risk [^114geuBs]. Desmopressin is not effective for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and is contraindicated in patients with a history of hyponatremia or severe renal impairment [^112NJWNb].

---

## Pharmacological properties

Desmopressin is a **synthetic analog of vasopressin** with high selectivity for V2 receptors, which mediate antidiuretic effects, and minimal V1 activity, reducing vasoconstrictive and prothrombotic risks [^1162sHeB]. It increases water reabsorption in the renal collecting ducts, thereby decreasing urine volume and frequency [^113pACMS]. Desmopressin is available in oral, intranasal, and injectable formulations, with oral and intranasal routes being the most commonly used for nocturnal enuresis and nocturia [^112QiWR9].

---

## Clinical indications

Desmopressin is indicated for the following **clinical conditions**:

| **Indication** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Primary nocturnal enuresis | Bedwetting in children aged ≥ 6 years and adults [^117MvkZe] [^1173MiHh] |
| Nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria | Frequent nighttime urination in adults, particularly older adults [^112hPujW] [^112Zy2P3] |
| Central diabetes insipidus | A condition characterized by excessive thirst and urination due to vasopressin deficiency [^112NJWNb] [^1114NYux] |

---

## Efficacy in nocturnal enuresis and nocturia

Desmopressin has been shown to **significantly reduce the number of nocturnal voids** and wet nights in patients with nocturnal enuresis and nocturia [^111JQuWG]. In clinical trials, desmopressin reduced nocturnal voids by approximately 0.5–1.0 per night and increased the time to the first nocturnal void by about 1 hour [^117LfyBS]. These improvements are associated with enhanced quality of life and reduced nighttime sleep disturbances [^112RKz6W] [^111JQuWG].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Desmopressin is generally well tolerated, but **hyponatremia is the most significant adverse effect**, particularly in older adults and those with renal impairment [^117LfyBS]. Hyponatremia can lead to symptoms such as headache, nausea, confusion, seizures, and, in severe cases, coma [^notfound]. Other common adverse effects include headache, nasal congestion, and gastrointestinal symptoms [^111JZGrM].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

Given the risk of hyponatremia, **careful monitoring of serum sodium levels is essential** [^114geuBs]. The European Association of Urology (EAU) recommends the following monitoring schedule:

- Baseline serum sodium measurement before initiating therapy [^114geuBs].
- Serum sodium measurement on day 3 and day 7 after starting treatment [^114geuBs].
- Monthly serum sodium measurement for the first month [^114geuBs].
- Periodic serum sodium measurements thereafter, especially in patients aged > 65 years or those at increased risk of hyponatremia [^114geuBs].

Patients should be advised to **restrict fluid intake** during the evening and overnight to minimize the risk of hyponatremia [^117MvkZe].

---

## Contraindications

Desmopressin is **contraindicated** in patients with:

- Known hypersensitivity to desmopressin or any of its components [^notfound].
- History of hyponatremia or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) [^notfound].
- Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min) [^notfound].
- Cardiac insufficiency or other conditions requiring diuretic therapy [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other medications

Desmopressin is often compared with other medications used for nocturnal enuresis and nocturia, such as anticholinergics and tricyclic antidepressants. Desmopressin is particularly effective in patients with **nocturnal polyuria**, whereas anticholinergics are more suitable for patients with bladder overactivity. Combination therapy with desmopressin and anticholinergics may be beneficial in patients with mixed etiologies [^117Da5EH].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines from the EAU, Canadian Urological Association (CUA), and American Urological Association (AUA) recommend desmopressin as a **first-line treatment** for nocturnal enuresis and nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria, with careful patient selection and monitoring for hyponatremia [^112hPujW] [^113vsexH] [^112Zy2P3].

---

Desmopressin is an effective treatment for nocturnal enuresis and nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria, with a favorable safety profile when appropriately monitored. The primary concern is **hyponatremia**, particularly in older adults, necessitating careful patient selection, fluid restriction, and regular monitoring of serum sodium levels [^114geuBs].

### Desmopressin for treating nocturia in men [^116LR3x2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Nocturia is the bothersome symptom of awakening one or more times per night to void. Desmopressin is a commonly used medication for treating nocturia.

Objectives

To assess the effects of desmopressin as compared to other interventions in the treatment of nocturia in men.

Search Methods

We performed a comprehensive search of medical literature with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status. The date of the latest search of all databases was August 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized or quasi-randomized trials. Inclusion criteria were men with nocturia defined as one or more voids per night. Trials of children, adults with primary or secondary enuresis or underlying distinct disorders were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted data according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

Main Results

We included 14 studies with 2966 randomized men across five comparisons. Desmopressin versus placebo: based on short-term follow-up (up to three months), desmopressin may have a similar effect on the number of nocturnal voids (mean difference (MD) -0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.94 to 0.01; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of desmopressin on major adverse events at short-term follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% CI 0.10 to 9.03; very low-quality evidence). For intermediate-term follow-up (three to 12 months), desmopressin may reduce the number of nocturnal voids in an appreciable number of participants (MD -0.85, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.53; low-quality evidence). Desmopressin may result in little or no difference in major adverse events at intermediate-term follow-up (RR 3.05, 95% CI 0.13 to 73.39; low-quality evidence). We found no evidence on quality of life. Subgroup analyses suggest a larger effect with oral, higher-dose formulations of desmopressin and in men with documented nocturnal polyuria. Desmopressin versus behavior modification: there were no data regarding the effect on the number of nocturnal voids, quality of life, or major adverse events. Desmopressin versus alpha-blocker: based on short-term follow-up, desmopressin likely has a similar effect on the number of nocturnal voids (MD 0.30, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.80; moderate-quality evidence) and quality of life (MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.35; moderate-quality evidence). There were no major adverse events in either study group. Desmopressin plus alpha-blocker versus alpha-blocker alone: based on short-term follow-up, combination therapy likely results in a small, unimportant reduction in the number of nocturnal voids (MD -0.47, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.21; moderate-quality evidence) and quality of life (MD -0.29, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.07; moderate-quality evidence). The risk of major adverse events may be similar (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.32; low-quality evidence). Desmopressin plus alpha-blocker versus alpha-blocker plus an anticholinergic: based on short-term follow-up, combination therapy likely results in little or no difference in the number of nocturnal voids (MD -0.43, 95% CI -0.97 to 0.11; moderate-quality evidence). We found no evidence on quality of life. There were no major adverse events in either study group.

Authors' Conclusions

Desmopressin may reduce the number of nocturnal voids in an appreciable number of participants compared to placebo in intermediate-term (three to 12 months) follow-up without increase in major adverse events. We found no evidence to compare its effects to behavior modification. The effect on the number of nocturnal voids is likely similar to that of alpha-blockers short-term with very infrequent major adverse events. There appears to be no added benefit in the combined use of desmopressin with an alpha-blocker or an anticholinergic. The findings of this review were limited by short-term follow-up, study limitations, and imprecision.

Primary Nocturnal Enuresis

The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to response. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy can begin tablet therapy the night following (24 hours after) the last intranasal dose. The recommended initial dose for patients age 6 years and older is 0.2 mg at bedtime. The dose may be titrated up to 0.6 mg to achieve the desired response. Fluid restriction should be observed, and fluid intake should be limited to a minimum from 1 hour before desmopressin administration, until the next morning, or at least 8 hours after administration.

### Poor compliance with primary nocturnal enuresis therapy may contribute to insufficient desmopressin response [^113uDhA6]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Studies of desmopressin in children with primary nocturnal enuresis show a greater than 90% decrease in wet nights in 20% to 30%, a 50% to less than 90% decrease in 20% to 40% and less than a 50% decrease in up to 60%. Insufficient response to desmopressin is attributable to various factors, including differences in the primary nocturnal enuresis definition, underlying bladder dysfunction and/or desmopressin pharmacokinetic characteristics. However, little attention has been given to poor compliance with therapy as a possible explanatory factor. For a drug with an effect duration limited to the night after administration a high degree of compliance is essential to ensure consistent therapeutic effects.

Materials and Methods

This was a substudy of an international investigation of treatment for 6 months or less with desmopressin tablets in children with primary nocturnal enuresis. Medication was dispensed at each visit as required and collected at each subsequent visit. Compliance was determined by pill counts by study staff.

Results

Compliance data were available on 723 patients. Of the patients 81% to 91% ingested all medication as instructed during the initial run-in phases. However, this decreased to 77% and 71% during the first and second 3-month treatment periods, respectively.

Conclusions

Patient motivation and compliance are generally stronger in clinical trials than in clinical practice. However, this study shows that some patients were poorly compliant with medication even at study initiation and only 71% were fully compliant with long-term treatment. Decreased compliance was associated with a lower response rate. Patients should be encouraged to comply fully with treatment to achieve an optimal outcome.

### Desmopressin acetate [^112NJWNb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Central Diabetes Insipidus

Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central diabetes insipidus and for the management of the temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region. Desmopressin acetate is ineffective for the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

Patients were selected for therapy based on the diagnosis by means of the water deprivation test, the hypertonic saline infusion test, and/or response to antidiuretic hormone. Continued response to desmopressin acetate can be monitored by measuring urine volume and osmolality.

Primary Nocturnal Enuresis

Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated for the management of primary nocturnal enuresis. Desmopressin acetate may be used alone or as an adjunct to behavioral conditioning or other non-pharmacologic intervention.

Desmopressin trial and administration — For patients for whom desmopressin is a valid option (primarily type 1 VWD) "and who have a baseline VWF level of < 0.30 IU/mL, the panel suggests performing a trial of desmopressin and treating based on the results over not performing a trial". "In these patients, the panel suggests against treating with desmopressin in the absence of desmopressin trial results". Remarks clarify scope and cautions: "This recommendation does not apply to patients for whom desmopressin is not a reasonable treatment option (eg, those with type 3 VWD). Desmopressin is contraindicated in type 3 VWD because of lack of efficacy and in type 2B VWD because of increased platelet binding with subsequent thrombocytopenia". "Many patients with type 2 VWD do not respond to desmopressin and require other modes of treatment". "Patients undergoing major surgery… should not receive desmopressin as sole therapy". It is "optimal to confirm desmopressin responsiveness", and adult type 1 VWD patients "whose baseline VWF levels are ≥ 0.30 IU/mL can be presumed to be desmopressin responsive", though "it is reasonable to obtain VWF levels to confirm response after administration", while "patients with type 1 VWD and VWF levels of < 0.30 IU/mL may not respond to desmopressin".

Primary Nocturnal Enuresis

Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 340 patients with primary nocturnal enuresis. Patients were 5 to 17 years old, and 72% were males. A total of 329 patients were evaluated for efficacy. Patients were evaluated over a two-week baseline period in which the average number of wet nights was 10 (range 4 to 14). Patients were then randomized to receive 0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 mg of desmopressin acetate or placebo. The pooled results after two weeks are shown in the following table:

Patients treated with desmopressin acetate tablets showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of wet nights compared to placebo-treated patients. A greater response was observed with increasing doses up to 0.6 mg.

In a six month, open-label extension study, patients completing the placebo-controlled studies were started on 0.2 mg/day desmopressin acetate, and the dose was progressively increased until the optimal response was achieved (maximum dose 0.6 mg/day). A total of 230 patients were evaluated for efficacy; the average number of wet nights/2 weeks during the untreated baseline period was 10 (range 4 to 14), and the average duration (SD) of treatment was 4.2 (1.8) months. Twenty-five (25) patients (11%) achieved a complete or near complete response (≤ 2 wet nights/2 weeks) and did not require titration to the 0.6 mg/day dose. The majority of patients (198 of 230, 86%) were titrated to the highest dose. When all dose groups were combined, 128 (56%) showed at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the number of wet nights/2 weeks, while 87 (38%) patients achieved a complete or near complete response.

Human Pharmacokinetics

Desmopressin acetate is mainly excreted in the urine. A pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n = 24, 6 subjects in each group) receiving single dose desmopressin acetate (2 mcg) injection demonstrated a difference in desmopressin acetate terminal half-life. Terminal half-life significantly increased from 3 hours in normal healthy patients to 9 hours in patients with severe renal impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .)

### Evaluation and treatment of nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis: a standardization document from the international children's continence society [^1177VMm2]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

This document represents the consensus guidelines recommended by the ICCS on how to evaluate and treat children with nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (NMNE). The document is intended to be clinically useful in primary, secondary and tertiary care.

Materials and Methods

Discussions were held by the board of the ICCS and a committee was appointed to draft this document. The document was then made available to the members of the society on the web site. The comments were vetted and amendments were made as necessary to the document.

Results

The main scope of the document is the treatment of NMNE with drugs other than desmopressin-based therapy. Guidelines on the assessment, and nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of children with NMNE are presented.

Conclusions

The text should be regarded as an expert statement, not a formal systematic review of evidence-based medicine. It so happens that the evidence behind much of what we do in the care of enuretic children is quite weak. We do, however, intend to present what evidence there is, and to give preference to this rather than to experience-based medicine, whenever possible.

### A systematic review of the efficacy and safety of desmopressin for nocturia in adults [^117LfyBS]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

We systematically reviewed desmopressin as treatment for nocturia in generally healthy adults with a focus on benefits and harms.

Materials and Methods

After a literature search we identified 10 articles (2,191 patients) that met our inclusion criteria of parallel group design, randomized, controlled trials with information on at least 1 benefit or harm of desmopressin in patients with nocturia. We evaluated the quality of included trials based on The Cochrane Collaboration criteria, assessed heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic and performed random effects meta-analysis.

Results

Studies were generally of high quality, although 4 used an active run-in period to titrate the dose and exclude patients with adverse effects or who were nonresponders. Thus, they were at high risk for bias. Desmopressin doses of at least 25 mcg or greater decreased nocturnal voids and increased time to first void. A dose of 100 mcg provided just more than an hour of additional sleep before the first void compared with placebo as well as 0.72 fewer voids per night. Higher doses provided no significant increase in benefit. Hyponatremia (RR 5.1) and headache (RR 4.3) were the most common adverse effects. Serious adverse effects were rare.

Conclusions

Desmopressin appears to offer a modest benefit for treating nocturia in generally healthy adults with adequate safety. The initial dose should be between 50 and 100 mcg. Higher doses should only be used with caution and a lower initial dose of 25 to 50 mcg is appropriate in elderly patients. All patients should be monitored for hyponatremia. The drug should be used with caution in patients with chronic lung disease due to the rare occurrence of respiratory failure. Additional well designed, adequately powered studies 1 or more years in duration are needed.

Desmopressin challenge/trial and administration — in patients for whom desmopressin is a valid treatment option (primarily type 1 von Willebrand disease [VWD]) and who have a baseline von Willebrand factor (VWF) level of < 0.30 IU/mL, the panel suggests performing a trial of desmopressin and treating based on the results over not performing a trial and treating with tranexamic acid or factor concentrate; this is a conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects. In these patients, the panel suggests against treating with desmopressin in the absence of desmopressin trial results.

### Predictive parameters of response to desmopressin in primary nocturnal enuresis [^112YNiwY]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction/Background

Many recent treatment guidelines have advocated the importance of a full noninvasive medical evaluation. To individualize treatment, special emphasis must be put on recording of the maximum voided volume (MVV) and nocturnal diuresis in a diary or frequency/volume chart.

Objective

The aim of this study was to identify any possible predictive factors to desmopressin response.

Study Design

This study is a re-analysis of a prospective, open-label, multinational, phase-IV study evaluating ≤ 6 months of treatment with desmopressin tablets for children with primary nocturnal enuresis. The children were enrolled between April 2002 and December 2004 from 86 centers in four countries: UK, Canada, Germany and France. A total of 936 children were screened; 744 children aged 5–15 years participated in the study. Of these, 471 children completed the study with 6 months follow-up and recording in a frequency/volume chart. All children experienced six or more wet nights during the 14-day screening period. Exclusion criteria were: organic pathology, treatment for enuresis within the past year, previous treatment for enuresis for > 4 weeks, diurnal symptoms, renal or central diabetes insipidus and the use of systemic antibiotics or other drugs known to affect desmopressin activity. The predictive value of number of wet nights a week, fluid intake, daytime voiding frequency and diuresis was investigated by performing a multinomial logistic regression.

Results

Of the demographic variables, age was the only significant predictor for response to desmopressin. Controlling for age, the significant predictive variables were: number of wet nights a week, average voided volume daytime, maximum voided volume daytime, total daytime diuresis, nocturnal diuresis (see Figure), maximum voided volume 24 h and total 24 h diuresis. More than 80% of the children had no nocturnal polyuria and a low maximum voided volume.

Discussion

Performing a secondary analysis is a limitation because the original study was not designed for that. A new prospective study is ethically hardly defendable for children if data are available from previous literature [1]; therefore, a re-analysis was the appropriate choice. The study confirms the predictive value of age, number of wet nights a week and nocturnal diuresis [1,2].

Conclusions

The study demonstrates that desmopressin response rates are higher in children with greater age, limited number of wet nights a week and nocturnal polyuria. Only a minority of a primary nocturnal enuresis population, based on history alone, had nocturnal polyuria. The majority had a low maximum voided volume. The results clearly stress the importance of a frequency/volume chart for individualizing therapy to the characteristics, thereby resulting in elevated success rates. Registration number of clinical trial: Clinical Trials.gov NCT00245479.

### Efficacy of parenteral formulations of desmopressin in the treatment of bleeding disorders: a systematic review [^113YLvRM]. Thrombosis Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a proven therapy for bleeding disorders; however, the therapeutic efficacy of different parenteral formulations has never been systematically analyzed. This study investigated whether subcutaneous (SC) DDAVP provides equivalent hemostatic efficacy to intravenous (IV) desmopressin, particularly in patients with mild to moderate bleeding tendencies from hemophilia A (HA) or von Willebrand disease (vWD).

Materials and Methods

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane, and CINAHL databases for observational studies and randomized controlled trials which compared the hemostatic efficacy of parenteral formulations of DDAVP in healthy patients and those with bleeding disorders. Two reviewers independently performed screening and data extraction. Extracted data included Factor VIII (FVIII) levels, von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen levels, and vWF activity.

Results

The search strategy yielded a total of 5519 studies. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Seven out of eight studies conducted in patients with bleeding disorders and all four studies conducted in healthy subjects found no difference in hemostatic efficacy between parenteral formulations. A meta-analysis was not performed due to disparities between study design and outcomes of interest.

Conclusions

Our study showed that IV and SC administration of DDAVP appeared to result in near equivalent hemostatic efficacy; however, the strength of these findings is limited by the small number and lack of comparability in the primary studies. A sizable contemporary study powered to detect differences in coagulation factor levels would be required to confirm our findings.

### Combination therapy with desmopressin and an anticholinergic medication for nonresponders to desmopressin for monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1138wnY8]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Desmopressin is an approved medical therapy for the treatment of monosymptomatic primary nocturnal enuresis. In cases of limited response to desmopressin, we have added anticholinergic therapy to desmopressin (combination therapy). To evaluate this treatment strategy, we examined the efficacy of combination therapy for primary nocturnal enuresis in desmopressin-nonresponders.

Methods

Only patients with primary nocturnal enuresis refractory to the maximal dosage of desmopressin were enrolled. Children with lower urinary tract symptoms or bowel dysfunction were excluded, on the basis of a 3-day, 24-hour, frequency-volume chart and elimination record. Children continued to take desmopressin and were assigned randomly, in a double-blind manner, to receive either extended-release anticholinergic medication or placebo. Patients were reassessed after 1 month of therapy, with a 1-week nocturnal record.

Results

Forty-one desmopressin-nonresponders were enrolled, and 7 patients were excluded because of noncompliance. The treatment groups were equally matched with respect to age, gender, functional bladder capacity, and number of wet nights per week. After 1 month of treatment, there was a significant reduction in the mean number of wet nights in the combination therapy group, compared with the placebo group. With a generalized estimating equation approach, there was a significant 66% decrease in the risk of a wet episode, compared with the placebo group.

Conclusions

This study represents the first prospective, placebo-controlled trial examining the effect of desmopressin in combination with long-acting, anticholinergic, bladder-relaxing therapy for monosymptomatic primary nocturnal enuresis.

### Clinical review: treatment of neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus [^116inXMr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

In recent years, there have been several improvements in the treatment of neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (DI). They include new formulations of the vasopressin analog, desmopressin; a better understanding of the effect of fluid intake on dosing; and more information about treatments of infants, children, and pregnant women who present special challenges. This review aims to summarize past and current information relative to the safety and efficacy of treatments for the types of DI caused by a primary deficiency of vasopressin.

Evidence Acquisition

The review is based on publications identified primarily by a PubMed search of the international literature without limitations of date.

Evidence Synthesis

In acute settings where fluid intake is determined by factors other than thirst, desmopressin should be given iv in doses that have a short duration of action and can be adjusted quickly in accordance with changes in hydration as indicated by plasma sodium. In ambulatory patients, the oral formulations (tablet or melt) are preferred for their convenience. If fluid intake is regulated normally by the thirst mechanism, the tablets or melt can be taken safely 1 to 3 times a day in doses sufficient to completely eliminate the polyuria. However, if fluid intake consistently exceeds replacement needs as evidenced by the development of hyponatremia, the dose should be reduced to allow higher than normal rates of urine output or intermittent breakthrough diuresis. This regimen is often indicated in infants or children because their rate of fluid intake tends to be greater than in adults. In all cases, the appropriate dose should be determined by titration, owing to considerable interindividual differences in bioavailability and antidiuretic effect.

Conclusions

Desmopressin can provide effective and safe therapy for all patients with neurohypophyseal or gestational DI if given in doses and by a route that takes into account the determinants of fluid intake.

### The use of desmopressin as a hemostatic agent: a concise review [^117E6Vs8]. American Journal of Hematology (2007). Low credibility.

Desmopressin, a synthetic derivative of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin, is the treatment of choice for most patients with von Willebrand disease and mild hemophilia A. Moreover, the compound has been shown to be useful in a variety of inherited and acquired hemorrhagic conditions, including some congenital platelet function defects, chronic liver disease, uremia, and hemostatic defects induced by the therapeutic use of antithrombotic drugs such as aspirin and ticlopidine. Finally, desmopressin has been used as a blood saving agent in patients undergoing operations characterized by large blood loss and transfusion requirements, but studies suggest that this is not as effective as other methods. This review briefly summarizes the current clinical indications on the use of desmopressin as a hemostatic agent.

### Randomized comparison of long-term desmopressin and alarm treatment for bedwetting [^112RRbWX]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of long-term primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) treatment using desmopressin versus enuresis alarm.

Materials and Methods

A 6-month randomized trial was performed with patients from 29 enuresis clinics: 251 patients ≥ 5 years in age with severe PNE (mean 5.5–5.6 wet nights/week) were randomized to desmopressin (0.2–0.4 mg daily) or alarm. Efficacy was assessed by percentage reduction in mean number of wet nights/week; patients achieving dryness, mean initial duration of sleep and compliance were evaluated. Efficacy analyses were performed using the intent-to-treat population (all patients) and excluding patients who withdrew; 12-month follow-up data were collected.

Results

Data could not be evaluated for the 32% of alarm patients and 7% of desmopressin patients who withdrew early. In intent-to-treat analyses, a similar proportion of patients across groups showed a ≥ 50% reduction in wet nights/week (desmopressin: 37.5%, alarm: 32.2%) and achieved dryness (desmopressin: 32%, alarm: 37%). Compliance was higher with desmopressin: 95–98% of patients took > 75% of tablets; 50–78% used alarm > 75% of nights. Initial sleep duration was 1.02 h longer at the end of treatment with desmopressin (95% CI: 0.045, 1.99).

Conclusion

Desmopressin and alarm demonstrated comparable efficacy in the treatment of PNE. Withdrawal from the alarm group was high, indicating the importance of considering family motivation before selecting treatment, for optimal outcome.

### The efficacy and safety of oral desmopressin in children with primary nocturnal enuresis [^113Y34vJ]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

We confirmed findings that oral desmopressin safely decreases the number of wet nights in children with enuresis and identified doses at which acceptable responses can be obtained.

Materials and Methods

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral desmopressin in a double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, randomized, multicenter trial of 193 children 6 to 16 years old with documented primary nocturnal enuresis. The study was conducted in 2 phases: 1) a 2-week dose ranging phase in which children received desmopressin (0.2, 0.4 or 0.6 mg.) or placebo at bedtime and 2) an 8-week dose titration phase that followed a 2-week placebo washout. Patients received 0.2 mg. desmopressin or placebo for the first 2 weeks and then the dose was increased in 0.2 mg. increments at 2-week intervals until the patient was completely dry or was receiving 0.6 mg. Patients were instructed to limit fluid intake. Mean decrease from baseline in the number of wet nights, percentage of responding patients and safety were assessed at 2-week intervals.

Results

There was a statistically significant linear response to oral desmopressin at doses from 0.2 to 0.6 mg. during the dose ranging phase (p ≤ 0.05). The decrease in wet nights after 2 weeks of treatment with desmopressin was 27%, 30% and 40% at 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 mg. doses, respectively, compared to 10% with placebo. All doses were statistically significantly different from placebo (p ≤ 0.05). During the dose titration phase all placebo treated and 87% of desmopressin treated patients were receiving the maximum dose of 3 tablets nightly because they had not been completely dry in the previous 2 weeks. Nevertheless, 44% of desmopressin treated patients had achieved at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the number of wet nights per 2 weeks at the lower doses of 0.2 and 0.4 mg. Most adverse events (rhinitis, pharyngitis, headache and increased cough) were mild to moderate in severity, unrelated to treatment and resolved before the study was completed.

Conclusions

Oral desmopressin administered at bedtime to children with primary nocturnal enuresis was significantly better than placebo for decreasing episodes of bed-wetting (p < 0.05). A linear dose-response relationship was observed (p < 0.05). An acceptable response to treatment (50% or greater reduction from baseline in wet nights per 2 weeks) was seen at all doses of desmopressin. Oral desmopressin, up to 0.6 mg. for 8 weeks, was well tolerated.

In addition to variation in the diagnosis and management of VWD, there is limited awareness within the VWD community on the best clinical practice. The aim of this systematic review is to determine the accuracy of commonly available diagnostic tests for VWD, which can be used to inform a combined strategy for diagnosis. The results were used to inform evidence-based recommendations on diagnostic strategies for the recently published clinical practice guidelines on VWD, developed by a combined effort from the American Society of Hematology (ASH), the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), the National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF), the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH), and the University of Kansas Medical Center. These guidelines aim to inform all stakeholders on essential issues where there is variation or uncertainty in clinical practice and will support decision-making in the context of the values and preferences of patients.

Pediatric Use

Central Diabetes Insipidus

Desmopressin acetate tablets have been used safely in pediatric patients, age 4 years and older, with diabetes insipidus for periods up to 44 months. In younger pediatric patients the dose must be individually adjusted in order to prevent an excessive decrease in plasma osmolality leading to hyponatremia and possible convulsions; dosing should start at 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet). Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in pediatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. (See WARNINGS .)

Primary Nocturnal Enuresis

Desmopressin acetate tablets have been safely used in pediatric patients age 6 years and older with primary nocturnal enuresis for up to 6 months. Some patients respond to a dose of 0.2 mg; however, increasing responses are seen at doses of 0.4 mg and 0.6 mg. No increase in the frequency or severity of adverse reactions or decrease in efficacy was seen with an increased dose or duration. The dose should be individually adjusted to achieve the best results. Treatment with desmopressin for primary nocturnal enuresis should be interrupted during acute intercurrent illness characterized by fluid and/or electrolyte imbalance (e.g., systemic infections, fever, recurrent vomiting or diarrhea) or under conditions of extremely hot weather, vigorous exercise or other conditions associated with increased water intake.

### Desmopressin treatment regimens in monosymptomatic and nonmonosymptomatic enuresis: a review from a clinical perspective [^113gQAtt]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate outcomes of desmopressin treatment in monosymptomatic enuresis (ME) and nonmonosymptomatic enuresis (NME).

Materials and Methods

PubMed was searched for all studies investigating enuresis, up to July 2009, in which desmopressin was administered alone or combined with other treatments. Each study was graded according to its respective level of evidence.

Results

Altogether, 99 studies enrolling 7422 patients were identified as fulfilling the inclusion criteria. In 76 studies, desmopressin was administered as monotherapy; in 29 it was combined with other treatments such as antimuscarinics and enuresis alarm.

Conclusion

Studies incorporating a minor invasive versus a non-invasive diagnostic approach seem to achieve superior long-term success rates. Primary efficacy outcomes following desmopressin treatment are more favourable in ME than NME. Desmopressin administered with adjunct measures achieves superior outcomes compared to monotherapy, especially in NME. Compared to sudden withdrawal, the structured withdrawal programs show better long-term success and lower relapse rates. So far, no superiority has been shown for either time- or dose-dependent structured withdrawal programs. Most studies incorporated only small case series; only 25 studies with level of evidence 1 or 2 have been conducted. The broad range of mono- and adjunct treatments were evaluated according to the evidence based criteria recommended by the European Association of Urology.

### Desmopressin dose requirements in patients with permanent arginine vasopressin deficiency: a tertiary center experience [^111FWBQv]. Pituitary (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Based on our data, patient age appears to be the primary factor associated with the daily sublingual desmopressin dose required to achieve adequate clinical and biochemical control in patients with permanent AVP deficiency.

Further studies involving larger cohorts of patients are necessary to clarify whether a greater susceptibility to dDAVP is also present in women with AVP deficiency and whether, as proposed, this susceptibility may diminish over time in the context of chronic hormonal deficiency.

### Desmopressin orally disintegrating tablet effectively reduces nocturia: results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112RKz6W]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

The primary objective was to investigate the efficacy of desmopressin orally disintegrating tablet versus placebo in patients with nocturia. Pharmacodynamics, safety and patient-reported quality of life (QoL) outcomes were also evaluated. One of several benefits of the new formulation is increased bioavailability. Exploring lower doses allows for a better evaluation of therapeutic effect versus tolerability.

Methods

This was a 4-week, randomized, double-blind study comparing 10, 25, 50, or 100µg desmopressin versus placebo in adults with defined nocturia.

Results

The intent to treat population comprised 757 patients experiencing ∼3 voids/night and a high prevalence of nocturnal polyuria (∼90%). Increasing doses of desmopressin were associated with decreasing numbers of nocturnal voids and voided volume, greater proportions of subjects with > 33% reduction in nocturnal voids, and increased duration of first sleep period. The lowest dose reaching statistical significance (P < 0.05 vs. placebo) varied by endpoint. Improvements were clinically meaningful, meaning that patients actually had fewer nightly voids. Post hoc analyses by gender suggested a lower minimum effective dose for women. Desmopressin was generally well tolerated. Reductions in serum sodium to < 125mmol/L in six women (taking > 25µg desmopressin) and two men (aged 67 and 82) taking 100µg, support lower and gender-specific dosing to reduce the small but clinically significant risk of hyponatraemia. Each void reduced/hour of sleep gained was associated with significant improvements in QoL.

Conclusions

Desmopressin orally disintegrating tablet is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for patients with nocturia. Further exploration of the lower dose range is warranted.

### ASH ISTH NHF WFH 2021 guidelines on the management of von Willebrand disease [^1126mKgo]. Blood Advances (2021). High credibility.

Von Willebrand disease — desmopressin use (remarks and good practice statements) emphasizes that this recommendation does not apply to patients for whom desmopressin is not a reasonable treatment option and that desmopressin is contraindicated in type 3 VWD and type 2B VWD; many patients with type 2 VWD do not respond, and patients undergoing major surgery should not receive desmopressin as sole therapy. It is optimal to confirm desmopressin responsiveness, but adult patients with type 1 VWD whose baseline VWF levels are ≥ 0.30 IU/mL can be presumed responsive, whereas patients with type 1 VWD and VWF levels of < 0.30 IU/mL cannot be presumed responsive. The administration of desmopressin to patients with type 2B VWD is generally contraindicated, and desmopressin is generally contraindicated in patients with active cardiovascular disease, patients with seizure disorders, and patients age < 2 years. Patients receiving desmopressin are at risk for hyponatremia from free water retention; therefore, they should receive normal saline if IV fluid replacement is required, and oral free water intake should be restricted to prevent hyponatremia; counseling should include strategies to mitigate hyponatremia risk. Desmopressin has been used safely in many women during pregnancy, but it should be avoided in women with preeclampsia and those with cardiovascular disease, and IV fluid infusion and oxytocic medications during labor and delivery increase the risk of desmopressin‑induced hyponatremia.

### Desmopressin associated symptomatic hyponatremic hypervolemia in children. are there predictive factors? [^112mb8PR]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Desmopressin is widely used in primary nocturnal enuresis, bleeding disorders, central diabetes insipidus and diagnostic urine concentration testing. Hyponatremic hypervolemia leading to seizures has been reported as a rare but potentially life threatening side effect of desmopressin therapy. We sought to identify factors that predispose patients to hyponatremia and to find predictive factors associated with increased risk of water intoxication.

Materials and Methods

We report 13 novel cases of desmopressin associated water intoxication and review the literature. A total of 93 instances of symptomatic hyponatremia during desmopressin treatment in children were identified. Specific data were reported in 58 of 93 cases. These 58 cases, in addition to our 13 novel cases, were further analyzed.

Results

All children were treated with intranasal or intravenous desmopressin. No patient received oral desmopressin. Younger children are at greater risk for water intoxication than older children. The risk is particularly high at the beginning of desmopressin therapy. A total of 45 patients (63%) had prodromal symptoms, eg nausea, vomiting and headache. In 10 cases (14%) desmopressin was prescribed without an evident need.

Conclusions

Based on this analysis, we conclude that the use of desmopressin should be cautiously considered, careful monitoring should be performed during the initiation of therapy, and particular care should be taken when treating young children and when prodromal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and headaches occur.

### Efficacy of desmopressin and enuresis alarm as first and second line treatment for primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis: prospective randomized crossover study [^111ZkhKe]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

We compared the efficacy of desmopressin and enuresis alarm as first and second line treatment options for monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis.

Materials and Methods

A total of 104 children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis were randomly assigned to either desmopressin (54) or enuresis alarm (50) as first line treatment. Following 12 weeks of first line treatment children with a full response were evaluated for relapse 12 weeks after withdrawal of treatment. Children with partial or no response were switched to the alternative treatment and then evaluated after 12 weeks of crossover treatment. Relapse was defined as more than 1 episode of bedwetting monthly.

Results

Following first line treatment 77.8% of the desmopressin group and 82% of the enuresis alarm group achieved a successful result, including full response in 37% and 50% of the groups, respectively (p = 0.433). Of the children with a full response 50% in the desmopressin group and 12% in the enuresis alarm group experienced a relapse when treatment stopped (p = 0.005). Following second line crossover treatment 71.4% of the enuresis alarm-desmopressin group and 67.8% of the desmopressin-enuresis alarm group achieved a successful result, including full response in 47.6% and 45.2% of the groups, respectively (p = 0.961).

Conclusions

There was no difference between desmopressin and enuresis alarm during treatment for achieving dryness, but the chance of relapse after treatment stopped was higher following desmopressin. Switching to the alternative treatment following partial or no response provided an additional benefit.

### Management of bleeding and coagulopathy following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^1127pkdo]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Desmopressin

Recommendation 30

We suggest that desmopressin (0.3 µg/kg) be administered in patients treated with platelet-inhibiting drugs or with von Willebrand disease. (Grade 2C)

We do not suggest that desmopressin be used routinely in the bleeding trauma patient. (Grade 2C)

Rationale

Desmopressin (DDAVP; 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) enhances platelet adherence and platelet aggregate growth on human artery subendothelium and is the first choice in the treatment of bleeding in patients with von Willebrand disease, a disease which occurs roughly in 1 in 100 patients. Two meta-analyses in patients not diagnosed with von Willebrand disease were able to demonstrate either a trend towards a reduced peri-operative blood loss or a small significant reduction in blood transfusion requirements (-0.29 (-0.52 to -0.06) units per patient). Patients with impaired platelet function as assessed by a platelet function analyser or whole blood multiple electrode aggregometer may benefit from desmopressin therapy. Concerns regarding possible thromboembolic complications were not confirmed in the last meta-analysis from 2008.

Desmopressin has never been formally investigated in general trauma or TBI. Nevertheless, desmopressin has been recommended in patients treated with platelet inhibitors, suffering from intracerebral bleeding and in trauma patients with von Willebrand disease. Interestingly, desmopressin prevents the development of hypothermia-induced impairment of primary haemostasis and significantly increases platelet aggregation during hypothermia and acidosis.

### Increased urinary calcium excretion in enuretic children treated with desmopressin [^116D5sai]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

The use of desmopressin in the treatment of primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) is accepted and based on the fact that this drug leads to renal water reabsorption. However, recent findings have also implicated that desmopressin regulates other molecules, such as sodium and potassium. We investigate if desmopressin influences renal Ca2+ handling.

Materials and Methods

A total of 32 children with PNE were enrolled in a prospective study. Patients received a standard 30 microg desmopressin intranasally before going to bed. All patients were treated for at least 4 weeks. Desmopressin was then withdrawn and reintroduced after 2 weeks. Urine samples were collected during all 3 phases of the study. Ca2+ measurement was performed in single morning spot urines as well as in 24-hour collections. Additionally, blood was sampled for analysis of Ca2+. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for statistical analysis.

Results

Wet nights decreased an average of 4.75 to 1.0 per week with desmopressin treatment. While blood concentrations did not change with or without medication, urinary Ca2+ excretion was significantly higher while patients were treated with desmopressin. This significant result was the same in single spot as well as in 24-hour samples.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated the increased excretion of Ca2+ by desmopressin treatment in children with PNE. Since Ca2+ is a crucial molecule in growth and development, this finding indicates the necessity of larger followup studies concerning Ca2+ handling and growth in children on long-term desmopressin treatment.

### Desmopressin for nocturia in adults [^114kDGNB]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

Desmopressin has been used for many years in the treatment of diabetes insipidus, nocturnal enuresis (involuntary urination while asleep) and nocturia associated with multiple sclerosis (in adults aged up to 65 years); it has also been recommended in certain circumstances for the treatment of nocturia in men and women (previously, an unlicensed use). 1,2 Recently, a new brand of desmopressin sublingual tablet (lyophilisate-an orally disintegrating tablet; Noqdirna-Ferring) has been licensed for use in adults of any age for the treatment of nocturia due to idiopathic nocturnal polyuria. 3,4 The tablets contain a lower dose of desmopressin than was previously available. Unusually, there are different recommended doses for men and women. In this article, we consider the evidence on desmopressin in the treatment of idiopathic nocturnal polyuria in adults, and how this new formulation fits with current management strategies.

### Low compliance contribute to insufficient desmopressin response of primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and the role of voiding school [^115tyUEv]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Our results are supported by current literature, although treatment compliance in children with enuresis remains under-evaluated. Baeyens et al. showed that higher compliance was correlated with better therapeutic outcome after 6 months of therapy. Their study showed 70% average compliance with advices in children with nocturnal enuresis. They highlighted that complete adherence with medication and recommendations for its usage are essential and may change the response to therapy. Van Herzeele et al. stated that after 3 months of treatment compliance was lower by 10–20%, and that at the end of the study there was 71 to 77% fully compliant children. They emphasize that low compliance was associated with poor response which lead to insufficient antienuretic and antidiuretic effect. Other studies have showed 67% to 94% compliance with Desmopressin.

It is important to highlight that low compliance were more frequent in studies with rigorous definitions of compliance, and that in some studies definitions were not reported. A difference in compliance definitions and sample sizes makes a comparison between studies challenging. One of the reasons for low compliance may be that PNME is not severe and life threatening disease. The current literature suggests various theories for low compliance in primary MNE. Babwah et al. examined compliance in diabetic patients and suggested that women have greater compliance when compared to men. Other demographic factors, such as socioeconomic status and teen age can contribute to low compliance to medical treatment. Also, if patient or their parents perceive enuresis as issue that need and can resolve, they will have more interest to commit fully to treatment. Response to treatment is increasing with higher compliance which further strengthens compliance continuation, but when the response is low - there is further deterioration in compliance. Parents support as well as patients and parents education on primary MNE can contribute to higher compliance due to its effect on children's psychological condition. Highly compliant children have an advanced problem solving competence and higher self-esteem. Non-optimal dosing and treatment side effects can have negative influence on compliance due to lower treatment effectiveness or acceptability.

### Diuretic treatment of nocturnal enuresis: preliminary results of an open pilot study [^111sH47A]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Since antidiuretic treatment with desmopressin in the evening has proven effective against enuresis, it would not be surprising if diuretic treatment in the afternoon would have similar effects. We are currently testing this in an open pilot investigation.

Materials and Methods

A total of 33 children including 12 girls with a mean age ± SD of 7.6 ± 2.3 years with monosymptomatic enuresis were recruited from an outpatient primary care setting. Wet and dry nights were recorded for 2 weeks without medication, 2 weeks with 0.4 mg desmopressin orally at night and 2 weeks with 1 mg/kg furosemide 4 to 5 hours before bedtime.

Results

The mean number of wet nights ± SD during the 3 periods was 10.2 ± 3.0, 6.7 ± 4.7 and 7.8 ± 4.5, respectively. The effects of desmopressin and of furosemide were statistically significant (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.001), although the 2 treatments did not differ (p = 0.08). Only 6 children had a complete response (ie greater than 90% reduction in wet nights) to desmopressin and 5 responded to furosemide. Interestingly, 2 children had a clearly better response on furosemide than on desmopressin.

Conclusions

The treatment of enuresis with diuretic medication in the afternoon may be beneficial but needs to be tested in randomized controlled trials.

### Desmopressin for nocturnal enuresis in children [^1173MiHh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Enuresis (bedwetting) affects up to 20% of five-year-old children and 2% of adults. Although spontaneous remission often occurs, the social, emotional and psychological costs can be great. Desmopressin has been used to treat bedwetting since the 1970s. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2000 and last updated in 2006.

Objectives

To assess the effects of desmopressin on treating nocturnal enuresis in children.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched January 2023) and reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised or quasi-randomised trials of desmopressin or desmopressin combined with another intervention for treating nocturnal enuresis in children between five and 16 years old.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the eligible trials. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We identified 50 new studies for this review, which now includes 95 studies (8473) participants, of whom 5434 received desmopressin. In this review we continued the assessment of the effect of combination therapy involving desmopressin. The majority of the trials were in children between the ages of five to 16 years in an outpatient setting. The quality of the evidence was assessed as low or very low. The first comparison was desmopressin versus placebo. Desmopressin may reduce the mean number of wet nights per week compared with placebo (MD -1.81, 95% CI -2.24 to -1.39; participants = 1267; studies = 16; low-certainty evidence). Desmopressin probably leads to more children achieving 14 consecutive dry nights by the end of treatment compared with placebo (RR 3.18, 95% CI 1.75 to 5.80; participants = 922: studies = 11; moderate-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in children experiencing adverse effects with desmopressin compared to placebo (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.52; participants = 269; studies = 3; low-certainty evidence). Desmopressin was compared with alarm therapy. It is uncertain if there is any difference between desmopressin compared with alarm training in reducing the number of wet nights per week (MD 0.63, 95% CI -0.49 to 1.75; participants = 285; studies = 4; I² = 82%; very low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference between desmopressin and alarm therapy in the number of children achieving 14 consecutive dry nights (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.09; participants = 1530; studies = 15; low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in children experiencing side effects with desmopressin therapy compared with alarm therapy (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.33 to 6.78; participants = 461, studies = 4; low-certainty evidence). We compared desmopressin with other medications, including tricyclics and anticholinergics. It is uncertain if there is any difference between desmopressin compared to tricyclics in reducing the mean number of wet nights per week (MD 0.23, 95% CI - 0.88 to 1.33; participants = 331; studies = 4; I² = 79%; very low-certainty evidence) or in the number of children achieving 14 consecutive dry nights at the end of treatment (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.38; participants = 371; studies = 7; I² = 71%; very low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether children experience more side effects with desmopressin compared with tricyclics (RR 0.29, 95%CI 0.06 to 1.39; participants = 351; studies = 4, very low-certainty evidence). This review included studies with combination therapies. It is uncertain if desmopressin combined with alarm therapy reduces the mean number of wet nights at the end of treatment compared with alarm monotherapy (MD -0.80, 95% CI -1.34 to -0.25; participants = 528; studies = 6; I² = 84%; very low-certainty evidence); or if it increases the number of children achieving 14 consecutive dry nights (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.63; participants = 822; studies = 10; very low-certainty evidence). Desmopressin plus alarm therapy may make little to no difference in children experiencing side effects compared with alarm therapy alone (RR 1.05 95% CI 0.07 to 16.56; participants = 207; studies = 1; low-certainty evidence). Combining desmopressin with alarm therapy probably reduces the number of wet nights at the end of treatment (MD -0.88; 95%CI -1.38 to -0.38; participants = 156; studies = 2; moderate-certainty evidence), and may increase the number of children achieving 14 consecutive dry nights at the end of treatment compared with desmopressin monotherapy (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.51; participants = 370; studies = 5; low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain if combined desmopressin and anticholinergic therapy versus desmopressin monotherapy reduces the mean number of wet nights at the end of therapy (MD -0.50; 95% CI -1.05 to 0.06; participants = 188; studies = 3; I² = 66%; very low-certainty evidence); or if it may increase the number of children achieving 14 consecutive dry nights at the end of treatment (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.11; participants = 611; studies = 8; low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in adverse events between desmopressin plus anticholinergics and desmopressin monotherapy (RR 1.51 95% CI 0.73 to 3.09, participants = 187; studies = 2; low-certainty evidence). Minor adverse effects were common for desmopressin, including dizziness, headache, mood changes, gastrointestinal discomfort, nasal discomfort, hyponatraemia and one report of a convulsion.

Authors' Conclusions

Desmopressin compared with placebo may increase the number of dry nights per week at the end of treatment in children. Desmopressin therapy may be as effective as alarm therapy at the end of treatment. However, the quality of evidence was assessed as low or very low. Alarm therapy compared to desmopressin may improve the number of children who are dry at follow-up (moderate-certainty evidence).

### Comparison of two weight-based desmopressin dosing strategies for spontaneous bleeding [^113ynERH]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of desmopressin are appropriate for adjusted body weight-based dosing, particularly in obese patients.

Objective

The objective of this study was to describe desmopressin dosing strategies, with emphasis on hemostatic outcomes among patients without preexisting bleeding disorders.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study of patients who received intravenous weight-based desmopressin for a hemostatic indication. Demographics, comorbidities, treatment setting, indication, site of bleeding, and outcomes were collected from the medical record. Primary outcomes included need for procedural intervention to achieve hemostasis, transfusion requirement, and death. Association between desmopressin dose and outcome was evaluated using χ² or Fischer's exact tests and logistic and linear regression models. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify other predictors of outcome in the data set.

Results

A total of 109 patients were included (n = 26, dose adjustment; n = 83, no dose adjustment). Baseline characteristics were well-matched between groups: mean (SD) age of 57.0 (13.5) years; mean (SD) Charlson Comorbidity Score of 6.5 (2.8); 37% were obese; 76% were critically ill; 81% were actively bleeding without differences in site of bleeding; and crude mortality was 39%. No differences in death, mean units of packed red blood cells transfused, or need for procedural hemostasis were observed between adjusted weight- and actual weight-based desmopressin dosing.

Conclusions

When used adjunctively to blood product transfusion in actively bleeding patients, use of adjusted body weight-based desmopressin did not negatively affect clinical outcomes. More data are needed to confirm this dosing strategy.

### Nocturnal enuresis [^111dG2tg]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Nocturnal enuresis is a common problem that can be troubling for children and their families. Recent studies indicate that nocturnal enuresis is best regarded as a group of conditions with different etiologies. A genetic component is likely in many affected children. Research also indicates the possibility of two subtypes of patients with nocturnal enuresis: those with a functional bladder disorder and those with a maturational delay in nocturnal arginine vasopressin secretion. The evaluation of nocturnal enuresis requires a thorough history, a complete physical examination, and urinalysis. Treatment options include nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic measures. Continence training should be incorporated into the treatment regimen. Use of a bed-wetting alarm has the highest cure rate and the lowest relapse rate; however, some families may have difficulty with this treatment approach. Desmopressin and imipramine are the primary medications used to treat nocturnal enuresis, but both are associated with relatively high relapse rates.

### Global estimation of the bleeding episodes treatable with desmopressin in von Willebrand disease and hemophilia a… [^111RYS4Y]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

After the original report in 1977, desmopressin has been used worldwide thanks to its ability to raise FVIII and VWF plasma levels in patients with non-severe Hem A or type 1 VWD who need treatment for spontaneous or provoked bleeding or in preparation for surgery and trauma. This medicine is characterized by its low-cost efficacy, convenient administration routes (subcutaneous and intranasal), the likelihood of avoiding having to use blood products or recombinant factors, as well as a good safety record. Moreover, its administration does not induce inhibitors in non-severe Hem A patients, who have a 3–13% lifetime inhibitor risk following FVIII replacement therapy. Desmopressin can also be used to treat bleeding episodes in non-severe Hem A patients who have developed inhibitors owing to the absence of any anamnestic rise of the inhibitor. These characteristics prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2015 to include desmopressin in its list of essential medicines. The WHO Expert Committee acknowledged that "desmopressin is an important medicine in the hemostatic armamentarium for patients with bleeding disorders, particularly in view of the ease of its administration (notably the intranasal formulation)". All this notwithstanding, the medication is becoming unavailable or experiencing a dramatic shortage, particularly in the intranasal and subcutaneous formulations.

Table 8.
Computation of estimates of number of patients, number of annual bleeding events, and successfully treated annual bleeding events according to responsiveness to desmopressin.

With this background, we chose to estimate how many patients with VWD type 1 and non-severe Hem A can be treated with desmopressin worldwide and how many bleeding events could be treated annually. To achieve these objectives, we assessed the literature in the frame of a narrative review and also employed the data reported by the WFH-AGS 2023 5 and scientific societies involved in congenital bleeding disorders. We chose a non-systematic review, with all its limitations, in order to include a wide variety of studies. This choice was also based on the paucity of studies pertaining to type 1 VWD and non-severe Hem A, and bleeding frequency and response to desmopressin in these patients, as well as the great variability of study designs (e.g. no randomized clinical trials, few prospective studies, type of cohorts) and definitions of desmopressin response.

Antidiuretic Hormone

Antidiuretic Hormone Diurnal Rhythm and Therapy

Healthy individuals have a nocturnal decrease in urine output due to increased plasma antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels at night. In fact, children with enuresis and nocturnal polyuria may lack the physiologic increase in ADH levels during sleep, and treatment with the ADH synthetic analogue desmopressin might be necessary to restore this rhythm. Furthermore, there is evidence for a diurnal rhythm in copeptin — the C-terminal part of the ADH precursor — release, similar to the rhythm of ADH, with higher levels at night and early morning and lower levels in the late afternoon (Fig. 1A).

Desmopressin acetate, also known as 1-desamino-8-D-AVP (DDAVP), is the synthetic analogue of ADH. The antidiuretic properties of desmopressin have led to its use in polyuric conditions including, among others, arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D, formerly known as central diabetes insipidus). Desmopressin can be administered intranasally, orally, subcutaneously, or intravenously. The absorption of desmopressin acetate through the nasal mucosa is highly variable, secondary to mucosal inflammation or congestion, and the duration of the antidiuretic effect is more variable than that of the oral administration, ranging from 5 to 21 hours. The oral form is generally preferred to the nasal spray due to the ease of administration, the more stable PK, and the preserved efficacy even in cases of nasal congestion or infection. The peak is reached within 2 hours of ingestion, and the antidiuretic action lasts for 6 to 12 hours. Patients with complete AVP-D usually need a dose 2 to 3 times daily, whereas in patients with partial AVP-D, a single bedtime dose might be sufficient to control nicturia.

Desmopressin is dosed empirically, and ADH is not routinely measured. According to previous evidence, the first dose of desmopressin is usually given at bedtime to initially reduce nicturia and to respect the circadian rhythm of ADH. If polyuria and polydipsia persist during the day, a daytime dose might be necessary (Fig. 1B).

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^116Csakg]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Although desmopressin has been shown to improve platelet function in volunteers on aspirin and clopidogrel and perioperatively in patients with mild inherited platelet defects, the use of desmopressin for acquired bleeding disorders is not supported by sound clinical evidence. One older meta-analysis suggested a benefit of desmopressin in patients taking aspirin, and desmopressin has been recommended in patients taking platelet inhibitors who suffer an ICH. The standard dose is 0.3 μg/kg diluted in 50 mL saline and infused over 30 min. Recently, two small prospective studies have shown that desmopressin can improve platelet function in patients with ICH who have received aspirin or not prior to the event. Identification of impaired platelet function with a platelet function analyser PFA-100 or whole blood MEA might be helpful in the identification of patients who could benefit from desmopressin therapy. The combined effect of platelet concentrates and subsequent administration of desmopressin has also been advocated to enhance the recovery of normal platelet function, however, desmopressin and platelet administration was not associated with either a decreased risk of early radiographic haemorrhage progression (OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.40; P = 0.2) or mortality (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.60 to 4.30; P = 0.4) in patients with traumatic ICH.

Desmopressin appears to be efficacious in the mitigation of platelet inhibition by adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitors such as clopidogrel and ticagrelor. Equivalent data for prasugrel appear not to have been published.

There are only a few studies on the use of desmopressin in general trauma, ICH or TBI. However, in patients with ICH and reduced platelet activity and/or prior aspirin use, desmopressin (0.4 µg/kg) shortened platelet function analyser closure time and increased von Willebrand factor levels. Conversely, in a recent retrospective study on early ICH progression in 401 patients with TBI (54 on platelet inhibitors prior to trauma) the co-administration of desmopressin (0.3 µg/kg) with platelet transfusion was found inefficacious in terms of slowing the early ICH progression. Nevertheless, desmopressin has been recommended in patients treated with platelet inhibitors with intracerebral bleeding and in trauma patients with von Willebrand disease. Interestingly, desmopressin prevents the development of hypothermia-induced impairment of primary haemostasis and significantly increases platelet aggregation during hypothermia and acidosis.

### Global estimation of the bleeding episodes treatable with desmopressin in von Willebrand disease and hemophilia a… [^115Avh3j]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, desmopressin is an essential therapeutic tool in VWD type 1 and non-severe Hem A, because more than 220,000 bleeding episodes can be annually treated safely and economically. This number could almost double if all patients registered are considered, or even increase 6-fold if we allow for one symptomatic patient out of 10,000 people seeking tertiary care referral for VWD. Finally, there is a need to improve VWD and hemophilia diagnosis globally, because it is reasonable to imply that 1 out of 1,000 individuals may suffer from bleeding symptoms, but will not have been diagnosed or received appropriate treatment.

### New therapies for von Willebrand disease [^1173w9tK]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

The management of von Willebrand disease (VWD) is based upon the dual correction of the primary hemostasis defect, due to the inherited deficiency of von Willebrand factor (VWF), and of the secondary defect of factor VIII coagulant activity (FVIII:C), due to the loss of binding and stabilization by VWF of this intrinsic coagulation factor in flowing blood. The traditional therapeutic weapons (the synthetic derivative of the antidiuretic hormone desmopressin and plasma-derived VWF/FVIII concentrates) are able to transiently correct both the defects. With the goal of tackling the primary deficiency in the disease, that is, VWF, but at the same time exploiting the normal capacity of patients to produce FVIII, the novel approach of replacing only VWF was implemented in the last 10 years. Following the manufacturing of a concentrate fractionated from human plasma and of one obtained by recombinant DNA technology, clinical studies have shown that VWF-only products correct not only the primary VWF deficiency but also the secondary FVIII:C deficiency. The demonstrated efficacy of these products in various clinical situations and, ultimately, in such a hemostasis-challenging context as surgery testifies to the effectiveness and safety of this approach. It remains to be seen whether VWF-only products are efficacious and safe in still-unexplored situations, such as use in children; the long-term use for prophylaxis; and in recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding due to angiodysplasia, a major therapeutic problem in VWD.

### Desmopressin dose requirements in patients with permanent arginine vasopressin deficiency: a tertiary center experience [^1162sHeB]. Pituitary (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Arginine vasopressin (AVP) deficiency, also referred to as central diabetes insipidus, is a hydro-electrolytic balance disorder resulting from an alteration in the production or secretion of the hypothalamic neuropeptide. This condition can be of genetic or acquired origin, often occurring after neurosurgery.

AVP deficiency is considered a rare disease, with an estimated prevalence in the population of approximately 1 in 25,000 individuals, and it belongs to the polyuria-polydipsia syndrome, along with AVP resistance (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) and primary polydipsia. This syndrome encompasses a group of disorders characterized by hypotonic polyuria (generally defined as urine output > 50 mL/kg/day), accompanied by excessive drinking (generally defined as fluid intake > 3L/day).

Indeed, the deficiency of the hypothalamic neurohormone results in a reduction of free water reabsorption at the level of the renal collecting duct (mediated through interaction with the V2 receptor), with a tendency towards rapid dehydration and possible consequent hypernatremia and hypertonicity, unless fluids are immediately replaced.

The treatment of AVP deficiency, therefore, relies on restoring fluid losses in cases of hypovolemia, as well as on the chronic administration of a synthetic analogue of the human peptide, known as 1-deamino-8-D-AVP (dDAVP) or desmopressin. This medication is exclusively selective for the renal V2 receptor, lacking the other effects mediated by interaction with the V1a receptor, primarily expressed at the vascular level, and V1b receptor, localized on the corticotrope cells of the anterior pituitary.

### Desmopressin for patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage taking antiplatelet drugs (DASH): a UK-based, phase 2, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre feasibility trial [^1112akxT]. The Lancet: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

Given sufficient recruiting centres and pragmatic trial methodology, it should be feasible to conduct a definitive trial to determine if desmopressin improves outcome in patients on antiplatelet drug therapy with intracerebral haemorrhage. Important considerations for a definitive trial are allowing 24 h after stroke symptoms onset for recruitment, facilitating recruitment out of hours, and using simplified temperature monitoring for desmopressin.

Recommendations of international guidelines for the management of intracerebral haemorrhage in people taking antiplatelets are conflicting. We hypothesised that desmopressin might reduce bleeding and improve outcomes in people with intracerebral haemorrhage. To our knowledge, no randomised trials comparing desmopressin with placebo have been conducted in people with intracerebral haemorrhage. Before embarking on a definitive randomised controlled trial, to determine the effectiveness of desmopressin, we conducted a feasibility trial to test the methods for a full trial, to understand whether participants could be recruited to such a trial and, if so, the rate of recruitment. The primary objective was to assess the feasibility of randomising, administering the intervention, and completing follow-up for patients treated with desmopressin or placebo, to inform a definitive trial.

### Evaluation and treatment of enuresis [^115zowSg]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Enuresis is defined as repeated, spontaneous voiding of urine during sleep in a child five years or older. It affects 5 to 7 million children in the United States. Primary nocturnal enuresis is caused by a disparity between bladder capacity and nocturnal urine production and failure of the child to awaken in response to a full bladder. Less commonly, enuresis is secondary to a medical, psychological, or behavioral problem. A diagnosis usually can be made with a history focusing on enuresis and a physical examination followed by urinalysis. Imaging and urodynamic studies generally are not needed unless specifically indicated (e.g., to exclude suspected neurologic or urologic disease). Primary nocturnal enuresis almost always resolves spontaneously over time. Treatment should be delayed until the child is able and willing to adhere to the treatment program; medications are rarely indicated in children younger than seven years. If the condition is not distressing to the child, treatment is not needed. However, parents should be reassured about their child's physical and emotional health and counseled about eliminating guilt, shame, and punishment. Enuresis alarms are effective in children with primary nocturnal enuresis and should be considered for older, motivated children from cooperative families when behavioral measures are unsuccessful. Desmopressin is most effective in children with nocturnal polyuria and normal bladder capacity. Patients respond to desmopressin more quickly than to alarm systems. Combined treatment is effective for resistant cases.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Infrequently, large doses of the intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate tablets and injection have produced transient headache, nausea, flushing and mild abdominal cramps. These symptoms have disappeared with reduction in dosage.

Central Diabetes Insipidus

In long-term clinical studies in which patients with diabetes insipidus were followed for periods up to 44 months of desmopressin acetate tablet therapy, transient increases in AST (SGOT) no higher than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal were occasionally observed. Elevated AST (SGOT) returned to the normal range despite continued use of desmopressin acetate tablets.

Primary Nocturnal Enuresis

The only adverse event occurring in ≥ 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials with desmopressin acetate tablets that was probably, possibly, or remotely related to study drug was headache (4% desmopressin acetate, 3% placebo).

Other

The following adverse events have been reported; however their relationship to desmopressin acetate has not been established: abnormal thinking, diarrhea, and edema-weight gain. See WARNINGS for the possibility of water intoxication and hyponatremia.

Post Marketing

There have been rare reports of hyponatremic convulsions associated with concomitant use with the following medications: oxybutinin and imipramine.

### Comparison of effects of treatment of primary nocturnal enuresis with oxybutynin plus desmopressin, desmopressin alone or imipramine alone: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^117QfSdg]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

We prospectively evaluated the efficacy of a combination of desmopressin and oxybutynin for treating children with nocturnal enuresis, compared to the single drugs imipramine and desmopressin.

Materials and Methods

We enrolled 158 patients from 2003 to 2004. Children were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups and treated with desmopressin, imipramine or a combination of desmopressin plus oxybutynin. Of these patients 145 (100 boys and 45 girls, mean age 7.8 ± 2.5 years, range 5 to 15) were followed for more than 6 months. Efficacy was measured at 1, 3 and 6 months in terms of average enuretic frequency, 5-scale response based on change in nocturnal enuretic frequency after treatment and posttreatment enuretic frequency as a percentage of pretreatment baseline frequency. The latter efficacy was classified according to daytime voiding symptoms. Statistical evaluation was performed using chi-square tests and ANOVA.

Results

Of the 145 children followed 48 received combination therapy, 49 received desmopressin and 48 received imipramine. A total of 68 patients (47%) had monosymptomatic enuresis and 77 (53%) had polysymptomatic enuresis. Combination therapy produced the best and most rapid results regardless of whether the children had monosymptomatic or polysymptomatic enuresis.

Conclusions

Combination therapy with desmopressin plus oxybutynin for the treatment of pediatric nocturnal enuresis was well tolerated, and gave significantly faster and more cost-effective results than single drug therapy using either desmopressin or imipramine.

### Primary nocturnal enuresis: a novel therapeutic strategy with higher efficacy [^1143H3Fi]. Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To introduce a new protocol for patients with primary nocturnal enuresis to increase efficacy of treatment and decrease relapse rate.

Methods

A prospective study was done on 185 children diagnosed with nocturnal enuresis between the years 2007 and 2014. Inclusion criteria consisted of age > 5 years, monosymptomatic enuresis or non-monosymptomatic enuresis, strict abidance by the protocol, and follow-up > 24 months. Exclusion criteria consisted of secondary enuresis, poor compliance to protocol, and neurogenic bladder. Participants were started on combination therapy of desmopressin 120 µg (MELT formula) once per day and propiverine 7.5 mg twice per day, which were then adjusted as per their response to therapy and our designed protocol. Outcome was defined as per the International Children Continence Society (ICCS) latest definitions.

Results

One hundred twenty-two patients satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included in the study with a median age of 9 years (range 5–19 years). The mean follow-up time was 62 months (range 25–114 months). Our protocol showed an overall complete success of 87% with failure and relapse of 13%. The success rate of patients needing 120 µg desmopressin as maintenance therapy to achieve dryness was 92.7% as compared to 65% success in patients needing a higher dose of desmopressin to achieve dryness (P < .05). Age, gender, and type of primary nocturnal enuresis had no effect over success (all P > .05).

Conclusion

Adopting combination therapy along with structured withdrawal as per our protocol showed higher success rates and lower relapses in primary nocturnal enuretic children.

### Global estimation of the bleeding episodes treatable with desmopressin in von Willebrand disease and hemophilia a… [^112EoUQ8]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Responsiveness to desmopressin is similar in VWD type 1 and mild Hem A (80%), but it is definitely lower in moderate Hem A (25%). Based on these assumptions on the response rate, the number of bleeding events that can be treated yearly with desmopressin are approximately 210,000 in VWD type 1 and 12,500 in non-severe Hem A. There are limitations related to these estimates, considering that patient aging may be associated with fewer bleeds. On the other hand, our estimation, based on the treatment of actual bleeds, may underestimate desmopressin usage, such as, for example, for bleeding prophylaxis and conditions other than mild Hem A and type 1 VWD (e.g. type 2 N VWD and platelet function defects, which were excluded from the present review). Underestimation of its use is also related to the fact that our estimates have not included the use of desmopressin for diagnosis, surgery, or childbirth, nor its pre-emptive use for trauma or bleeding prophylaxis, because it is impossible to have reliable data. We have also not included hemophilia carriers with FVIII levels below 40 IU/dL, who presumably account for at least 5% of the cases with severe Hem A, nor patients with other VWD types, such as 2M, who may be responsive to desmopressin.

### Evaluating use of higher dose oxybutynin in combination with desmopressin for refractory nocturnal enuresis [^112b9kxb]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Nocturnal enuresis is a common pediatric condition with limited treatment options. In older children, pharmacologic therapy is often the preferred treatment. Pharmacologic therapies including desmopressin (DDAVP) or imipramine are effective in 40–50% of children. However, imipramine has serious safety concerns. Desmopressin in combination with a fixed dose anticholinergic has been shown to be useful in individuals who fail desmopressin monotherapy, but still fails to achieve success rates greater than 60%.

Objective

The goal was to explore the efficacy and safety of using combination therapy desmopressin plus oxybutynin with increasing dose of oxybutynin in patients refractory to standard combination therapy.

Study Design

This was a single institution, IRB-approved, retrospective chart review of 61 patients (ages 7–18 years) including those with monosymptomatic primary nocturnal enuresis and non-monosymptomatic enuresis with controlled daytime voiding symptoms (CDVS) treated initially with desmopressin. All patients who failed initial therapy with desmopressin were started on combination therapy desmopressin (0.6 mg) plus standard dose (5 mg) oxybutynin. In patients who failed standard combination therapy, the dose of oxybutynin was titrated upwards until a response or the maximum dose of 10 mg was achieved. Demographic and medical history data were evaluated to determine predictive factors associated with response/failure to different therapy groups.

Results

The use of escalating doses of oxybutynin in combination with desmopressin achieved an overall response rate of 96.7% defined as a 2-week period without any enuretic events following initiation of treatment. Low-dose combination therapy (LDCT) (0.6 mg of desmopressin+5 mg of oxybutynin) had a response rate of 68% (Table). Advanced dose combination therapy (ADCT) (0.6 mg of desmopressin+7.5–10 mg of oxybutynin) had a response rate of 75.0%. A statistically significant relationship was found correlating both attention deficit disorder/attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADD/ADHD) and CDVS with failure on monotherapy. No patients in the study reported any adverse events or side effects from the medications.

Discussion

The overall success rate of 96.7% with titrated doses of oxybutynin in combination with desmopressin is considerably higher than the response rates on fixed dose combination therapy quoted in the literature and supports the need for further evaluation in larger studies. Additionally, we found a statistically significant association between monotherapy failure and children with either ADD/ADHD or controlled daytime voiding symptoms. Our study is limited by small numbers and larger studies are needed to confirm these results.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that ADCT is a safe and effective treatment option for primary nocturnal enuresis refractory to standard and low-dose combination therapy.

### Recommendations of apex health bodies remain localized: not in conformity with international implementation policy for urological disorders [^117MWTjy]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

Desmopressin/DDAVP (deamino — arginine-vasopressin)

Nocturia is one of the common and early symptoms of BPH that impairs sleep at night, reduces the QoL, leads to daytime sleepiness and increased risk of falls in older adults. Desmopressin (synthetic replacement for vasopressin) is currently approved for the treatment of nocturia along with nocturnal polyuria or multiple sclerosis. This is being used voraciously even though it leads to hyponatremia induced morbidity in older adult patients. Most surprising fact is that STOPP/START and AUA guidelines are silent whereas Beer criteria advocate avoiding its use in said population. As per EAU guidelines cautioned use in people > 75 years of age is recommended as decisive factor not the outcome (hyponatremia). In patients < 75 years of age, low dose is recommended with monitoring of serum sodium levels.

Androgens

Adult male hypogonadism also called (late-onset-hypogonadism (LOH) usually presents with persistent sexual, physical and psychological symptoms and may adversely affect multiple organ functions and QoL in older adult. The prevalence of hypogonadism increases with age. EAU considers serum testosterone < 3.5 ng/ml as cut off value while AUA recommends serum testosterone levels below 300 ng/ml in support of the diagnosis of low testosterone. All these apex bodies recommended androgens in LOH, however there is lack of harmony with regard to their contraindications. AUA guidelines (2018) state that PSA should be measured prior to commencement of testosterone therapy to exclude prostate cancer diagnosis and patient should be informed of inadequate evidence available regarding effect of testosterone therapy on the risk of cardiovascular events.EAU absolutely contraindicated its use in patients with untreated prostate and breast cancer.

### Desmopressin versus desmopressin + oxybutynin in the treatment of children with nocturnal enuresis [^1147cy3v]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Enuresis is identified as voluntary or involuntary leakage of urine for at least three consecutive months in the daytime and/or nighttime on clothes for children older than five. Monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE) describes nighttime wetting without daytime leakage of urine in children with no pathology in the urinary system and it is 80% more common than enuresis. Desmopressin is the most common medical treatment for MNE. The aim of this study is to retrospectively compare the effectiveness of desmopressin as monotherapy and desmopressin + oxybutynin as a combination therapy in the treatment of nocturnal enuresis.

Material and Method

This study retrospectively evaluated 183 patients who applied to pediatrics, pediatrics surgery and urology clinics with the complaint of nocturnal enuresis and diagnosed with primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis between January 2014 and December 2019. The patients were divided into two groups (91 patients) who only received desmopressin therapy (Group 1), and those (92 patients) who received desmopressin and oxybutynin combination therapy (Group 2). Response to treatment, compliance and recurrence ratios were determined in the evaluation. Complete response was accepted as 90–100% decrease in the number of nighttime wetting, partial response was accepted as 50–90% decrease in the number of nighttime wetting and those below 50% were regarded as non-response. The 1st, 3rd, and 6th months of control data of treatment effectiveness of both groups were evaluated and their responses to treatment and the side effects of drugs were examined.

Results

The mean age 183 patients of whom 103 were male and 80 were female was 10 (6–16) year. In the first month of control of Group 1, 71.4% had a complete cure, 8.8% had a partial cure and 19.8% had no response to treatment. In the third month of control of Group 1, 74.73% gave a complete response and were cured, 5.5% gave a partial response and 19.78% had no response. In the sixth month of Group 1, 70 patients were evaluated as complete response (79.5%), and 5 patients were evaluated as partial response (5.6%). In the first month of control of Group 2, 75% gave a complete response, 10.9% gave a partial response, 14.1% had no response to treatment. In the third month of control of Group 2, 86.9% gave a complete response, 6.52% gave a partial response, and 6.52% had no response. In the sixth month of the control of Group 2, the number of patients who did not come for control and could not be reached was 2, 83 patients out of 90 patients were evaluated as complete response (92.2%), 6 patients were evaluated as partial response (6.6%).

Conclusion

Desmopressin is the only FDA approved pharmacologic treatment for nocturnal enuresis. Desmopressin reduces urine production and the anticholinergic agent allows the bladder to store more urine. Therefore, combined therapy can be recommended in the MNE treatment for specially selected cases.

### Association of anaesthetists guidelines: the use of blood components and their alternatives [^113PdELp]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Desmopressin

Desmopressin (or DDAVP or 1‐deamino‐8‐D‐arginine vasopressin) is a pro‐haemostatic drug that is used commonly for patients with inherited bleeding disorders. Desmopressin stimulates release of von Willebrand factor (vWF) from the endothelium which then binds platelets to collagen through GP1b receptors and to other platelets through GPIIb/IIIa receptors. It has been considered as an alternative to platelet transfusions. Desmopressin in a dose of 0.3 μg·kg⁻¹ may be considered in patients presenting for surgery with acquired or inherited vWF deficiency.

The use of desmopressin has been evaluated in the peri‐operative setting where it may lead to a small reduction in blood loss and volume of RBCs transfused in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, these differences are unlikely to be of clinical importance. Patients that may benefit from desmopressin include those with platelet dysfunction secondary to cardiopulmonary bypass or recent antiplatelet therapy prior to cardiac surgery, but the certainty of the evidence is low. A small feasibility RCT found no evidence of an efficacy signal for desmopressin on raising vWF levels or other markers of haemostasis in patients who are critically ill.

In patients on antiplatelet drugs who experience intracranial haemorrhage, a multicentre trial demonstrated feasibility and safety of desmopressin administration, but confirmatory data are needed.

### Desmopressin in the treatment of nocturia: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^111JQuWG]. European Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate efficacy, safety, and impact on quality of sleep of desmopressin in the treatment of nocturia.

Methods

Adults aged ≥ 18 yr with nocturia (≥ 2 voids/night) received desmopressin tablets (0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mg) during a 3-wk dose-titration period. Patients should show sufficient response during the dose-titration period (≥ 20% reduction in nocturnal diuresis) and a return of nocturnal diuresis to ≥ 80% of baseline levels during washout. Eligible patients then entered a 3-wk double-blind treatment period and received either desmopressin or placebo.

Results

127 patients were randomised to either desmopressin (n = 61) or placebo (n = 66). Twenty (33%) desmopressin-treated patients compared with seven (11%) placebo-treated patients showed a clinical response, defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in the number of nocturnal voids compared with baseline (p = 0.0014). Compared with placebo, desmopressin resulted in a significant reduction in the mean number of nocturnal voids (39% reduction with desmopressin vs. 15% with placebo; absolute difference -0.84, p < 0.0001) and duration of the first sleep period (prolonged by 108 min with desmopressin vs. 41 min with placebo; p < 0.0001). Quality of sleep was also improved with desmopressin versus placebo (statistically significant for one of the two parameters evaluated). Adverse events were mainly mild.

Conclusions

Oral desmopressin tablets provide an effective and well-tolerated treatment for nocturia. Compared with placebo, nocturnal voiding frequency is reduced, duration of the first sleep period is increased, and sleep quality may be improved.
