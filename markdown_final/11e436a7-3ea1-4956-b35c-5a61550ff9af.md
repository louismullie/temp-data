## Question

what causes aphthous ulcers

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes aphthous ulcers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core entity and whether we are dealing with recurrent aphthous stomatitis versus other oral ulcer diseases. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for a multifactorial model versus any single cause. Next, I will examine genetic predisposition, immune dysregulation, local and systemic triggers, and the role of nutrition and drugs. After that, I need to distinguish simple aphthosis from complex aphthosis and systemic mimics. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and highlight uncertainties and exceptions that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity so I don't jump to conclusions. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis is the most common oral ulcerative condition, characterized by painful, round or oval ulcers on nonkeratinized mucosa that heal spontaneously, with prevalence around 20% and peak incidence in adolescents and young adults, which frames the discussion of causation in a population context [^114V8hXG] [^114t53bk].

> Wait, let me verify the overarching etiologic message before drilling down. Multiple high-quality sources converge on the same point: the cause of recurrent aphthous stomatitis is unknown, and current evidence supports a multifactorial model with genetic susceptibility, immune dysregulation, and environmental or local triggers interacting to produce lesions, rather than a single causal agent or pathway [^115AZoga] [^116oR26A] [^114V8hXG].

> I will now examine genetic predisposition, but I should double-check the magnitude and specificity. Family history is positive in roughly 40% of patients, suggesting heritability, and a large genome-wide association study estimates heritability at about 8% with 97 variants near immune regulatory loci, notably IL12A, supporting a T cell–mediated component to susceptibility rather than a Mendelian cause [^114V8hXG] [^117CeV8c] [^117W79cM].

> Next, I should review immune dysregulation and inflammatory mediators. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about autoimmunity; while an autoimmune or hypersensitivity mechanism is plausible, it remains unproven as a singular cause. However, meta-analytic data show elevated TNF-α in saliva, serum, and lesions of RAS compared with healthy controls, reinforcing a proinflammatory milieu that likely lowers the threshold for ulceration in susceptible hosts [^1129nbRU] [^115DYCVA].

> Let me consider local and environmental triggers, and I need to ensure I separate established from speculative. Local mechanical trauma is a recognized precipitant in susceptible individuals, and sodium lauryl sulfate in toothpastes may exacerbate symptoms, while smoking cessation has been associated with increased recurrence in some cohorts, implying a complex relationship rather than a straightforward protective effect [^115AZoga] [^116oR26A] [^114V8hXG].

> I should confirm systemic and nutritional associations because they often get overcalled. Meta-analyses link RAS with deficiencies in vitamin B12, folate, and ferritin, and celiac disease is associated with a higher incidence of RAS, with gluten-free diet improving oral symptoms in a meaningful fraction of patients, suggesting that in a subset, malabsorption and micronutrient deficits contribute to pathogenesis [^114t53bk] [^116KA5tF] [^116zwQa9].

> But wait, what if medications are the driver in a given patient. I need to check drug associations carefully. Case-control and case-series data implicate NSAIDs and beta-blockers, and transplant immunosuppressants like mycophenolate mofetil and mTOR inhibitors are well-described causes of aphthous-like stomatitis; importantly, lesions often resolve with withdrawal, supporting a causal relationship in those contexts [^116oR26A] [^112dTDVc] [^116C8No9].

> Hold on, I should verify the distinction between simple and complex aphthosis because it changes the causal workup. Simple RAS is idiopathic and typically self-limited, whereas complex aphthosis features frequent, severe, or multisite ulcers and warrants evaluation for systemic diseases such as Behçet disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and autoinflammatory syndromes like PFAPA, where aphthae are part of a broader immune phenotype rather than isolated mucosal disease [^1151sL4a] [^114u5tww] [^115MjJC9].

> Let me reconsider whether any single factor explains most cases, and I should double-check that I'm not overstating certainty. Despite advances, no study has identified a universal cause, and authoritative reviews consistently conclude that RAS reflects a multifactorial interplay of genetic susceptibility, immune activation, and environmental or local triggers, with the relative contribution varying by individual, which is why management often remains empiric and symptom-targeted [^115AZoga] [^115zppZ3] [^114V8hXG].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis is clinically actionable and honest about uncertainties. Aphthous ulcers arise from a multifactorial pathogenesis in which genetically susceptible individuals, with immune dysregulation marked by elevated TNF-α, experience mucosal injury precipitated by local trauma, certain foods or oral care products, micronutrient deficiencies, gastrointestinal disease, or medications, with the balance of factors differing across patients. Persistent, severe, or atypical disease should prompt evaluation for systemic associations, but for most, no single cause is identifiable and management focuses on trigger avoidance and symptomatic care [^117CeV8c] [^115DYCVA] [^114t53bk] [^1151sL4a].

---

Aphthous ulcers are caused by a **multifactorial interplay** of immune dysregulation, genetic predisposition, and environmental triggers [^1151sL4a]. Key drivers include **TNF-α–mediated inflammation** [^115DYCVA], local trauma, stress, hormonal shifts, and deficiencies in iron, vitamin B12, or folate [^114t53bk]. They are also linked to systemic diseases such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and Behçet's [^1151sL4a] [^112SzgHs], and can be triggered by certain drugs (e.g. NSAIDs, beta-blockers, immunosuppressants) [^116oR26A] [^112dTDVc]. No single cause explains all cases, and management focuses on identifying and addressing modifiable triggers while using topical corticosteroids for symptom control [^1129nbRU] [^114V8hXG].

---

## Immune dysregulation and inflammation

- **TNF-α dysregulation**: Elevated TNF-α is a hallmark of aphthous ulcers, driving inflammation and tissue injury [^115DYCVA].
- **Autoimmune mechanisms**: Autoimmune or hypersensitivity reactions are suspected in many cases, though no specific autoantigen is identified [^1129nbRU].
- **Neutrophil dysfunction**: Abnormal neutrophil activity and chemotaxis contribute to mucosal damage [^112Dk95V].

---

## Genetic predisposition

Family history is present in about **40% of patients**, indicating a heritable component [^114V8hXG]. A genome-wide association study identified **97 loci** near immune-regulatory regions (e.g. IL12A) associated with mouth ulcers, supporting a genetic susceptibility [^117CeV8c].

---

## Environmental and local factors

- **Local trauma**: Mechanical injury (e.g. dental procedures, sharp foods, accidental bites) is a common trigger [^115AZoga].
- **Stress and anxiety**: Emotional stress is frequently reported to precipitate episodes [^1148ZadS].
- **Hormonal fluctuations**: Hormonal changes, particularly in women, correlate with recurrence [^notfound].
- **Dietary factors**: Acidic, spicy, or abrasive foods may exacerbate ulcers [^114V8hXG].

---

## Nutritional deficiencies

Deficiencies in **iron, vitamin B12, and folate** are strongly associated with aphthous ulcers, with odds ratios of 2.62, 3.75, and 7.55, respectively [^114t53bk]. Celiac disease-related malabsorption is also linked to recurrent ulcers, and a gluten-free diet improves symptoms in many patients [^116KA5tF] [^116zwQa9].

---

## Systemic diseases and conditions

- **Celiac disease**: Strong association with aphthous ulcers; prevalence is significantly higher than in controls [^114t53bk].
- **Inflammatory bowel disease**: Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis feature oral aphthae as extraintestinal manifestations [^112SzgHs].
- **Behçet's disease**: Recurrent oral aphthae are a diagnostic hallmark, often with genital and ocular involvement [^113jL4qE].
- **Immunodeficiencies**: HIV and other immunosuppressed states increase risk and severity [^114V8hXG].

---

## Medications and substances

NSAIDs and beta-blockers are associated with aphthous ulcers in **case-control studies** [^116oR26A]. Immunosuppressive agents such as **mycophenolate mofetil** and **mTOR inhibitors** also cause aphthous-like stomatitis [^112dTDVc] [^116C8No9]. Sodium lauryl sulfate in toothpaste may irritate mucosa and worsen symptoms [^114V8hXG].

Aphthous ulcers result from a **complex interplay** of immune, genetic, environmental, nutritional, and systemic factors. No single cause explains all cases, and management should be individualized to identify and address modifiable triggers while providing symptomatic relief [^1129nbRU].

### Aphthous ulcers [^112Pi1FQ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Aphthous ulcers are one of the most common oral diseases worldwide. Their clinical presentation is characterized by multiple, recurrent, small, round, or ovoid ulcers with circumscribed margins and erythematous haloes present in different sizes. Oral lesions similar to aphthous ulcers may be present in several systemic diseases. This article will summarize the differential diagnosis of aphthous ulceration, with emphasis on a practical guide for the management of recurrent aphthous ulceration, including topical and systemic therapy.

### Guidelines for diagnosis and management of aphthous stomatitis [^1129nbRU]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Aphthous ulcers are the most common oral mucosal lesions in the general population. These often are recurrent and periodic lesions that cause clinically significant morbidity. Many suggestions have been proposed but the etiology of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is unknown. Several precipitating factors for aphthous ulcers appear to operate in subjects with genetic predisposition. An autoimmune or hypersensitivity mechanism is widely considered possible. Sometimes aphthous ulcers can be the sign of systemic diseases, so it is essential to establish a correct diagnosis to determine suitable therapy. Before initiating medications for aphthous lesions, clinicians should determine whether well-recognized causes are contributing to the disease and these factors should be corrected. Various treatment modalities are used, but no therapy is definitive. Topical medications, such as antimicrobial mouth-washes and topical corticosteroids (dexamethasone, triamcinolone, fluocinonide, or clobetasol), can achieve the primary goal to reduce pain and to improve healing time but do not improve recurrence or remission rates. Systemic medications can be tried if topical therapy is ineffective.

### Comprehensive management of major aphthous ulcer [^113gqHCN]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Recurrent aphthous ulcers are the most prevalent oral mucosal disease, but the subset major aphthous ulcer is a less frequent type. These ulcers are refractory, may persist for several weeks to months, and interfere with the normal state of health. The aetiology is multifactorial and so is the treatment. We present a case of an adolescent male patient reported with multiple oral ulcers. He developed three ulcers simultaneously and suffered for 10 months despite using topical medications prescribed by different dental practitioners. We executed a multidisciplinary treatment approach that resulted in a long-term disease-free state. The treatment methods followed in our case could be a successful model to implement by medical practitioners and oral physicians when the situation demands.

### Aphthous ulcers: a difficult clinical entity [^115ZbKvT]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2000). Low credibility.

Recurrent aphthous ulcers (RAU) are the most common oral ulcerative disease, affecting 10% to 20% of the population. There are 3 clinical subtypes-minor, major, and herpetiform. Minor aphthous ulcers are the most common subtype, representing 80% to 90% of all recurrent aphthous ulcers. Clinically, RAU present as extremely painful, shallow ulcerations with an erythematous halo on unattached oral mucosa. The primary differential diagnosis is oral herpes simplex. The etiology of RAU is unknown. Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy.

### Complex aphthosis and Behçet's disease [^114u5tww]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Complex aphthosis is a disorder in which patients develop recurrent oral and genital aphthous ulcers or almost constant, multiple oral aphthae, without manifestations of systemic disease. Behçet's disease is a multisystem disease characterized clinically by oral and genital aphthae, arthritis, cutaneous lesions, and ocular, gastrointestinal, and neurologic manifestations. This article reviews both disorders, including their clinical and histologic presentations, factors in pathogenesis, and includes an overview of therapeutic modalities.

### Role of drug exposure in aphthous ulcers: a case-control study [^116oR26A]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Drug-induced aphthous ulcers have been the subject of several isolated and heterogeneous case reports for the last three decades.

Objectives

To perform a case-control study to evaluate the risks linked to drug exposure in aphthous ulcers.

Methods

Eighty patients with typical clinical patterns of aphthous ulcers and 152 control patients who had had consultations for skin tumours were studied. A standardized questionnaire, concerning clinical features, life-style and medications taken during the last month, was completed for each patient.

Results

Case patients had a much higher intake of medications than control patients, respectively, 5.1 and 2. 8 medications per patient (P < 0.0001). Multivariate paired analysis showed an association between aphthous ulcers and two classes of drugs: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (P < 0.001) and beta-blockers (P = 0.002). Smoking could have a protective effect against aphthous ulcers (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Previous case reports and the results of this study suggest a real link between beta-blockers and aphthous ulcers. Our study did not confirm a role of other drugs but a few interesting case reports with positive reintroduction have to be considered. These results could be beneficial for patients, as healing may occur when the incriminated drug is discontinued.

### Behçet disease: new aspects [^115aqgq2]. Clinics in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Behçet disease is currently considered an "autoinflammatory disease" triggered by infection and environmental factors in genetically predisposed individuals. Although the disease is characterized by recurrent oral and genital aphthous ulcers and ocular involvement, it can affect multiple organ systems. Complex aphthosis is characterized by recurrent oral and/or genital aphthous ulcers. It is important to evaluate the patient with complex aphthosis for Behçet disease and related systemic disorders. We discuss the etiopathogenesis, clinical features, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches for complex aphthosis and Behçet disease in light of the current literature.

### Palatal ulceration [^111WgaAV]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Palatal ulcers are a common presentation and can be conveniently divided into developmental and acquired causes, the latter of which is subdivided into acute and chronic causes. Most commonly seen dermatologic causes have associated skin manifestations. Acute and multiple ulcers are usually infectious or drug induced in origin. Recurrent ulcers are largely dominated by aphthosis, while chronic ulcers are seen in immunocompromised patients and can occasionally be malignant. It is essential to involve the oral and maxillofacial surgeons early in the therapeutic management to tackle the inevitable complications that may ensue in the chronic cases.

### Acute oral ulcers [^116BNiLi]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

In general, a detailed history and examination of the patient provides sufficient information for diagnosis. The pattern, frequency, and natural history of ulcer episodes are helpful. The presence or absence of associated features and the site of oral involvement guides most physicians accurately in the diagnosis. Additional investigations, including blood tests, and occasionally the use of oral cultures or biopsy, are needed to make a definitive diagnosis. A multispecialty approach is often necessary to evaluate patients with other systemic features. Most acute oral ulcers heal spontaneously without specific therapy being necessary, but an understanding of the cause of the ulcer is reassuring to the patient and guides the clinician in management to prevent recurrent episodes of oral ulceration, or chronicity of ulcers.

### Recurrent aphthous stomatitis [^1151sL4a]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is the most common acute oral ulcerative condition in North America. RAS is divided into a mild, common form, simple aphthosis, and a severe, less common form, complex aphthosis. Aphthosis is a reactive condition. The lesions of RAS can represent the mucosal manifestation of a variety of conditions. These include conditions with oral and genital aphthae such as ulcus vulvae acutum, reactive nonsexually related acute genital ulcers, and Behçet disease. The mouth is the beginning of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and the lesions of RAS can be a manifestation of GI diseases such as gluten-sensitive enteropathy, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn disease. Complex aphthosis may also have correctable causes. The clinician should seek these in a careful evaluation. Successful management of both simple and complex aphthosis depends on accurate diagnosis, proper classification, recognition of provocative factors, and the identification of associated diseases. The outlook for patients with both simple and complex aphthosis is positive.

### Genome wide analysis for mouth ulcers identifies associations at immune regulatory loci [^117CeV8c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Mouth ulcers are the most common ulcerative condition and encompass several clinical diagnoses, including recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS). Despite previous evidence for heritability, it is not clear which specific genetic loci are implicated in RAS. In this genome-wide association study (n = 461,106) heritability is estimated at 8.2% (95% CI: 6.4%, 9.9%). This study finds 97 variants which alter the odds of developing non-specific mouth ulcers and replicate these in an independent cohort (n = 355,744) (lead variant after meta-analysis: rs76830965, near IL12A, OR 0.72 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.73); P = 4.4e−483). Additional effect estimates from three independent cohorts with more specific phenotyping and specific study characteristics support many of these findings. In silico functional analyses provide evidence for a role of T cell regulation in the aetiology of mouth ulcers. These results provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of a common, important condition.

### How to recognise a Behçet's ulcer from other types of oral ulceration? Defining Behçet's ulceration by an international Delphi consultation [^114hcSvd]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To define the clinical characteristics of oral ulceration (OU) in Behçet's disease (BD), to allow differentiation from other causes of OU, including aphthous ulcers, by an International Delphi consultation. To develop a clinical guideline on how to recognise BD ulcers.

Methods

Round 1. 40 clinical images of OU in BD, recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) were shown. Participants answered, independently, which images would be consistent with a BD ulcer. Round 2. The results from marking independently were shown. The panel remarked the questions through iteration process. The images not agreed to be a possible BD ulcer were discarded. Round 3. 10 clinical descriptors that may define BD ulcers were suggested. Participants ranked the level of importance for each descriptor on each image presented. Round 4. Participants re-ranked their level of agreement for each descriptor through iteration process. Whether the clinical pictures would be different from RAS was also explored. A final agreement was reached.

Results

This study has shown clear differentiation between BD, IBD and MMP ulcers when defining them by phenotype through clinical images only. On the other hand, no differentiation between RAS and BD ulcers was found. The most important clinical descriptors that define BD ulcers have been agreed.

Conclusions

New clinical guidance for Health Care Professionals (HCP) on how to recognise a BD ulcer has been proposed. This should elucidate an earlier diagnosis, quicker access to treatment and control of the disease enhancing patient's quality of life.

Observation

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common cause of recurrent oral ulcers, which often leads to significant impairment of a patient's quality of life. The underlying pathogenic mechanism remains unclear, and no treatment modality is uniformly effective. In this report, we describe the use of apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor in treatment of recalcitrant RAS.

### Oral ulcers: clinical aspects. A tool for dermatologists. part I. acute ulcers [^111xS3o2]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Oral ulcers are generally painful lesions that are related to various conditions developing within the oral cavity. They can be classified as acute or chronic according to their presentation and progression. Acute oral ulcers are be associated with conditions such as trauma, recurrent aphthous stomatitis, Behçet's disease, bacterial and viral infections, allergic reactions or adverse drug reactions. Chronic oral ulcers are associated with conditions such as oral lichen planus, pemphigus vulgaris, mucosal pemphigoid, lupus erythematosus, mycosis and some bacterial and parasitic diseases. The correct differential diagnosis is necessary to establish the appropriate treatment, taking into account all the possible causes of ulcers in the oral cavity. In the first part of this two-part review, acute oral ulcers are reviewed.

### Vulvar aphthous ulcer after COVID-19 vaccination [^116kdTcp]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Vulvar aphthous ulcer, also known as acute genital ulceration or Lipschutz ulcers, is an uncommon, non-sexually acquired condition characterized by sudden onset ulcerations of the vulva in young girls and women. It is thought to represent an immunologic reaction to an infection or other source of inflammation and is commonly preceded by prodromal symptoms including fever, chills, fatigue, and malaise. During the COVID-19 pandemic, vulvar aphthous ulcer associated with COVID-19 infection has been reported. Here, we report a case of vulvar aphthous ulcer in response to COVID-19 vaccination.

### Genome wide analysis for mouth ulcers identifies associations at immune regulatory loci [^117W79cM]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Oral ulceration is the most common ulcerative condition in humans, affecting up to 25% of young adultsand a higher proportion of children. Depending on context, ulcers in the mouth are described as mouth ulcers or canker sores, both of which are descriptive terms rather than clinical diagnoses. In this article, mouth ulcers is used as an umbrella term describing the spectrum of clinical presentation.

To date, many causes of mouth ulcers are recognised including mucosal trauma and a range of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. For example, mouth ulcers are common in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and are considered a diagnostic feature of Behçet's disease, an inflammatory disorder of blood vessels that causes ulceration of the mouth, eyes and genitals.

Many people experience recurrent mouth ulcers which cannot be attributed to systemic disease or obvious oral trauma. Here, the clinical diagnosis of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is used, referring to a group of closely related conditions of uncertain aetiology, whose defining feature is the presence of clinically characteristic oral ulcers, which are painful and associated with impaired quality of life –. First line management strategies for RAS reduce the severity of ulceration without preventing recurrence. Second line management strategies involve topical or systemic use of potent and non-specific immunomodulatory drugs including thalidomide and dapsone, exposing patients to a range of side effects. Thus, there is unmet need for a wider range of therapeutic options in the management of RAS.

### Oral ulcerations in an immunosuppressed pediatric patient [^111dMnD8]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the patient's most likely risk factor for developing this adverse event?
A. Introduction of foreign lymphocytes
B. Hormonal alteration
C. Latent viral infection
D. Nutritional deficiency
E. Steroid discontinuation

Answers:
A. Introduction of foreign lymphocytes – Incorrect. Oral cGVHD, which can be the initial or only manifestation of cGVHD, is characterized by lichenoid mucositis. Although the pathogenesis is incompletely understood, activated alloreactive T-cells and other immune mediators from transplanted tissue are thought to drive the disease process. cGVHD does not typically present as discrete, aphthous-like lesions.
B. Hormonal alteration – Incorrect. Hormonal changes were previously suggested as a cause of aphthous ulcers, but this theory has faded in popularity, lacking supporting evidence. Additionally, this patient is prepubertal.
C. Latent viral infection – Incorrect. Specimens of mIAS fail to demonstrate viral cytopathic changes, and patients do not typically respond to antivirals. As previously described, this patient did not have any of the specific features that typically characterize herpes simplex virus-associated oral ulcerations.
D. Nutritional deficiency – Incorrect. Nutritional deficiencies, such as inadequate iron or vitamins (B3, B9, B12, or C), may lead to oral ulcerations. This is a reasonable consideration in our patient with decreased oral intake; however, the onset of lesions preceded the decreased oral intake. Likewise, an association between nutritional deficiency and mIAS has not been reported.
E. Steroid discontinuation – Correct. The ulcers occurred shortly after discontinuation of systemic corticosteroid therapy, suggesting that corticosteroid effects were preventing the onset of stomatitis. Indeed, a randomized control trial of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease on sirolimus therapy reported decreased risk of mIAS with concomitant corticosteroid use.

### Cogan and behcet syndromes [^113ST42V]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Cogan and Behcet syndromes are considered large vessel vasculitides. Both are rare diseases, with varied clinical manifestations affecting multiple organ systems. Although both have hallmark symptoms (ocular and vestibuloauditory inflammation in Cogan syndrome and aphthous ulcers in Behcet syndrome), neither has confirmatory diagnostic testing. Delayed diagnosis can result in poor outcomes. In both syndromes, large vessel arterial inflammation may result in severe morbidity and mortality. Treatment strategies in both syndromes vary based on organ system involvement and severity of manifestations. In this article, the epidemiology, proposed pathogenesis, manifestations, and the most current treatment paradigms for these syndromes are reviewed.

In a meta-analysis of 26 population-based cohort and cross-sectional studies, the global prevalence of dry mouth symptoms was 23% (95% CI, 18% to 28%), placing individuals at risk of oral candidiasis, dental caries, dysgeusia, masticatory/speech impairment, and oropharyngeal dysphagia. Dry mouth is associated with using more than 3 oral medications per day (odds ratio [OR], 2.9 [95% CI, 1.4 to 6.2]), head and neck radiation, and Sjögren disease. Symptoms may include difficulty swallowing and speaking, thirst, and halitosis. Dry mouth is associated with an 11.5% (95% CI, 3.6% to 27%) higher risk of oral candidiasis, based on a meta-analysis of 6 observational cohorts. Management of dry mouth includes mechanical salivary stimulants, oral moisturizers, and/or systemic sialagogues. Oral candidiasis is an opportunistic fungal infection caused by overgrowth of the Candida genus with C albicans, which accounts for 76.8% of infections. The prevalence of oral candidiasis is higher in patients who are immunosuppressed, for example, those with HIV (35% [95% CI, 28% to 42%]) and those with salivary gland hypofunction (OR, 3.02 [95% CI, 1.73 to 5.28]). Common risk factors associated with oral candidiasis include use of antibiotics (P = 0.04) and oral mucosal disorders such as lichen planus. Oral burning and dysgeusia are common symptoms of oral candidiasis. Treatment includes addressing risk factors and use of topical and/or systemic antifungal medications. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis is characterized by symptomatic round or oval oral ulcers, which are covered by a gray-white fibrin layer and encircled by an erythematous ring. A meta-analysis of 10 case-controlled studies revealed an increased risk of recurrent aphthous stomatitis associated with polymorphism of IL-1β (+3954C/T) (OR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.07 to 2.17]) and IL-1β (-511C/T) (OR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.09 to 1.67]). Another meta-analysis of 9 case-control studies reported that patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis had a higher frequency of nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin B12 (OR, 3.75 [95% CI, 2.38 to 5.94]), folic acid (OR, 7.55 [95% CI, 3.91 to 14.60]), and ferritin (OR, 2.62 [95% CI, 1.69 to 4.06]). Recurrent aphthous stomatitis can be associated with systemic diseases. A meta-analysis of 21 case-control studies revealed that celiac disease is associated with a higher incidence of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (25% vs 11%; OR, 3.79 [95% CI, 2.67 to 5.39]; P < .001). Topical corticosteroids are first-line agents to manage recurrent aphthous stomatitis; however, systemic medications may be necessary in more severe cases.

Conclusions and Relevance

Dry mouth, oral candidiasis, and recurrent aphthous ulcers are common oral conditions that may be associated with patient discomfort, decreased quality of life, and morbidity. First-line treatment includes over-the-counter sialagogues for dry mouth, topical antifungals for oral candidiasis, and topical corticosteroids for aphthous ulcers. Oral conditions that do not improve with first-line treatment may require treatment with systemic medications.

### Acyclovir in the prevention of severe aphthous ulcers… [^113bfFsp]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — Recurrent aphthous ulceration is characterized by recurring ulcers of the nonkeratinized oral mucosa. The cause of RAU has not been determined, but preliminary data have indicated that the ulcers may be caused by reactivation of locally latent varicella zoster virus. 1 As acyclovir is the most effective drug therapy against VZV, an open trial was undertaken to evaluate the preventive effect of systemic acyclovir on the recurrence of RAU in severely affected patients. Report of Cases. — Eight otherwise healthy patients suffering from almost constant RAU consented to participation in the study. Blood screening revealed no deficiencies, and acyclovir tablets were prescribed for 10 weeks. Six patients benefited from therapy within 2 days, with either total regression of existing ulcers or striking relief of symptoms. Throughout the remainder of the study, ulcers did not develop in two patients;. Pedersen A.

### Silver nitrate cautery in aphthous stomatitis: a randomized controlled trial [^1148NLR4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Aphthous stomatitis is a painful, recurrent disease of the oral mucous membrane. Silver nitrate sticks have been used for a long time to provide pain relief for the duration of an aphthous ulceration, with only one application. Silver nitrate causes chemical cauterization and increases the depth of injury.

Objectives

To study the effect of chemical cautery with silver nitrate in reducing pain of aphthous ulceration and to determine if this treatment shortens or prolongs healing.

Methods

In a randomized, patient-blinded, placebo-controlled study, 97 patients with painful minor oral aphthous ulceration were randomized to receive silver nitrate cautery or placebo. The severity of pain was rated on a three-category scale (severe, mild, none) and was recorded each day until the seventh day after the procedure. The lesion size was recorded at the time of the procedure and on the seventh day afterwards. In the treatment group, the ulcer was gently painted with a silver nitrate stick until it turned white. In the placebo group, the ulcer was gently painted with a placebo stick.

Results

In the treatment group, 33 of 47 patients (70%) evaluated and in the placebo group, four of 38 patients (11%) evaluated had reduction in severity of pain 1 day after the procedure. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). On the seventh day after the procedure, the ulcers were completely re-epithelialized in 39 patients (83%) in the treatment group and in 34 patients (89%) in the placebo group. The difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.39).

Conclusions

The results of our study showed that one application of silver nitrate can decrease the severity of pain in aphthous ulceration without significantly shortening or prolonging healing time. We did not observe any side-effects in our study. The effect is rapid and lasts for the duration of the lesion. The treatment is simple and cost-effective in patients with infrequent recurrences.

### Interventions for the management of oral ulcers in Behçet's disease [^112Z6egr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Behçet's disease is a chronic inflammatory vasculitis that can affect multiple systems. Mucocutaneous involvement is common, as is the involvement of many other systems such as the central nervous system and skin. Behç̧et's disease can cause significant morbidity, such as loss of sight, and can be life threatening. The frequency of oral ulceration in Behçet's disease is thought to be 97% to 100%. The presence of mouth ulcers can cause difficulties in eating, drinking, and speaking leading to a reduction in quality of life. There is no cure for Behçet's disease and therefore treatment of the oral ulcers that are associated with Behçet's disease is palliative.

Objectives

To determine the clinical effectiveness and safety of interventions on the pain, episode duration, and episode frequency of oral ulcers and on quality of life for patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS)-type ulceration associated with Behçet's disease.

Search Methods

We undertook electronic searches of the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 4 October 2013); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9); MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 4 October 2013); EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 4 October 2013); CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 4 October 2013); and AMED via Ovid (1985 to 4 October 2013). We searched the US National Institutes of Health trials register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. There were no restrictions on language or date of publication in the searches of the electronic databases. We contacted authors when necessary to obtain additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that looked at pre-specified oral outcome measures to assess the efficacy of interventions for mouth ulcers in Behçet's disease. The oral outcome measures included pain, episode duration, episode frequency, safety, and quality of life. Trials were not restricted by outcomes alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

All studies meeting the inclusion criteria underwent data extraction and an assessment of risk of bias, independently by two review authors and using a pre-standardised data extraction form. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

A total of 15 trials (n = 888 randomised participants) were included, 13 were placebo controlled and three were head to head (two trials had more than two treatment arms). Eleven of the trials were conducted in Turkey, two in Japan, one in Iran and one in the UK. Most trials used the International Study Group criteria for Behçet's disease. Eleven different interventions were assessed. The interventions were grouped into two categories, topical and systemic. Only one study was assessed as being at low risk of bias. It was not possible to carry out a meta-analysis. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low and there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any included intervention with regard to pain, episode duration, or episode frequency associated with oral ulcers, or safety of the interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to the heterogeneity of trials including trial design, choice of intervention, choice and timing of outcome measures, it was not possible to carry out a meta-analysis. Several interventions show promise and future trials should be planned and reported according to the CONSORT guidelines. Whilst the primary aim of many trials for Behç̧et's disease is not necessarily reduction of oral ulceration, reporting of oral ulcers in these studies should be standardised and pre-specified in the methodology. The use of a core outcome set for oral ulcer trials would be beneficial.

### Vulvar aphthous ulcer in an adolescent with COVID-19 [^114V75U1]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Vulvar aphthous ulcers have been associated with various prodromal viral illnesses. We describe the case of an adolescent girl who developed vulvar aphthous ulcers during infection with Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.

Case

A 19-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with cough, sore throat, fevers, and rash, and tested positive for COVID-19. She re-presented 2 days later with vulvar pain and was found to have a vulvar aphthous ulcer. She was admitted for pain control and treated with oral steroids. Improvement in her vulvar pain was noted, along with resolution of fevers, cough, and rash.

Summary and Conclusion

This case illustrates the novel association of COVID-19 with vulvar aphthous ulcers in adolescents. Use of oral steroids for symptomatic management of COVID-19 led to rapid clinical improvement.

### Vulvar aphthous ulcer following pfizer-bioNTech COVID-19 vaccine – A case report [^111D8Dyr]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In this case report, we describe a potential association between the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and development of a vulvar aphthous ulcer in a virginal 14-year-old girl.

Case

A 14-year-old patient reported vulvar pain and visible lesion. Exam findings were consistent with vulvar aphthous ulcers. Two days prior to the onset of her symptoms she received her second Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The evening of vaccine administration, she experienced several hours duration of fatigue, muscle aching and insomnia but had otherwise been recently healthy and testing for common viral associations of vulvar ulcers was negative.

Summary and Conclusion

Vaccination, in general, has been associated with mucosal side-effects and oral ulceration has been reported in subjects who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. It is reasonable to hypothesize that vulvar ulceration may be caused by a similar mechanism and should be considered a rare side effect of this vaccine.

### Genetic and immunologic findings in children with recurrent aphthous stomatitis with systemic inflammation [^116aCwYS]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) in children is usually a benign idiopathic disorder requiring only supportive care. However, in some cases RAS may be a presenting sign of a systemic disorder.

Patients may seek the attention of a rheumatologist because of early onset of complaints in infancy, high frequency of episodes, severity of oral ulcers, or due to the presence of a systemic inflammatory involvement, as revealed by laboratory examinations of by inflammatory symptoms involving other organs (such as genital ulcers, vasculitis, hepatitis, skin rashes and abscesses). As discussed further, these patients should undergo a clinical whole exome sequencing targeted to immune dysregulation genes.

The most common diagnosis in children with RAS and systemic inflammation is probably PFAPA syndrome. However, RAS is rarely a serious issue in patients with PFAPA, where mouth ulcers are small, shallow, scattered or solitary, seemingly not painful; and frequently only are noted in episodes subsequent to the query; in contrast with other autoinflammatory syndrome where RAS is usually symptomatic and associated with systemic symptoms. In PFAPA genital ulcers are exceptionally reported, and the prognosis is usually good with prompt response to on demand glucocorticoids and complete healing with growth or after tonsillectomy. Relapsing after tonsillectomy is a rare event, which may raise the suspicion of distinct disorders, such as Hereditary Periodic Fever syndromes, or which may forecast a progression toward BD, as suggested by retrospective interviews performed in adulthood. For this reason, we excluded subjects with PFAPA from our study, but included patients with a PFAPA-like onset whose disease progressed after tonsillectomy. Apart from PFAPA, the most common cause of RAS and inflammation is BD. In these cases, oral and genital ulcerations are often a serious complaint. The positive pathergy test can help in the BD diagnosis, but it is not considered a criterion because in some populations, as in our series, can be infrequent. However, BD is quite rare in pediatrics and the onset of the disease in younger children should raise the suspicion of an underlying genetic disorder. In agreement, a recent study in a pediatric series of BD showed that a high proportion of patients carried pathogenic mutations in genes associated with monogenic autoinflammatory disorders. In our series, all cases carrying a pathogenic mutation in the analyzed genes had a disease onset before the age of 6 years, with an average age at onset of 3 years, which is very young and below the mean age of onset for BD (7 years) or SLE (11 years). Indeed, early onset may identify a subset of disease with severe phenotype which is likely to be enriched for genetic variants.

### Refractory aphthous ulceration treated with thalidomide: a report of 10 years' clinical experience [^114CuhMg]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Thalidomide has reported efficacy in treating refractory idiopathic aphthous ulceration and aphthous ulceration in Behçet disease (BD). However, because of its potential teratogenicity and neurotoxicity, thalidomide must be used and monitored carefully. We report our experience of using thalidomide over the past 10 years in patients referred within our region with severe refractory aphthous ulceration, and their response to treatment and side-effects. In our experience, thalidomide works well for severe refractory aphthous ulceration, with a typical patient response reported within 4 weeks, but its use is limited by neurotoxicity. The aphthous ulceration occurring in the context of BD was more difficult to control than idiopathic aphthous ulceration.

### Vulvar aphthous ulcer in an adolescent after pfizer-bioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccination [^111CcLp3]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Vulvar aphthous ulcers are a rare type of genital lesion most common in non-sexually active adolescents. Vulvar aphthous ulcers are typically associated with viral infections. To date, there have been several cases reported in patients infected with COVID-19. Vulvar aphthous ulcers following vaccination have not been previously reported in the literature.

Case

We present the case of a 16-year-old adolescent who developed vulvar aphthous ulceration following Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccination.

Summary and Conclusion

Through an extensive literature search, we found no previous reports of vulvar aphthous ulcer following vaccination. Our case highlights a potential novel side effect of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination and a new etiology for vulvar aphthous ulcers. This case suggests that vulvar aphthous ulcers might be associated with COVID-19 vaccination through a yet undetermined mechanism that requires further investigation.

### Unusual causes of cutaneous ulceration [^113WVoSC]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Skin ulceration is a major source of morbidity and is often difficult to manage. Ulcers caused by an inflammatory cause or microvascular occlusion are particularly challenging in terms of diagnosis and treatment. The management of such ulcers requires careful assessment of associated systemic conditions and a thorough analysis of the ulcer's clinical and histologic findings. In this article, the authors discuss several examples of inflammatory ulcers and the approach to the diagnosis and treatment of these ulcers.

### The association between minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), children's poor oral condition, and underlying negative psychosocial habits and attitudes towards oral hygiene [^11288TgZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

In the presence of a direct association between RAS and decayed teeth in pediatric patients, the concomitant presence of recurrent aphthae must suggest particular care in evaluating the occurrence of carious lesions, and also the necessity of implementing protocols of prevention to control RAS disease in children affected by caries.

Given the documented association between the psychosocial behavioral indices of a positive general attitude towards oral hygiene and oral health, and given also the documented association between proper oral-health maintenance instructions received by parents and compromised dental status (DFMT), special attention should be paid also to those psychological indices, aspects, and predictors that are able to strengthen children's commitment towards proper hygiene and oral status, on the one hand, and oral health, on the other.

In comparing the results of the present study with those of similar studies and other relevant evidence, we may note that the etiology of RAS ulcers, in the research literature, is still not entirely clear and known. For instance, Sunday et al. conducted research on possible causes of RAS and concluded that the etiology of RAS lesions is still unknown as several local, systemic, immunologic, genetic, allergic, nutritional, and microbial factors have been proposed as causative agents. Also, some medications including immunosuppressive drugs such as calcineurin and mTOR inhibitors have been associated with severe aphthous-like stomatitis. They do not make a direct reference to the presence of cariogenic bacteria, but only to the variation of the saliva composition, of saliva, such as PH, which is certainly a factor that correlates with the presence of caries lesions in the active phase in the oral cavity.

### Clinical immunology review series: an approach to the patient with recurrent orogenital ulceration, including Behçet's syndrome [^113jL4qE]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with recurrent orogenital ulcers may have complex aphthosis, Behçet's disease, secondary complex aphthosis (e.g. Reiter's syndrome, Crohn's disease, cyclical neutropenia) or non-aphthous disease (including bullous disorders, erythema multiforme, erosive lichen planus). Behçet's syndrome is a multi-system vasculitis of unknown aetiology for which there is no diagnostic test. Diagnosis is based on agreed clinical criteria that require recurrent oral ulcers and two of the following: recurrent genital ulcers, ocular inflammation, defined skin lesions and pathergy. The condition can present with a variety of symptoms, hence a high index of suspicion is necessary. The most common presentation is with recurrent mouth ulcers, often with genital ulcers; however, it may take some years before diagnostic criteria are met. All patients with idiopathic orogenital ulcers should be kept under review, with periodic focused assessment to detect evolution into Behçet's disease. There is often a delay of several years between patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria and a diagnosis being made, which may contribute to the morbidity of this condition. Despite considerable research effort, the aetiology and pathogenesis of this condition remains enigmatic.

### Severe recurrent aphthous stomatitis treated with adalimumab: a case report in a teenage patient [^113ZJZwh]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a chronic disorder of unknown etiology characterized by recurring ulcers involving the oral mucosa in patients with no other manifestations. It is a common cause of oral ulcers in children. In its major form, RAS can be a severe and disabling disorder due to pain and scarring, and poses a therapeutic challenge. Therapies for major RAS include prednisone, thalidomide, colchicine, and dapsone. However, many patients do not achieve adequate control of the disease with them (J Clin Diagn Res, 10, 2016 and ZE08). We report a case of severe RAS in a teenager with a dramatic response to adalimumab.

### Genetic and immunologic findings in children with recurrent aphthous stomatitis with systemic inflammation [^114vW1nY]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common and usually isolated and benign complaint in children. However, some cases of RAS present in association with other clinical symptoms or with signs of systemic inflammation, raising a diagnostic challenge to pediatricians. The most common form of RAS with systemic inflammation in pediatrics can be encountered in periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome (PFAPA). The typical periodic recurrence of fever bouts with complete well-being between episodes, and with the absence of significant intestinal or musculoskeletal symptoms, makes PFAPA syndrome an easy diagnosis. Although oral ulcers may present along with PFAPA crises, they are usually small-sized and rapidly self-recovering, never being the patient's major complaint. Aphthous stomatitis accompanying recurrent fevers may also be part of rare syndromes like mevalonate kinase deficiency and Behçet's disease (BD). In these cases, aphthosis is often severe with multiple painful ulcerations and with slow recovery. RAS associated with raised acute phase reactants can also occur without a clinical story of recurrent fever and in these cases, it should raise the suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or of a rheumatologic condition such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and BD. However, RAS with systemic inflammation can also be a sign of an immunodeficiency, like HIV infection, neutropenia and monogenic mimics of BD. In a recent study, a significant proportion of children with atypical BD was found to have pathogenic mutations in genes associated with monogenic autoinflammatory disorders. Similarly, monogenic disorders can be diagnosed in children who meet the classification criteria for SLE and present recurrent oral ulceration. Some of these disorders are associated with dysregulated interferon (IFN)-driven inflammation, which can be revealed by the transcriptomic screening of the IFN signature. Of note, an increased IFN signature may be found both in SLE and in BD, supporting that rare monogenic conditions with IFN-mediated inflammation may present in an area of clinical and pathological overlap between the two conditions.

The diagnostic challenge is even harder if we consider that some patients with SLE may also meet the classification criteria for pediatric BD.

Thus, we decided to investigate if a diagnostic protocol based on immunologic, transcriptomic and next generation sequencing analysis can contribute to improve the classification of subjects with recurrent oral ulcers and systemic inflammation, with possible benefits on the care of the patient in terms of meaningful therapeutic choices and complication surveillance.

### The association between minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), children's poor oral condition, and underlying negative psychosocial habits and attitudes towards oral hygiene [^1148ZadS]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Minor Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis (minor RAS) represents a disease which is very difficult to prevent. It is a painful oral mucosal condition characterized by recurrent, multiple, small, round ulcers, surrounded by erythematous haloes, with a necrotic base.

A minor RAS episode is characterized by a group of 2–5 ulcers with a size of less than 1 cm in diameter. In a period of about 4–14 days the lesions disappear, and there aren't scars.

The scientific literature does not clarify the etiology of minor RAS, but it seems to be related to multifactorial causes, such as allergy, trauma, genetic predisposition, endocrine disorders, stress and anxiety, and microbiota in the mouth. Minor RAS episodes are often treated with drugs, topical and systemic, that are considered palliative. This treatment is mainly aimed to decrease inflammation and pain.

With respect to the psychosocial side of the issue, there is mounting empirical evidence showing that studies and considerations about oral health status, origins and consequences cannot be limited — any longer — only to clinical issues. Both actual and perceived oral health conditions do in fact heavily affect young patients' quality of life, especially in the form of social acceptance by peers. Outcomes of this kind become especially significant when one considers that research has repeatedly shown that parents tend to underestimate the influence of poor oral conditions on their children's emotional and social quality of life. This happens while oral health and dento-facial appearance actually play, instead, a pivotal role in contributing to children's self-esteem and proper social functioning — a finding established long time ago in social psychology and clearly relating to social acceptance, also known as the 'what is beautiful is good' stereotype. Children's self-confidence and smooth social functioning depend heavily on healthy (facial) appearance. Monitoring children's behavioral attitudes, habits and practices of (home) oral hygiene becomes, thus, of paramount importance, especially because young patients' attitudes, habits and (good/bad) practices of oral hygiene may all critically affect their actual oral status and, in turn, prompt or hinder the manifestation of precarious oral conditions, such as — for instance — those leading to unwanted episodes of minor RAS.

### Aphthous ulcers associated with imiquimod and the treatment of actinic cheilitis [^111wvYQG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Our case series report is the first documented depiction of the appearance of aphthous ulcers secondary to imiquimod application. This case series presentation discusses the underlying pathophysiology of aphthous ulcer development and imiquimod therapy in terms of the stimulation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). The literature review suggests more than just a mere coincidence for the development of aphthous ulcers subsequent to the treatment of actinic cheilitis with imiquimod application.

### Effectiveness of vitamin B12 in treating recurrent aphthous stomatitis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114tgP4H]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The frequency of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), the most common oral mucosa lesions seen in primary care, is up to 25% in the general population. However, there has been no optimal therapeutic approach. Our objective was to confirm our previous clinical observation of the beneficial treatment of RAS with vitamin B(12).

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was done using primary care patients. A sublingual a dose of 1000 mcg of vitamin B(12) was used in patients in the intervention group for 6 months.

Results

In total, 58 patients suffering from RAS participated in the study: 31 were included in the intervention group and 27 were included in control group. All parameters of RAS among patients in the intervention group were recorded and compared with the control group. The duration of outbreaks, the number of ulcers, and the level of pain were reduced significantly (P < .05) at 5 and 6 months of treatment with vitamin B(12), regardless of initial vitamin B(12) levels in the blood. During the last month of treatment a significant number of participants in the intervention group reached "no aphthous ulcers status" (74.1% vs 32.0%; P < .01).

Conclusion

Vitamin B(12) treatment, which is simple, inexpensive, and low-risk, seems to be effective for patients suffering from RAS, regardless of the serum vitamin B(12) level.

### Recurrent aphthous stomatitis… [^112gPCMA]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis Recurrent aphthous stomatitis, or "canker sores, " is an oral ulcerative condition with a prevalence ranging from 5 to 21 percent. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis is characterized by recurring, painful, solitary or multiple ulcers, typically covered by a white-to-yellow pseudomembrane and surrounded by an erythematous halo. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis usually involves nonkeratinizing mucosa. There are three clinical forms: minor, major, and herpetiform. The minor form is the most common and appears as rounded, well-demarcated, single or multiple ulcers less than 1 cm in diameter that usually heal in 10 to 14 days without scarring. 36, 37 Chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash decreases the severity of an episode but does not reduce the incidence of ulcers. 15 Amlexanox 5% paste may promote healing and lessen pain.

16 In severe or constantly recurring cases, systemic therapy with agents such as thalidomide may be necessary. Because of the risk of serious adverse effects and its off-label status, thalidomide generally is reserved for severe cases such as those associated with HIV infection.
17. The condition typically waxes and wanes, and the lesions demonstrate a migrating pattern. Some patients may complain of pain or burning, especially when eating spicy foods. However, most individuals are asymptomatic and do not require treatment for this benign condition. For symptomatic cases, several treatments have been proposed, including topical steroids, zinc supplements, and topical anesthetic rinses. None of these treatments has been proven to be uniformly effective.
18. **Two major clinical forms of oral lichen planus exist**: reticular and erosive.

The reticular form can appear as bilateral asymptomatic, white, lacy striations or papules on the posterior buccal mucosa. The erosive form manifests as zones of tender erythema and painful ulcers surrounded by peripheral white, radiating striae. It may also manifest as generalized erythema and ulceration of the gingiva, known as desquamative gingivitis.

### MASCC / ISOO expert opinion on the management of oral problems in patients with advanced cancer [^112Y51PW]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Oral discomfort/pain

Aetiology

There are several potential causes of new onset oral discomfort/pain in patients with advanced cancer, including salivary gland hypofunction, mucosal conditions (i.e. infection/inflammation/ulceration), dental-related problems, denture-related problems, neurological conditions and pain referred from adjacent structures.

Management

Management should include treatment of the underlying cause (if possible), e.g. relining, adjusting, or replacing poorly fitting dentures (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V). Symptomatic management primarily involves pharmacological interventions, which may include both topical agents and systemic analgesics. The optimal analgesic regimen depends on the aetiology of the pain (cancer-related, coexisting condition), the pathophysiology of the pain (nociceptive, neuropathic) and a variety of patient-related factors (e.g. co-morbidities, personal preference) (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V).

Bland rinses (e.g. normal saline) can often provide some relief for patients with oral ulceration, including patients with oral mucositis. Similarly, "coating" agents can provide some relief for patients with oral ulceration, particularly in patients with pain on eating/drinking ("contact"/incident pain). However, many patients with oral ulceration have associated inflammation, and so merely covering the ulcer(s) does not relieve the discomfort. Topical analgesics can be highly effective in some cases, and options include benzydamine hydrochloride solution/spray (anti-inflammatory), oral morphine solution (opioid) and doxepin solution (antidepressant). Topical analgesics are less likely to cause systemic adverse effects, and so are often considered as first line treatments. Local anaesthetics have a limited role, and care must be taken to prevent inadvertent aspiration. Equally, topical steroids have a limited role (e.g. recurrent aphthous stomatitis), and care must be taken to exclude oral problems that might worsen with steroids (e.g. oral infections).

Systemic analgesics can also be effective, but there are limited reasons for chronic administration (due to concerns about adverse effects).

Interventional techniques are another option in highly select cohorts of patients (e.g. patients with intraoral tumours).

### Aphthous ulcer of the vocal cord leading to hoarseness [^111U7gw8]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Acute or chronic laryngitis, laryngeal trauma, vocal cord paralysis, cysts of the vocal cord, and benign or malignant tumors of the vocal folds are frequent causes of hoarseness. It is important to identify the cause of hoarseness to rule out potential malignancies. In this case report, we describe a patient with a bilateral aphthous ulcer in the vocal cords who was admitted with hoarseness and had been previously diagnosed with Behcet disease. Behcet disease is characterized by mucosal aphthous lesions, which are found primarily in oral and genital regions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a patient with bilateral aphthous ulcer in the vocal cords.

### Looking in the mouth for Crohn's disease [^113Cyajn]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

It is widely acknowledged among gastroenterologists that the oral cavity may be involved in Crohn's disease (CD). However, the specific manifestations are poorly appreciated. Although oral aphthous ulceration is probably not diagnostically useful in patients with suspected CD, disease-specific manifestations do occur and are particularly common in children presenting with CD. These manifestations can be subtle, often are subclinical, yet commonly harbor diagnostically useful material (granulomas). Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is conventionally used to describe patients with overt oral disease without obvious involvement of the gastrointestinal tract. However, many patients with OFG have subclinical intestinal CD or will progress to develop overt intestinal CD with time. The management of severe oral disease is challenging and lacks a clear evidence base.

### Behçet's disease presenting as recurrent oral aphthosis in a 9-year-old boy from Greece [^114Ft9ME]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

We report a case of Behçet's disease in a 9-year-old boy from Greece, presenting with a history of recurrent ulceration of the oral cavity. Following inspection of the oral cavity, which revealed lesions on both the upper and lower labial mucosa, as well as a large ulcer on the apex of the tongue, the diagnosis of Behçet's disease was immediately suspected. The diagnosis was confirmed using the International Criteria for Behçet's Disease. Nevertheless, as multiple diseases can cause recurrent oral aphthosis, an extensive differential diagnosis was made, and pertinent tests were undertaken to exclude other causes of oral ulceration. The approach to a patient with Behçet's disease, as well as its various clinical presentations and complications, is discussed.

### Recurrent aphthous stomatitis in childhood and adolescence: a single-center experience [^1117xGtQ]. Pediatric Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common oral ulcerative condition in children. The objective was to describe the clinical features of RAS in children with accompanying clinical and laboratory findings.

Methods

The study included 120 patients younger than 18 years of age (mean age 9.6 ± 4.3 years) with three or more oral aphthous ulcers per year between August 2008 and February 2014. Demographic characteristics of the patients, clinical features of the ulcers, and associated clinical and laboratory findings were evaluated.

Results

The mean number of aphthae per year was 12.8 ± 8.5 and the mean duration of the disease was 3.6 ± 2.9 years. Minor aphthae were the most common type (87%), papulopustules were the most common accompanying cutaneous lesions (13.3%), and family history of RAS was the most common associated factor (35.8%). Genital scarring (p = 0.04) and pathergy (p = 0.01) were significantly more common in the adolescent group. Pathergy was significantly related to genital scarring (p = 0.04) and Behçet's disease (p = 0.02). There was no association between the number of aphthae per year and the duration of the disease and hematologic and immunologic abnormalities.

Conclusion

Our study is consistent with previous reports in terms of clinical features of aphthous ulcers, related diseases, and family history of RAS, but no associated laboratory abnormalities were noted.

### Coeliac disease: oral ulcer prevalence, assessment of risk and association with gluten-free diet in children [^116KA5tF]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

Oral mucosal lesions may be markers of chronic gastrointestinal disorders, such as those causing malabsorption. Our objectives were to assess the prevalence of recurrent oral aphthous-like ulcers in coeliac disease patients living in the Mediterranean area, and to evaluate the impact of a gluten-free diet.

Methods

A test group of 269 patients (age range 3–17 years) with coeliac disease confirmed both serologically and histologically was compared with a control group of 575 otherwise clinically healthy subjects for the presence, or a positive history of aphthous-like ulcers. Coeliac disease patients with aphthous-like ulcers were re-evaluated 1-year after starting a gluten-free diet.

Results

Aphthous-like ulcers were found significantly more frequently in coeliac disease, in 22.7% (61/269) of patients with coeliac disease versus 7.1% (41/575) of controls (p = < 0.0001; chi-square = 41.687; odds ratio = 4.3123; 95% confidence interval = 2.7664:6.722). Most coeliac disease patients with aphthous-like ulcers and adhering strictly to gluten-free diet (71.7%; 33/46) reported significant improvement on gluten-free diet, with no or reduced episodes of aphthous-like ulcers (p = 0.0003; chi-square = 13.101; odds ratio = 24.67; 95% confidence interval = 2.63:231.441).

Conclusions

The epidemiological association found between coeliac disease and aphthous-like ulcers suggests that recurrent aphthous-like ulcers should be considered a risk indicator for coeliac disease, and that gluten-free diet leads to ulcer amelioration.

### Herpetiform aphthous ulcerations induced by secukinumab: report of 2 cases [^1129z5vM]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the literature, the occurrence of non- Candida gingivostomatitis after IL-17 blockers is only anecdotally reported. Mouth ulcerations were seen in 2 patients in a phase-2 secukinumab trial, but no clinical details were provided. Further, a case of a patient with spondylarthrosis who had recurrent oral ulcers after secukinumab treatment developed inflammatory bowel disease 1 month after the start of secukinumab. After the second injection of secukinumab, this patient experienced periodic occurrence of endobuccal aphthoid lesions, appearing 2 to 3 days after each injection. Finally, a case of severe mucositis appearing 1 week after initiation of secukinumab was described in a 62-year-old man. In this case, secukinumab discontinuation resulted in substantial improvement. In our 2 cases, clinical course as well as extensive laboratory workup reasonably ruled out other inflammatory diseases potentially affecting the oral mucosa, such as lichen planus, autoimmune bullous diseases, or erythema multiforme.

Why oral aphthous ulcers developed after secukinumab used remains unclear. Secukinumab is associated with the development of mucocutaneous candidiasis, as the IL-17 pathway is crucial for antifungal defense. Yet, IL-17 blockers may also affect the oral microbiome in way that is not detectable by mycologic cultures and may thus favor the development of an inflammatory stomatitis.

Taken together, acute herpetiform aphthous ulcerations may represent a rare complication of secukinumab treatment. The clinical outcome is favorable after reduction or cessation of secukinumab. With increasing use of IL-17 blockers, clinicians should be familiar with this rare but striking and bothersome side effect.

### Extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease: current concepts, treatment, and implications for disease management [^112SzgHs]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are systemic diseases that manifest not only in the gut and gastrointestinal tract, but also in the extraintestinal organs in many patients. The quality of life for patients with IBD can be substantially affected by these extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs). It is important to have knowledge of the prevalence, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation of EIMs in order to adapt therapeutic options to cover all aspects of IBD. EIMs can occur in up to 24% of patients with IBD before the onset of intestinal symptoms, and need to be recognized to initiate appropriate diagnostic procedures. EIMs most frequently affect joints, skin, or eyes, but can also affect other organs, such as the liver, lung, and pancreas. It is a frequent misconception that a successful therapy of the intestinal inflammation will be sufficient to treat EIMs satisfactorily in most patients with IBD. In general, peripheral arthritis, oral aphthous ulcers, episcleritis, or erythema nodosum can be associated with active intestinal inflammation and can improve on standard treatment of the intestinal inflammation. However, anterior uveitis, ankylosing spondylitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis usually occur independent of disease flares. This review provides a comprehensive overview of epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and treatment of EIMs in IBD.

### Common oral lesions… [^114V8hXG]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Aphthous Stomatitis Recurrent aphthous stomatitis, or canker sores, is the most common ulcerative condition of the oral cavity 1–3. Prevalence in the general population has been reported at 20%, peaking between 10 and 20 years of age and decreasing after 50 years of age. 1–4 A positive family history is found in 40% of patients suggesting a genetic predilection. 2, 4 The etiology is unknown. 1, 4. 1, 4 Major aphthae represent 5% to 10% of cases and are characterized by painful ulcers larger than 1 cm that may persist up to six weeks and often leave mucosal scarring. Major aphthae can occur at any oral site and in the oropharynx. 1, 2, 4 Major aphthae are associated with HIV infection. The herpetiform type accounts for 5% to 10% of recurrent aphthous stomatitis; they occur in patches of up to 100 aphthae anywhere in the oral cavity, ranging in size from 0. 1 to
0. 3 cm. These heal within two weeks and appear similar to herpetic stomatitis. 1, 2.

Treatment goals include reducing lesion frequency, pain, and size. Application of topical corticosteroid gels or rinses is the primary therapy; however, quality studies lack support for any specific treatment. 2, 4 Systemic corticosteroids or intralesional triamcinolone may be used for more severe presentations. 1–3 Oral chlorhexidine rinse may decrease lesion severity and pain, but prolonged use stains the teeth. 3 Patients should avoid foods that trigger ulcers. Sodium lauryl sulfate may increase the irritation and pain from aphthous ulcers.

1. Blistering follows within 24 hours, becoming crusted, painful ulcerations that may bleed. 14, 17 Topical 5% acyclovir cream or topical penciclovir 1% cream applied every two hours at prodrome onset and used for five days decreases pain. 16 Over-the-counter 10% docosanol cream has a similar benefit.

Traumatic Fibroma Fibroma is the most common oral soft tissue growth, which is thought to occur secondary to local trauma or irritation.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Medium credibility.

Bowel preparation–associated mucosal injury and focal active colitis (FAC): FAC is described as a hallmark of some types of ASLC and as an aspect of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease, but colon-cleansing agents can create confounding lesions. Sodium phosphate preparations (and, to a lesser extent, magnesium citrate) may produce aphthous ulcers detected predominantly in the rectosigmoid against an otherwise unremarkable mucosal background, with a reported prevalence of 6% to 24%. Histologically, the correlate of an aphthous ulcer is either an erosion overlying a lymphoid aggregate or a focal, typically superficial, ischemic-type change; phosphate enema effect shows focal mucin depletion with a mild inflammatory infiltrate and hemorrhage limited to the superficial mucosa and no significant crypt inflammation.

### Oral lesions in autoimmune bullous diseases: an overview of clinical characteristics and diagnostic algorithm [^1137Bkps]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Main Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of erosive oral lesions include infectious agents, due to viruses and bacteria, drug-induced reactions, inflammatory conditions, and systemic diseases (Table 1). These conditions have some specific morphological features and overlapping clinical features, therefore histology is required for the diagnosis.

Table 1
Differential diagnosis of oral blisters, ulcers, gingivitis, and stomatitis

SJS/TEN Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis

Oral lesions caused by infectious agents are usually transient. Primary infection with herpes simplex is the most common viral cause of erosions and blisters in the oral mucosa. Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are severe, mostly drug-induced reactions with an abrupt onset of erosive stomatitis and hemorrhagic cheilitis followed by widespread skin lesions (Fig. 1 j–l). The gingiva is rarely affected in Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Other mucosal involvement is frequently seen, such as ocular and genital involvement.

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis is the most frequent inflammatory condition of the oral mucosa with recurrent self-limiting ulcers affecting non keratinized mucosa. Multiple factors are involved in the etiology of recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Behçet syndrome is a chronic multi-system condition characterized by diffuse aphthous erosions and ulcers on the labial, buccal, and lateral tongue mucosa. Ocular and genital involvement is also frequently seen.

Lupus erythematosus is a systemic autoimmune disorder with a wide variety of clinical features. Oral lesions in lupus erythematosus are usually multiple, located on the buccal mucosa, hard palate, lips, and gingiva. The distribution is asymmetrical with different morphological features ranging from plaques, erythema, and ulcerations.

Oral lichen planus is a chronic immune mediated disease with highly variable clinical features ranging from subtle white reticular patterns to erosions and ulcerations (Fig. 1 m–o). Lesions are usually symmetrically distributed in the oral cavity. Affected sites of the oral cavity include the buccal mucosa, tongue, and gingiva. Histopathologic biopsies of oral lichen planus often show sub-epithelial blistering without preservation of the basal cells, in contrast to pemphigoid.

### COVID-19, coronavirus vaccines, and possible association with lipschütz vulvar ulcer: a systematic review [^112Dk95V]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present systematic literature review documents 39 episodes of Lipschütz vulvar ulcer temporally associated with COVID-19 or, more frequently, an immunization against SARS-CoV-2.

A temporal relationship between COVID-19 or vaccines to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection does not immediately imply causality. Nonetheless, three factors insinuate that the link between COVID-19 or immunization against SARS-CoV-2 and Lipschütz ulcer may be causal. First. Primary Epstein-Barr virus infection, which is currently regarded as the most characteristic cause of genital ulcer, was excluded in most cases. Furthermore, approximately 40 patients with Epstein-Barr virus-associated Lipschütz ulcer were published over a period of 50 years, while 33 patients are documented in the present review that covers just 3 years of coronavirus pandemic. Second. Approximately 10% of patients included in this review experienced recurrences after re-exposure to coronavirus 2 or vaccination against it. Third, a cause-and-effect relationship between coronavirus 2 and Lipschütz ulcer appears plausible also because ulcerations of the oral mucosa are detected in two-thirds of individuals with coronavirus disease 2019. Moreover, genital ulcers were reported also in two male subjects affected by coronavirus disease 2019. SARS-CoV-2 has been observed to elevate levels of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor α, which can impact the adhesion of endothelial cells and chemotaxis of neutrophils, ultimately resulting in the development of aphthous lesions. However, the pathophysiology of ulcers affecting the vulvar region remains uncertain.

The clinical features of Lipschütz ulcer associated with COVID-19 or immunization against SARS-CoV-2 and that of the remaining cases, including those associated with Epstein-Barr virus, are undistinguishable. Remarkably, while approximately 10% of cases associated with COVID-19 or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 recur, such a propensity has been very rarely (about 1%) observed before the pandemic. This likely relates to the fact that diseases such as Epstein-Barr virus mononucleosis can only be caught once. However, COVID-19 may recur. Furthermore, vaccines are widely prescribed to prevent and control the pandemic.

Most cases of Lipschütz ulcer included in this analysis were induced by a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, Lipschütz ulcer has never been reported to be temporally associated with other vaccines.

### Inflammatory ulcers [^112sJvgZ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Skin ulcerations may develop as a manifestation of a variety of different diseases or may result from some nondisease phenomena. Inflammatory ulcers refer specifically to those ulcerations in which inflammation is the primary pathologic process resulting in lesion formation; that is, inflammation is the cause rather than the consequence of the ulcer. This review will consider several types of inflammatory ulcers that the clinician may encounter in his or her practice.

### Assessment of recurrent fever among children undergoing tonsillectomy [^115fhuJa]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 4
Screening questionnaire for PFAPA

Interestingly, we found that children with 3 or more episodes of tonsillitis with fever per year were significantly more likely to have a history of recurrent aphthous ulcers than children undergoing tonsillectomy for other reasons. We previously found that first-degree family members of patients with PFAPA have high rates of recurrent aphthous ulcers suggesting a link in the pathogenesis of these oropharyngeal disorders. Indeed, recently, patients with PFAPA, recurrent aphthous ulcers, and Behçet's disease were found to have common genetic susceptibility loci, further supporting the biologic connection between aphthous ulcers and PFAPA. Here, we find that aphthous ulcers are more common among children with recurrent tonsillitis, which has also noted to be heritable in studies of twins. The raises the question as to whether a wider group of children with recurrent tonsillitis have inflammatory tonsillitis with genetic underpinnings similar to PFAPA. Assessment of genetic risk variants for recurrent tonsillitis may shed light on whether recurrent tonsillitis has a genetic basis and shares genetic susceptibility loci near genes involved in inflammatory immunologic pathways with PFAPA.

### Efficacy and safety of dexamethasone ointment on recurrent aphthous ulceration [^115Z76wi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Recurrent aphthous ulceration is the most common oral mucosal lesion and may be associated with many systemic diseases. Topical corticosteroids are used frequently for recurrent aphthous ulceration; however, the number of high-quality clinical experiments available is insufficient, and no reports exist on the blood level of corticosteroids after topical usage in the oral mucosa. The objective was to determine the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone ointment in the treatment of recurrent aphthous ulceration and detect serum dexamethasone concentrations in the patients.

Methods

A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel, multicenter clinical trial was conducted in 5 centers to compare the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone ointment with placebo. There were 810 patients with minor recurrent aphthous ulcerations screened for study eligibility, and 240 patients were enrolled at 5 centers from March 1, 2009 to April 30, 2010; 120 were assigned randomly to the treatment group and 120 to a control group. Patients were instructed to apply the given agent to the identified ulcer 3 times a day (after meals) for 5 days. The size, pain level, healing ratio, and average duration of ulcers and the safety of the agents were evaluated. The serum concentration of dexamethasone was detected using a high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry assay.

Results

The results showed that baseline characteristics were similar (P > .5). At day 6 ± 2 after treatment, there was significant difference in the variation of ulcer size between the treatment group (7.167 ± 6.3415 mm²) and the control group (4.346 ± 7.0666 mm²; P = 0.000); and in the variation of pain level between the treatment group (5.623 ± 1.9570) and the control group (4.940 ± 2.2449; P = 0.001). The healing ratio was 83.33% in the treatment group and 54.70% in the control group (P = 0.000). No severe adverse reactions were observed. No serum dexamethasone was detected before or after the use of the agents (< 0.502 ng/mL).

Conclusion

Dexamethasone ointment was efficient in the treatment of recurrent aphthous ulceration and was safe as evaluated using clinical assessment and serum level detection.

### Acute vulvar ulcers and the COVID-19 booster vaccine [^11356sAX]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

The treatment for acute vulvar ulcers secondary to COVID-19 or the vaccine has been focused on symptomatic pain relief, but antibiotics can be considered in settings where bacterial superinfection seem likely. For outpatient treatment, patients with moderate to severe infection may benefit from topical or oral steroid treatments, respectively. In the case of RNSRAGU and the COVID-19 infection and vaccine, multiple case reports note successful treatment with both oral and topical steroid use.

Our hope is that this case will add to the growing literature on RNSRAGU following COVID-19 vaccination but also highlight the Pfizer booster vaccine specifically. Our patient had multiple other risk factors in addition to their booster, including a history of oral aphthous ulcers and 2 previous episodes of acute vulvar ulcers. Their infectious, autoimmune, and inflammatory workup was overall unremarkable, and thus, RNSRAGU was the diagnosis of exclusion. While the patient did not report gastrointestinal symptoms, we still recommended the patient follow-up with gastroenterology to rule out underlying disease. In the absence of reported common triggers for RNSRAGU, including recent infection (including COVID-19) and stress, their Pfizer booster was likely the trigger.

### Diagnostic difficulties in inflammatory bowel disease pathology [^116pYyY9]. Histopathology (2006). Low credibility.

This review summarizes some of the common diagnostic problems encountered by pathologists when evaluating patients with chronic colitis and in whom inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is either suspected or within the differential diagnosis. Both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) show characteristic, but non-specific, pathological features that may overlap and result in a diagnosis of 'indeterminate colitis' (IC). However, other reasons why pathologists may entertain a diagnosis of IC include failure to recognize or accept certain 'hardcore' histological features as indicative of CD, an attempt to classify cases of chronic colitis based on mucosal biopsy material or in the absence of adequate clinical and radiographic information, and the presence of other disease processes that mask, or mimic, IBD. In addition, some cases of UC may show unusual CD-like features, such as discontinuous or patchy disease, ileal inflammation, extracolonic inflammation, granulomatous inflammation in response to ruptured crypts, aphthous ulcers, or transmural inflammation. Furthermore, other forms of colitis, such as microscopic colitis, diverticulitis and diversion colitis may, on occasion, also show IBD-like changes. The clinical and pathological features that aid in the distinction between these entities, and others, are covered in detail in this review.

### Silver nitrate stick helps manage aphthous ulcers… [^11159fsh]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

to the editor: Years ago I learned from my father, who was also a physician, a simple and highly effective way to manage aphthous ulcers — touch them with a silver nitrate stick. Obviously, one needs to be sure there is no other apparent etiology but, because the most common cause is not related to underlying disease, the silver nitrate stick works wonders, and patients walk out of the office pain free. The procedure is simple: wet the tip of the stick and gently touch it to the ulcer. When the ulcer turns white, remove the stick. Have patients swish out the silver nitrate and send them home. You should warn them that the procedure may sting for a moment but, considering that they are already in pain, they don't really notice much difference. Although silver nitrate cautery may cause more tissue necrosis and longer healing time if it is left in place too long, I have not found this to be a problem.

### Terminal ileitis is not always Crohn's disease [^116h4aHu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Isolated terminal ileal ulcerations

Some asymptomatic individuals may present with aphthous or small ulcerations in the TI, unaccompanied by lesions in the colon or ileocecal valve. Most of the ulcerations were surrounded by normal mucosa, regenerating epithelium, or edematous mucosa and covered by thin or faint exudates. Thus patients with isolated TI ulcerations (ITIU) in most cases do not have CD, and in some cases follow up is needed.

A recent study reported 145 patients with ITIU. All of the patients were asymptomatic healthy individuals who did not take aspirin or NSAIDs and underwent colonoscopy for other indications (mostly surveillance for colorectal carcinoma). In this study, ITIU had completely resolved on follow-up colonoscopy in 62 of 93 patients. Only one showed a significant histological abnormality, a granulomatous lesion, and this patient was confirmed as having intestinal tuberculosis. Another patient was later diagnosed with CD, based on follow-up colonoscopic findings of typical longitudinal ulcerations of CD. The time from initial diagnosis of ITIU to confirmation of typical CD was 32 months. During the follow-up period the patients did not have any symptoms nor did they receive any treatment, except for the patient with CD. Aphthous or small ulcerations in the TI may be one of the earliest manifestations of serious diseases, such as CD and intestinal tuberculosis. Some patients with aphthous type CD later develop typical CD. In these patients, progression from aphthous lesions to overt CD requires a relatively long period of time, whereas in other patients, aphthous lesions disappear or remain unchanged on follow up. Another study has reported that CD is unlikely to develop in asymptomatic individuals with isolated ileitis.

### Targeting mucosal healing in Crohn's disease: what the clinician needs to know [^1143A5HA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Although a universal definition of mucosal healing is yet to be determined, the absence of ulceration at ileocolonoscopy has currently been adopted as the endoscopic endpoint for CD. Nevertheless, analyses of the SONIC trial demonstrated that partial mucosal healing, depicted as a reduction in SES-CD from baseline of > 50%, may also suffice to improve clinical outcomes. In that analysis, SES-CD reduction of > 50% from baseline at week 26 of treatment was more predictive of steroid-free remission at week 52 than any of the other endoscopic cut-off values examined. Additionally, steroid-free remission at week 52 could be predicted with a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 48%. Further trials are urgently needed to develop an entirely new endoscopic scoring tool in CD that is objective, validated and easily applicable.

In addition, endoscopic assessment of postoperative recurrence of CD is also an indispensable part of optimised management of patients with CD. In a pioneering study conducted in 1990, the extent of ulcerations in the neoterminal ileum proximal to the anastomosis 1 year after ileal resection was identified as a predictor of clinical recurrence. A five-grade stepwise numeric ulcers index gradation was applied. Here, postoperative symptom recurrence could be found in 6% of patients with five or fewer aphthous ulcers in the distal ileum (Rutgeerts score i0–1), 27% in patients with more than five aphthous ulcers in the distal ileum (i2), 63% in those with diffuse ileal ulceration (i3), and 100% in examined patients with diffuse ileal ulceration with nodules or luminal narrowing (i4). The interobserver agreement for the Rutgeert's score was, however, rather fair, with Kappa statistics of 0.57 (95% confidence interval 0.51–0.65) in a group of 14 expert gastroenterologists in a real-life setting. The recommendation of the IOIBD expert consensus panel was to define post-operative remission as a Rutgeerts' score of ≤ i1. Here, it was also proposed that the currently used i2 grade should be subdivided into i2a (purely anastomotic lesions) and i2b (lesions in the neoterminal ileum with more than five aphthous ulcers) grade, where only i2b would be judged as relevant mucosal recurrence. Again, the score lacks formal validation, and it is unclear which level of ileal inflammation constitutes clinically meaningful recurrence.

### Common oral lesions: part I. superficial mucosal lesions [^116hPJMb]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Common superficial oral lesions include candidiasis, recurrent herpes labialis, recurrent aphthous stomatitis, erythema migrans, hairy tongue, and lichen planus. Recognition and diagnosis require taking a thorough history and performing a complete oral examination. Knowledge of clinical characteristics such as size, location, surface morphology, color, pain, and duration is helpful in establishing a diagnosis. Oral candidiasis may present as pseudomembranous candidiasis, glossitis, or perlèche (angular cheilitis). Oral candidiasis is common in infants, but in adults it may signify immune deficiency or other illness. Herpes labialis typically is a mild, self-limited condition. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis most often is a mild condition; however, severe cases may be caused by nutritional deficiencies, autoimmune disorders, or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Erythema migrans is a waxing and waning disorder of unknown etiology. Hairy tongue represents elongation and hypertrophy of the filiform papillae and most often occurs in persons who smoke heavily. Oral lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory condition that may be reticular or erosive. Certain risk factors have been associated with each of these lesions, such as poor oral hygiene, age, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption, and some systemic conditions may have oral manifestations. Many recommended therapies for oral lesions are unsupported by randomized controlled trials.

### Oral ulcers in juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus: a review of the literature [^116e5xLv]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

LE-Nonspecific Oral Ulcers

Aphthous Ulcers

An aphthous ulcer is described as a white to yellow painful ulcer with a surrounding red rim. The lesion is usually presented with multiple lesions or in a group, and tends to involve primarily lining tissue: the soft palate, buccal and labial mucosa. Aphthous ulcers are more common in JSLE patients than in adult SLE and usually occur when disease is active. There are four types of aphthous ulcer, classified as (a) minor ulcers, smaller than 1 cm, usually healing without scar; (b) major ulcers, larger than 1 cm, often healing with scar; (c) herpetiform ulcers, a group of small ulcers (more than ten lesions); and (d) severe ulcers, a continuous minor ulcer lasting months. In our observations, the most common type of aphthous ulcer in JSLE patients is multiple minor ulcers and less than ten lesions (Fig. 1 d).

Lupus Cheilitis

Lupus cheilitis is an inflammation of the buccal lips. The typical lesion is small or diffuse, erythematous and edematous, and may turn into crusty painful ulcers. Cheilitis often involves the vermilion zone of the lower lip (typical lupus cheilitis). As the lesion is found in the sun-exposed area, lupus cheilitis is usually associated with photosensitivity in JSLE patients. Extensive erosive lupus cheilitis that involves both upper and lower lips has also been reported in JSLE patients and appears in active disease (Fig. 1 e).

Other LE-Nonspecific Oral Lesions

Bullous SLE is a rare clinical manifestation developed by circulating antibodies against type VII collagen at the sub-epidermis. It typically presents with multiple tense bullae at the face, neck and trunk. Bullous LE at buccal mucosa has been reported in adult SLE and JSLE patients.

Suspected CD

The cardinal lesions are mucosal ulcerations of varying severity (Fig. 1); in the earliest stage they present as aphthous ulcerations defined by a mucosal break with surrounding erythema. Punched out, linear or irregular ulcers with cobblestone appearance and stenosis caused by inflammation or fibrosis are seen in more severe CD. Other findings, such as erythema, edema and loss of villi without ulcerations, are considered non-specific. It should be emphasized that ulcerations detected by CE are not specific for CD, and CE does not allow tissue sampling to support the diagnosis.

Figure 1
Crohn's disease of the small bowel detected with capsule endoscopy: (A) normal small bowel mucosa, (B) aphthous ulceration, (C) linear ulcers, and (D) ulcerated stenosis

Lesions caused by NSAIDs are an important differential diagnosis, because these drugs are frequently used in the general population. It is well established that NSAIDs are associated with gastrointestinal ulcerations, bleeding and strictures, that lesions are visualized with CE and they can mimic CD. The precise number of weeks NSAIDs should be stopped prior to CE is unknown, but generally 4 weeks is recommended.

A surprising finding by Goldstein et al was that 11% of healthy volunteers who were not users of NSAIDs had mucosal breaks in the small bowel at a baseline CE. In the subsequent clinical study, 7% of patients with a normal baseline CE developed 1–3 mucosal breaks after placebo treatment. This raises an important question about the diagnostic criterion and minimum threshold for diagnosing CD in patients examined with CE. At this point, no such criterion has been validated. As suggested by Mow et al, the most frequently used diagnostic criterion for CD with CE is the presence of > 3 ulcerations in patients not using NSAIDs.

### The expression of TNF-α in recurrent aphthous stomatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115DYCVA]. Cytokine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The pathogenesis of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is related to an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokine, namely tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). This cytokine plays an important role in the development of ulcer lesions, both in saliva, tissues and blood. This systematic review analyzed the differences of TNF-α in lesions, salivary and blood and can be used as a reliable method of diagnosis for RAS.

Methods

A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus databases, Web of Science, Scielo, Google Scholar and Embase with keywords. The inclusion criteria were studies that assessed the saliva, serum, and RAS lesion, with the outcome reporting the mean of saliva, serum and tissue expression of TNF-α. The risk of bias was also assessed.

Result

Healthy individuals showed significantly lower TNF-α than RAS (SMD = -1.517, 95% CI [-2.25, -0.78]). Although there is a significant difference between sample (i.e., saliva, serum) and detection type (i.e., cytometry bead array, ELISA), both methods can detect a significant difference in TNF-α between healthy individuals and RAS patients.

Conclusions

The TNF-α is a useful diagnostic marker for RAS. We encourage saliva to detect changes in TNF-α during ulceration as it provides accuracy, reliability, and non-invasive procedure compared to a blood draw.

### Genital ulcers as an unusual sign of periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngotonsillitis, cervical adenopathy syndrome: a novel symptom? [^116e2d9x]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngotonsillitis, cervical adenopathy (PFAPA) syndrome, which is characterized by periodic episodes of high fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis, is of unknown etiology and manifests usually before 5 years of age. A patient with periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngotonsillitis, cervical adenopathy syndrome simultaneously presenting with genital ulcers has not been reported previously. We describe a 12-year-old Chinese girl with a 2-year history of periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngotonsillitis, cervical adenopathy syndrome who exhibited vulvar ulcers accompanying an episode of febrile periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngotonsillitis, and cervical adenopathy. Although during a 1-year follow-up this girl did not manifest typical symptoms/signs of Behçet's disease except recurrent oral aphthae and genital ulcers, it is possible that periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngotonsillitis, cervical adenopathy syndrome and Behçet's disease could have overlapping manifestations. Furthermore, this report would add to the evidence of a wide variation in the clinical symptomatology of PFAPA syndrome.

Regarding medical management for Behçet's syndrome, more specifically with respect to management of mucocutaneous lesions, topical therapy, BAD/BSR 2024 guidelines recommend to advise patients with BS with severe oral aphthous-like ulcers on simple oral hygiene measures, having regular dental appointments, using topical antiseptics (such as chlorhexidine mouthwash), and avoiding irritants such as sodium lauryl sulfate in toothpaste or any identified food.

Behçet's disease is a systemic vasculitic disease characterized mainly by recurrent oral and genital aphthous ulcers, uveitis and skin findings. Central nervous system involvement is a serious manifestation. A case of acute meningeal syndrome secondary to Behçet's disease is presented. Behçet's disease should always be considered in differential diagnosis of acute meningeal syndrome without signs of viral infection, particularly in the context of multisystem manifestations.

### Association of oral manifestations with severity of the disease in ulcerative colitis patients [^115gmo4S]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study also revealed that increasing illness severity correlated with a higher incidence of vomiting. Fisher's exact test confirmed the statistical significance of this relationship. However, Hearty et al.'s research on Crohn's disease patients yielded insignificant results in this regard. In a comparison between colitis and Crohn's disease patients by Katz et al. vomiting rates were significantly higher in Crohn's patients but not in colitis patients. Given the multifactorial nature of vomiting, further extensive retrospective or prospective cohort studies should explore additional contributing factors beyond the disease itself.

Regarding mucosal changes in UC, the oral cavity may exhibit stomatitis, glossitis, cheilitis, aphthous ulcers, and pyostomatitis vegetans — a specific sign of UC. However, the exact nature of this association remains unclear. Additionally, deep linear ulcers and hyperplastic folds, which cause pain upon touch or when consuming acidic, spicy, or hot foods, should not be confused with the shallow, round-to-elliptical aphthous ulcers that typically heal within 7 to 14 days.

UC may precede oral or cutaneous lesions by months or years, sometimes with minimal symptoms hindering early diagnosis. Identifying pyostomatitis vegetans can prompt further investigation for subclinical intestinal diseases. Treatment aims to manage associated gastrointestinal conditions, and controlling colitis leads to gradual oral lesion improvement. Aphthous ulcers, affecting up to 20% of the population, are wider and more persistent in UC. Adult patients with a history of recurrent aphthous ulcers may experience concurrent aphthous stomatitis alongside colitis. Mucosal changes include stomatitis, glossitis, cheilitis, aphthous ulcers, and pyostomatitis vegetans. Dental care should prioritize prevention, regular visits, and avoiding non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

The potential limitations of this study include the relatively small sample size of 99 patients, which may not be representative of the broader population of UC patients. Additionally, the study's cross-sectional design limits the ability to establish causality between oral manifestations and UC severity. The reliance on self-reported symptoms and clinical evaluations may introduce bias and variability in the data. Furthermore, the study was conducted in a single hospital in Gorgan, Iran, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other regions or populations. Finally, the study did not account for potential confounding factors such as medication use, dietary habits, and other comorbid conditions that could influence the observed associations.

5 Common disease considerations

5.1 Infectious diseases and IBD: differential and concurrent diagnoses

5.1.1 Tuberculosis

Statement 73. We recommend that the differential diagnosis of tuberculosis should be considered in patients with suspected ileocaecal Crohn 's disease, particularly in patients born in or who have lived for extended periods in endemic areas or have other risk factors for infection (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.8%).

Differentiating between intestinal tuberculosis (TB) and Crohn's disease may be challenging in those who have lived in endemic areas as clinical features may be similar. Features suggestive of a diagnosis of intestinal TB include night sweats, concomitant pulmonary tuberculosis, positive tuberculin skin test, antibodies to TB, abdominal lymphadenopathy, ascites, transverse ulcers and a patulous ileocecal valve. Haematochesia, involvement of the sigmoid colon, skip lesions and aphthous ulceration are more common in Crohn's disease, whereas weight loss may be predictive of TB. Extraintestinal manifestations are more commonly associated with Crohn's disease. A recent study from South Korea used 40 Crohn's patients and 40 with intestinal TB to develop a predictive model using colonoscopic, laboratory and radiological criteria. Features suggesting Crohn's at colonoscopy were anorectal lesions, longitudinal ulcers, aphthous ulcers and cobblestoning. Colonoscopic features suggesting TB were fewer than four segments of colon involved, patulous ileocaecal valve, transverse ulcers and scars or post-inflammatory polyps. Positive ASCA serology and proximal small bowel disease suggested Crohn's, and a positive quantiferon gold test and typical pulmonary lesions suggested TB. A score derived from these features was able to make an accurate diagnosis in 96.3% of patients.TB PCR performed on intestinal biopsies may be helpful for discrimination between the diseases.

### Mycophenolate mofetil-induced oral ulcerations in solid organ transplant recipients: a report of 3 cases [^112dTDVc]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Second, some have posited that the association between MMF and oral ulcers may be owing to viral infection secondary to immunosuppression. Although some empirical evidence for this hypothesis does exist, all viral cultures reported in the literature, including our cases, have been negative, and attempts to discontinue other immunosuppressive agents before discontinuing MMF have not successfully resolved patients' oral lesions. The association between MMF-induced ulcers and viral infection is thus tenuous at best.

Regardless of the mechanism underlying mucosal damage, it is clear that an association exists between MMF and oral ulcers. In particular, recipients of solid organ transplants seem to be especially susceptible to the development of such ulcers. A possible explanation for the increased incidence of MMF-induced ulcers in these patients is that plasma levels of MMF have been found to increase dramatically when MMF is combined with certain additional immunosuppressive drugs, most notably cyclosporine. In patients maintained on both medications — a frequent combination in transplant recipients — plasma drug concentrations of MMF may thus be much higher than initially anticipated, predisposing these patients to the development of oral ulcers. This explanation may also underlie the increased incidence of oral ulcers in transplant patients on a combination of MMF and sirolimus compared with those on MMF and tacrolimus. Although plasma levels of MMF are not routinely assessed in hospitalized patients and are thus unfortunately not reported in any of the published cases series (including this one), limited pharmacologic data do support the assertion that elevated plasma levels of MMF may play a role in the development of oral ulcers in transplant recipients. MMF levels may therefore represent a useful adjunctive laboratory test to help confirm the diagnosis in patients with suspected MMF-induced oral ulcers.

Although the precise mechanism has yet to be elucidated, an association exists between MMF and the development of oral ulcers, especially among solid organ transplant recipients. MMF-induced aphthae should thus be added to the differential diagnosis of oral ulcerations in the immunocompromised host, and discontinuation of MMF should be considered in a patient with refractory oral ulcers and a negative workup for other etiologies.

2.2 Outcome Measures

Clinical effectiveness and safety were assessed at baseline, weeks 4, 8, and 12. The primary outcome was categorized into complete remission (CR) for no new oral ulcers in the last 4 weeks, partial response (PR) for improved symptoms but with new oral ulcers, and non‐responder (NR) for no improvement. Secondary outcomes included ulcer activity, assessed through a patient questionnaire on lesion count, total new lesions in the last 4 weeks, lesion duration of a single lesion, persistent duration of overall oral ulcer, and pain severity using a numeric rating scale (NRS). In addition, modified composite index scores for oral ulcer activity were retrieved. Safety was measured by tracking adverse events (AEs) after initiation, with discontinuation recorded as intolerable AEs. Outcome measures were written in a standardized, predetermined medical record format.

### Intestinal Behçet and Crohn's disease: two sides of the same coin [^112Jnkic]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Behçet's disease (BD) was first described by the Turkish dermatologist Hulusi Behçet in 1937 as a syndrome with oral and genital ulcerations and ocular inflammation. It is a rare multi-systemic inflammatory disease with unknown etiology and a chronic recurrent pattern, characterized by recurrent oral and genital aphthous/ulcers with muco-cutaneous, ocular, articular, vascular, and/or gastrointestinal lesions. BD is included both in vasculitis, affecting vessels of all kinds and sizes, and auto-inflammatory disease classifications. Crohn's disease (CD) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. It often includes both intestinal (abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting) and extra-intestinal symptoms (fever, weight loss, anaemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye). When the gastrointestinal tract is involved, a differential diagnosis between BD and CD is very difficult. There are no pathognomonic laboratory tests or endoscopic findings of intestinal BD, although few, large and deep ulcerations with discrete borders are described as a characteristic endoscopic pattern. Recently, novel diagnostic criteria and a disease activity index have been proposed in the diagnosis of intestinal BD. Treatment for intestinal BD is similar to CD, such as steroids, immunomodulators and biologic agents (anti-tumour necrosis factor α antibody). The goal of this review is to describe these clinical conditions with similarities and differences from clinical, therapeutic and surgical points of view.

P058 Colchicine efficacy on oral ulcers caused by behçet's spectrum disorders including idiopathic recurrent aphthous stomatitis, PFAPA, and behçet's disease

Introduction: Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common oral mucosal disorder characterized by painful ulcers in pediatric patients. Significant genetic commonalities among RAS, periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome (PFAPA), and Behçet's disease (BD) suggest shared underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Consequently, these disorders have been proposed to constitute a unified clinical spectrum termed "Behçet Spectrum Disorders (BSD)".

Objectives: Given the scarcity of objective data regarding the efficacy of colchicine in pediatric BSD-related RAS, this study aimed to evaluate clinical and laboratory changes in patients before and after colchicine treatment.

Methods: In this retrospective study, a total of 317 patients with RAS were evaluated between December 2019 and March 2024. Only patients with complete data were included in the study. Of these, 186 were classified as having BSD-related RAS, while 131 were excluded due to underlying conditions such as micronutrient deficiencies, autoinflammatory diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, chronic infections, immunodeficiencies, or hematologic disorders. The included patients were classified into three subgroups: Behçet's disease -associated RAS (BARAS), idiopathic-RAS (IRAS), and PFAPA-associated RAS (PFARAS). Clinical and laboratory parameters were assessed before and after colchicine treatment.

### The association between celiac disease, dental enamel defects, and aphthous ulcers in a United States cohort [^113r9NHk]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Goals and Background

European studies have demonstrated that dental enamel defects and oral aphthae are observed in celiac disease (CD). We investigated this association in a US population.

Study

Biopsy proven CD patients and controls were recruited from a private dental practice and from CD support meetings. History of aphthae was taken and dental examination was performed by a single dentist. Teeth were photographed and enamel defects graded according to the Aine classification. A second dentist reviewed all photographs.

Results

Among patients (n = 67, mean age 34.8 ± 21.6 y) compared with controls (n = 69, mean age 28.1 ± 15.7 y), there were significantly more enamel defects [51% vs. 30%, P = 0.016, odds ratio (OR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2–4.8]. This was confined to children (87% vs. 33%, P = 0.003, OR 13.3, 95% CI 3.0–58.6), but not adults (32% vs. 29%, P = 0.76, OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.5–2.8). This was reflected in defects being observed in those with mixed dentition compared with those with permanent dentition (68.4% vs. 29.6%, P < 0.0001). The degree of agreement between the 2 dentists was good (kappa coefficient = 0.53, P < 0.0001), aphthous ulcers were more frequent in CD than controls (42.4% vs. 23.2%, P = 0.02).

Conclusions

This study supports that CD is highly associated with dental enamel defects in childhood, most likely because of the onset of CD during enamel formation; no such association was found in adults. Our study also supports the association between CD and aphthous ulcer. All physicians should examine the mouth, including the teeth, which may provide an opportunity to diagnose CD. In addition, CD should be added to the differential diagnosis of dental enamel defects and aphthous ulcers.

### Roflumilast for oral ulcers in Behçet's disease and recurrent aphthous stomatitis [^115Wvt8G]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Oral aphthae in patients with Behçet's disease (BD) and recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) cause significant discomfort and require long‐term management. While colchicine or azathioprine is a common choice for systemic treatment of refractory oral ulcers, some patients show insufficient response or intolerance. Apremilast, a phosphodiesterase‐4 (PDE4) inhibitor, has proven to be effective for the treatment of oral ulcers in BD through phase‐3 randomized controlled studies, but was unavailable in some high‐prevalence countries, including Turkey and Korea, at the time of the study. Roflumilast, another PDE4 inhibitor approved for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), has similar molecular properties with higher binding affinity to PDE4 and longer plasma halftime. Thus, we investigated the effectiveness and safety of roflumilast as an alternative treatment option for refractory oral ulcers.

### Wound, pressure ulcer, and burn guidelines (2023)-4: guidelines for the management of connective tissue disease / vasculitis-associated skin ulcers, third edition [^117SuQ7V]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3.3 Many‐associated oral ulcers are painless, being related to a primary disease. However, there are some cases of discoid lupus erythematosus of the mucosa. Diseases to be differentiated include recurrent aphthous stomatitis, lichen planus, leukoplakia, and infectious diseases such as herpes simplex and fungal infection. When it is difficult to make a diagnosis based on clinical symptoms, skin biopsy, including direct immunofluorescence, and investigation for infectious disease are recommended for detailed examination for the etiology. Furthermore,‐associated oral ulcers may reflect the disease state, and it should be re‐evaluated using blood biochemistry/immunological examination and urinalysis

In patients with SLE, the prevalence of oral lesions varies among reports, ranging from 2% or 3% to 50%. The lesion site is painless in some cases but painful in others. The ulcer site sometimes becomes painful, affecting lifestyle. Typical oral lesions include painless ulcers, which often occur in the upper palate in the acute stage, and discoid lupus erythematosus of the mucosa. However, various disease types, such as recurrent aphthous stomatitis, lichen planus‐like exanthema, leukoplakia, and red plaque, have been reported.
In patients with SLE receiving systemic administration of immunosuppressants, secondary infection with herpes virus or fungus may induce oral ulcers; therefore, microscopy, Tzanck test, and viral antigen tests must be performed. If herpetic gingivostomatitis or oral candidiasis is observed, treatment with antiviral or antifungal drugs should be performed.
Immunoglobulin deposition in the basement membrane is observed on direct immunofluorescence in ≥ 70% of patients with SLE‐related oral lesions, whereas the positive rate in patients with lichen planus–like exanthema or leukoplakia is ≤ 10%. It is useful for the differential diagnosis. In the case of refractory ulcers at the site of discoid lupus erythematosus, the possibility of scar carcinoma must also be considered.
Oral lesions are adopted for many criteria as a parameter of SLE activity. Therefore, if oral lesions are observed in patients with SLE, SLE activity should be initially evaluated, and the systemic administration of steroids or immunosuppressants should be performed if necessary. The systemic administration of steroids or immunosuppressants is also useful for treating oral lesions.
Systemic treatment for SLE‐associated oral ulcers is beneficial, but no study has directly evaluated the utility of local therapy. However, there is one systematic review on local treatment for recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Topical steroid therapy is the first choice of therapy.

Table 2 — conditions, characteristics, and treatment of potential etiologies of seronegative enteropathy — also outlines immune-mediated, neoplastic, and injury-related causes with diagnostic clues and management. Collagenous sprue shows subepithelial collagen deposition and treatment with GFD with or without immunosuppression (budesonide, prednisone, azathioprine). Common variable immune deficiency (CVID) presents with onset after age 2 y, poor response to vaccines, recurrent infections, and persistent diarrhea, histology with absence of plasma cells and polymorphonuclear infiltrate, testing listing IgG < 5 g/L with low IgA or IgM, and treatment with budesonide. Autoimmune enteropathy includes intractable diarrhea and weight loss, few intraepithelial lymphocytes with lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate in the lamina propria, decreased goblet cells, and neutrophilic cryptitis, with anti-enterocyte antibody testing and immunosuppression (eg, steroids, azathioprine, infliximab). Intestinal lymphoma shows a monoclonal population of T cells with evaluation using inflammatory markers, CT scan, capsule endoscopy, and PET scan, and hematology consultation. Crohn's disease features aphthous ulceration, skip lesions, and granulomas, other tests with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and treatment with immunosuppression and biologic agents. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis has massive eosinophilic infiltration with peripheral hyper eosinophilia and treatment with dietary therapy and glucocorticoids. Radiation enteropathy lists lamina propria fibrosis, and graft vs host disease shows crypt cell necrosis with loss of epithelium and treatment with prednisone or budesonide.

### Acute oral ulcers [^115fGk19]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of acute oral ulcers can be challenging. Important historic details include the pattern of recurrence, anatomic areas of involvement within the mouth and elsewhere on the mucocutaneous surface, associated medical symptoms or comorbidities, and symptomology. Careful mucocutaneous examination is essential. When necessary, biopsy at an active site without ulceration is generally optimal. Depending on the clinical scenario, supplemental studies that may be useful include cultures; perilesional biopsy for direct immunofluorescence testing; and evaluation for infectious diseases, gluten sensitivity, inflammatory bowel disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection, connective tissue diseases, or hematinic deficiencies. Clinicians should maintain a broad differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with acute oral ulcers.

Specific cutaneous manifestations

Orofacial Crohn's disease and orofacial ulcerative colitis

In Crohn's disease (CD), oral manifestations occur in 8–9% of the patients. They are more common in the pediatric population, and may precede intestinal involvement. When there is oral involvement, the likelihood of other extraintestinal manifestations is greater. CD may appear in the oral cavity as aphthous ulcerations or superficial bleeding ulcers. However, a wide variety of disease-specific oral lesions have been described in patients with intestinal CD (Table 2).

Table 2
Oral lesions in patients with Crohn's disease

CD in the oral cavity usually takes the form of aphthous ulceration of the mucosal surface. Aphthae and mucosal tags are frequently seen if the oral cavity is carefully evaluated in patients with newly diagnosed CD. Deep tissue inflammation occurs uncommonly and may lead to labial, lingual, and facial swelling and fistula formation can result. CD sometimes shows only orofacial manifestations.

In ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, lesions of the oral cavity may appear as aphthous ulcerations, superficial hemorrhagic ulcers or angular cheilitis. In general, oral lesions coincide with exacerbations of the colonic disease. Similar ulcerations may arise on the buttocks, abdomen, thighs and face. Aphthous ulcers or angular stomatitis occur in as many as 5–10% of patients.

Indeed, classification of granulomatous orofacial disease is complex (particularly in the absence of inflammation elsewhere) and there is considerable overlap between orofacial CD, Melkersson Rosenthal syndrome, cheilitis granulomatoses, and the other orofacial granulomatosis. Therefore, diagnosis should include tissue sampling of the involved orofacial region for histopathologic examination.

Effective treatment for specific orofacial CD has not been defined. Many patients who are found to have OCD manifestations may be completely asymptomatic, since the oral findings are not clinically problematic.

### PFAPA flares observed during COVID outbreak: can emotional stress trigger PFAPA attacks? A multicenter cohort study [^1174iGae]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) is one of the most common autoinflammatory syndrome. It was reported in 1987 by Marshall et al. who described recurrent episodes of fever along with pharyngitis, cervical lymph nodes, and mouth ulcers mimicking cyclic neutropenia, but with a normal neutrophil count. The exact prevalence of this syndrome is unknown, but PFAPA appears to be more common than other periodic fever diseases.

A typical PFAPA attack usually lasts 3–7 days, with intervals of 2–8 weeks. At certain stages of the disease episodes may occur at regular intervals, with predictable attacks. Medications may reduce the frequency of attacks, especially glucocorticoids therapy where a single dose usually halts the attack within hours, but in about half of patients frequency of attacks increases. Our group recently found that a Mediterranean ancestry may play a role in the development of the disease; however, other factors that affect the development or severity of the disease remain unknown.

We and others have clinically observed that emotional stress may play a significant role in the development of PFAPA attacks. However, periodic emotional stress as a contributor to an immunologic burst is hard to prove using scientific tools, especially in toddlers, although the association between psychological factors and attacks in patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is well-established.

In March 2020, during COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, a general lockdown was announced in Israel, closing all educational institutions and work places for approximately 2 months. Subsequently and on short notice (~2 weeks), preschools and schools were reopened. We assumed that familial and personal stress due to COVID-19 outbreak consequences, along with returning to school (considered a significant stressor in children) on short notice may have served as a stressful event to the patients, and therefore as a trigger for induction of flare.

The objectives of this study were to examine whether emotional stress triggers PFAPA attacks. A secondary goal was to examine whether parents of children with PFAPA identify specific environmental triggers for their children's flares.

### Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome and syndrome of unexplained recurrent fevers in children and adults [^115iW1aM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Children and adults with autoinflammatory disorders, who often experience recurrent fevers, rashes, cold-induced symptoms, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, recurrent infections, aphthous stomatitis, and abnormal blood cell counts, may present to the allergist/immunologist because the symptoms mimic allergies and disorders of immunity. In recent years, there has been increased recognition of non-monogenic autoinflammatory disorders, including periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome and syndrome of undifferentiated recurrent fevers. For many clinical practitioners, the natural history, diagnostic criteria, differential diagnoses, and preferred therapies remain challenging because of the presumed rarity of patients and the evolving field of autoinflammation. Here, we aim to provide a practical framework for the clinical allergist/immunologist to evaluate and treat this patient population.

### The association between minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), children's poor oral condition, and underlying negative psychosocial habits and attitudes towards oral hygiene [^112Zip2u]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

By the same token, the significant direct associations between children's reported severity of dental pain with (a) the actual presence of decayed teeth, and with (b) children's general deteriorated oral health condition — as testified to by a comparatively lower DMFT index —, both suggest to pay close attention also to the nuances of children's (un)expressed feelings and sensations — such as, in our case, pain and teeth ache.

No statistical association between ulcers and filled teeth was detected. This outcome gave us a further confirmation that caries in the active phase (teeth decayed, not the filled teeth), rather than the presence of filled teeth in itself, seem to predispose to the appearance of recurrent aphthous.

Data from this sample did not detect significant associations between RAS and celiac disease, food intolerances, and further indicators of lifestyle such as the customary consumption of snacks at School, the more or less frequent practice of sports, or general social-status as inferred by observing whether children possessed a tablet or not.

### Mucocutaneous manifestations in juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus: a review of literature [^112hpJRS]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Oral or nasopharyngeal ulcers There are two types of these ulcers: those with classical LE histological changes representing oral discoid lesions (Figure 2 D) and nonspecific ulcers in keeping with aphthous ulceration. The lupus specific lesions begin with solitary erythema and hemorrhaging patches before developing into discoid ulcers with a reticulate border. Typically, the lesions are painless and located on the hard palate (Figure 2 E). In contrast, the nonspecific aphthous ulcers are usually painful, with multiple lesions on the buccal mucosa, lips and nasal septum, whilst also having a tendency to bleed. Oral and nasopharyngeal ulcers are normally found during active disease and subside with disease remission in JSLE and adult SLE patients.

Diffuse non-scarring alopecia Alopecia often presents with generalized hair loss without signs of inflammation on the scalp. Diffuse, non-scarring alopecia in JSLE and adult SLE patients usually suggests active disease. However, it may occur three months after a severe lupus flare; e.g. Telogen effluvium, which is a nonspecific finding and can also occur after any significant systemic disturbance. Other forms of alopecia also found in JSLE patients include lupus hair (thin and weakened hair at the periphery of the scalp), patchy non-scarring alopecia (mild erythematous, scattered patchy hair loss) and alopecia areata.

Livedo reticularis These lesions present more commonly in both juvenile and adult patients who are diagnosed with anti-phospholipid syndrome. It is characterized by erythematous or cyanotic discoloration of the skin with reticulated (net-like) pattern, usually on the lower extremities. The etiology and correlation with systemic disease activity are unknown, but vascular obstruction and blood viscosity may be the cause.

Raynaud's phenomenon Raynaud's phenomenon is characterized by the classic "triphasic" color changes limited to the digits; pallor (white or blanching) followed by the cyanosis (blue) then erythema (red or reactive hyperemia). This color change sequence results from excessive vasospasms triggered by cold exposure or emotional stress, and can often be reversed following re-warming. There is no evidence to suggest that this symptom correlates with systemic disease.

### Penicillamine (Depen) [^111XBCZV]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

The appearance of a drug eruption accompanied by fever, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, or other allergic manifestations usually requires discontinuation of penicillamine. Certain patients will develop a positive anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) test and some of these may show a lupus erythematosus-like syndrome similar to drug-induced lupus associated with other drugs. The lupus erythematosus-like syndrome is not associated with hypocomplementemia and may be present without nephropathy. The development of a positive ANA test does not mandate discontinuance of the drug; however, the physician should be alerted to the possibility that a lupus erythematosus-like syndrome may develop in the future.

Some patients may develop oral ulcerations which in some cases have the appearance of aphthous stomatitis. The stomatitis usually recurs on rechallenge but often clears on a lower dosage. Although rare, cheilosis, glossitis, and gingivostomatitis have also been reported. These oral lesions are frequently dose-related and may preclude further increase in penicillamine dosage or require discontinuation of the drug.

Hypogeusia (a blunting or diminution in taste perception) has occurred in some patients. This may last two to three months or more and may develop into a total loss of taste; however, it is usually self-limited, despite continued penicillamine treatment. Such taste impairment is rare in patients with Wilson's disease.

### Severe aphthous stomatitis secondary to vitamin B12 deficiency with isotretinoin therapy [^111B32hq]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Oral mucosal changes including glossitis and aphthous-like lesions represent a cardinal symptom of vitamin B12 deficiency and may represent the earliest clinical sign of B12 deficiency, as in our patient. To date, the occurrence of mucosal lesions in the context of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies has been reported during treatment by isotretinoin in only 1 patient with a perianal mucosal involvement together with nonulcerative erythema of the oral mucosa. The literature includes few studies that evaluated the effect of isotretinoin therapy on blood levels of vitamin B12, vitamin B9, holotranscobalamin, hemoglobin, and homocysteine. Despite conflicting results, we speculate that long-term or high-dose isotretinoin therapy tends to decrease folic acid and vitamin B12 levels. Indeed, 2 studies in particular reported a decrease in vitamin B12 and folate levels in 2 large cohorts of patients treated by isotretinoin for 6 and 4 months, respectively. Karadag et alalso noted an associated hyperhomocysteinemia. However, the mechanisms of B12 and folate deficiency during isotretinoin treatment remain unclear. Isotretinoin could interact with the transport system for vitamin B12 absorption via enterocytes and interaction with the metabolism of holotranscobalamin. Moreover, the decrease in the levels of vitamin B12 and folate alters the methylation pathway and induces high blood homocysteine levels. Finally, hyperhomocysteinemia may result in an elevated frequency of thrombosis in the feeding arterioles that supply the oral epithelial cells and may lead to the formation of oral ulcers.

The progressive development of glossitis and oral ulcers during the second cycle of isotretinoin therapy, together with the absence of evidence suggestive of pernicious anemia or inflammatory bowel disease and the lack of recurrence after treatment discontinuation, strongly suggest that the development of vitamin B12/folate deficiency in our patient was strictly related to isotretinoin therapy. Cumulative doses of isotretinoin may play a role in the occurrence of mucosal lesions, especially because a short course of isotretinoin may not be associated with vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. To our knowledge, this case represents the first clinical characterization of severe oral lesions related to vitamin B12 deficiency induced by systemic isotretinoin therapy. Clinicians should be aware that isotretinoin therapy can induce vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiencies and that secondary oral mucosal changes can occur in this context.

### Oral ulcers in juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus: a review of the literature [^1148iafY]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Epidemiology

Oral ulcers are the second most common mucocutaneous manifestation in JSLE patients after butterfly rash, and they are the most common mucosal sign of JSLE. The incidence of oral ulcers in JSLE is approximately 11.4–37%, which is significantly higher than in adult SLE. In adult patients, males have a lower rate of oral ulcers than females, but there are no reports of gender preference in children. The common oral ulcers in JSLE patients are palatal erythematous ulcers, oral DLE and aphthous ulcers.

### Prophylaxis, clinical management, and monitoring of datopotamab deruxtecan-associated oral mucositis / stomatitis [^116C8No9]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Newer targeted therapies, including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), may have different underlying mechanisms for stomatitis which are not yet fully understood.mTOR inhibitors have shown proinflammatory properties in experimental models, and immune dysregulation may be involved in the development of mTOR inhibitor-associated stomatitis (mIAS).mIAS presents as single or multiple superficial grayish-white ulcers that are ovoid in shape and well demarcated, typically involving areas of non-keratinized mucosa. Clinically, mIAS resembles aphthous stomatitis more than oral mucositis, although its pathobiology is also not well understood. Aphthous stomatitis is characterized by recurrent painful oral ulcers with inflammatory halos that are round or ovoid in shape. Impaired wound healing has also been suggested in aphthous ulceration and may also be involved in the pathogenesis of mIAS. Angiogenesis and vascular cell proliferation are important for wound repair, and both processes may be impeded by mTOR inhibitors. The mechanisms of stomatitis that are induced by some newer therapies, including datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), have not yet been fully elucidated.

Risk Factors for Development of Stomatitis

Both intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors have been implicated in the development of stomatitis. Intrinsic factors include age, sex, ethnicity, and some genetic conditions. The youngest and oldest patients with cancer are at increased risk of experiencing AEs and events of greater severity. Additionally, patients with underlying systemic illnesses, such as autoimmune diseases, may be predisposed to mucosal damage due to alterations in the tissue environment. Females receiving high-dose or fluorouracil-based chemotherapy have a higher risk and more severe presentation than males. Some genetic polymorphisms, such as those involved in drug metabolism, also increase risk. For example, a polymorphism in the TNF gene, with an incidence of ~16% of Japanese populations, has been associated with more severe mucositis when treated with 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin chemotherapy. Additionally, impaired dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase activity in the metabolism of fluoropyrimidine drugs has been shown to have a role in drug-related toxicities. The deficiency of the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase enzyme may reduce the patient's capacity to catabolize fluoropyrimidine, increasing risk of stomatitis, among other toxicities.

Extrinsic patient risk factors that increase the risk of developing stomatitis include poor oral health, diet, alcohol use, a history of smoking, and prior treatment with certain chemotherapeutic agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).

### Prevalence of oral manifestations in coeliac disease and associated factors [^116zwQa9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Various oral manifestations are associated with coeliac disease in children, whereas data on adults are scarce. Moreover, possible individual factors predisposing to these manifestations remain unresolved. The aim of this study was to investigate these issues in a large cohort of adult coeliac disease patients both at diagnosis and while on gluten-free diet (GFD).

Methods

This population-based study involved 873 adult patients with coeliac disease and 563 non-coeliac controls. Patients and controls were interviewed and structured questionnaires were used to assess the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life at the time of the study. All participants were systematically asked about oral manifestations, including dental enamel defects, recurrent aphthous ulceration and glossodynia. Coeliac disease-related data were collected from medical records. Possible individual factors associated with oral manifestations were studied using logistic regression analysis.

Results

Dental enamel defects were more common among patients than among non-coeliac controls (27% vs. 4%, p < 0.001). Prior to the coeliac disease diagnosis, 56% of the patients had experienced recurrent aphthous ulceration and GFD brought relief to 69% of them. While on GFD, coeliac disease patients had higher prevalence of recurrent aphthous ulceration than did the controls (17% vs. 13%, p = 0.040), but this significance disappeared after adjusting for gender. Glossodynia on GFD was more prevalent in the coeliac cohort than in the controls (14% vs 6%, p < 0.001). Oral manifestations at diagnosis and on GFD were associated with the presence of abdominal symptoms at the time of coeliac disease diagnosis, long diagnostic delay and female gender. At the time of the study, patients with oral symptoms had more severe gastrointestinal symptoms and poorer quality of life than those without these symptoms.

Conclusions

Oral manifestations were more prevalent, at diagnosis and on GFD, in patients with coeliac disease than in the controls, and they were associated with long diagnostic delay, abdominal symptoms, female gender and impaired quality of life. A GFD was shown beneficial in relieving recurrent aphthous ulcerations in patients with coeliac disease.
